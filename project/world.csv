Boeing 787 safe to fly? US says no current evidence for grounding aircraft; Air India crash under review,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boeing-787-safe-to-fly-us-says-no-current-evidence-for-grounding-air-india-crash-under-review/articleshow/121814086.cms,"



US officials have said there is no current evidence to justify grounding Boeing 787 aircraft, after a deadly Air India crash killed over 240 people on Thursday, when a Dreamliner took off from Ahmedabad and crashed into a residential complex just 30 seconds after take-off.Speaking at a press briefing on Thursday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Acting Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief Chris Rocheleau said investigators were still reviewing the facts surrounding the incident, reports news agency Reuters.Duffy confirmed that officials from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the FAA, and representatives from Boeing and engine-maker GE Aerospace would be travelling to India to assist with the investigation.""They have to get on the ground and take a look. But again right now it'd be way too premature,"" said Duffy. ""People are looking at videos and trying to assess what happened, which is never a strong, smart way to make decisions on what took place.""Duffy said that the FAA is actively reviewing available data in coordination with Boeing and GE. He also stressed that the US government will act swiftly if any safety concerns arise.""The FAA is prepared to send additional resources to get the data we need to ensure the safety of the flying public,"" Duffy said. ""We will not hesitate to implement any safety recommendations that may arise. We will follow the facts and put safety first.""Rocheleau doubled down on this approach, stating, ""As we proceed down this road with the investigation itself, if there's any information that becomes available to us regarding any risk, we will mitigate those risks.""Duffy also confirmed that he had spoken to NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy about the crash and that coordination between US and Indian authorities was ongoing.","US officials have said there is no current evidence to justify grounding Boeing 787 aircraft, after a deadly Air India crash killed over 240 people.

This bond, rooted in their shared Chitrapur Saraswat heritage, has blossomed into a warm friendship. The actresses, along with their respective partners, Ranveer Singh and RJ Anmol, have since shared heartwarming moments, solidifying their connection beyond a mere family tie.

In a world where Bollywood connections often surprise us, one such lesser-known bond has recently come to light—between Deepika Padukone and Amrita Rao . Though they’ve walked very different paths in the film industry, the two actresses share more than just talent and grace. A unique family connection, rooted in their shared Konkani heritage, brought them together in 2019 and has since blossomed into a warm friendship that continues to delight fans.For those curious about the origin of this unexpected bond, it dates back to 2019 when Deepika Padukone attended her cousin brother’s lavish Konkani wedding in Mumbai.

The two were seen warmly embracing and even posing for a joyful photo with their husbands, Ranveer Singh and RJ Anmol.At an event, Amrita Rao clarified her connection to Deepika Padukone, explaining that they both belong to the Chitrapur Saraswat community—a small Konkani-speaking group from Karnataka, often mistaken for the Konkan region in Maharashtra. She noted that the community has produced several notable names in the film industry, including Shyam Benegal, Guru Dutt, Isha Koppikar, and Deepika herself. Given how closely knit the community is, many members are interrelated.The recent marriage between Deepika’s cousin and Amrita’s cousin became a special occasion that brought their families—and the wider community—closer.While Deepika is married to actor Ranveer Singh, Amrita Rao found her life partner in popular radio jockey Anmol Sood, widely known as RJ Anmol.

The last time Israel and Iran traded attacks, Israel received strong support from many allies. Britain and the US provided backup in the form of fighter jets, refuelling planes and air defence systems. Neighbouring Jordan confirmed it had shot down Iranian missiles and drones. Some West Asian states allowed Israel to transit their airspace.This time around, there was less understanding and more concern. Some European allies worried Israel was ratcheting up a conflict with Iran after eight months of simmering tensions but no overt warfare. ""Escalation serves no one in the region,"" PM Keir Starmer of Britain said, while EU's chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, called the situation ""dangerous"". Those remarks followed a growing chorus of European condemnation of Israel over the past few months for escalating the war in Gaza. Some of the sharpest condemnation came from countries in the region. Egypt, which has a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, called the strikes ""a direct threat to regional and international peace and security"".Still, a number of key allies, including the US, stood behind Israel and expressed mounting frustration with Iran's advancing nuclear programme. And should Iran launch a powerful counterattack against Israel, allies could still come to the country's defence militarily.","The last time Israel and Iran traded attacks, Israel received strong support from many allies.

Israel-Iran war: Attack comes at a moment of weakness for Iran's proxies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-iran-war-attack-comes-at-a-moment-of-weakness-for-irans-proxies/articleshow/121841417.cms,"Representative image





For four decades, Iran poured billions of dollars, weapons and military minds into a grand project: building up a network of anti-Israel militias known as the ""Axis of Resistance"" that would join Iran if a war with Israel broke out.Friday's strikes underscored just how degraded that axis has become over the past year, with few expecting those armed groups to meaningfully respond to the Israeli aggression, experts say. In the clearest sign of that weakened stance, Hezbollah , the Lebanese militant group seen as Iran's most powerful proxy, condemned the attack but stopped short of vowing military action in response - a notable omission from a group that has long served as the central pillar of the axis.The Houthis in Yemen also made no mention of responding militarily. ""The axis hasn't been fully destroyed, but it has been diminished beyond the point of return,"" said Mohanad Hage Ali, a senior fellow at Carnegie Middle East Centre in Beirut. ""It has been transformed into an axis of sitting ducks waiting for the next Israeli strikes rather than taking initiative and pushing Israel into the defence.""Iran also lost a key ally in Dec, after Syrian rebels, whom Hezbollah fought, toppled Bashar al-Assad's govt in Syria. Among Iran's proxies, still intact are Iranian-backed Iraqi militias and the Houthis. ""Now the Houthis are the most capable and forthcoming of the axis, but at the same time, (Israeli) strikes have had an impact on their capacity,"" said Ali.","Iran poured billions of dollars, weapons and military minds into a network of anti-Israel militias.

Israel sent Mossad agents deep into Iran: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-sent-mossad-agents-deep-into-iran-report/articleshow/121841328.cms,"Representative image





JERUSALEM: Israel sent Mossad commandos deep into Iran to destroy Iranian weapons systems during Israel’s attack on nuclear and military targets, an Israeli security source said, while another official said Israel used a ploy to suggest the strike was not imminent.The Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, described secret and lengthy preparations that went into the attacks.Reuters could not independently verify the accounts.Iranian officials who spoke to Reuters shortly before the attack had been dismissive about any imminent action and repeatedly said talk of strikes was just “psychological pressure” to influence US-Iranian nuclear negotiations that were due on Sunday. Ahead of the strike, Israel gave the impression its focus was still on US diplomacy towards a nuclear deal with Iran.Instead, Israel said it sent 200 warplanes to conduct a wave of air strikes across Iran before dawn on Friday, hitting nuclear facilities and missile factories, and killing military commanders and nuclear scientists, in a culmination of its efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.The Israeli security source said Israel’s military and Mossad had worked for years on the intelligence needed for the strikes.M ossad even smuggled weapons into Iran. The security source said Mossad commandos had covertly deployed weapons across Iran, including explosive drones that were launched at a surface-to-surface missile base near Tehran. The Mossad commandos also fired precision-guided weapons systems at Iranian surface-to-air missile systems as the Israeli attack got underway, reducing the threat to Israeli warplanes.A grainy black and white video distributed by Mossad showed what it said were its operational force — two camouflaged figures crouched in what looks like desert terrain, deploying the precision weapons system meant to destroy Iran’s air defence systems.The decision to strike Iran was made Monday, the same day Netanyahu and Trump spoke, when Netanyahu, defence minister Israel Katz and military chief Eyal Zamir decided the operation would begin Friday, said a second source. The final green light was given by Netanyahu’s security cabinet, which convened Thursday night.REUTERS","Israel sent Mossad commandos deep into Iran to destroy Iranian weapons systems, an Israeli security source said.

UAE airlines have suspended and cancelled flights to multiple destinations across the Middle East, Caucasus, and Central Asia after Israel launched a series of military strikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets early Friday, June 13, 2025. The Israeli operation, codenamed “Rising Lion”, struck key facilities and killed several top Iranian military commanders, prompting Iran to shut down its airspace and triggering widespread disruption across regional flight routes.In immediate response to the escalating tensions and subsequent airspace closures, airlines operating out of the UAE, including Emirates, Etihad, flydubai, and Air Arabia, halted services to at least nine countries, namely: Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Russia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Additional suspensions also affected routes to and from Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, according to airline advisories and airport listings.The cancellations affected dozens of flights at Dubai International Airport (DXB) and Al Maktoum International (DWC), with airport authorities confirming delays and urging passengers to check with their airlines for the latest travel updates. Services to key cities such as Tehran, Shiraz, Lar, Kish Island, Bandar Abbas, Baghdad, Basra, Amman, Beirut, and Tel Aviv were either suspended or removed from schedules entirely for the day.Flights inbound from those cities were also disrupted.While some routes remain under review, many were either rerouted, significantly delayed, or returned to their points of origin mid-flight. Airport authorities stated they are working closely with airlines to manage the situation and assist impacted travellers.“Our teams are on hand to assist impacted guests,” Dubai Airports said, adding that passengers should confirm their flight status and rebooking options before travelling to the airport.Here is a breakdown of flights affected as of June 13:The Dubai-based low-cost carrier confirmed widespread disruptions and issued this official statement:“Due to the temporary closure of airspace over Iran and Israel in the early hours of 13 June, some flydubai flights have been impacted. Flights to Amman, Beirut, Damascus, Iran and Israel have been suspended and a number of flights have been cancelled, rerouted or have returned to their destination of origin.We are monitoring the situation in the region closely and adjusting our flight schedule accordingly. The safety of our passengers and crew remains our top priority. We are in direct contact with passengers whose travel plans have been affected.”Air Arabia has also suspended operations to and from a wide list of destinations, including:The Sharjah-based airline noted that other flights could also be delayed or rerouted. It issued the following advisory:“Passengers should check their flight status at airarabia.com or contact our call centre. Affected customers will be notified directly.”The ripple effects of the Israeli strikes and Iran's response have thrown regional aviation into turmoil:These closures have forced major international airlines to reroute flights mid-journey:The Dubai Airports authority urged travellers to arrive early, allow extra time for processing, and check with airlines directly before proceeding to the airport.“Guest ambassador teams are on hand across all terminals to assist affected passengers,” the authority added, thanking travellers for their patience.Friday’s strikes mark a dramatic escalation in the shadow war between Israel and Iran. According to initial reports, the Israeli military executed Operation Rising Lion, targeting strategic Iranian infrastructure, including:Iran later confirmed damage to a nuclear facility but reported no casualties. However, several senior military figures were said to be killed in the operation.Countries across the region immediately responded by shutting down airspaces, fearing retaliatory action and broader conflict spillover.In light of the evolving airspace closures and ongoing flight disruptions across the Middle East, UAE airport authorities and airlines have issued the following guidance for all affected or potentially affected travellers:Passengers are strongly urged to verify the latest status of their flights directly through official airline websites, mobile apps, or customer service hotlines. Third-party sources, including travel aggregators and booking platforms, may not reflect real-time updates or operational changes.Due to the increased congestion and potential schedule changes, travellers should arrive well in advance of their scheduled departure times. Early arrival will help accommodate any additional time required for check-in, security clearance, and gate reassignments.All UAE-based airlines, including Emirates, Etihad, flydubai, and Air Arabia, have activated customer support services for passengers affected by cancellations or delays. Rebooking options, refunds, and itinerary changes are being facilitated, and affected passengers are being contacted directly where possible.Dubai Airports confirmed that guest ambassador teams are on hand across all terminals at both Dubai International Airport (DXB) and Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC). These teams are assisting impacted passengers with navigation, information, rebooking, and general travel support.As the situation remains dynamic and may shift with little notice, passengers are advised to monitor announcements from their airlines and airport authorities. All stakeholders are coordinating closely to manage the impact and will provide further updates as developments unfold.","Emirates, Etihad, Flydubai and Air Arabia Announce Sweeping Disruptions.

Restored UN sanctions on Tehran possible

Undeclared nuclear materials





Growing Middle East tensions





The UN nuclear watchdog IAEA has condemned Iran for being in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in almost two decades, diplomatic sources have said.The agency's 35-nation board of governors passed a resolution to that effect on Thursday, they said.They said the motion, drafted by the United States, Britain, France and Germany, was carried by 19 votes in favour. Russia, China and Burkina Faso opposed the motion, 11 abstained and two nations of the 35 did not vote.Iran responded defiantly to the resolution by announcing it would open a new enrichment site and upgrade centrifuges at the Fordow nuclear facility.""The Islamic Republic of Iran has no choice but to respond to this political resolution,"" the Iranian Foreign Ministry and the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran said in a joint statement.The IAEA board ""Finds that Iran's many failures to uphold its obligations since 2019 to provide the Agency with full and timely cooperation regarding undeclared nuclear material and activities at multiple undeclared locations in Iran ... constitutes non-compliance with its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement with the Agency,"" the resolution text, seen by Reuters news agency, said.Thursday's move could lead to further tensions between the West and Iran over its nuclear program and pave the way for United Nations sanctions on Tehran to be restored later this year.The resolution by the IAEA comes after Iran failed to give the agency credible explanations for the presence of uranium traces at undeclared sites in the country.The report by the agency at the end of May found that three of the four locations ""were part of an undeclared structured nuclear program carried out by Iran until the early 2000s and that some activities used undeclared nuclear material.""US intelligence services and the IAEA have suspected for some time that Iran had a secret nuclear weapons program it halted in 2003.Iran has gradually been abandoning the commitments it made under the nuclear deal it agreed with world powers in 2015.That deal, which collapsed after the US withdrew from it in 2018 during US President Donald Trump's first term, lifted some sanctions in exchange for restrictions on Tehran's nuclear program.The IAEA resolution comes as tensions in the region have been rising.The US State Department announced on Wednesday that it was pulling out people whom it considered non-essential to its operations in the Middle East.Staff reductions are being carried out at the US Embassy, and there are reports that personnel are also being moved from Kuwait and Bahrain over security concernsPresident Donald Trump has also warned that Israel or the US could carry out airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities if ongoing US-Iran negotiations failed.Iran in its turn has responded with threats to hit US bases in the region if the US takes military action.Israel, Iran's regional archenemy, has meanwhile said the world must respond ""decisively"" to Iran's non-compliance with its nuclear obligations.",UN nuclear watchdog IAEA condemns Iran for being in breach of its non- proliferation obligations.

Experience Bach in Arabic

Transforming the St. John Passion

Adding a Middle Eastern touch to Bach

Playing for the emir of Abu Dhabi





Violence against LGBTQ+ people and well as war and displacement in Gaza inspire two adaptations of one of Johann Sebastian Bach's works on the story of Christ. Queer Passion,"" by author, director and dramaturge Thomas Höft, opens with a reference to the June 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting targeting the LGBTQ+ community, in which 49 people died and 53 were injured. It is one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in US history.Played by the Art House 17 orchestra on period instruments, Höft's work uses as its musical basis Johann Sebastian Bach's famous St. John Passion, based on the Gospel story of the suffering of Jesus Christ on the cross.In his libretto, however, Höft describes the stories of queer people who are discriminated against or murdered. ""I asked myself, where do I, as a queer man, appear in classical music?"" Höft told DW. And he quickly realized that the answer was: ""Actually, not at all."" And that is precisely what he wants to change.Bach's St. John Passion also served as a model for the Bulgarian musician and musicologist Vladimir Ivanoff in his ""Arabian Passion."" The composer is concerned with the people living in the Middle East, the birthplace of Jesus Christ, whose suffering through war, displacement and oppression has a long history.The impetus for his ""Arabian Passion"" was the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, which had devastating consequences for the civilian population. ""And I feel the same way about Gaza now. I had several music students from the Middle East in my workshops, of whom I'm only sporadically informed if they're still alive,"" Ivanoff told DW.Ivanoff left the text and music by Johann Sebastian Bach in their original form, but some of the instruments come from the Arabian Mediterranean region. Lebanese singer Fadia El-Hage sings all of Bach's arias in Arabic.Both the Arabian and the queer versions of the St. John Passion are now on tour. They will be performed, among other works, as part of the Bachfest n Leipzig, held from June 12-22. The revisited versions of the work appropriately fit into this year's theme for the Bach festival, ""Transformation.""It was in Leipzig that Johann Sebastian, while serving as Cantor of St. Thomas Church, composed his famous St. John Passion in 1723.Bach often rewrote his cantatas himself, using the so-called parody technique. He also had them performed by other ensembles.For example, he later added a sacred text to secular cantatas, thus placing them in a different context. Thomas Höft and Vladimir Ivanoff build on this approach with their version of the St. John Passion.For his ""Arabian Passion,"" Vladimir Ivanoff has recombined pieces from the St. John Passion and Bach's St. Matthew Passion.Instead of sticking to the traditional combination of orchestra and choir, his ensemble Sarband also features the jazzy Modern String Quartet. The ensemble also includes instruments from the Mediterranean region, such as the long-necked lute ud, the flute ney and the Arabic violin.Sarband means ""connection."" Ivanoff sees himself as a bridge-builder and wants to connect the West and the East through music. The mere fact that Christian texts from the St. John Passion are sung in Arabic, and by a woman at that, can be seen as a provocation for conservative Muslims. This makes it all the more surprising that Vladimir Ivanoff and his Sarband ensemble have been welcome guests at various Arab music festivals.Since 2003, Sarband has been touring the Middle East with the ""Arabian Passion."" The ensemble has performed in the cathedral of Beirut and in Aleppo, Syria. ""We also performed the Passion in Damascus at the Alhambra Cinema, a very famous jazz concert hall,"" says IvanoffThey were also invited to Abu Dhabi to perform during the Sheikh Zayed Book Award ceremony. The Emir liked their music. However, shortly before the event, organizers noticed that a female singer was planned. That couldn't be allowed; the ensemble had to play an entirely instrumental version of the work.Ivanoff also travels with his ensemble to Hezbollah-held areas. Sometimes, lyrics or titles of Christian and Jewish songs are changed, he says, but he accepts that. ""That's our principle: we want to get into the structures at all costs,"" says Ivanoff. ""I see myself a bit as a musical guerrilla. What we do is effective, and this gentle seduction works incredibly well.""","Violence against LGBTQ+ people and war and displacement in Gaza inspire two adaptations of one of Johann Sebastian Bach's works on the story of Christ.

The Israel defence forces conducted aerial strikes targeting Iranian ballistic missiles that were positioned to attack Tel Aviv.The IDF has released video evidence of the operation, in which the air defenses were seen bombing the Iranian ballistic missiles projectiles in its strikes in Iran earlier today.Additionally, the military has shared footage showing attacks on various other Iranian weapons systems.Earlier, the IDF said that they have ""control over the situation"" following Iran's deployment of more than 100 drones targeting Israel.The Home Front Command has revised its guidance, indicating that citizens need not stay near bomb shelters, though restrictions on public gatherings continue to be enforced, according to Times of Israel.Despite claiming control of the drone assault, the IDF has not provided confirmation regarding the complete neutralisation of all incoming drones.The Home Front Command stands ready to issue additional alerts should Iran launch further attacks towards Israel.The IDF has also explained that the nationwide siren activation at 3 a.m. was implemented based on intelligence suggesting an immediate Iranian retaliation to Israel's military actions, though this anticipated response did not materialise at that time.","The Israel defence forces conducted aerial strikes targeting Iranian ballistic missiles that were positioned to attack Tel Aviv.

When were Iran and Israel allies?

When did Israeli-Iranian relations change?

Should Iran change its anti-Israel stance?

This article was originally written in German and published in April 2024. It was updated on June 13, 2025, following the Israeli attack on Iran.





Iran and Israel have been enemies for the past few decades with Iran saying it wants to wipe Israel off the map and threatening to annihilate it. Israel, for its part, regards Iran as its biggest adversary.But this wasn't always the case.In fact, Israel and Iran were allies until Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iran was one of the first states to recognise Israel after it was founded in 1948. Israel regarded Iran as an ally against the Arab states. Iran, meanwhile, welcomed US-backed Israel as a counterweight to the region's Arab countries.Back then, Israel trained Iranian agricultural experts, supplied technical know-how and helped build up and train the Iranian armed forces. The Iranian shah paid Israel in oil, as its burgeoning economy was in need of fuel. Not only that. Iran was home to the second-largest Jewish community outside of Israel. Yet, after the Islamic Revolution, many Jews left the country. That said, even today, more than 20,000 Jews still live in Iran.Also read: Tensions soar: Why did Israel strike Iran? What makes the timing crucial – Explained After the Iranian Islamic Revolution brought Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and his religious revolutionaries to power, Iran scrapped all previous agreements with Israel.Khomeini directed fierce criticism at Israel for its occupation of Palestinian territories.Gradually, Iran adopted an increasingly harsh rhetoric toward Israel with the aim of winning the favour of regional Arab states, or their citizens at the very least. The Iranian regime, after all, was eager to grow its regional influence.When Israel sent troops into southern Lebanon in 1982 to intervene in the country's civil war, Khomeini dispatched Iranian Revolutionary Guards to the Lebanese capital, Beirut, to support local Shiite militias. The Hezbollah militia, which grew out of this support, is today regarded as a direct Iranian proxy in Lebanon. Iran's current leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in all matters, remains just as antagonistic toward Israel as his predecessors.

Israel's overnight ""preemptive strikes"" on Iran early Friday have led to major disruptions in international air traffic across the Middle East, as commercial airlines quickly diverted routes to avoid the affected region.The strikes, which targeted Iranian nuclear facilities, missile infrastructure, and key military personnel, marked one of the most intense escalations between the two longtime adversaries in decades.As air-raid sirens sounded in parts of Israel and explosions were reported near Tehran, real-time data from flight tracking service Flightradar24 showed a rapid clearance of civilian aircraft from the region’s skies.A time-lapse video circulated online illustrating how aircraft were forced to abandon Middle East airspace as the Israeli operation commenced.The disruption is expected to have a ripple effect on international aviation, with longer flight durations, rerouted paths, and increased fuel costs likely for carriers operating across the Middle East and Asia.Emirates airline confirmed that multiple flights to and from Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Iran had been cancelled.The airline’s website listed cancellations for several Friday flights, as well as a Tehran-bound flight scheduled for Saturday.Dubai International Airport, one of the world's busiest aviation hubs, issued a statement acknowledging delays and cancellations at both DXB and DWC, Al Maktoum International, citing ""airspace closures over Iran, Iraq, and Syria.""The Israeli strikes conducted under, Operation Rising Lion hit multiple strategic sites across Iran, including its main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz.

The Concept: Artificial Reefs for Marine Life

Inchcape 2: A Thriving Reef off Khor Fakkan





Inchcape 10: A Marine Wonderland in Fujairah





The Impact: Ecological Balance and Marine Conservation

Khaleej Times





In a unique blend of environmental stewardship and ecotourism, the UAE has deliberately sunk three ships off its east coast, not as an accident, but as a conscious effort to promote marine conservation. The vessels, Inchcape 1, Inchcape 2, and Inchcape 10, have been transformed into thriving artificial reefs that now attract divers from across the world. This innovative approach is a testament to the UAE’s commitment to protecting its natural resources while fostering sustainable tourism.The concept behind sinking these ships is simple yet effective: to create artificial reefs that mimic the role of natural coral reefs in the ocean. Over time, the ships have become vibrant ecosystems, teeming with marine life. These reefs not only support a wide range of fish species but also help to promote biodiversity, offering an underwater experience for divers.The UAE’s efforts are especially significant given the rising threats to ocean ecosystems, including pollution and coral bleaching. The ships, once decommissioned, serve as a reminder that responsible management can help restore marine habitats.Sunk in 2001, Inchcape 1 lies about 32 meters below the surface, off the coast of Al Aqah, Fujairah. Accessible by boat in just five minutes from Al Aqah, this site is recommended for experienced divers, thanks to its depth and complexity. The wreck has turned into a bustling underwater city, home to large schools of red snapper, cardinal fish, and a wide variety of other marine creatures.Divers exploring the site can witness firsthand how the wreck has evolved into a rich marine habitat. Snorkelling and diving equipment are essential to access the site, and the area is becoming a popular spot for eco-tourists looking to experience the UAE’s commitment to sustainable diving.Inchcape 2, intentionally sunk in 2002, rests at a depth of around 22 meters off the coast of Khor Fakkan. It has quickly become one of the most popular dive sites in the region. As the wreck has developed into a thriving coral reef, it now attracts a variety of marine life, including parrotfish, moray eels, small boxfish, and long-tailed rays. The presence of barracudas also adds to the site's allure, making it a must-visit destination for professional divers seeking to explore a healthy and diverse underwater ecosystem.To visit, divers typically embark on a 25-minute boat ride from Al Aqah. Diving equipment is mandatory, and access is managed through licensed diving centers. These centers not only ensure safety but also educate visitors on how artificial reefs contribute to ocean health.Perhaps the most remarkable of the three, Inchcape 10 (formerly known as 'Awaiz') was sunk in 2003. Resting at a depth of about 23 meters off Fujairah, it is one of the largest ships deliberately sunk to create an artificial reef. This site has become a focal point for divers due to its rich biodiversity, including moray eels, barracudas, and other species.Located just an 8-minute boat ride from the Fujairah International Marine Club, the wreck offers an exciting opportunity to explore the wonders of marine life. The site is open year-round, and divers must book through licensed diving centers to gain access. Similar to the other wrecks, the presence of thriving marine life at Inchcape 10 speaks volumes about the success of the UAE’s ecotourism initiatives.Saleh Al-Dhahouri, a diver from Dibba Al Fujairah, has seen firsthand the positive transformation that these shipwrecks have brought to the area. “The diving there is wonderful, a beautiful place, and you couldn't get over the amount of fish and coral,” he said, as told to. He explained that before the ships were sunk, diving opportunities were limited. “With these ships, diving sites have increased, and they have become part of the weekly diving program,” he added, highlighting how these artificial reefs have revitalized local dive tourism.Emirati diver Mintaha Al Shehhi, who specializes in sharks, has been diving in the region for over three years. She praised the ecological balance at sites like Inchcape 2, where frequent sightings of sharks and turtles indicate a healthy environment. “Sharks do not choose random locations, and turtles only pass through when they feel secure and find natural abundance,” she said, emphasizing that the presence of these larger creatures is a sign of a thriving and balanced marine ecosystem.","The UAE has deliberately sunk three ships off its east coast, not as an accident, but as a conscious effort to promote marine conservation.

Fee Hikes: What’s Driving the Increase?

A Mixed Reaction from Parents

Khaleej Times

The Growing Need for Affordable Options

The Bigger Picture: Dubai’s Expanding Private School Sector





A wave of school fee hikes has been announced across Dubai, leaving parents to either adapt to the higher costs or consider alternative schooling options. While some families are grappling with increases of up to Dh5,000 annually for each child, others are managing more modest hikes of a few hundred dirhams. Despite the widespread rise in fees, many parents are exploring ways to cope, from paying annual fees in lump sums to researching more affordable institutions.In May 2025, Dubai’s Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA) approved a 2.35% increase in the Education Cost Index (ECI) for private for-profit schools for the 2025-2026 academic year. This decision allows schools to adjust their fees based on individual school grades, as determined by the results of the Dubai School Inspection Bureau (DSIB) and the ECI. The change impacts families across Dubai, who have started receiving notifications about the fee increases.The adjustment is part of a broader effort to account for inflation, rising operational costs, and other financial pressures faced by schools. However, while some parents are facing steep increases, others are relieved by more manageable hikes.Many parents are already feeling the financial strain of the fee hikes. For example, Manal, a Dubai resident with children attending an Indian syllabus school in Al Quoz, shared that her family's total fee increase will amount to Dh400 per year for both of her children. “I am very glad that the increase is manageable and not a huge burden,” Manal said. “We had budgeted for an increase this year so we were not caught off-guard,”reported.In contrast, some families are facing much steeper hikes. Vivek, an Indian expat with two children enrolled in a premium school, revealed that his children’s school fees currently range from Dh87,000 to Dh92,000 annually. The recent fee hike will cost him an additional Dh10,000 per year for both children. “However, our school gives the option of paying the entire year’s fees in one go,” Vivek said. “This has given us a lump sum discount, so the total fee increase for me has come to about Dh3,000 per year for both children. ”Meanwhile, other parents like German expatriate Greta, whose three children attend a British syllabus school in Jumeirah, are feeling the squeeze. “I got the email yesterday that my school fees have been hiked by Dh2,000 per child per annum,” Greta shared. “That’s a total increase of Dh6,000 per year in school fees alone. The books, uniforms, and other study material are not included in that.” Greta admits that she cannot consider switching schools because her eldest child will be entering Year 11 in the upcoming academic year. Instead, she and her husband are adjusting by cutting back on some extracurricular activities to offset the additional costs.For some parents, the fee hikes have become too much to bear, prompting them to consider transferring their children to more affordable schools. Mohammed Iqbal, whose children attend a British syllabus school in Qusais, expressed relief as his school’s increase was relatively modest, Dh1,200 annually. “I was expecting a little more than that, so I am very happy,” he remarked.On the other hand, parent R.M., whose children attend another British syllabus school, has seen fee increases two years in a row. “Last year, our school increased fees by 4.55%, and this year again, they announced a 2.35% hike,” R.M. explained. “While I understand that the cost for businesses is going up, it puts a burden on parents because unfortunately, salaries don’t increase at the same rate as the costs. I began researching schools as soon as I heard about the fee hike, but then soon realized that changing schools would bring with it a fresh set of challenges. So we decided to stay put at our current one.”Umm Mohammed, another Dubai parent, decided to move her daughter to a more affordable school before the fee hike was announced. “We were paying over Dh55,000 in annual fees at our previous school,” she recalled. “It was already the higher upper limit of what we could afford. So last year, we decided to move her to another school. Now we pay Dh30,000 inclusive of school fees, uniforms, and books. When the announcement of the school fees came, I was relieved. At our previous school, the fee increase would have been really difficult for us. But now, the fee increase is about Dh1,000 per annum. It is very manageable for us. I think it was the best decision to move her,"" she added.Dubai’s private school sector has been booming, with a 12% increase in student enrollment recorded in the 2023-2024 academic year. As of the latest figures, Dubai has 227 private schools serving 387,441 students from 185 different nationalities. The rise in student numbers has likely contributed to the increased demand for private education and the subsequent fee hikes.Despite the challenges, many parents still find value in Dubai’s private education system, with some schools offering flexible payment options to help mitigate the financial strain. The diverse offerings of schools, from international curricula to specialized programs, also give parents more choices, though finding an affordable option in the current climate can be challenging.","Dubai's Knowledge and Human Development Authority approved a 2.35% increase in the Education Cost Index (ECI) for private for-profit schools for the 2025-2026 academic year.

LONDON: Three British Hindu men were asked their ethnicity in a London park and, when they replied they were Indian and Sri Lankan, were viciously beaten up in an unprovoked attack by three older men who appeared to be Muslim, it has emerged.Two of the men suffered blows to the head and were left unconscious; all had to go to Northwick Park Hospital. They have all been left with cuts and bruises and two have been left with facial fractures. Tory MP Bob Blackman raised the case in the House of Commons on Thursday, describing it as “religious hatred.”TOI has now tracked down the sister of one of the men, a British Indian Gujarati Hindu, aged 20, a first-year university student studying radiography. It turns out he had gone to Harrow Recreation Ground with two friends on May 30 to play cricket. The friends are British Hindus of Sri Lankan descent, aged 20 and 21.The three of them went to a shop at 6 pm, walking past a café where a group of around eight people were seated. It appeared to be a Muslim family, with some of the women wearing hijabs. They looked back at their other friends playing cricket when one of the men outside the café got up and confronted the three Hindus and asked them why they were looking at his family, his sister told TOI.They replied that they were not looking at his family and were looking at friends playing cricket. Then a slightly older man from the café group came over and asked: “What is your problem? Why are you talking to my brother?” The three men tried to defuse the situation and the two men seemed to accept their answer.They went back to the park and sat on a bench.Around 30 minutes later, three men from the cafe group, in their mid to late 20s, came over and became very aggressive, asking, “Where are you from? Are you Sri Lankan? Are you Indian?”To which one of the Sri Lankan-origin men replied: ”Yes, we are.”The three men then beat them up relentlessly, punching and kicking them until the British Indian and his friend were left lying unconscious on the ground, the sister said.“My brother was wearing a sacred thread from a mandir on his wrist,” the sister said.One of the attackers was wearing a Moroccan football T-shirt with the number 2 and the word “Hakimi”.Police and ambulances arrived and the British Indian was taken to the hospital. The other two had to make their own way there.“My brother is struggling. He feels as if people are looking at him and is ashamed to step out of the house. He has never been involved in a fight before,” the sister told TOI on Friday.“He has just done his first-year exams and was meant to resume his two-week clinical placement the week after the attack and that has been put on hold.” She also said she was unhappy with how the police investigation was progressing, as two weeks later, they still had not examined CCTV footage.The Met Police told TOI they were called to deal with a “fight” and one man was taken to hospital “with a head injury”. “There is no evidence at this time that this attack was racially motivated. Our enquiries into the circumstances continue. No arrests have been made,” a spokesperson said.",Three British Hindu men were viciously beaten up in a London park. Three older men who appeared to be Muslim attacked them. Two of the men suffered blows to the head and were left unconscious. Tory MP Bob Blackman raised the case in the House of Commons on Thursday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121840397,imgsize-299963,width-400,resizemode-4/121840397.jpg"

LONDON: A British Indian relative of an elderly Indian couple killed on board the Air India flight has spoken of his anger with the airline, saying the fleet that Air India uses is terrible.Tushar Jogi and his family were shell-shocked on Thursday when the news came through that the flight their relatives were on had crashed.Jogi’s cousin’s in-laws — Vallabh Nagji Agheda, a former general manager of the electricity board in Gujarat, and his wife, Vinaben Vallabh Agheda, a housewife, both from Vadodara — were in seats 21E and 21F on the Boeing aircraft. Both in their 70s, they were to come to the UK to spend a few months with their eldest daughter, her husband, and their grandchildren who live in Reading. The daughter and her whole family were en route to Heathrow on Thursday evening to fly to India.Jogi’s cousin, and his wife, an IT engineer, had been due to go to Gatwick on Thursday night to pick them up. The elderly couple have three daughters and the other two live in Gujarat. The two sisters had rushed to Ahmedabad on Thursday with their husbands to get DNA tests done so their parents’ remains could be handed over.“We are all absolutely shattered.We are all not able to digest this reality that we have lost them sadly — my cousin’s wife has lost both parents in just a single instant,” said Jogi, getting emotional. “They are the closest relatives we have in the UK. We don’t have any other family here. We are all a close-knit family,” he said, as he prepared to travel to Reading.Maharashtra-born Jogi, a British Indian social media influencer living in London, said though the couple were in their 70s they were enjoying the perfect retirement in Vadodara and spending time with all their grandchildren. “They were very fit and healthy and their life expectancy was beyond 90. They had huge love and affection from the whole family.”He said there was a lot of British concern with Air India among the Indian diaspora in Britain at “the way they treat passengers like luggage”. “The queue management is pathetic and people in the Indian community say the Air India fleet is the most horrible one. The ex-Etihad Airways Boeing 777-300ER aircraft are pathetic – the ones running from Heathrow. Seats falling apart is the default – whether 787 or 777-300ER, these Boeing fleets are horrible. For any journey, life is more important. They have to have a policy of care. Half the infotainment systems don’t work and the food tables are even broken at times,” he added.","Tushar Jogi and his family were shell-shocked on Thursday when the news came through that the flight their relatives were on had crashed.

LONDON: Britain announced it will build 12 new attack submarines as it was set to unveil Monday a major defence review to deal with ""growing"" Russian aggression and the changing nature of warfare.Prime Minister Keir Starmer told BBC radio that ""there is greater instability on defence and security than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.""His Labour government will later publish its Strategic Defence Review, a document that will assess threats facing the UK and make recommendations.The review warns that Britain is entering ""a new era of threat"" as drones and artificial intelligence transform modern warfare, The Guardian newspaper reported over the weekend.""I wanted a review that told me the challenges we're actually facing and likely to face for the foreseeable future,"" Starmer told the BBC Monday.""And the principles are clear: war-fighting readiness, integrating our forces... and a Nato first approach,"" he added.The UK has been racing to rearm in the face of the threat from Russia and fears that US President Donald Trump will no longer help protect Europe.Starmer said it would serve as ""a blueprint for strength and security for decades to come"".His government pledged in February to lift defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2027 in the ""largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War"".And despite budget constraints, it aims for spending to rise to three per cent in the next parliamentary term, due in 2029.The Labour government has said it will cut UK overseas aid to help fund the spending.Based on the recommendations of the review, which is led by former Nato secretary general George Robertson, the government said Sunday that it would boost stockpiles and weapons production capacity, which could be scaled up if needed.This includes £1.5 billion ($2 billion) for building ""at least six munitions and energetics factories"", procuring 7,000 domestically built long-range weapons, and spending £6 billion on munitions over the current parliamentary term.The government also said late Sunday that it would build up to 12 new attack submarines as part of its Aukus military alliance with Australia and the United States, and invest £15 billion in its nuclear warhead programme.The defence ministry last week pledged £1 billion for the creation of a ""cyber command"" to help on the battlefield.""We're in a world that is changing now... and it is a world of growing threats,"" defence secretary John Healey told the BBC in an interview Sunday.""It's growing Russian aggression. It's those daily cyberattacks, it's new nuclear risks, and it's increasing tension in other parts of the world as well,"" he said.The last such defence review was commissioned in 2021 by the previous Conservative government, and was revised in 2023 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.While launching the new review, Robertson said it would tackle threats from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, calling them a ""deadly quartet"".But in an op-ed in The Sun newspaper, Starmer did not mention China, while warning that ""The Kremlin is working hand in hand with its cronies in Iran and North Korea.""The softer rhetoric on China is in line with the Labour government's efforts to thaw relations with Beijing, which reached new lows under former prime minister Rishi Sunak 's Conservative government.The review describes Russia as an ""immediate and pressing"" threat, but calls China a ""sophisticated and persistent challenge"", according to The Guardian.At a time when Washington is demanding that its Nato allies bolster their own defences, Britain is considering strengthening its deterrent by buying nuclear-missile capable aircrafts from the United States, The Sunday Times reported.Without confirming or denying, Healey said Sunday that ""strong deterrence is absolutely essential in order to keep Britain and the British people safe"".","UK to unveil major defence review to deal with ""growing"" Russian aggression.

UK Threatens To Sue Abramovich Over £2.5 BN Chelsea Sale As Russia-UK Tensions Escalate





LONDON: Sikh Federation UK has warned PM Keir Starmer it will campaign to no-platform Labour MPs from Aug 1 unless a judge-led public inquiry into Britain’s role in 1984’s Operation Blue Star is announced in Parliament by the end of July.No-platforming is a political strategy where people actively work to prevent certain politicians or public figures from speaking publicly, often due to disagreements with their views.The warning, delivered in a letter signed by 455 gurdwaras and Sikh organisations, follows a rally of more than 10,000 Sikhs at Trafalgar Square Sunday marking the 41st anniversary of the military operation at Amritsar’s Golden Temple against Sikh militants hiding there.Deputy PM Angela Rayner had publicly committed to the inquiry just before the 2024 general elections. Labour also promised it in two consecutive manifestos.The federation insists the inquiry must investigate both UK involvement in the Indian military operation and anti-Sikh actions in Britain during Margaret Thatcher’s tenure. It plans to contact every MP individually, asking them to confirm written support for a judge-led inquiry by July-end.The letter warns Starmer that failing to act “could have massive consequences for the re-election of many Labour MPs”, citing rising support for Reform UK and independent candidates. Sikh Federation UK also said it is in talks with Reform UK, Liberal Democrats, and SNP to secure broader political backing.Documents declassified in Jan 2014 showed Thatcher’s government sent an SAS officer to India in Feb 1984 after Indian officials requested help planning an operation to remove Sikh militants from the Golden Temple.In Feb 2014, then-cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood concluded there was “no record of any assistance to the June 1984 operation other than the limited military advice provided in mid-February,” describing it as a “one-off”.Sikh Federation disputes this, citing its 2017 Sacrificing Sikhs report. “The papers released prove training and equipment was secretly provided by Britain before the Indian army assault in June 1984,” the letter says. “In addition, counter-insurgency training and equipment were provided to Indian army and police to deal with the Sikh uprising that followed the massacre. We are confident a judge-led public inquiry will prove the UK involvement had a massive rather than limited impact. ”",Sikh Federation UK has warned PM Keir Starmer it will campaign to no-platform Labour MPs from Aug 1 unless a judge-led public inquiry is announced in Parliament.

The number of migrants reaching the UK in small boats in a single day hits a 2025 high,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/the-number-of-migrants-reaching-the-uk-in-small-boats-in-a-single-day-hits-a-2025-high/articleshow/121549944.cms,"Representative image (AI)





LONDON: UK government figures Sunday showed that more than 1,100 migrants arrived in the country on Saturday in small boats from France across the English Channel, the highest number recorded on a single day so far this year.The latest Home Office figures show that 1,194 migrants arrived in 18 boats on Saturday in what were settled weather conditions, bringing the provisional annual total so far to 14,811.That's 42% higher than the same point last year, an increase that has piled pressure on the Labour government, which returned to power nearly a year ago, partly on disillusionment with the previous conservative administration's efforts to get a grip on the numbers making the crossing.Having ditched the Conservative government's plan to send migrants who arrived in the UK by unauthorized means to Rwanda, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government would get control by smashing the gangs and the business models that sustain their smuggling operations.Since gaining power, Starmer's government has sought better intelligence-sharing internationally, enhanced enforcement operations in northern France, and has adopted tougher rules in its immigration legislation.French police officers were seen watching Saturday as migrants boarded at a beach in Gravelines, between Calais and Dunkirk, and authorities were then pictured escorting the boats. French authorities said they rescued 184 people.""Pretty shocking, those scenes yesterday,"" defense secretary John Healey told Sky News.He added that it is a ""huge problem"" that French police are unable to intervene to intercept boats in shallow waters, adding that the UK is pressing for the French to put new rules into operation so they can intervene.""They're not doing it, but, but for the first time for years ... we've got the level of cooperation needed,"" he told Sky News. ""We've got the agreement that they will change the way they work, and our concentration now is to push them to get that into operation so they can intercept these smugglers and stop these people in the boats, not just on the shore.""Despite French and UK efforts, the cross-Channel route, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, remains a major smuggling corridor for people fleeing conflict or poverty. Many migrants favor the UK for reasons of language, family ties or perceived easier access to asylum and work.The home office says 36,816 people arrived in the UK on small boats in 2024, 25% more than in 2023 (29,437). The highest number of arrivals was in 2022, with 45,774.","1,194 migrants arrived in 18 boats on Saturday in what were settled weather conditions.

The United Kingdom's defence review has warned against “immediate and pressing” threat from Russia, meanwhile, China poses a “sophisticated and persistent challenge”. The government's strategic review is set to be concluded on Monday, the Guardian reported.A 130-page document authored by three advisers to UK PM Keir Starmer also suggested on drawing extensively on lessons from the war in Ukraine. While Russia was the central concern, the document also highlighted China, that has at times cooperated with Moscow. It further identified Iran and North Korea as smaller but significant “regional disruptors.”According to the report, Britain was entering “a new era of threat,” as drones, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies were transforming the nature of warfare more profoundly than ever before.The analysis is not expected to announce new defence spending commitments but will reaffirm Starmer’s February pledge to raise the defence budget to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, and to 3% in the following parliament. However, the document is likely to support a major medium-term spending increase—potentially exceeding £50 billion in real terms—that may be agreed at the upcoming Nato summit in June.There, Western allies are considering a proposal to raise core defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2032, with an additional 1.5% dedicated to cyber and infrastructure efforts, partly in response to mounting pressure from US President Donald Trump.It is also expected to address the issue of British army size, as tensions continue between the ministry of defence and the treasury over whether to commit to increasing troop numbers beyond the current target of 73,000. This comes amid fresh figures revealing that the army's strength has fallen to 70,860 full-time trained soldiers as of 1 April—its lowest level since the Napoleonic era—marking a 2.3% decline over the past year.Meanwhile, US defense secretary Pete Hegseth has also warned Indo-Pacific allies of an ""imminent threat"" from China, reassuring them that they would not face growing military and economic pressure from the country alone.","Britain's defence review has warned against “immediate and pressing” threat from Russia.

Prince William may be on holiday with Kate Middleton and their three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, but his work as the Duke of Cornwall never truly takes a back seat.During a recent visit to the Duchy of Cornwall estate, The Telegraph witnessed how William remains focused on improving life for its residentseven while away with his family.One of the family’s favourite spots is Tresco, an island in the Isles of Scilly, part of the duchy. Here, the prince is well known for chatting with locals about community needs and development. His efforts have led to tangible improvements, including a new healthcare centre with a maternity suite, housing plans for essential workers like teachers and doctors, and initiatives promoting sustainable tourism.The Isles of Scilly hold a special place for William, as family holidays there echo his own childhood trips with Princess Diana and the future King Charles, People reported.A holidaymaker who spotted the couple in 2020 told the Daily Mirror, “William and Kate were riding their bicycles, having a laugh. They looked so happy enjoying the weather. I did do a double-take. They were really friendly and said hello.”In May this year, Prince William returned to the Isles of Scilly on official duty — much to the chagrin of his family.“My family are very upset I’m here without them,” he told the Daily Mail. “The children will kill me if I don’t go home later.” He was spotted buying pastries at a local cafe, likely to bring back for them.The Duchy of Cornwall, established by King Edward III in 1337, covers around 130,000 acres of land and assets, supporting the heir to the throne and his family financially. But William’s focus goes beyond finance, he is committed to bettering the lives of those living on duchy land, prioritising sustainability, mental health, and charitable partnerships.“II’m trying to make sure I’m prioritizing stuff that’s going to make people’s lives, living in those areas, better. This is what we’re going to do to make people’s lives in Cornwall better,” William said.","Prince William is on holiday with his family in the Isles of Scilly, part of the Duchy of Cornwall.

Now worth more than £800 million, the duchy provides income for the heir to the throne but under Prince William’s leadership, it is becoming far more than just a source of funds.The 42-year-old royal is reportedly a demanding leader who visits parts of the duchy every four to six weeks.Will Bax, the duchy’s secretary, called William ""pretty demanding,"" but in a good way.Speaking to The Telegraph, he said that the Prince is ""a man on a mission.""“He’s easy to follow because he’s got great conviction and personality, and he really wears his heart on his sleeve in terms of social interest and his desire to have a positive impact in the world.”Estate director Ben Murphy also called William’s leadership “energising”, and compared it to his father’s, ""healthy impatience, as his father did,"" which ""puts the wind in our sails,"" PeoplePrince William sees the Duchy as more than just a royal portfolio.“I see the Duchy as an extension of the work we do with the Royal Foundation,” he told the newspaper. “I see it as a branch of my philanthropy.""He further added that there’s so much good that can be done in the rural world, ""I see it as another arm to the work that I want to do, which is being a positive force for good.”Key priorities under his stewardship included tackling homelessness, supporting mental health among farmers, and boosting sustainability across rural communities. The duchy has partnered with local groups on housing initiatives and mental health outreach, particularly for those working in agriculture who often face isolation.“I’m trying to make sure I’m prioritizing stuff that’s going to make people’s lives, living in those areas, better. This is what we’re going to do to make people’s lives in Cornwall better,” William said.“That, I feel as Duke of Cornwall, is something I should be doing. It’s about responsibility, it’s about leadership and doing what’s right on the social issues of our time.”Even family getaways are laced with purpose. During visits to the Isles of Scilly with Kate and their children — Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis — the Prince often chats with locals about their needs. These conversations have already led to drastic results, including improved healthcare facilities, new housing for key workers, and steps towards more sustainable tourism.Bax said, “He’s asking us to change and evolve in a way to deliver positive impact at scale and at pace.”The duchy’s most recent Integrated Annual Report, released in July, reported a surplus of £23.9 million for the 2023–24 financial year, Prince William’s first full year as Duke of Cornwall.","Duchy of Cornwall is a vast estate spanning over 130,000 acres across more than 20 counties in England and Wales.

Comedian Russell Brand to enter pleas on rape charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/comedian-russell-brand-to-enter-pleas-on-rape-charges/articleshow/121513061.cms,"British actor and comedian Russell Brand arrives at Southwark Crown Court, in London (AP)





LONDON: British comedian and actor Russell Brand arrived at a London court on Friday where he was due to enter pleas on five charges of sexual offences including rape and sexual assault.He faces one count of rape, one of oral rape, two of sexual assault and one of indecent assault between 1999 and 2005, involving four women.Brand, 49, arrived at Southwark Crown Court in an open-buttoned shirt and dark blazer for the plea hearing, after being granted conditional bail at a previous hearing.He gained international recognition as the husband of pop star Katy Perry, but is better known in the UK for his hyper-sexualised and often lewd comedy routines and TV and radio appearances in the early 2000s.Now living partly in the US, Brand appeared at Westminster magistrates court in central London earlier this month, where he showed no emotion as a prosecutor read out allegations against him.Prosecutors charged Brand following a police probe into allegations aired in a 2003 Channel 4 documentary.He is accused of raping one woman in a hotel room following an event in the southern Bournemouth area in 1999.Another charge relates to the oral rape and sexual assault of a woman in 2004 in central London.The accusations involve four women, including one who was a TV worker, and another who was a radio station worker at the time of the alleged assaults.In a video response on X after he was charged in April, Brand said he was ""grateful"" for the ""opportunity"" to defend himself.""I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile, but what I never was was a rapist. I've never engaged in non-consensual activity,"" he said in the video.Born in 1975 to working-class parents in Essex, east of London, Brand began his stand-up career as a teenager, eventually working as an MTV presenter and host of a Big Brother spin-off.He presented a show on the BBC's Radio 2 station between 2006 and 2008, but quit after an on-air prank when he left a sexually explicit voicemail for ""Fawlty Towers"" actor Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter.Once a left-leaning political campaigner and Hollywood star, he has rebranded himself as a conservative guru to his millions of social media followers.Brand often peddles conspiracy theories, as well as sharing wellness tips, in his anti-establishment videos.

Meghan Markle In 'Image Push' Overhaul? Royal Expert Reveals 'Anxiousness'





Since stepping away from royal life in 2020, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have settled California their home — but their neighbours say the couple have shown little interest in becoming part of the local community.Richard Mineards, a local journalist, told the Daily Mail that while the Duke of Sussex is known to be warm and approachable, his wife has kept a much lower profile.Mineards recalled an incident where Markle reportedly turned away an elderly local historian who wished to present her with a copy of his documentary about the area. “The old man never got past the gate,” he said, adding that Markle “doesn’t play the community game.”The journalist contrasted Markle’s distant approach with that of fellow Montecito resident Oprah Winfrey, who is well-known for her visible presence at charity events.Meghan has remained practically invisible to her neighbours ever since the couple purchased their $14 million home, which has now doubled in value, Mineards said.“She’s there, of course, but she shows herself very little. Her relationship with Montecito is … distant, shall we say,” he said, adding that the former actress has managed to “cultivate a very controlled image” of herself.“She pays attention to every appearance, every word, every gesture,” the New York Post quoted.Meanwhile, Mineards described Prince Harry, 40, as “always charming, approachable, with that very recognizable Windsor accent.”The prince “has kept his good natured side,” he said.“He smiles, shakes hands, and willingly exchanges a few words.”The reporter also noted that many locals have seen Harry out and about, whether at the beach, visiting an organic coffee shop, or cycling in the nearby hills with his security following in a Range Rover.","Meghan Markle has remained practically invisible to her neighbours ever since the couple purchased their $14 million home, a local journalist said.

They inhaled a gas and scaled Everest in days. Is it the future of mountaineering?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/they-inhaled-a-gas-and-scaled-everest-in-days-is-it-the-future-of-mountaineering/articleshow/121451558.cms,"Photo/Agencies

With xenon, 'you feel better.'

The use of the gas is 'against climbing ethics.'





Climbing Mount Everest typically takes weeks, with most of that time spent at the foot of the mountain adjusting to the thin air. But four British men last week shrank that timeline dramatically, traveling from London to the summit and back in less than a week, according to the organizer of their expedition.They skipped the adjustment period, in part, by inhaling a secret weapon: xenon gas.Their feat has roiled the world of mountaineering and prompted an investigation by the Nepalese government, as use of the gas is fiercely debated. Some research has shown that xenon can quickly acclimatize people to high altitudes, even as some experts say the benefits, if any, are negligible and the side effects of its use remain unclear.Organizers said the gas was key to the speed of the climb, but their approach has prompted a broader debate that strikes at the core of mountaineering: Should scaling Mount Everest , one of sporting's greatest accomplishments, be made easier -- available to more people during a quick vacation -- with the help of a performance enhancer?""It is a provocation, especially for traditional mountaineers, who feel bad about this idea that you can climb Everest in less than a week,"" Lukas Furtenbach, who organized the exhibition, said in a phone interview from the base of the mountain.""This showed that it can work.""Furtenbach said that beginning in 2026 he planned to offer two-week round-trip excursions to Mount Everest using xenon gas, cutting the typical time needed to scale the mountain by several weeks.""This can be the future of commercially guided mountaineering on Mount Everest,"" he said.For those who live at lower elevations and have traveled to the mountains, the discomfort of altitude sickness is all too clear. Symptoms include nausea, headaches and disrupted sleep, and in some cases it can lead to brain swelling or even death.As you go higher, less oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream with each breath. That is why so many people who climb Everest use supplemental oxygen.Xenon, an odorless gas, has been known for years to activate a molecule called the hypoxia-inducible factor, which is also turned on when people acclimate to low oxygen, said Hugh Montgomery, a professor of intensive care medicine at University College London and a mountaineer who led an expedition to Mount Everest to study how humans respond to low oxygen.""So what these people claim to have done,"" he said, ""is basically found a way to switch on the adaptation to low oxygen levels.""The group took what was known from medical science, he said, ""and have now applied it, recreationally, to sport mountaineering.""Montgomery said scientists were still unsure how xenon triggers this response.While some doctors have used the gas in the past to ""precondition"" patients to low oxygen levels -- for example, before major heart surgery -- the practice hasn't really caught on because ""it hasn't been as protective as one would hope,"" he said.Mike Shattock, a professor of cellular cardiology at King's College London, said ""xenon probably does very little, and there is virtually no reputable scientific evidence that it makes any difference.""Experts cautioned that self-medicating with xenon, which has the effects of anesthesia, could lead to overdose or death, and more study was needed to understand how the gas works and its use in mountaineering.On Mount Everest, the weeks of training and acclimation on the lower levels of the mountain are typically required to survive the ""death zone,"" the area above 26,000 feet where the air is particularly thin.The British group, which included four former special forces members, took a different approach.About 10 weeks before the expedition, the men began sleeping in hypoxic tents, which lower oxygen levels in the air and gradually acclimatized the hikers to conditions on Mount Everest, Furtenbach said.While hypoxic tents have been used by some climbers for years, the big innovation for the British expedition came two weeks before the excursion, when the men flew to Limburg, Germany, outside Frankfurt, where a doctor, Michael Fries, had been experimenting with inhaled gases in his clinic.The men wore masks hooked up to ventilators as an anesthesiologist slowly introduced higher levels of xenon into their systems.Furtenbach, who has tried xenon gas on his own mountaineering trips since 2020, said that after the treatment, users experienced enhanced breathing and the sensation of more lung volume, and ""when you do your workout or training, you feel better.""After arriving at the base of Everest, the British group climbed to the summit in less than three days, which Furtenbach said was one of the fastest times for a group that hadn't acclimatized on the mountain. (According to the Nepalese government, the record for the fastest climb overall is held by Lakpa Gelu, a Sherpa, who reached the top of the mountain in just under 11 hours.)The rapid climb by the British expedition and the use of the gas caught the eye of the Nepalese government, and the fallout has been swift.Himal Gautam, director of Nepal's tourism department, which is responsible for regulating expeditions on the nation's mountains, said in an interview that using the gas was ""against climbing ethics,"" and that it would hurt the country's tourism industry and the Sherpas who help climbers by reducing their time on the mountain.Gautam said his department was looking into the use of the gas by the British climbers, one of whom, Alistair Carns, is also a member of Parliament.In an interview, Carns said that his expedition had been in touch with the ministry and clarified with the department that it had not taken the gas on the mountain.He added that many people who want to climb Mount Everest don't have the time to spend multiple weeks acclimating.""The reality is if I had six to eight weeks to climb Everest, I would, but I'm a government minister, and I don't have time,"" he said. ""What we've done is we've proven that you can reduce the timeline safely.""Others in the mountaineering community have warned against the use of the gas.In January, the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation, a global network that promotes and protects the sport, released a statement that said there was no evidence that xenon gas improved performance, adding that ""inappropriate use can be dangerous.""The federation noted that xenon has been on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of banned substances since 2014 and is not approved in all countries.""From a medical point of view, off-label use without a scientific basis and with unknown health risks must be rejected,"" the statement said.Furtenbach argued that his expeditions were still using Sherpas -- five accompanied the British climbers to the summit -- and that shorter times on the mountain were safer, as they reduce the chance that climbers will be exposed to other health threats, including avalanches, hypothermia or falls.He said the prohibition of the gas by the World Anti-Doping Agency didn't apply to mountaineering because it is not a regulated competitive sport.Use of the gas gets at a core question about why people climb mountains in the first place, Montgomery said.""Is it really a good idea that we can all have what we want, when we want, as quick as we want?"" he asked. ""Are we missing out on the sacrifice you sometimes have to make to get the achievement?""""I'm not a critic,"" he added. ""But maybe just bagging every hill at speed means you miss out on the joy you could have had.""","Xenon gas can quickly acclimatize people to high altitudes, some research shows. Some experts say the benefits, if any, are negligible and the side effects of its use remain unclear. Four British men last week traveled from London to the summit and back in less than a week.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121451579,imgsize-856938,width-400,resizemode-4/121451579.jpg"

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

The first was in June 2023 and focused on Robinson promoting a film called Silenced, which included defamatory claims. It was also pinned to the top of his X profile and shared in interviews. The second was filed in August and concerned Robinson playing the film at a rally in Trafalgar Square and included six further breaches.





Far-right activist Tommy Robinson was released early from prison on Tuesday after a high court judge reduced his sentence for contempt of court by four months.Robinson's real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. He was serving an 18-month jail term for breaching a court order that barred him from repeating false allegations about a Syrian refugee. The 42-year-old left HMP Woodhill in Buckinghamshire on Tuesday, after the court accepted that he had shown a “change in attitude” and taken steps to comply with the injunction.In October 2024, Robinson was sentenced to 18 months—14 months as punishment and four months as a coercive measure to push him to follow a 2021 injunction. That injunction followed a successful libel case by Jamal Hijazi, a schoolboy Robinson falsely accused online of attacking girls, despite a viral video in 2018 showing Hijazi being assaulted.Although the sentencing judge noted Robinson showed “no remorse or contrition”, Mr Justice Jeremy Johnson ruled last week that the coercive part of the sentence had served its purpose.After the release, Robinson appeared visibly changed, with longer hair and a beard.In a video shared on his X account, he gave an assurance that he would not repeat the allegations.“He has given an assurance that he will comply with the injunction in the future, that he has no intention of breaching it again,” said Justice Johnson. “I consider it appropriate to grant the application.”The Solicitor General brought two contempt cases against Robinson after he ignored the high court’s order.In total, he admitted to ten breaches of the injunction. The court heard Robinson’s behaviour had led to a campaign of abuse against Hijazi and forced the teenager’s family to move house for their safety, reports the Independent.Despite previously fleeing the country to avoid legal consequences, Robinson returned and was taken into custody in October 2024.Robinson's legal team argued that he had removed much of the offending content and no longer intended to defy the injunction. The judge accepted this, but warned that any future breaches could land him back in prison for up to two years.Contempt of court, though classified as a civil offence, can still lead to criminal penalties such as imprisonment. It typically involves behaviour that disrupts the legal process, like breaching reporting restrictions or sharing material that could affect active cases. In Robinson’s case, the offences stemmed from defying a legal reporting ban, rather than any direct attempt to influence the outcome of a trial.",Far-right activist Tommy Robinson was released early from prison on Tuesday.

Court decision follows legal application to purge contempt

Controversial figure remains divisive

Robinson thanks Elon Musk





British TV channels interrupted their regular broadcast on Tuesday morning after Tommy Robinson was released from prison four months early.Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was jailed for 18 months for contempt of court after repeatedly breaching a 2021 injunction. The injunction had been granted to prevent him from making false claims against a Syrian refugee, who later won a libel case against him.GB News presenter Eamonn Holmes told viewers: “Tommy Robinson has been released from jail, that is four months early. He was originally jailed for 18 months for contempt of court after multiple breaches of an injunction, that was four years ago, but reportedly showed a ""change in attitude.”“He was originally due to be released on July 26,"" he added.Robinson looked visibly changed in his first public appearance since his release, sporting a thick beard and appearing older. Social media quickly reacted to the images, with many saying he was “unrecognisable.”Robinson’s early release came after a legal request to purge his contempt of court charge. His lawyers told the high court he had demonstrated a “commitment” to complying with the injunction.This commitment included refraining from repeating defamatory statements about the Syrian teenager.Although progress had been made, Justice Johnson said Robinson still showed “no real remorse or contrition.” Even so, he noted there had been a “change in attitude” since sentencing, which helped justify cutting the sentence.Lawyers representing the Solicitor General did not oppose the move, saying Robinson had taken necessary steps to follow the terms of the court order.Robinson remains one of the UK’s most controversial political figures. He co-founded the far-right English Defence League in 2009 and has faced multiple legal issues since. His supporters have often claimed he is unfairly targeted by the establishment, while critics have long denounced his inflammatory rhetoric and criminal record.His release will likely reignite debate over freedom of speech, contempt of court, and the limits of public discourse. The very issues Robinson himself has often used as rallying cries.Following Robinson's release, the reaction online was swift and polarised. Supporters celebrated his release, while critics questioned the decision and the message it might send.Tommy Robinson thanked Elon Musk as he was released early. Robinson said, ""I have to say a thank you to Elon Musk, because without X, if we didn't have X, everyone would just think I lied. No one would have got any other narrative."" Musk has shown support for Robinson, calling for his release and saying he was jailed ""for telling the truth.""Robinson is seen very differently by people. His supporters view him as a free speech martyr who tells the truth.

Lauren York described the landing as ""very worrying."" York mentioned her 20-month-old son remained asleep throughout. She said: ""When we touched ground and we were swerving all over the place, that was really frightening.""We were just holding on to him thinking are we going to make it? It was very worrying.""Sarah Brown praised the pilot's handling of the situation, despite the frightening experience.She said: ""We knew we'd get here safely in the end."" She noted that afterwards her children ""got to go in the cockpit, meet both the pilots, so they had an experience"".The AAIB decided not to investigate further after reviewing the incident.","The Blue Islands aircraft was travelling from Birmingham to Jersey.

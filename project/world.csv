Trump renews filibuster fight: GOP Senators push back in election year; Thune faces leadership test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-renews-filibuster-fight-gop-senators-push-back-in-election-year-thune-faces-leadership-test/articleshow/125812614.cms,"‘DARE YOU USE…’: Trump Picks Putin Over EU Allies? Lobbies Against Ursula On Frozen Russian Assets





President Donald Trump is continuing his push to eliminate the Senate filibuster, creating fresh tensions within the Republican caucus as lawmakers head into a critical election year. Senate Republicans, who have largely backed the president on major legislative and executive priorities, remain resistant to ending the 60-vote threshold, despite Trump’s repeated demands to ease legislative gridlock.Several GOP senators say the numbers simply aren’t there. “I know this has been an important priority for the president, but I think he has too many people telling him that this is achievable when it doesn’t strike me as achievable,” Senator Todd Young said, adding, “I don’t think we’re close to having the votes, just to be candid.”Majority Leader John Thune and most Senate Republicans rejected Trump’s call last month to scrap the filibuster during the record-long government shutdown. Still, the pressure continues to mount, leaving rank-and-file lawmakers wary of crossing Trump while also trying to preserve longstanding Senate norms.Despite Trump’s insistence, less than a quarter of Senate Republicans have shown openness to ending or modifying the filibuster.A few, however, have shifted. Sen Ron Johnson reversed his stance during the shutdown, saying Trump was right. Sen John Cornyn, facing a primary challenge, has also said he is open to reconsidering Senate traditions.The debate comes as Congress prepares for multiple deadlines early next year, including funding the government by Jan. 30, addressing rising health costs, completing the farm bill and renewing key surveillance authorities.Asked whether Trump will continue pressing the issue, a White House official pointed to his Truth Social post warning that Democrats would pack the Supreme Court “unless we TERMINATE THE FILIBUSTER, which will lead to an easy WIN of the Midterms, and an even easier WIN in the Presidential Election of 2028.”Advisers close to the White House say the filibuster fight is emerging as a key leadership test for Thune. “Every Republican prior to two months ago has been adamantly against getting rid of the filibuster and because Trump wants to get rid of the filibuster, John Thune either has to swallow another red pill or wean himself off,” said one person granted anonymity.Despite the disagreements, both sides have maintained a working relationship. Trump last month called senators who rejected his push “very smart people” and has continued to praise Thune. A person familiar with Senate leadership said, “This isn’t a relationship dealbreaker.”Trump made similar attempts in his first term, but then-majority leader Mitch McConnell declined to consider the move, citing insufficient support. Some Trump allies also pushed to fire the Senate parliamentarian during debate earlier this year on the administration’s “big, beautiful bill,” a request Thune refused.Several GOP senators remain adamant that the filibuster is not going anywhere. “It’s a moot issue. We’re just not going to get rid of the filibuster,” said Sen John Kennedy.Still, Trump’s supporters argue Republicans should act now in anticipation of Democrats scrapping the rule if they regain power. Sen Tommy Tuberville said Trump has raised the matter with lawmakers directly, noting, “I just got a feeling … it’s just a matter of time that they’re going to vote and get rid of it whenever they take over the majority next time.”Sen Josh Hawley framed the push as urgency to deliver results ahead of the 2026 midterms. Trump, he said, is “the one who’s right now pushing Congress to act… We need to deliver more.”","President Donald Trump is continuing his push to eliminate the Senate filibuster.

‘I want my husband home’: Green card holder ​Allan Dabrio Marrero misses mail; detained by ICE,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-want-my-husband-home-green-card-holder-allan-dabrio-marrero-misses-mail-detained-by-ice/articleshow/125812459.cms,"ICE Officers ‘Pepper-spray’ Dem Grijalva At Arizona Raid; DHS Fires Back | ‘Medical Miracle If True’





A green card applicant was detained by the ICE agents because he missed a piece of mail from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services during a recent move.Allan Dabrio Marrero, who is married to a US citizen, Matthew Marrero, and used to live in the Cayman Islands, was detained by ICE agents last week at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan. His husband and their church family are seeking his release, arguing that he has no criminal history and was meticulous with his paperwork, Newsweek reported.“The way the narrative has been spun to the general public is that they’re going after the worst of the worst. And that is not true,” Matthew Marrero told ABC 7. “My husband is a contributing member to society, is proud to want to be an American.”More cases of green card applicants married to US citizens have been reported in recent weeks, as the Trump administration tightened immigration enforcement against those who overstayed visas or had minor paperwork issues. While such arrests have been uncommon at Federal Plaza, the building has been the site of multiple protests over the detention of immigrants appearing before immigration judges.Allan Marrero has lived in the US for over a decade. He left the Cayman Islands, where he was a citizen, to find a safer place to live as a member of the LGBTQ+ community and applied for asylum in the US. He met his husband via social media two years ago.The couple married and applied for Allan’s marriage-based green card, with his interview scheduled for last week in Lower Manhattan.Unaware that he had missed a December 2022 notice summoning him to an immigration hearing, USCIS marked him as having failed to appear, triggering removal proceedings. At last week’s appointment, the couple learned that Allan had an order of removal. ICE agents then detained him and transferred him to Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey, where he remains.A GoFundMe campaign started by the family has raised over $15,500 to cover legal fees and visiting costs at the New Jersey detention centre.The Department of Homeland Security stated that it targets the “worst of the worst” among alleged illegal immigrants, namely those with criminal convictions. Immigration advocates and attorneys say the evidence contradicts this claim, noting that Allan is one of a growing number of individuals arrested while lawfully pursuing a green card.“I just want so badly to get my husband home. I hope, I pray, that he’ll be able to get out before the holidays,” Matthew Marrero told Documented in New York.“He is a law-abiding, tax paying, work visa holding SHOULD BE citizen, who left the Cayman Islands to come to the USA to seek asylum from discrimination against homosexuality. A man who fell in love in a place he felt safe to do so. And after being married to Matthew for over two years, is entitled to a green card based on a Bonafide marriage. Not to be blindsided when doing what they were told is the right thing to do,” said Andrea Marrero, Allan’s sister-in-law, on GoFundMe.","Allan Dabrio Marrero, who is married to a US citizen, was detained by ICE agents last week at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan.

Why did John Cena warn IShowSpeed against switching careers even after praising his WWE potential?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/why-did-john-cena-warn-ishowspeed-against-switching-careers-even-after-praising-his-wwe-potential/articleshow/125812227.cms,"Internet sensation IShowSpeed shows surprising wrestling talent during WWE training.

John Cena praises IShowSpeed’s talent but warns against a career switch





IShowSpeed may be one of the internet’s most energetic entertainers, but his recent dive into WWE training has sparked a more serious conversation: could the 20-year-old streamer actually become a professional wrestler? From running drills at the WWE Performance Center to taking bumps from established stars, Speed has shown he’s not just playing for the cameras.He sells moves convincingly, engages the crowd like he’s been doing it for years, and brings a natural athletic flair that most rookies don’t have. Yet, even with that potential, John Cena, one of WWE’s biggest icons, thinks Speed’s future belongs somewhere entirely different. And it’s not in wrestling or sprinting.During a recent conversation on Joe Rogan’s podcast, Cena praised how quickly IShowSpeed adapts to physical storytelling and crowd psychology. Watching a sprint clip featuring the streamer, Cena marveled at his athleticism and charisma, explaining that both are rare and valuable in sports entertainment. However, Cena argued that the real issue isn’t whether Speed can wrestle professionally, it’s whether he should sacrifice his successful digital career to chase it.“So I see this and be like, this kid should be a wrestler. Because he is athletic, and he can talk shit, and back it up.My god, this kid, he would be a 20-time champion whatever. But no, he should do this (livestreaming)… he should do neither. He should just do that… and just keep crushing.”Cena’s message highlights something deeper about modern fame: in an era where creators command bigger audiences than many athletes, Speed may already be in the best lane for his future. His WWE appearances, whether selling a chair shot from Randy Orton or performing as a Prime mascot at WrestleMania, work precisely because of his streaming identity, not in spite of it.While legends like Orton see a full-time wrestler in him, Cena believes Speed’s greatest strength is his one-of-a-kind ability to stay unpredictable, funny, and viral, without needing to belong to one industry. If he keeps training just enough to surprise fans, but not enough to replace streaming, he may end up with the rarest prize of all: crossover stardom on his own terms.Also Read: ""I could be harmed"": QTCinderella regrets becoming a streamer as harassment and safety concerns overshadow her career","Internet sensation IShowSpeed shows surprising wrestling talent during WWE training.

Planning your year around UAE holidays





Local authorities may add extra holidays

Public holidays are not carried forward if they fall on weekends or overlap with another holiday

Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, so slight adjustments are possible





Residents of the UAE have much to look forward to in 2026, with several public holidays promising opportunities for long weekends and family time. From Eid celebrations to the National Day, a mix of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar holidays will shape the holiday calendar. Here is a detailed guide to all predicted public holidays, how they are determined, and tips to plan your time off.UAE public holidays are a combination of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar calendar dates. Gregorian holidays, such as New Year’s Day and National Day, occur on the same date each year. Islamic holidays, including Eid Al Fitr, Eid Al Adha, Islamic New Year, and Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday (PBUH), shift each year based on moon sightings.The UAE Public Holiday Law, established in April 2024 and implemented from January 2025, allows certain holidays to be shifted to the start or end of the week to create long weekends, except for Eid holidays. Cabinet Resolution No. 27 of 2024 also permits local governments to declare additional holidays for special occasions.Holidays that fall on weekends or coincide with another public holiday are not carried forward, but 2026 predictions indicate no overlap between Islamic holidays and Gregorian holidays.Residents in the UAE can expect at least 12 public holidays in 2026. While final dates depend on moon sightings and government announcements, current predictions give a clear picture of the likely schedule:Transferable holidays: Islamic holidays such as Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al Adha are not transferable. Other holidays, including the Islamic New Year, Prophet’s Birthday, and National Day, may be moved to create long weekends based on Cabinet resolutions.2026 promises several opportunities for extended breaks:Residents are advised to plan ahead, as Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, which may adjust official dates.Public and private schools in the UAE align their breaks with national holidays, though exact dates differ by curriculum and school authority:This schedule helps families coordinate holidays and make the most of predicted long weekends.Understanding the mix of fixed and lunar based holidays allows residents to strategically plan annual leave. For example, taking just a few days off around Eid or National Day can maximize time away from work. While the UAE government confirms official dates closer to each holiday, these predictions serve as a reliable guide for 2026.Residents should note:With this guide, UAE residents can look forward to a year of well timed breaks, long weekends, and ample family and leisure time.","UAE residents in 2026 can enjoy 12 public holidays, including Eid, National Day, and school breaks.

An illegal immigrant, who is identified as Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia, was taken into custody in connection with a stabbing on a light rail in Charlotte, North Carolina.While investigating the case, the police discovered that the 33-year-old suspect was actually deported twice back to his country.Solorzano-Garcia was issued a final deportation order in 2018 and was removed from the United States on March 9 of that year, DHS said. He was arrested crossing the border illegally again in 2021 and removed a second time. DHS said he apparently re-entered the US a third time at an unknown date and location.DHS Secretary Kristi Noem condemned the alleged stabbing, saying the incident “should have never happened.“This heinous stabbing by this twice removed illegal alien should have NEVER happened. ICE lodged an arrest detainer to ensure Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia is not released back into North Carolina neighborhoods. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the county will honor the detainer since they have a history of not cooperating with ICE,” said Secretary Noem in a press statement released by DHS.“Under President Trump, ICE is being unleashed to ensure public safety for all Americans.

‘Whole thing just disgusts...’: CEO Brian Thompson’s colleague slams fans of his killer Luigi Mangione,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/whole-thing-just-disgusts-ceo-brian-thompsons-colleague-slams-fans-of-his-killer-luigi-mangione/articleshow/125809962.cms,"Luigi Mangione Gets 200+ Letters A Day; Some Too Explicit To Read Out Loud





A former colleague of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson , who was killed by Luigi Mangione , is not happy with the fans who give attention to the shooter.It has been one year since the executive was shot dead in Manhattan, but the case of Mangione is still ongoing.“It was the Luigi show,” said Terrie Martin, an independent Medicare broker from Texas who met Thompson at a conference months before his death, reports the New York Post.She described how Brian was an innocent family guy: “The whole thing just disgusts me — the way it was handled, the way it was portrayed, the way everybody jumped to celebrate when they weren’t even thinking this guy was a father, a husband, a boss or anything. That was just appalling.”50-year-old Thompson was fatally shot outside the Hilton Hotel in New York on December 4, 2024. The assassination was caught on camera.26-year-old Mangione managed to flee New York but was arrested after a five-day manhunt at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania. Federal prosecutors ruled that Mangione was hostile towards the healthcare industry.Thompson's accomplice said he bore no resemblance to the “caricature” painted by Mangione’s supporters.“He really and truly wanted to know how to make it better, nuts and bolts from people who are working on the ground in the trenches. What’s beneficial, what’s lacking, how can we make it better? He was really, really set on that very sincerely. He was actually trying to make a difference. That’s what made me so sad.”She recalled Thompson’s humility: “The one thing that I noticed from the very beginning was that everyone called him BT. They didn’t call him Brian or Mr. Thompson… I’ve never seen a dynamic like that before in corporate America.”Martin also remembered an awkward moment when she realised she had been speaking to the CEO. “He just laughed. He was so gracious about it. If you had met him anywhere like in line at a grocery store or a sporting event, you would never have guessed he was a CEO. Never. He was just such a really nice, humble, everyday kinda guy.”Earlier this week, a Manhattan judge reviewed key evidence in Mangione’s murder case, including a 911 call from the Altoona McDonald’s where he was arrested days after the killing. Prosecutors played surveillance footage of a masked gunman shooting Thompson. Mangione's defence seeks to suppress evidence from his arrest, including a handgun, a magazine, and a notebook.Meanwhile, supporters gathered outside the court in costume, holding “Free Luigi” signs.","Former colleague of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is not happy with the fans who give attention to Luigi Mangione.

A powerful magnitude-7.0 earthquake struck in a remote area near the border between Alaska and the Canadian territory of Yukon on Saturday.There was no tsunami warning, and officials said there were no immediate reports of damage or injury, AP news agency reported.The U.S. Geological Survey said it struck about 230 miles (370 kilometres) northwest of Juneau, Alaska, and 155 miles (250 kilometres) west of Whitehorse, Yukon.In Whitehorse, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sgt. Calista MacLeod said the detachment received two 911 calls about the quake. “It definitely was felt,” MacLeod said. “There are a lot of people on social media, people felt it.”Alison Bird, a seismologist with Natural Resources Canada, said the part of Yukon most affected by the temblor is mountainous and has few people. “Mostly people have reported things falling off shelves and walls,” Bird said. “It doesn’t seem like we’ve seen anything in terms of structural damage.”The Canadian community nearest to the epicentre is Haines Junction, about 80 miles (130 kilometres) away, Bird said. The Yukon Bureau of Statistics listed its population at 1,018 for 2022. The quake was also about 56 miles (91 kilometres) from Yakutat, Alaska, which the USGS said has 662 residents.It struck at a depth of about 6 miles (10 kilometres) and was followed by multiple smaller aftershocks.","There was no tsunami warning, and officials said there were no immediate reports of damage or injury.

Biggest ever US travel ban in the works?

The United States is planning to expand the number of countries that were covered by its travel ban - and the new list may include over 30 countries.US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, on Thursday, during an interview on Fox News’ The Ingraham Angle, when asked whether President Donald Trump’s administration would increase the number to 32, she said “I won’t be specific on the number, but it’s over 30, and the president is continuing to evaluate countries. ""In June, Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats, Reuters reported.The bans applied to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travellers.Noem did not specify which countries would be added to the list. “If they don’t have a stable government there, if they don’t have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” she said.Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was considering banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable.An expansion of the list would mark a further escalation of migration measures the administration had taken since the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week.Investigators said the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement programme under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting. Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” although he did not identify any by name or define “third-world countries.”Prior to that, officials from the Department of Homeland Security said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the administration of his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, and Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries. Since returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border.

Survivors were in 'clear distress'

Survivors were trying to 'stay in the fight'

Trump says Pete 'didn't know what people were talking about'





Two people who survived the September 2nd US strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean were seen waving before they were killed in a second follow-up strike, sources familiar with a video shown to lawmakers revealed.One source said the gestures could be interpreted as the survivors either calling for help or surrendering to avoid another strike.The operation was the first of more than 20 US attacks on suspected drug-carrying vessels under the Trump administration. The GOP leader has defended the campaign as a necessary way to curb narcotics trafficking. However, the premise remains legally questionable. The Pentagon has reported that more than 80 people have died in these strikes, including 11 in the initial September 2 attack.Members of Congress were shown video of the strikes, including the follow-up attack that killed the two survivors, during a closed-door briefing with the operation's commander, Adm. Mitch Bradley, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, according to CBS News.Democratic Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut described the scene as one of the most difficult things hes ever seen in his life. He said the survivors appeared “in clear distress without any means of locomotion.”Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas defended the strikes. He said the survivors were “trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight” and clarified that the strikes were “entirely lawful and needful.”US President Donald Trump hinted he would support releasing the video to the public, but denied knowledge of any order given to target survivors. “I don't know that that happened. And Pete said he did not want that — he didn't even know what people were talking about. We'll look into it. But no, I wouldn't have wanted that. Not a second strike,” he said.Trump has also said that Venezuela’s airspace should now be considered “closed” amid rising tensions.Defensed department officials have defended the operations as legal and necessary. Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told The Washington Post that “ongoing operations to dismantle narcoterrorism and to protect the Homeland from deadly drugs have been a resounding success.”Defense secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes were “lethal, kinetic strikes” aimed at stopping drug trafficking and destroying vessels affiliated with “Designated Terrorist Organisations.”Legal experts and lawmakers have expressed concern that targeting survivors could constitute a war crime.","Survivors seen waving before they were killed in a second follow-up strike.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday evening hosted the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees in the Oval Office for a medal-presentation ceremony.“This is a great evening, it’s a great honour,” Trump said. “And I’m delighted to welcome to the Oval Office – the world-famous, most famous office in the world, most powerful office in the world – our truly exceptional 2025 Kennedy Center honorees. ”Trump said the honorees “inspired, uplifted and unified millions and millions of Americans”, calling them “the most accomplished and renowned class of Kennedy Center honorees ever assembled”.Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell stood behind Trump as the President presented the medals. Grenell, who was appointed by Trump in February this year to head the centre, is also a special envoy to Latin America for the administration.This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone , singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford , Guardian reported.The medallions to the honorees were “re-designed” by Tiffany and Co, Trump said. “They have done a fantastic job, they’re wonderful people – I know them very well because they’re right next to Trump Tower, I’ve lived with them many years,” he said.Trump never visited the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in his first term, and did not take part in its annual awards programme.But he has taken a keen interest in his second. Since taking office, he has ousted the Kennedy Center’s board of trustees and replaced them with supporters. He has promised to “fully renovate” the Kennedy Center’s infrastructure, and make it a “crown jewel” of arts and culture in the US.It was unclear how this year’s honorees were chosen, but Trump said in August when presenting the list that he had been “about 98% involved”.The Kennedy Center Honors programme and its series of tribute performances for each recipient is set to be taped on Sunday, and will be broadcast later in December.The President said in August that he would host the show, and Trump on Saturday set expectations high: “I believe – and I’m going to make a prediction: this will be the highest-rated show that they’ve ever done,” Trump said about Sunday’s event during the medal ceremony. “And they’ve gotten some pretty good ratings. But there’s nothing like what’s going to happen tomorrow night.”Presidents traditionally attend the programme, but none has ever presented the show, a fact Trump appeared aware of as well. “We never had a president hosting the awards before, this is a first. I’m sure they’ll give me great reviews, right?” Trump quipped. “No, we’ll do fine. I’ve watched some of the people that host. Jimmy Kimmel was horrible.”“If I can’t beat out Jimmy Kimmel in terms of talent, then I don’t think I should be President,” Trump added.","US President Donald Trump hosted the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees in the Oval Office for a medal-presentation ceremony.

US defence secretary Pete Hegseth on Saturday defended the ongoing series of strikes on suspected drug-smuggling vessels, asserting that President Donald Trump has full authority to order military action to protect national security. His remarks came during a keynote address at the Reagan National Defense Forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California.The strikes, which have reportedly killed more than 80 people, have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers over questions of legality and compliance with international law. Some members of Congress have also sought clarity on whether US forces were directed to carry out a second strike in September despite Pentagon awareness of survivors from the first.Rejecting criticism, Hegseth compared the counter-narcotics campaign to the post-9/11 war on terror. “If you’re working for a designated terrorist organization and you bring drugs to this country in a boat, we will find you and we will sink you. Let there be no doubt about it,” he said.He added, “President Trump can and will take decisive military action as he sees fit to defend our nation’s interests. Let no country on earth doubt that for a moment.”While Hegseth framed the alleged smugglers as equivalent to Al-Qaida operatives, several security experts have pointed out that the contexts and adversaries differ significantly.His address followed the release of the administration’s updated national security strategy, which underscores a harder line towards European allies and emphasises renewed US dominance in the Western Hemisphere. Hegseth also highlighted the need to counter China’s rise “through strength”, reiterating Trump’s pledge to resume nuclear testing on par with China and Russia - a position that has raised concerns among nuclear specialists. Beijing and Moscow have not carried out explosive tests in decades, though Russia has said it would mirror any US resumption.Positioning Trump as Reagan’s “true and rightful heir” on foreign policy, Hegseth criticised Republican leaders over the years for backing Middle East wars and democracy-building efforts. He also dismissed arguments that climate change poses security risks, saying, “The war department will not be distracted by democracy building, interventionism, undefined wars, regime change, climate change, woke moralizing and feckless nation building. ”(With inputs from agencies)","US defence secretary Pete Hegseth defended the ongoing series of strikes on suspected drug-smuggling vessels.

"US coast guard snipes drug boat from chopper; seizes 20,000 pounds of cocaine",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-coast-guard-snipes-drug-boat-from-chopper-seizes-20000-pounds-of-cocaine-watch/articleshow/125812166.cms,"‘Drug Boat’ Shocker: New Video Shows Survivors Frantically Waving Right Before Fatal Second Strike





The United States coast guard disabled a high-speed “go-fast” boat via helicopter sniper fire and seized over 20,000 pounds of cocaine in a single mission - the largest such haul by a national security cutter to date.Video put out by Fox News shows coast guard personnel, including a sniper from the service’s helicopter interdiction tactical squadron (HITRON), stationed in Jacksonville, Florida, firing at the vessel’s engines from a helicopter to disable the boat before boarding. The interception and seizure took place in the Eastern Pacific, south of Mexico. According to the Coast Guard, the haul represents more than 7.5 million potentially lethal doses of cocaine.The operation was carried out under Operation Pacific Viper, a joint coast guard–navy initiative launched in August as part of the current administration’s crackdown on drug-trafficking cartels in Latin America. By October, the coast guard said the operation had already netted 100,000 pounds of cocaine in the eastern Pacific - roughly 1,600 pounds per day.In November, the coast guard reported nearly 510,000 pounds of cocaine seized in fiscal year 2025 - the highest annual total in the service’s history.Officials noted this amount translates to some 193 million potentially lethal doses, “enough to jeopardise more than half of the US population,” and amounts to more than three times the service’s usual yearly average of about 167,000 pounds.The “go-fast” boat interdiction is typical of the tactics used to curb the flow of narcotics across waterways. In such missions, HITRON snipers disable engines so that Coast Guard cutters and other assets can board and seize contraband. According to the service, this approach played a key role in the success of the most recent action.Separately, the administration has reportedly conducted at least 22 strikes against suspected drug vessels in Latin American waters since September. Some lawmakers have questioned the legality of those strikes - particularly one that targeted a second vessel after the first strike left survivors. In response, the White House asserted its authority to carry out such attacks.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senators Tim Kaine, Adam Schiff and Rand Paul on Wednesday introduced a war-powers resolution aimed at blocking the president from using US armed forces to conduct hostilities in or against Venezuela. Meanwhile, defence secretary Pete Hegseth affirmed that strikes on “narco-boats” will continue, saying, “We’ve only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean because they’ve been poisoning the American people. ”","U.S. coast guard disabled a high-speed ‘go-fast’ boat via helicopter sniper fire and seized over 20,000 pounds of cocaine in a single mission.

What does the Act say about apprehension fee?

'Holiday deal of a lifetime'





On top of all the new immigration rules the Donald Trump administration recently announced, there is a new $5,000 'apprehension fee' on migrants without legal status, US Border Patrol chief Micheal banks announced. This charge will apply to people apprehended after crossing the border between posts of entry. The fee is part of a provision of One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was passed by Congress earlier this year.""This message applies to all illegal aliens—regardless of where they entered, how long they’ve been in the U.S., their current location, or any ongoing immigration proceedings,"" Banks wrote in a post on X.The Act set the initial amount at a minimum of $5,000 for fiscal year 2025 and gave the DHS secretary the authority to adjust the fee over time. The bill implements new fees for certain humanitarian protections, including a minimum $100 non-waivable fee for asylum applications, plus an additional $100 for each year the application remains pending. It also implements a minimum $250 fee for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, a form of humanitarian relief for children who have been abused or neglected by one or both parents.The DHS this week launched a 'holiday deal of a lifetime' offering illegal immigrants free flight home for the holidays and a $1000 gift if they self-deport. “The CBP Home App offers those in this country illegally a fantastic gift this holiday season: a free flight home, a $1,000 gift, and the potential opportunity to return to America the right, legal way,” said assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “Your choice is simple: Choose self-deportation and reap the rewards, or stay here and continue breaking our laws, which will lead to you being arrested and deported.

A major staffing firm is facing backlash after a job advert showed it barred United States citizens from applying and allowed only H-1B visa holders to apply. The listing has stirred a row over alleged discrimination in industries that rely heavily on foreign work visas.The company is named LanceSoft, which is an IT staffing company that promotes its commitment to “diversity, equality, and inclusivity.” The firm posted the advert on November 25 for a technical support role in California, the Washington Free Beacon reported.The job paid $60 an hour and was framed as an equal-opportunity role open to people of any background.But buried under “Visa requirement” was a line that was questionable: applicants “must hold an active H1B visa.” A recruiter, Riyaz Ansari, added “No USC/GC for this role,” referring to US citizens and green card holders. He also said that LanceSoft’s status is a “certified Minority Business Enterprise.”Federal law forbids employers from discriminating based on citizenship status in the US. The Free Beacon reportedly found more than two dozen job postings since 2024 that appeared to exclude Americans, including listings on LinkedIn.Many came from firms owned by Indian nationals, who make up 70 per cent of H-1B visa holders.LanceSoft removed the advert within 24 hours of being contacted by reporters, according to the Free Beacon.The Justice Department has fined numerous companies for similar behaviour, including Meta, IBM and several tech recruitment firms.Moreover, Harmeet Dhillon, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the DOJ, said that a team is working on such cases.In a post on X, the Indian-origin said: ""Thanks for flagging — we have a team working on these cases and will look at this. We work with the USEEOC and USDOL and the White House.""The row comes amid an internal divide among MAGA conservatives over the H-1B programme.

Democrat senator Ruben Gallego (Arizona) has expressed concern over the H-1B visa program and asked the Donald Trump administration how it would ensure Americans are not losing out on jobs.

At major public technology companies, employees between the ages of 21 and 25 made up 15 percent of the workforce in January 2023. By July 2025, that number had dropped to 6.7 percent. These statistics suggest that there are young American workers eager to be trained for and to fill these roles,"" the senator wrote.""Gen Z workers are struggling elsewhere in our economy too,"" he added.Citing the data from a Bank of America Institute report, Gallego claimed that over 13 per cent of of unemployed Americans in July were new entrants into the workforce or jobseekers with no prior work experience.

Moreover, a new report shows that childcare for one infant now costs more than rent in 17 states and more than in-state college tuition in 38 states,"" he wrote.Acknowledging the administration's Project Firewall, the senator asked whether the Department of Labor will pay special attention to companies that have laid off American workers while filing petitions for H-1B workers.

Fresh information has surfaced about Brian Cole, the man accused of planting pipe bombs outside the Democratic and Republican national headquarters on the eve of the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot.According to Fox News, Cole is an unlikely suspect who lived with his mother, adored chihuahuas and was described by those who knew him as “almost autistic-like.”30-year-old Cole was arrested on Thursday after a 5-year manhunt and investigation into the mysterious explosives left outside the DNC and RNC buildings on 5 January 2021.The bombs never detonated, but the FBI has confirmed they were fully capable of causing serious injuries or deaths.Cole made his initial appearance in federal court in Washington on Friday. He did not enter a plea and was ordered to remain in custody until his detention hearing on December 15. He is charged with transporting explosives across state lines with intent to kill, injure or cause damage, as well as attempted malicious destruction of property using explosive materials.According to the New York Post, Cole sat for nearly four hours with investigators and admitted he planted the devices.He told investigators he believed claims that “Trump — not Democrat Joe Biden — won the 2020 presidential election,” yet a national Republican operative told NYP there was no sign Cole was a Trump voter.Investigators also found social media posts suggesting he held anarchist views, but found no evidence tying him to militant groups or pro-Trump rioters.The pipe bombs were classic improvised explosives made from galvanised metal pipes filled with homemade black powder. Each had a simple firing system with wiring and a kitchen timer. According to the FBI, they were lethal despite not being military grade.The bombs were found only after 15 to 20 hours of searching, a delay that fuelled criticism of the FBI’s handling of the case. Many people questioned the credibility of federal authorities, asking how a man described as quiet, simple and living with his mother, who loved dogs, could evade arrest for nearly five years.","Brian Cole was arrested on Thursday after a 5-year manhunt and investigation into the mysterious explosives left outside the DNC and RNC buildings on 5 January 2021.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





Pakistan’s defence ministry on Friday officially notified the appointment of Field Marshal Asim Munir as the country’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).The ""president, on the advice of the prime minister, is pleased to appoint Field Marshal Asim Munir (NI) M as the chief of army staff, concurrently the chief of defence forces for a tenure of five years,” the notification read, news agency PTI reported citing Dawn.This comes a day after President Asif Ali Zardari approved his appointment on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.According to the notification issued under Article 243 of Pakistan’s Constitution and the amended Pakistan Army Act, Munir will serve concurrently as Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces for a tenure of five years. The notification marks the most significant restructuring of Pakistan’s military command since the 1970s.The appointment follows the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment last month, which created the new CDF post to establish a unified command structure and enable faster decision-making in critical situations.The amendment also abolished the office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which had coordinated the tri-services since 1976. The CJCSC post formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.With the restructuring, operational, administrative and strategic authority of the armed forces has been consolidated into a single office headed by the CDF. The revised Article 243 provides that the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, will appoint the army chief, who will concurrently serve as the CDF.Munir was first appointed Army Chief in November 2022 for three years. His tenure was extended to five years in 2024 after amendments to the Pakistan Army Act.He was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal days after the four-day conflict with India in May, becoming only the second officer in Pakistan’s history to hold the rank after Field Marshal Ayub Khan.Alongside Munir’s notification, the defence ministry also confirmed a two-year extension for Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu. His extended tenure as Chief of the Air Staff will begin in March 2026 and continue till March 2028.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Munir on his “historic” appointment, saying his leadership had been pivotal in guiding Pakistan’s armed forces. He also praised the air chief for his command during recent operations. defence minister Khawaja Asif and other senior leaders also extended their congratulations, according to Dawn.Information minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan’s defence had strengthened with the establishment of a unified command. Dismissing speculation over the delay in the notification, he said rumours circulating on social and electronic media had proven baseless.Earlier uncertainty had followed the abolition of the CJCSC post and the end of Munir’s original three-year term in late November, leading to political speculation over upcoming four-star appointments. Government officials maintained that the delay was procedural and linked to the prime minister’s travel schedule.Explaining the significance of the new post, army spokesman Lt General Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry said the CDF headquarters would improve coordination across modern, multi-domain warfare involving land, sea, air, cyber, space and intelligence operations. He added that many countries already operate under similar unified command structures.Under the amended military laws, the five-year tenure of the first COAS-plus-CDF is deemed to begin from the date of notification, effectively resetting Munir’s term. The law also allows future reappointments or extensions of up to five years, creating the legal framework for continuity in leadership.The next major step under the new structure will be the appointment of the Commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), a four-star position responsible for strategic assets. The NSC commander will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the CDF.Meanwhile, law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the defence ministry is finalising a new organogram for the CDF to clearly define command flows between the CDF, the service chiefs and the newly created strategic command.Politically, the 27th Constitutional Amendment has drawn mixed reactions. While the ruling coalition hailed it as a step towards efficiency and national security, opposition leaders warned that it concentrates excessive power in the military and could weaken democratic and provincial autonomy.",Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday formally appointed Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir as Pakistan’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) for a period of five years.The move follows the recent passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment on November 12, which created the post of CDF to unify command across the armed forces and streamline decision-making during critical situations.The newly created CDF replaces the abolished office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.President Zardari approved the recommendation submitted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for Munir’s appointment. A press release from the President’s office extended best wishes to Munir in his new role.The same release also announced a two-year extension in the service of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu, Chief of Air Staff, effective from the completion of his current tenure in March 2026.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the reforms “bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while maintaining military honour and tradition” and confirmed there were no legal or political obstacles to Munir’s appointment. He also stated that the Defence Ministry was preparing a new organogram for the CDF to reflect the changes.Field Marshal Munir, who was initially appointed as COAS in November 2022 for three years, had his tenure extended to five years in 2024.With this appointment, he assumes a historic dual role, serving simultaneously as Chief of Army Staff and the first Chief of Defence Forces, marking a significant shift in Pakistan’s military hierarchy and institutional structure.The 27th Constitutional Amendment elevates the army chief to the role of CDF with constitutional authority over all three branches of the military: army, navy and air force.It also introduces judicial reforms, including the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) to handle constitutional matters, allowing the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the amendment as a demonstration of national unity, highlighting the role of law enforcement in recent counterterrorism efforts.While the ruling coalition including PPP, PML-N, and MQM-P, supported the amendment, opposition parties criticized it as unconstitutional, warning it could concentrate excessive power in the military.PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan described it as the “Baku Amendments,” accusing the government of undermining democracy. PPP Senator Raza Rabbani warned the changes could damage provincial autonomy and roll back powers devolved under the 18th Amendment, according to Dawn.Following Munir’s appointment, the next key step will be appointing the commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), a four-star position previously under the CJCSC. The NSC commander will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the CDF.","President Asif Ali Zardari formally appointed Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir as Pakistan’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) for a period of five years.

Rise of Rehman Dakait and the Peoples’ Aman Committee





Feuds, betrayal and the making of Uzair Baloch





Parallel governance, ‘parchi’ systems and water mafias





Several informal systems operated during this period:

The ‘Parchi’ System: Residents, businesses and even small schools were required to obtain a stamped permission slip or parchi from PAC offices to build, renovate, operate stalls or open new ventures. What looked like a routine approval process effectively served as taxation, a tool of surveillance and a means to regulate economic activity.

Water and Tanker Control: Amid persistent water shortages across Karachi, PAC factions captured key pipeline points and operated illegal hydrants. Water was sold through tankers at inflated rates, turning a basic utility into one of the most profitable sources of revenue for the gangs. Control over water distribution also gave PAC leverage over entire neighbourhoods.

Welfare Patronage and ‘Robin Hood’ Politics: A share of illicit earnings was used to sponsor madrassas, support religious events, organise football tournaments, fund community funerals and assist poor families. This welfare strategy deepened PAC’s influence and aligned it with PPP’s political base, reinforcing the perception of gang leaders as protectors rather than mere criminals.

PPP, the Bhuttos and the contested 'protector' narrative





A factual account of the events surrounding Benazir’s return and death underscores this point:

Karsaz bombing (18 October 2007): Benazir was in an open truck surrounded by PPP volunteers, not in a car. Her protection was largely handled by party workers and an informal crowd, not gang networks.

Assassination in Rawalpindi December, 27, 2007: At the time she was targeted, she was travelling in a white Toyota Land Cruiser driven by Javed Rehman, a trained PPP driver, not Rehman Dakait. No credible evidence links the gangster to her security detail.

Post-war Lyari: Quiet streets, unresolved questions









NEW DELHI: Karachi’s Lyari has long been associated with a dual identity. To its residents, it is the “mother of Karachi” – one of the city’s oldest settlements powered by dockworkers, truck drivers, boxers and footballers. To the rest of Pakistan, especially through the 1990s and 2000s, it came to signify something very different: a “mini Brazil” of football-obsessed alleys, heavily armed gangs, and extortion rackets, long branded as Karachi’s “wild west.”It is this layered, contradictory Lyari that Aditya Dhar’s recent 'Dhurandhar' turns into cinema. The film revolves around characters that seem to be inspired by gangster Rehman Dakait, police officer Chaudhry Aslam and a shadowy military-intelligence player resembling Ilyas Kashmiri (fictionalised as Major Iqbal). Alongside Pakistani security figures, the narrative hints at a foreign intelligence angle featuring an unnamed “Indian spy chief” — a character with echoes of a former top security official who, in real life, has been involved in covert roles in regional conflicts in Pakistan. These references remain ambiguous on screen, but they mirror real allegations that have circulated for years through local press conferences, dossiers and counterclaims on both sides of the border.Reacting to the controversy around Dhurandhar and the a case file in Delhi high court, Major Mohit Sharma’s brother, Madhur Sharma, said the petition was filed due to ongoing speculation that the film was inspired by the Ashok Chakra awardee’s life without any transparency from the makers. Madhur clarified that the family is not opposed to a film based on Major Sharma, but objected to the possibility of using his story without consent. “We would be proud if a film is made on him. Even in 2021, a film was announced and we supported the producers. He has left a legacy, and it should live on,” he said. The family maintains that they are only seeking clarity and dignity for the officer: “There is no benefit the parents are looking for… If the film is based on him, just say, ‘Sorry ma’am, we didn’t inform you.’ If not, say the hype is untrue.”The Delhi high court heard the plea filed by Major Sharma’s parents seeking a review before the film’s release. While the court did not stay the December 5 release of Dhurandhar, it acknowledged the legitimacy of the family’s concerns regarding similarities to a real-life officer without consent. The court referred the matter to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) for examination, noting the need for regulatory scrutiny before the film proceeds.Following the controversy, director Aditya Dhar issued a clarification on X addressed to the family. He wrote: “Hi, sir - our film Dhurandhar is not based on the life of braveheart Major Mohit Sharma AC(P) SM. This is an official clarification. I assure you, if we do make a biopic on Mohit sir in the future, we will do it with full consent and in complete consultation with the family, and in a way that truly honors his sacrifice for the nation and the legacy it has left for all of us. Jai Hind.”This blurred mix of fact, rumour and state narrative reflects Lyari’s history itself. For more than six decades, the neighbourhood has moved on two parallel tracks. One is a working-class community that powered Karachi’s docks, produced champion boxers and footballers, and remained a loyal base of the Pakistan People's Party ( PPP ). The other is a network of gangs and protection rackets that emerged from the hashish trade of the 1960s and later expanded into narcotics trafficking, extortion, land capture and control of water tankers.Successive governments, including PPP administrations, did not simply fight these groups; at various points they bargained with them, funded them or turned a blind eye. Leaders like Rehman Dakait, and later Uzair Baloch, acted not only as crime bosses but as political intermediaries who ran parallel governance under the banner of the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC), often brandishing PPP flags at their offices. As Taliban networks poured into Karachi in the 2000s and regional intelligence rivalries spilled into the city, Lyari’s gangs were no longer seen merely as enforcers protecting a vote bank — they were gradually treated as potential pieces in a wider security chessboard.With Dhurandhar reigniting attention, this story revisits how Lyari transformed from a labour colony to PPP stronghold to a battleground shaped by gang wars, state patronage, counter-terror operations and allegations of espionage. What emerges is not simply the tale of feared men, but the story of a neighbourhood where poverty, politics and competing security agendas turned everyday life into a prolonged and violent conflict.a long, violent war.Lyari is among the oldest continuously inhabited parts of Karachi and holds a foundational place in the city’s history. Long before Karachi became Pakistan’s financial hub, Lyari evolved as a working-class settlement dominated by Baloch communities who migrated from coastal and interior regions in search of livelihoods. During the 18th and 19th centuries, as the port emerged as the centre of colonial trade, Baloch labourers became indispensable to loading cargo, building roads and supporting maritime activities. This early dependence on manual workers gradually transformed Lyari into a labour colony closely interlinked with Karachi’s industrial and infrastructural growth.Despite its importance in sustaining the city’s economy, the locality remained neglected in terms of urban development. Narrow lanes, dense housing clusters, unreliable utilities and limited state services came to define its daily reality. Yet, Lyari’s social fabric remained strong: sports, community centres and local cultural traditions created a sense of belonging that distinguished it from other Karachi neighbourhoods.In politics, Lyari’s identity further crystallised with the rise of the Pakistan People's Party. Since the 1970s, the PPP’s populist messaging—centred on economic justice and empowerment of marginalised groups—found deep resonance in Lyari. During decades of shifting political power in Karachi, the locality consistently returned PPP candidates to provincial and national assemblies. This loyalty turned Lyari into the party’s most dependable urban stronghold, a constituency where electoral victories were seldom in doubt.Over time, however, this relationship between Lyari and the PPP took a complex turn. As Karachi’s security landscape deteriorated in the 1980s and 1990s, the party increasingly relied on local strongmen, community leaders and later armed groups to maintain influence and protect its vote bank. Patronage networks developed, blurring the lines between politics, street authority and organised crime. What began as a working-class community with a vibrant political identity would eventually become the focal point of Karachi’s most violent gang conflict—one in which loyalty, power and criminality became deeply entangled.The roots of the Lyari gang war go back to the 1960s, when the area emerged as a key node in the local hashish trade. According to both journalistic and academic accounts, early figures like Dad Muhammad (“Dadal”) and his brother Sheru moved into the hashish business in the mid-1960s, challenging the dominance of an older drug boss known as “Kala Nag”.Kala Nag was eventually killed in what was officially described as a police encounter, and the hashish economy fragmented into rival factions. Violence at this stage largely revolved around knives and small arms, with public killings used to send messages and enforce territorial control.In the 1990s, a more educated generation of criminals appeared. One of the most prominent was Iqbal, known locally as “Babu Dacoit”, who reportedly held a Master’s degree in physics. Operating across a wider network, he ran drugs and other rackets while remaining largely beyond the reach of the police. His later arrest, when he was already paralysed, symbolised a shift from small-scale street crime to more organised, networked operations.A major shift in Lyari’s politics and crime landscape came with the ascent of Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch, widely known as Rehman Dakait. Born into a family already linked to smuggling networks, Rehman entered the criminal world at a young age. By the mid-1990s, he had developed a reputation for extreme violence, with local accounts even alleging that he murdered his own mother during a domestic dispute—an unverified but persistent story that reinforced his notoriety.By the early 2000s, Rehman had consolidated control over large parts of Lyari’s illicit economy, including drug trafficking, extortion and gambling rackets. Yet, he also cultivated an image as a benefactor. Oral histories, media reporting and academic studies describe how he funded small clinics, madrassas, football tournaments, neighbourhood parks and schools, using criminal proceeds to build patronage. This dual identity—provider and predator—helped him secure legitimacy among segments of the local population who felt abandoned by the state.Rehman’s rise coincided with Lyari’s continued loyalty to the PPP. As political competition intensified in Karachi, PPP leaders increasingly saw strategic value in a local armed actor who could protect the party’s dominance and mobilise votes. Political alignment, according to multiple accounts, allowed Rehman to operate with greater impunity and helped formalise gang influence under a new name: the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC).Formed around 2008, the PAC presented itself as a community “peace” organisation but functioned as an institutionalised version of Rehman’s operations. It opened offices, appointed local commanders, mediated disputes, collected protection money and distributed welfare. In a context of chronic state neglect, many residents began to rely on the PAC as a parallel administration, making it one of the most powerful non-state authorities Karachi had ever seen.The roots of Lyari’s modern gang war lie in an older conflict shaped by ransom kidnappings, shifting alliances and internal betrayals. In the 1980s and 1990s, parts of Lyari’s criminal economy were dominated by a figure known as Haji Lalu, with another notorious operator, Dadal, working as one of his trusted aides. Disputes over ransom money extorted from wealthy businessmen gradually fractured this relationship. The split laid the foundation for two rival blocs: one centred on Lalu and his son, Arshad Pappu, and the other aligned with Dadal’s family, including his son, Rehman Dakait.The rivalry intensified through the 1990s. Dadal’s murder—widely believed to have been carried out by a competing gang—created a vacuum that Rehman moved to fill, initially with Lalu’s support. But a later dispute over a substantial ransom sum allegedly taken behind Rehman’s back marked the end of that partnership. The fallout turned the former allies into adversaries, cementing a bitter feud between Rehman’s camp and that of Haji Lalu and Arshad Pappu.A separate event subsequently brought an important new actor onto the scene: Uzair Jan Baloch, the son of a transport businessman, Faiz Muhammad, known locally as Mama Faizu. According to both police records and local accounts, Faizu was kidnapped and killed in 2003 by men linked to Arshad Pappu. Uzair initially attempted to seek justice through legal channels but reportedly faced threats and obstruction. Sharing a common enemy in Pappu, he turned instead toward his cousin, Rehman Dakait, joining his organisation.Over the following years, the Rehman–Uzair alliance fought a sustained war against the Pappu–Lalu network. What began as a dispute over illicit profits evolved into a violent cycle of killings, reprisals and territorial battles. By the mid-2000s, the feud had escalated into one of the deadliest urban conflicts in Karachi, with casualties running into the hundreds and paving the way for a new era of militarised gang politics.With the rise of Rehman Dakait and, later, Uzair Baloch, the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC) grew beyond a criminal network and evolved into a parallel governance structure in Lyari. Between roughly 2008 and 2013, researchers describe Lyari as effectively under PAC’s informal administration, with neighbourhood “commanders’’ exercising authority over small jurisdictions. These commanders managed disputes, issued permissions and collected funds in a manner that closely resembled state functions.These overlapping spheres blurred boundaries between state actors and non-state power. PAC offices routinely displayed both their own banners and PPP flags, while police operations in Lyari were often delayed, curtailed or influenced by political pressure. For a period, the PAC did not simply challenge state authority—it partially replaced it.Within Lyari, Rehman Dakait was widely viewed as being closely aligned with senior leaders of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP). Journalistic reporting and local accounts repeatedly describe him as someone who maintained proximity to the Bhutto leadership and attended major PPP political events.A popular narrative in Lyari claims that Rehman “saved” former prime minister Benazir Bhutto during the 18 October 2007 Karsaz attack in Karachi, when two explosions targeted her homecoming procession. In these accounts, Rehman is portrayed as part of an informal security circle that helped her escape following the blast. The story has fuelled his “protector” image and contributed to his Robin Hood-style mystique.However, despite the narrative’s frequency in oral history, there is no independent, verifiable evidence confirming that Rehman personally rescued Benazir or served as her driver or official security guard at any point. What is more clearly documented is the broader political relationship: Lyari’s gangs and the PPP operated in a framework of mutual benefit for years, with the party relying on armed control of the constituency and the gangs receiving political space to operate.After the PPP returned to power in 2008, Rehman publicly rebranded himself as Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch, presenting the Peoples’ Aman Committee as a community organisation rather than a gang body. His growing political visibility, and reported sympathies with certain Baloch nationalist circles, are believed by some analysts and residents to have contributed to his killing in a controversial police “encounter” in 2009.As media scrutiny of Lyari intensified and gang violence spread to other parts of Karachi, state pressure began to mount. At the centre of this response was SSP Chaudhry Aslam Khan, an officer in the Crime Investigation Department (CID) known for aggressive policing tactics. Aslam cultivated a reputation as an “encounter specialist,” targeting both militant groups and organised crime. His public stance against Lyari gangs put him in direct confrontation with Rehman Dakait, who by the mid-2000s had become one of the most influential figures in Karachi’s underworld.Law enforcement records and press reports from the period describe a tense cat-and-mouse dynamic between the two men. Rehman repeatedly evaded capture; in at least two documented incidents, he escaped custody after allegedly bribing police officers. According to local media accounts and later investigations, Rehman paid select CID and jail officials to secure temporary releases or avoid charges, a practice facilitated by weak internal oversight and political protection. These incidents contributed to Aslam’s personal resolve. Journalists covering Karachi’s crime beat recall that Aslam increasingly framed the pursuit of Rehman as a matter of professional and personal credibility for the police force.On 9 August 2009, police announced that Rehman had been killed in a shootout near Steel Town, on Karachi’s outskirts. Officials claimed that Rehman and three accomplices opened fire on police and were killed in retaliatory fire. However, from the outset, rights groups and local residents questioned the official account. Activists, lawyers and researchers later described the killing as a likely extrajudicial execution, consistent with a broader pattern of “encounters” used in Karachi to bypass a slow judicial system and fragile witness protections.With Rehman removed, the gang landscape did not stabilise. Instead, the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC), which he had informally led, underwent a leadership transition. Within weeks, Uzair Jan Baloch was positioned as Rehman’s successor, assuming both the criminal networks and the political connections tied to PPP support. Unlike Rehman, whose authority rested heavily on personality and charisma, Uzair’s tenure was marked by greater bureaucratisation—defined commanders, more formalised extortion systems and deeper conflict with the state. This period would set the stage for some of the bloodiest episodes of the Lyari gang war.After Rehman Dakait’s killing in 2009, leadership of the Lyari network did not pass smoothly to a single successor. Uzair Jan Baloch projected himself as the political head of the organisation: educated, relatively well-spoken, and comfortable appearing alongside PPP leaders. His image contrasted sharply with the operational commander Noor Muhammad, better known as “Baba Ladla”, who had a reputation for ruthlessness built over years as an enforcer in neighbourhood turf battles.Initially, the two worked side by side under the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC) banner. But disagreements over extortion routes, neighbourhood control and access to political patrons gradually turned into open rivalry. Within Lyari, some commanders gravitated toward Uzair’s political authority and alleged links to provincial leadership; others aligned with Baba Ladla’s street power. This divide transformed PAC from a single entity into competing armed factions.The conflict reached its most infamous moment in March 2013, with the killing of rival gangster Arshad Pappu. According to court filings and media reporting, Pappu and his brother Yasir Arafat were abducted from Karachi’s Defence neighbourhood and taken to Lyari. Both were tortured, killed and later mutilated. Their remains were reportedly burned and dumped—widely interpreted as Uzair’s retaliation for the killing of his father, Faiz Muhammad. Some later accounts, including police dossiers and local testimonies, alleged that gang members kicked or played football with severed heads, turning the murders into a grim public spectacle that circulated in local narratives.By this stage, the greatest toll fell on ordinary residents. Prolonged firefights between splinter factions left neighbourhoods barricaded for days. Homes and small businesses were commandeered as torture rooms or lookout posts. Young men were coerced into gang recruitment, teachers and shopkeepers were forced to pay “taxes,” and ambulance workers trying to retrieve bodies were threatened by both sides. In response, the state increasingly turned to large-scale fires, sieges and heavy weaponry, culminating in the militarised crackdowns that would soon follow.In April–May 2012, the Sindh government initiated one of Karachi’s largest security actions against gang networks, later known as Operation Lyari. The police deployed thousands of personnel, armoured carriers and specialised units with the stated goal of clearing the area and arresting key commanders linked to the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC). For the first time, a formal state crackdown directly targeted the network that had operated for years through political patronage and parallel governance.The operation, however, quickly encountered intense resistance. Armed groups used heavy weaponry, including rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), to attack the advancing police. Several armoured personnel carriers were damaged or destroyed, and police units struggled to push through Lyari’s dense alleyways, where snipers and lookout positions gave gang members a tactical advantage. After several days of fighting, rising casualties, and growing criticism from political circles, the operation stalled. It ended without major arrests and was widely perceived as a failure that exposed both the state’s limitations and PAC’s entrenched power.For residents, the consequences were immediate and severe. Lyari was effectively sealed off for about a week, with restricted movement in and out of the neighbourhood. Power and water supplies were disrupted, markets were shut, and families already living under economic strain faced shortages of food and basic essentials. Humanitarian groups and ambulance services reported being blocked or delayed from providing aid, amid police suspicions that relief efforts could serve as a cover to transport weapons or militants.The failed siege deepened mistrust between civilians, gangs and the state. Many residents had already endured years of coercive “taxes” and violence under PAC rule; the security operation then subjected them to collective punishment, indiscriminate fire and deprivation. Instead of restoring confidence, the crackdown reinforced the perception that both the state and the gangs were willing to sacrifice ordinary people to protect their own interests.Even as Lyari’s gang networks fought prolonged turf wars, Karachi was simultaneously becoming a logistical base for militant organisations, particularly factions of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). As security operations intensified in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt, militants sought anonymity in large urban centres. Pashtun-majority neighbourhoods such as Sohrab Goth, Manghopir and SITE became key sanctuaries and transit corridors where fighters, explosives and finances could be moved with relative ease.The turning point came on 8 June 2014, when ten militants launched an armed assault on Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, using automatic weapons, grenades and a rocket launcher. The attack triggered an overnight battle that left at least 36 people dead, including all ten assailants. The incident severely embarrassed federal authorities and exposed vulnerabilities in Karachi’s security infrastructure. The scale of the attack underscored that the city’s violence was no longer just about gangs—it was also linked to national insurgency networks.In the aftermath, the state expanded its response. The federal and provincial governments granted Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) extensive policing and detention powers to target both militants and criminal networks. These operations aligned with ongoing national counterinsurgency campaigns, including Operation Zarb-e-Azb and later Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad, which aimed to dismantle militant networks and disrupt their finances and recruitment pipelines.In Karachi, this translated into a sustained, multi-year crackdown led by the Rangers. Tactical raids, mass arrests, prolonged detentions under special legal provisions and high-profile encounters became common features of urban policing. In Lyari, the result was a shrinking space for gangs to openly control territory. The Peoples’ Aman Committee and splinter factions still operated, but their public influence diminished as armed checkpoints, displays of heavy weaponry and enforced taxation became more difficult to sustain. Although pockets of violence persisted, the crackdown marked the beginning of the end of large, overt gang administrations in the city.One of the most high-profile casualties in the post-2014 security phase was SSP Chaudhry Aslam Khan, the police officer who had led major operations against both Lyari gangs and militant networks. On 9 January 2014, a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into Aslam’s convoy in Karachi, killing him and at least three others. The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility, calling the attack revenge for police operations against its fighters and financiers. Aslam’s death was widely perceived as a serious setback to the city’s counter-terror and anti-gang efforts, though operations continued under other police officers and with greater reliance on Pakistan Rangers (Sindh).For Lyari’s armed groups, the most decisive blow came three years later. Acting on intelligence reports, Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) launched a pre-dawn raid on 2 February 2017 in Phool Patti Lane, Lyari, targeting Noor Muhammad, better known as “Baba Ladla.” According to Rangers’ statements, a gun battle lasting over 30 minutes ensued, during which gang members used automatic weapons and grenades. By the end of the raid, Rangers announced that Baba Ladla and two close associates had been killed.Listed for years among Pakistan’s “most wanted” criminals, Baba Ladla faced cases ranging from murder and extortion to armed attacks on police and suspected collaborations with extremist groups. His death effectively dismantled a key pillar of the Uzair-era structure, removing the most prominent operational commander who had challenged both rivals inside Lyari and the security forces sent to eliminate them.By the mid-2010s, as state pressure intensified and gang structures were fractured by successive operations, Uzair Jan Baloch left Pakistan. In December 2015, Interpol arrested him at Dubai International Airport, reportedly while he was travelling from Muscat. He was subsequently handed over to Pakistani authorities and brought back to Karachi.From 2016 onward, Uzair was charged in dozens of criminal cases, ranging from murder and attempted murder to extortion, kidnapping and terrorism. Many of these cases have since resulted in acquittals due to lack of evidence, hostile witnesses or procedural weaknesses—a pattern that has long characterised Karachi’s organised crime trials, where intimidation makes witness testimony difficult.In April 2017, a new dimension emerged when the Pakistan Army took custody of Uzair to try him under military law. He was accused of espionage and leaking sensitive information to a foreign intelligence agency, reportedly linked to Iran. In April 2020, a military court sentenced him to 12 years in prison on espionage charges, marking a significant shift in how the state officially characterized him—not merely as a gang leader, but as a potential national security threat.Pakistani officials and segments of local media have occasionally linked Uzair’s alleged intelligence connections to the controversial case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Indian national sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court in 2017. One strand of narrative suggests that Uzair’s alleged contacts in Iran overlapped with networks also linked to Jadhav. However, India has rejected Pakistan’s claims in the Jadhav case as coerced and unsubstantiated, and publicly verifiable evidence connecting Uzair directly to operational support for Jadhav remains limited.What is clearer is that, from the perspective of the Pakistani state, Uzair Baloch’s profile evolved from that of a gang leader embedded in local politics to an alleged cross-border security risk—reshaping the narrative around Lyari’s gangs and their significance.As violence worsened and Lyari began drawing national and even international scrutiny, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) gradually shifted its stance on the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC). Between 2012 and 2013, amid pressure from rival parties, security agencies and media coverage, the PPP formally disowned the PAC, despite years of visible proximity.Senior party leaders later framed PAC figures as rogue actors or products of state neglect, arguing that they were not part of a deliberate political strategy. Critics, however—including journalists, residents and some researchers—contend that the PPP benefitted for years from PAC’s armed control of Lyari, only distancing itself once the political and reputational costs became unsustainable.This distancing reflected a broader shift: as the state redefined Lyari’s gangs from political intermediaries to security liabilities, political actors recalibrated their alliances. What had once been an informal partnership built on patronage and vote control became a liability in the age of counterterrorism and international scrutiny.Security indicators suggest that overt gang violence in Lyari has dropped sharply since the mid-2010s. Rangers-led operations, the removal or incarceration of key gang leaders such as Rehman, Uzair and Baba Ladla, and broader counter-terror campaigns have reduced the frequency of armed clashes and targeted killings in the area.The legacy of the Lyari gang war remains unfinished. For many families, the years of kidnappings, torture, blockades and forced recruitment left deep social and economic scars. Questions continue to surround extrajudicial killings, disappearances and the conduct of both the gangs and state agencies tasked with fighting them. Although large armed networks have been dismantled, traces of informal control and low-level criminality persist in new forms.At the same time, Lyari’s cultural and political identity is evolving again. The football grounds, community schools and cultural centres that once defined the neighbourhood are re-emerging, even as residents remain wary of new power brokers. In popular culture, recent portrayals such as Dhurandhar and other planned projects reflect an enduring public fascination with Lyari—its blurred boundaries between criminal groups, political actors and state security agencies, and the unanswered questions they leave behind.Seen in retrospect, the gang war was not merely the story of violent figures in a marginalised settlement. It grew out of structural inequality, weak state institutions and a political party’s reliance on armed intermediaries to protect its vote bank. As militancy and regional intelligence rivalries later intersected with local crime networks, a neighbourhood built from labour and sport became entangled in national security narratives.Lyari today is quieter, but its past continues to shape how residents understand politics, policing and protection. The names of Rehman Dakait, Uzair Baloch, Baba Ladla and Arshad Pappu remain part of local memory—sometimes condemned as criminals, sometimes recalled as flawed protectors, always as evidence of how quickly a working-class community can become a battleground when crime, politics and security policy converge.","Karachi’s Lyari has long been associated with a dual identity. To its residents, it is the ‘mother of Karachi’ – powered by dockworkers, truck drivers, boxers and footballers. To the rest of Pakistan, especially through the 1990s and 2000s, it came to signify something very different: a “mini Brazil” of football- obsessed alleys, heavily armed gangs, and extortion rackets.

'Munir Is A Mentally Unstable Man': Ex-Pakistan PM Imran Khan Blames Army Chief of Fueling Terrorism





Pakistan’s jailed former prime minister Imran Khan on Wednesday launched a sharp attack on the country’s army chief and de-facto ruler Asim Munir , calling him a ""mentally unstable man."" He also claimed that field marshal Munir’s policies were ""disastrous"" for Pakistan and accused him of intentionally ""igniting tensions"" with Afghanistan.The 73-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician shared these remarks on social media a day after his sister, Dr Uzma Khan, met him in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail. The meeting took place after more than a month, following “special permission” from Shehbaz Sharif ’s government, amid widespread rumours on social media about Imran’s health and safety after he was placed in solitary confinement.In a post on X written in Urdu, Khan said, “Asim Munir’s policies are disastrous for Pakistan. Because of his policies, terrorism has spiralled out of control that grieves me deeply.”He further alleged, “Asim Munir has no concern for Pakistan’s national interests. He is doing all this merely to please Western powers. He deliberately ignited tensions with Afghanistan so that he could be seen internationally as a so-called 'mujahid'.”The PTI founder said he had always opposed “drone attacks and military operations against own people in the country which he said would only fuel more terrorism.”He claimed, “Munir first threatened Afghans, then expelled refugees from Pakistan and carried out drone strikes whose consequences we now face in the form of rising terrorism.”Calling Munir a “mentally unstable man,” Khan alleged that the army chief’s “moral bankruptcy has led to the complete collapse of the Constitution and rule of law in Pakistan.”He also accused Munir of being behind the cases against him and his wife, saying they had been “imprisoned in fabricated cases and subjected to the worst form of psychological torture.”Khan described his prison conditions, saying, “I have been kept in complete solitary confinement, locked inside a cell with no contact with a single human being for four weeks. I was kept entirely cut off from the outside world, and even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been taken away from us.”He added that despite court orders, his meetings with political colleagues were stopped, and now even his access to lawyers and family had been cut off. “Pick up any human rights charter, psychological torture is considered 'torture' and is deemed even more severe than physical torture. My sister Noreen Niazi was dragged on the road simply for demanding her legitimate right to meet me,” he said.Khan praised Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi for showing courage during what he called an “environment of repression.” He wrote, “I ask him to continue to play on the front foot. There is no law or Constitution in this country. The law is enforced only against PTI as everyone else is exempt. Those threatening governor’s rule in KP should impose it today rather than tomorrow and then watch what happens to them. ”Speculation about Khan’s health had grown after an undeclared ban was imposed on meeting him. Uzma, after seeing her brother, said his health was “perfectly fine” but he was being subjected to “mental torture in solitary confinement.”“Praise be to Allah! His health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture,” she said.","Imran Khan says Asim Munir's policies are ""disastrous"" for Pakistan. He accuses Munir of intentionally ""igniting tensions"" with Afghanistan.

Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), state media reported on Wednesday.The loss-making airline is being privatised as part of a $7 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) program , which requires the federal government to reform or divest struggling state enterprises. A previous attempt to offload PIA last year was scrapped after the government failed to receive a sufficiently attractive offer.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with corporate entities and company representatives involved in the process, according to a press release shared by state broadcaster PTV News. “PIA’s bidding will take place on December 23, which will be broadcast live on all media. We are ensuring transparency and merit in the privatisation process,” the statement quoted him as saying.Sharif said the process was proceeding “smoothly” and argued that privatisation would help restore the airline’s “lost prestige,” align it with modern aviation requirements and facilitate the restoration of PIA’s global flight operations — a step he said was crucial for overseas Pakistanis.If completed, the transaction would mark Pakistan’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.Founded in October 1946, PIA is based at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, the country’s second-busiest airport and its largest city’s main aviation hub.","Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines.

NEW DELHI: Imran Khan’s sister on Tuesday said the former Pakistan prime minister is “completely fine” and in good health, after she was finally allowed to meet him inside Adiala Jail following weeks of restricted access that had fuelled protests and rumours about his condition.Authorities at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail permitted Imran’s sister Uzma Khanum to meet him on Tuesday, breaking a prolonged period during which family members and PTI leaders were repeatedly denied access. According to Pakistan news outlet Dawn, Uzma entered the prison as several PTI supporters gathered outside demanding transparency on Imran’s health.Following the meeting, PTI USA shared her remarks, quoting her as saying, “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he said that they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this.”AccordingUzma said that Imran Khan was kept in his room throughout the day, allowed only limited time outside, and had no communication with anyone.

There has been absolutely no contact with Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan , which has intensified speculation about his possible death. Demanding access to the PTI founder, party members have decided to stage a protest despite the restrictions imposed by the Pakistan government.Following the PTI workers' announcement of protests outside the Islamabad High Court and Adiala Jail, Section 144 was enforced in both cities. However, the order has not deterred Imran Khan’s supporters. They declared their protest plans even as restrictions have been in place since November 18 for two months.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday declared that the party would stage a major protest outside the Islamabad High Court on Monday, followed by another demonstration outside Adiala Jail on Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference at the CM House, Afridi claimed that Imran Khan, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, has been held in “complete isolation” since November 4, with no one granted access to him.He said that Khan’s sisters, senior party leaders, lawyers, and even doctors have all been barred from meeting him, effectively placing him in total solitary confinement—a situation he described as “extremely alarming.”PTI leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan. After KP CM Afridi ordered the party members to immediately move to Islamabad, the party has also asked the supporters to gather outside the Adiala Jail later.Talking to reporters, Afridi said that on Tuesday, all parliamentarians would first gather at the IHC to stage a strong protest before the court’s chief justice, noting that despite judicial orders, he himself was not allowed to meet Khan.“This is blatant contempt of court. We will hold a protest at the IHC,” Afridi asserted.He said the parliamentarians would then move to Adiala Jail to attempt to meet Khan and to express solidarity with his sisters.Following the announcement of protests, the Rawalpindi deputy commissioner's office issued the notice on Monday that Section 144 shall be imposed in the city from December 1 to December 3. According to the notice, the order has been enforced on the basis of “imminent threats” identified by the district intelligence committee (DIC), particularly in and around sensitive installations, major roads and other critical infrastructure. The committee’s assessment underpinned the local government’s decision to restrict public gatherings during this period.The Rawalpindi notification prohibits all kinds of gatherings of more than five people. As per the statement, ""All kinds of Assemblies, Gatherings, Sits-in, Rallies, Processions, Demonstrations, Jalsas, Dharnas, Protests and such like other activities, i.e gathering of 05 or more persons.""""Carrying of weapons, spikes, laden batons, gaulails, ball bearings, petrol bombs, improvised explosives or any other instrument that could potentially be used for violence,"" is also listed as one of the restrictions in the notice.Along with these, pillion riding and the use of loudspeakers or display of ""arms and hatred speeches"" are also prohibited.The Islamabad district magistrate’s office issued the order after what it described as “certain segments of society … planning to organise unlawful assemblies … within the jurisdiction of Islamabad Capital Territory,” according to a report in Dawn. The announcement in Rawalpindi came through a notification from the deputy commissioner’s office, which cited security concerns due to potential large gatherings.In Islamabad, the order did not define what would constitute an “unlawful assembly” but noted that authorities deemed it “necessary to control such types of illegal activities which present a threat to public peace, tranquillity and maintenance of law & order.”Pakistan’s former Prime Minister has remained completely out of sight for more than six weeks, with neither his party members nor his family able to establish any direct contact during this period. His prolonged absence from public view has intensified anxiety across the country, fuelling widespread speculation and deepening fears about his safety.The lack of verified updates or appearances has further heightened concerns, with many questioning whether the politician-turned-cricketer may have become the target of a possible assassination attempt or is otherwise being kept in undisclosed conditions.Khan’s sons fear authorities may be hiding “something irreversible” about his condition. His son, Kasim Khan, told Reuters that the family has had no direct or verifiable contact with the jailed former Prime Minister, despite a court order allowing weekly meetings.“Not knowing whether your father is safe, harmed, or even alive is psychological torture,” he said, noting that there has been no independently confirmed communication for months.“We have no reliable information about his condition,” he added. “Our deepest fear is that something irreversible is being kept from us.”Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, filed a contempt of court petition in the IHC on November 28 against the Adiala Jail superintendent and other officials, alleging they prevented her from meeting her brother.Submitting the petition in the presence of Chief Minister Afridi, she cited the IHC’s March 24 order, which had restored a twice-weekly visitation schedule for the 73-year-old former prime minister.Pakistan government officials have rejected rumours that Imran Khan has died in custody or been quietly moved out of Adiala Jail, insisting he remains inside the Rawalpindi facility and is in stable condition.“There is no truth to claims of his transfer from Adiala Jail. He is in good health and receiving full medical care,” Geo News quoted Rawalpindi prison officials as saying.Imran Khan is currently being held in Adiala Jail, where a court first handed him a three-year prison term in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Since then, successive corruption convictions have pushed his total sentence to 14 years, the longest jail term imposed on him so far.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan.

In a first, the Baloch Liberation Front (BLF) used a woman fidayeen operative to storm a heavily-guarded complex belonging to the Frontier Corps and housing a Chinese copper and gold mining project center located in Chagai, Balochistan. Six Pak personnel were reportedly killed in Sunday evening’s attack but there was no official word from the Pak authorities.The BLF also released the photo of the bomber, Zareena Rafiq aka Trang Mahoo, who detonated herself at the barrier to allow the rebel fighters to breach the main compound. The attack is significant because it is the first time the BLF has used a suicide bomber, a tactic exclusive to Majeed Brigade of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) which has carried out a series of attacks including the Jaffar Express hijack in the region.The fact that the complex was linked to the Saindak and Reko Diq projects, managed by Chinese companies and a Canadian firm, indicates the change in rebels’ strategy to strike high-value assets with geopolitical significance, sources said. In a statement released on Telegram, the BLF spokesperson Gwahram Baloch said that the Fidayeen operation was carried out by its ‘selfsacrifice’ unit, Saddo Operational Battalion (SOB), named after Martyred Commander Waja Sado aka Sadath Marri.Meanwhile the BLA released a statement on the wave of coordinated attacks carried out at multiple locations between Nov 28-29, claiming 27 Pak army personnel were killed in 29 attacks. The BLA also said it had taken control of motorways and seized weapons.BLA fighters struck the Pakistani army’s Coast Guard camp in the Pasni area of Gwadar with multiple grenade launchers. They targeted military intelligence personnel in the Jiwani area of Gwadar with a remote-controlled IED attack while they were returning after extorting money from vehicles, the BLA said. Another attack was on the residence of a Pakistani army major in Mastung city.Six blasts were reported at defence installations in Quetta as well.

Pakistan Rages At UN After Criticism Of Munir’s Immunity Amendment Amid Fears Of Deeper Militarism

Also Read |





Author and National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) member Tilak Devasher claimed that Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is “intentionally” staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).Created through the 27th amendment to Pakistan’s constitution, the post is set to be assumed by Field Marshal Asim Munir, potentially making him the most powerful army chief in the country’s history.Speaking to ANI, Devasher highlighted that Sharif left for Bahrain and then London, leading to speculation that he's ""deliberately"" staying away to avoid issuing the notification.“Very smartly, the Pakistan PM went to Bahrain and then to London. He clearly does not want to issue the notification giving Asim Munir five years as army chief and as Chief of Defence Forces. He seems to believe that by staying away and avoiding signing the notification, he can escape the consequences,” said Devasher, author of four books on Pakistan.The comment comes after Sharif’s government failed to issue the required notification appointing Munir as the first-ever CDF by the November 29 deadline—the day his original three-year term as army chief ended.With the creation of the CDF post, the office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee has formally been abolished.Devasher added that Pakistan is currently navigating a “very messy” situation.“If it turns out that he (Asim Munir) is no longer the army chief, then Pakistan finds itself without an army chief, and even the nuclear command authority—meant to fall under the new Strategic Forces Command—is effectively leaderless. It’s an extremely strange situation,” he remarked.Legal experts remain divided over whether the notification is necessary. Under the amended Constitution, the Chief of Army Staff’s term is meant to run concurrently with the CDF, lasting five years.Some analysts, however, argue that the issue may already be addressed by the Pakistan Army Act’s 2024 amendment, which extended the tenure of service chiefs to five years, according to Dawn. The amendment includes a “deeming” clause stating it “shall always be deemed to have been part of the Pakistan Army Act,” implying that Munir’s current term could automatically extend from three to five years without any additional notification.Devasher, however, called this interpretation “controversial,” questioning the view that a notification may not be required.“Some people argue that the Army Act was amended in 2004, setting the army chief’s tenure at five years. Since he has already served three, he supposedly has another two years remaining. From this perspective, no new notification would be required. This is controversial, and it’s unclear how the judiciary or the government will view it. But the fact remains that it makes his position very tenuous,” Devasher said.He also pointed to what he described as political manoeuvring within the military. “There are reports that other generals are now jostling for the position of army chief or for the two newly created four-star posts,” he stated.Devasher added that Prime Minister Sharif’s absence is only deepening the uncertainty. “But this situation cannot continue,” he warned. “A nuclear-armed country cannot function without a Chief of the Army Staff or someone in charge of the nuclear command authority.”","Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is ""intentionally"" staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces.

Pakistan Army General Warns Of Hybrid-To-Full War As Pakistan Reshapes Military Power Under Munir





Fresh violence broke out in Pakistan after a suicide bomber detonated himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan, sparking an intense exchange of fire and a major security response, Dawn reported.The attack, claimed to be the work of militants described by officials as Fitna-al-Khawarij — the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — triggered a swift retaliatory operation in which three attackers were killed.According to FC Balochistan South, the assault began when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance, allowing several armed militants to force their way into the compound. Security personnel from the quick response force immediately engaged the attackers, with heavy gunfire reported from the area. Officials said at least six gunmen were believed to have entered the headquarters, prompting a full-scale clearance operation that continued through the day.In a statement, the FC spokesperson said troops were determined to neutralise the remaining threat, adding that the “last of the terrorists will also be” dealt with.Local reports described sustained firing inside the headquarters as forces worked room-to-room to secure the facility.The incident comes just days after a similar assault on an FC compound in the northwestern city of Peshawar, where gunmen and two suicide bombers stormed a paramilitary headquarters, killing three people. Police had said the first bomber detonated at the main entrance while the second entered the compound, forcing law enforcement to cordon off the busy FC Chowk area amid multiple explosions.These attacks form part of a broader escalation in militant violence this year. Earlier attacks in Quetta — including a deadly car bomb outside a paramilitary base and a suicide blast at a political rally — have added to growing instability in Balochistan. The province has endured a long-running insurgency, with hundreds of security personnel killed in 2024 alone, alongside attacks claimed by separatist groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army.","Suicide bomber detonates himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan.

Pakistan Army General Warns Of Hybrid-To-Full War As Pakistan Reshapes Military Power Under Munir





At least seven explosions were reported in Pakistan’s Balochistan province over the past 24 hours, with suspected insurgents targeting sites in Quetta and Dera Murad Jamali. No casualties were reported, although two security guards with a construction company were injured in the attacks.The incidents triggered fear and panic in the provincial capital.On Saturday, insurgents hurled hand grenades at a police checkpoint in Quetta, followed by the detonation of an IED near an Anti-Terrorism Department vehicle. Three additional explosions took place later in the evening, as cited by PTI.Senior Superintendent of Police Asif Khan said the blast near Lohr Karez, on the outskirts of Quetta, damaged the main line connecting the city with other parts of the country.SSP Khan said the attackers had planted IEDs on a railway track and detonated them as a train was scheduled to arrive at Quetta station. The blast damaged the track and forced the suspension of rail services.Khan added that armed men also attacked a construction company site on Quetta’s Sariab Road with hand grenades, damaging machinery and injuring two security guards. In another incident, motorcycle-borne insurgents hurled two hand grenades at the Manzoor Shaheed police station, one of which exploded while the other was defused by a bomb disposal squad.In Dera Murad Jamali, a patrolling police vehicle was targeted with hand grenades.Attackers also threw hand grenades in the Kech Beg area near a police patrol post in Quetta.No group immediately claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attacks, but insurgent activity resumed on Sunday morning.Earlier this year, at least ten people were killed and several others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside the paramilitary headquarters in Quetta.On September 3, a suicide bombing at a political rally in the city killed 11 people and wounded more than 40, targeting a stadium parking area where hundreds of Balochistan National Party supporters had gathered.Pakistani forces continue to battle a longstanding insurgency in Balochistan, which has claimed 782 lives in 2024. In March, the Baloch Liberation Army hijacked a train and killed off-duty troops. Since January, more than 430 people, most of them security personnel, have been killed in various attacks, including six soldiers in Bannu.","At least seven explosions reported in Pakistan's Balochistan province over the past 24 hours.

Brazening it out, Pakistan on Sunday dismissed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk’s concerns over the country’s recent 27th constitutional amendment, urging him to avoid remarks that reflect “political bias and misinformation. ”“Like all parliamentary democracies, all legislation as well as any amendment to the constitution remain the exclusive domain of the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan. While Pakistan gives due importance to the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the statement issued,” the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement.The FO added that Pakistan remains “fully committed to protecting, promoting and upholding human rights, human dignity, basic freedoms and the rule of law as enshrined in the constitution”.“It is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the remarks. We urge the High Commissioner to respect the sovereign decisions of Pakistan's parliament and avoid commentary that reflects political bias and misinformation,"" it stated.In a statement on Friday, Türk criticised Islamabad for adopting the amendment without “broad consultation” with legal experts and civil society, warning that the “hastily adopted” changes could undermine judicial independence and raise questions about military accountability.The 27th amendment has stirred intense political debate within the neighbouring nation. On November 12, a joint parliamentary committee of the Senate and National Assembly approved the bill , prompting the opposition to warn that the government was sounding “the death knell for the Supreme Court”.The amendment alters Article 243 by abolishing the post of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and replacing it with a new Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). It also proposes establishing a Federal Constitutional Court and reducing certain powers of the Supreme Court.The first CDF will be Asim Munir, the Pakistan Army chief who was “promoted” to the five-star Field Marshal rank following the conflict with India in May.According to Dawn, the Pakistan government is yet to notify the appointment of the CDF, even as the office of the CJCSC formally ended on Thursday.",Pakistan dismisses UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk's concerns over the country’s recent 27th constitutional amendment.

Afghanistan FM Muttaqi Defends India Ties, Slams Pakistan Over Deoband Row And Shifting Accusations





Four civilians and a soldier were killed in overnight shelling and gunfire along the Pakistan–Afghanistan border, Afghan officials said on Saturday, marking the latest outbreak of violence between the two countries despite a ceasefire agreement reached after deadly clashes in October.Five other civilians were wounded on the Afghan side, government spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat said in a video statement. A hospital in the Pakistani town of Chaman reported three people with minor injuries following the exchange.Both sides accused each other of firing first near the busy Chaman–Spin Boldak crossing in southern Afghanistan. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on X that Pakistan “started attacking Afghanistan in Kandahar, Spin Boldak district, and the forces of the Islamic Emirate were forced to respond.” Pakistan prime minister’s spokesman Mosharraf Zaidi alleged that “the Afghan Taliban regime resorted to unprovoked firing” along the border.Local Afghan officials said “light and heavy artillery” was used, with mortar shells striking civilian homes. Residents told AFP that firing began around 10:30 pm and escalated rapidly. One resident described mortars hitting houses after tank fire, while another said his brother was killed when trying to reach a different room during the shelling.People on the Pakistan side said families took shelter indoors as mortar rounds landed near homes.Tensions have surged since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, with Islamabad accusing Kabul of harbouring militant groups, including the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), responsible for attacks inside Pakistan. Kabul denies the allegations. More than 70 people were killed in October clashes before Qatar and Turkey brokered a ceasefire. Talks in Doha and Istanbul since then have failed to produce a lasting settlement, and the border remains closed.Pakistan recently announced it would partially reopen the frontier at Chaman for United Nations aid deliveries. Pakistan’s spokesman Zaidi told AFP the latest clash would “have no impact on that decision,” adding that humanitarian access would continue separately.","Four civilians and a soldier were killed in overnight shelling and gunfire along the Pakistan–Afghanistan border.

A medical board overseeing critically ill former Bangladesh prime minister Khaleda Zia has determined to send her to London for specialist treatment, according to her personal physician AZM Zahid Hossain.According to PTI, Zia, aged 80 and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson, is scheduled for transfer via air ambulance to London either late Thursday night or early Friday. Her elder son and acting BNP chief Tarique Rahman resides in London.Following a chest infection affecting her heart and lungs, Zia was hospitalised on November 23. She was moved to the coronary care unit (CCU) four days later due to deteriorating health complications.""The medical board has unanimously decided that she will be taken to London via the Qatar Royal Air Ambulance, either after midnight tonight or early tomorrow morning,"" Hossain announced outside the hospital.Whilst Hossain, a BNP standing committee member, refrained from detailed comments about Zia's current condition.At Tuesday's briefing, he had noted her positive response to treatment. The decision for urgent transfer was made by an expanded medical board, including recently arrived specialists from China and the United Kingdom.The BNP released a list of 14 accompanying individuals, including Syeda Shameela Rahman, widow of Zia's younger son Arafat Rahman, six doctors, party adviser Enamul Haque Chowdhury, two Special Security Force (SSF) agents from Muhammad Yunus' interim government, and personal assistants.Qatar offered their air ambulance service whilst military and air force helicopters conducted rooftop landing tests at the hospital. A helicopter transfer is expected from hospital to airport.A Chinese medical team of four specialists arrived Wednesday night, joining a UK medical group led by Dr Richard Buell. This marked the second Chinese delegation, following an advance team's arrival on December 1.Interim government leader Muhammad Yunus visited Wednesday, following visits from military service chiefs. Family members present include her younger brother Shamim Iskandar, his wife Kaniz Fatema, and Sharmila Rahman.Tarique Rahman wrote on Facebook: ""In this time of crisis, like any child, I too long for the comforting touch of my mother.""""But unlike others, to make a unilateral decision in this regard is not in my hands alone nor solely within my control. The sensitivity of this matter also limits the scope for detailed explanation,"" he stated.Rahman has resided in London since 2008, previously facing various legal charges. In 2024, Yunus' government withdrew these cases, with courts issuing revised acquittals.Government advisers have assured his safe return. Foreign adviser Touhid Hossain confirmed readiness to process travel documents, though no requests had been received through Wednesday evening.Nationwide prayer gatherings are being held across Bangladesh, including Dhaka, Jhenaidah, Sunamganj, Bagerhat, Cumilla, Chuadanga and Munshiganj, for Zia's recovery.","Former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia to be flown to London for specialist treatment.

IMD Issues Red Alert as Cyclone Ditwah Approaches TN; Sri Lanka Deaths Exceed 80

Thousands trapped, isolated

Early warnings wasted

Rescue teams stretched 'beyond capacity'



Opposition blames government for loss of life



Too few alerts in Tamil language







Days after Cyclone Ditwah tore through Sri Lanka, over 1.46 million people across all 25 of the nation's districts remain affected by the island's worst flooding disaster in two decades.According to the government's Disaster Management Center, the official death toll stands at 410, with 336 people still missing. More than 64,000 people from 407,000 affected families are sheltering in nearly 1,450 government-run safety centers across the country.Multiple countries have responded to Sri Lanka's appeal for assistance with India leading the charge, followed by pledges from the UK, China, Australia, and Nepal. Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has also declared a state of emergency to deal with the aftermath of the cyclone.Despite his declaration and the promise of international aid, however, the Sri Lankan public seems increasingly frustrated with the state's response. Authorities appear to be overwhelmed with rescue demands and are struggling to communicate in a timely manner as critics point out the absence of a unified relief-and-rescue system.Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Colombo-based Centre for Policy Alternatives, accuses the Sri Lankan government of failing to heed warning signals and allowing the calamity to spiral beyond human control.""The government has not come off well in its handling of the crisis and should have called Parliament to convene urgently to review and strengthen disaster management policies,"" Saravanamuttu told DW.According to Saravanamuttu, ""this disaster reveals significant gaps in preparedness and response mechanisms"" and the existing frameworks need to be evaluated to ""prevent future failures.""While Ditwah made landfall in Sri Lanka on November 28, some voices point out that warning signals were present as early as two weeks before. Experts say that the loss of life was exacerbated by the government's failure to act in a timely manner.""Unlike tsunamis, hydrometeorological hazards like cyclones arrive with sufficient notice of several days to take precautions. As early as November 12, Sri Lanka's department of meteorology had publicly flagged the prospect of extreme rainfall later in the month. That should have triggered a process of preparations across the government at central, provincial, and local levels,"" Nalaka Gunawardene, a science writer from Colombo, told DW.""Apparently, that did not happen, and an official response has mostly been reactive when Cyclone Ditwah was imminent or after it made landfall,"" added Gunawardene.""The entire disaster management structure – from policymakers to state officials – should be held accountable for cascading failures that made a bad disaster much worse.""Kishali Pinto-Jayawardena, a public interest advocate and legal columnist, agrees that the aftermath is ""particularly horrendous as the deadly impact of the cyclone was not realized until it was far too late.""She told DW that the governments should have ""the ability and the competence to take critical decisions"" in times of emergency.""Sentimental outpouring by politicians lauding the people for 'coming together' in times of crisis does not substitute for that duty,"" she added.Sivanathan Navindra, a former Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) member, who has been involved in political activities post-conflict, said the cyclone has damaged roads and communication lines in northern Sri Lanka.""The situation in northern Mannar, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya, and Kilinochchi districts is extremely severe. Mullaitivu has experienced a total power outage with telecommunication towers down, leaving residents without phone or internet access,"" Navindra told DW from Jaffna.""Road closures have effectively cut off the northern province, with travel between Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi and Jaffna impossible,"" he said.Chathuranga Abeysinghe, deputy minister of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development, warned that rising water levels will make evacuation ""extremely difficult."" He urged residents along the Kelaniya River and flood-prone areas to leave.""There have been immense hardships caused by Cyclone Ditwah, but the president has constituted task forces to study the impact and organize relief. It will take a while for rebuilding,"" Abeysinghe told DW.""We had initial difficulty in predicting the cyclone's course"" Abeysinghe said, noting that significant rainfall expected was many different areas which ""stretched rescue teams beyond capacity to reach everyone in need.""Abeysinghe also pointed out that the government was working on a war-footing to reach vulnerable populations that had been cut off.Government critics, however, remain unconvinced by the official narrative. Opposition party Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) recently pledged to launch legal action against the government.SJB lawmaker and spokesperson S M Marikkar compared the severity of the disaster to the Easter Sunday suicide attacks which killed nearly 270 people in 2019, and the more recent economic collapse under the powerful Rajapaksa family.""Similar to the criminal case filed against the Rajapaksas for bankrupting the nation, we will file a case against the current government, as they are responsible for every citizen that died in the disaster,"" Marikkar told the media on Monday.Despite some relief materials being delivered and emergency teams arriving to certain affected locations, many communities still lack clarity on when full help will arrive and when normalcy can be restored. A notable communication obstacle, according to Colombo-based disinformation expert and analyst Sanjana Hattotuwa, is the choice of languages officials use for disaster communications.The nation recognizes both the majority language of Sinhala and the smaller Tamil language as official, with English — a remnant of the British colonial period — also spoken to varying degrees by nearly a quarter of its population.""My research showed key updates were in Sinhala only, and sometimes mirrored in English, but rarely, if ever in Tamil. State television and radio did not communicate the risks, and threats, mirroring what was evident on social media,"" Hattotuwa told DW.""This contributed to [an] information vacuum in critical hours, impacting preparedness and community responses,"" he said. ""If information was available in a more effective and timely manner, lives now lost may have been saved.""","Cyclone Ditwah has left over 1.46 million people in Sri Lanka affected by flooding.

Bangladesh Seeks Hasina’s Extradition After Death Verdict As India Weighs Options | Watch

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday permitted the entry of a pregnant woman and her eight-year-old child into India on “humanitarian grounds,” months after the pair had been pushed into Bangladesh.The top court was hearing the Centre’s challenge to the Calcutta High Court’s September 26 order, which struck down the government’s move to deport Sunali Khatun, Sweety Bibi and their families to Bangladesh after labelling them “illegal immigrants.”A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi directed the West Bengal government to look after the minor and instructed the Birbhum district chief medical officer to ensure full medical support for Khatun, including a free delivery.The bench noted solicitor general Tushar Mehta’s statement that the competent authority had agreed to allow the woman and her child into India purely on humanitarian grounds, without affecting any rights or claims, and that they would be kept under “surveillance.”This followed the Supreme Court’s December 1 direction asking the Centre to consider permitting their entry, also on the condition that they remain under “surveillance.”The Supreme Court had earlier asked Mehta to seek instructions on permitting Khatun, who is in an advanced stage of pregnancy, to enter India through the India–Bangladesh border at Malda in West Bengal.The woman’s father said the family had lived as daily-wage workers in Delhi’s Rohini Sector 26 for more than two decades when police detained them on June 18 on suspicion of being Bangladeshi nationals.Sunali, her husband, Danish Sekh and their son were later taken into custody and, on June 27, were deported to Bangladesh.Also read: ‘Night at thana’: Was very scared, couldn’t sleep one bit, says Sunali During the hearing, the bench noted that the woman and her eight-year-old child, allowed to re-enter India, would ultimately be brought back to Delhi, from where they were picked up and pushed across the border in June, as cited by PTI.However, senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Sanjay Hegde, appearing for Khatun’s father, urged the court to direct that she be taken instead to her home district of Birbhum in West Bengal, where her family resides. They also informed the bench that others, including Khatun’s husband, remained in Bangladesh and sought directions for their return as well, subject to instructions from the Centre.Mehta maintained that he would challenge their claim of Indian citizenship, insisting the family were Bangladeshi nationals and that the government’s decision to admit the woman and her child was purely on humanitarian grounds.Justice Joymalya Bagchi observed that if Khatun could establish that she is the daughter of Bhodu Sheikh, it would be sufficient to prove her Indian citizenship.The court has listed the matter for further hearing on December 10.As per a May 2, 2025, memo issued by the union home ministry, Bangladesh and Myanmar nationals found residing illegally in any state or Union territory will first be subject to an inquiry by the respective state or UT government, after which the deportation process will be initiated.","The Supreme Court on Wednesday permitted the entry of a pregnant woman and her eight-year-old child into India on ""humanitarian grounds"" The top court was hearing the Centre's challenge to the Calcutta High Court's September 26 order, which struck down the government's move to deport them.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125738725,imgsize-1379982,width-400,resizemode-4/ani-file-photo.jpg"

Sheikh Hasina, UK MP Tulip Siddiq Convicted in Corruption Case, Raising Concerns Over Fair Trials





Bangladesh’s former prime minister Sheikh Hasina , her sister Sheikh Rehana and Hasina’s niece and British MP Tulip Siddiq were on Monday sentenced to different terms of imprisonment for ‘irregularities’ in allocation of plots under the Purbachal New Town project.Judge Rabiul Alam of Dhaka Special Judge Court-4 pronounced the verdict. Hasina, already sentenced to death for crimes against humanity, was handed five years’ imprisonment, while Rehana got seven years and Tulip Siddiq two years of jail.The court found Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, guilty of misusing her “special influence” as a British politician to coerce Hasina into giving valuable pieces of land to her mother and siblings.Bangladesh does not have an extradition treaty with the United Kingdom (UK), and it is unlikely Siddiq will serve the sentence. The Labour party said it was not recognising the corruption judgment against Siddiq because she was denied the opportunity to a fair legal process in the case.Siddiq had denied the charges, claiming that much of the evidence being presented by prosecutors was forged. She had been put on trial as a Bangladeshi citizen, with a passport and tax ID, even though she said she had not held a Bangladeshi passport since childhood and had never paid taxes there.Siddiq said, “This whole process has been flawed and farcical from the beginning to the end.” “The outcome of this kangaroo court is as predictable as it is unjustified. I hope this so-called ‘verdict’ will be treated with the contempt it deserves. My focus has always been my constituents in Hampstead and Highgate, and I refuse to be distracted by politics of Bangladesh,” the Guardian quoted her as saying.","Sheikh Hasina, UK MP Tulip Siddiq Convicted in Corruption Case, Raising Concerns Over Fair Trials.

Sheikh Hasina, UK MP Tulip Siddiq Convicted in Corruption Case, Raising Concerns Over Fair Trials





All 17 convicts were fined Tk 1 lakh each, with an additional six months in jail if fines remain unpaid, the state-run BSS news agency reported. The court also imposed a fine of $813 each on Hasina, Rehana, and Siddiq, and ordered the cancellation of the plot allotted to Rehana.According to The Dhaka Tribune, the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) filed six separate cases between January 12 and 14 over alleged irregularities in the allocation of plots under the Purbachal project. The ACC alleged that Hasina, in collusion with senior Rajuk officials, unlawfully secured six plots, each measuring 10 kathas (7,200 sq ft), in the diplomatic zone of Sector 27 for herself, her children Joy and Putul, sister Rehana, niece Siddiq, and other relatives, despite being ineligible under existing regulations. Charges were framed against 29 people, including Hasina’s children Sajeeb Wazed Joy and Saima Wazed Putul, as part of multiple cases filed in January 2025.Tulip Siddiq, who represents Hampstead and Highgate in Britain’s Parliament, had previously denied the allegations, calling the trial “a farce built on ‘fabricated accusations and driven by a clear political vendetta’.” In January, she resigned as economic secretary to the Treasury in Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Cabinet, saying she had been cleared of wrongdoing but stepped down because the issue was becoming “a distraction from the work of the government,” AP quoted.This verdict is one among several against Hasina. Earlier this month, a separate Dhaka court sentenced her to 21 years in jail across three corruption cases over the same Purbachal project, with consecutive seven-year terms and fines of Tk 1 lakh per case. Joy and Putul were also sentenced to five years each in related cases, Dhaka Tribune reported. Mass protests toppled Hasina’s Awami League regime on August 5, 2024, ending her rule after which she took refuge in India. She had earlier been declared a fugitive by a Bangladeshi court. She was also sentenced to death in absentia in November for her role in the violent crackdown on student-led protests, termed the “July Uprising”, and had previously been declared a fugitive.Bangladesh’s foreign affairs adviser Mohammad Touhid Hossain said the interim government expects India to consider Hasina’s extradition “at the earliest possible time,” now that judicial proceedings against her are complete.The country is currently run by an interim government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, which has announced that the next parliamentary elections will be held in February.","All 17 convicts were fined Tk 1 lakh each, with an additional six months in jail if fines remain unpaid.

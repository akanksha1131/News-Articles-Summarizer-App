'Could have done better': Andrew Cuomo apologizes to Jewish New Yorkers for Covid-19 lockdown rules; 'those decisions caused pain',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/could-have-done-better-andrew-cuomo-apologizes-to-jewish-new-yorkers-for-covid-19-lockdown-rules-those-decisions-caused-pain/articleshow/124268057.cms,"Andrew Cuomo (AP)





Former Governor Andrew Cuomo has issued an apology to Jewish New Yorkers for the Covid-19 lockdown measures he implemented five years ago, which prohibited large gatherings, closed schools, and disrupted religious observances.The apology comes hours before Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, and as Cuomo seeks a political comeback with a mayoral bid.In the video, Cuomo stated that his decisions were aimed at safeguarding the health and safety of New Yorkers during the unprecedented pandemic that claimed roughly 80,000 lives.“However, I recognize some of those decisions caused pain in the Jewish community because we did not always fully consider the sensitivities and traditions that are so deeply important,” Cuomo said in the video, as reported by the New York Post.“We could have done better and for that I’m truly sorry,” he said. “My decision doesn’t change the impact. I sincerely ask for your understanding.”The lockdowns, intended to curb the spread of the highly contagious virus, faced criticism from residents in Brooklyn and Queens’ ultra-Orthodox communities.Orthodox groups perceived the restrictions as disproportionately affecting their communities.Despite this, Jewish political groups, primarily representing Orthodox communities, endorsed Cuomo for mayor on Tuesday, just two days after incumbent Eric Adams withdrew from the race.Community groups and local leaders jointly announced their support for Cuomo, stating, “we believe it is essential to speak with one voice at this critical time,” as reported by the Times of Israel.The statement added, “we are deeply concerned about the direction that mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani would take our city,” citing Mamdani’s comments on policing, his past endorsement of the phrase “globalize the intifada,” and his “socialist policies that we believe would create chaos” and endanger their communities.","Former Governor Andrew Cuomo has issued an apology to Jewish New Yorkers for the Covid-19 lockdown measures he implemented five years ago.

US Government shutdown: Will the Statue of Liberty go dark? Here’s what’s happening,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-government-shutdown-will-the-statue-of-liberty-go-dark-heres-whats-happening/articleshow/124267754.cms,"



The United States government officially shut down at 12.01 am Wednesday (October 1), leaving citizens with a lot of questions, including whether the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island will be open or not.And the answer is yes, both of them will be open during the partial government shutdown, the Department of the Interior announced on Wednesday, following New York Governor Kathy Hochul's refusal to provide state assistance.“Thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump both Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty remain open for the enjoyment of the American people,” a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior told The New York Post.Ahead of the shutdown, Hochul declined to allocate state funds to maintain operations at the Statue of Liberty. “If Lady Liberty’s iconic torch goes dark, it will be thanks to the Washington Republicans who refused common sense and abandoned the people they were elected to represent,” Hochul said in a statement to The New York Post hours before federal funding expired for the first time since the 35-day shutdown in December 2018 and January 2019.During that previous shutdown, then-Governor Andrew Cuomo utilised state resources to keep the landmark, managed by the National Parks Service, open. “As we’ve done before when Washington’s dysfunction has shut down the govt, New York will step up and ensure the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island remain open for the world to look to for strength and hope during this tumultuous time,” Cuomo, a Democrat, said at that time.Over 3.7 million people visited the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island last year, according to the National Park Service. The complex employs 88 permanent employees, 28 seasonal employees and 80 United States Park Police personnel.","The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island will be open during the partial government shutdown.

US government shutdown: Trump administration freezes $26 billion for Democratic states- Details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-government-shutdown-trump-administration-freezes-26-billion-for-democratic-states-details/articleshow/124267709.cms,"



US President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday froze $26 billion for Democratic-leaning states, following through on a threat to use the government shutdown to target Democratic priorities, Reuters reported.The targeted programmes included $18 billion for transit projects in New York, home to Congress's top two Democrats, and $8 billion for green-energy projects in 16 Democratic-run states, including California and Illinois.In a post on X, Vought wrote: “Roughly $18 billion in New York City infrastructure projects have been put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles.”DEI refers to diversity, equity and inclusion policies, which have come under scrutiny by the Trump administration.The funding freeze affects major infrastructure projects such as the Gateway project, a $16 billion effort to build a second rail tunnel under the Hudson River, and the Second Avenue Subway expansion along Manhattan’s East Side. The Hudson River tunnel, long delayed, is designed to ease congestion on the century-old tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey, which carries hundreds of thousands of passengers daily and is crucial for East Coast travel between Boston and Washington.The Trump administration blamed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both from New York City, for the shutdown.Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance signaled that the administration could expand its freeze on federal employees if the shutdown continues for several days.The moves made clear that Trump would carry out his threat to take advantage of the shutdown to punish his political opponents and extend his control over the $7 trillion federal budget, established by the U.S. Constitution as the domain of Congress.","$18 billion for transit projects in New York, home to Congress's top two Democrats. $8 billion for green-energy projects in 16 Democratic-run states.

Global oil market influence



Understanding how UAE fuel prices are set

Tips to save on fuel in 2025





The UAE Fuel Price Committee has announced the fuel prices for October 2025, reflecting a slight increase across all fuel types compared to September. These adjustments align with global oil market trends and are part of the UAE's monthly review process to keep domestic fuel prices in line with international rates.These price changes are determined based on the average global price of oil and are applicable across all Emirates, including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and others. The UAE's approach to fuel pricing ensures that residents and businesses experience consistent and transparent fuel costs. For people commuting daily to work, school, or errands, the small price hike may feel noticeable at the pump. Middle-class and lower-income residents can manage costs by:The recent increase in UAE fuel prices for October 2025 is closely linked to trends in the global oil market, which plays a major role in determining local fuel costs. Factors such as international supply and demand, geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions, and fluctuations in crude oil prices all have a direct impact on the rates residents pay at the pump. For example, disruptions in major oil-exporting countries or unexpected changes in production can quickly drive up global prices, which then filter down to domestic markets. Additionally, seasonal demand spikes, such as increased travel during holidays, can also influence pricing.By understanding these global dynamics, everyday commuters and middle-class families can better anticipate changes and plan their monthly fuel budgets more effectively, rather than being caught off guard by sudden hikes.Fuel pricing in the UAE follows a deregulated model introduced in August 2015, which links local petrol and diesel rates to international oil prices. This policy ensures transparency and aligns retail prices with global market conditions. Each month, the UAE Fuel Price Committee reviews global trends and announces new rates, typically during the final days of the month. These rates take effect from the 1st day of the following month.This approach means UAE motorists feel the impact of both upswings and drops in the international energy market, encouraging more efficient fuel usage while maintaining pricing fairness.Looking to keep more dirhams in your pocket while filling up? Think of it as fuel-saving hacks for everyday heroes. First, carpooling like a boss sharing rides with friends or colleagues not only saves cash but also gives you some gossip time on the road. Next, combine your errands; that extra trip to the supermarket? Toss it in with the school run. Drive like a Zen master gentle acceleration, smooth braking, and no sudden sprints can stretch every litre farther. Don’t forget your car needs TLC too; proper tire pressure and timely servicing mean your engine sips fuel, not gulps it. And if you really want to be clever, fill up during off-peak hours, so you avoid long queues and unnecessary idling. A little planning and some smart moves can turn fuel anxiety into a monthly money-saving win.While the October 2025 fuel price adjustments represent a modest increase, they underscore the UAE's commitment to aligning domestic fuel prices with global market conditions. Staying informed about these changes allows consumers and businesses to plan and adapt accordingly.","The UAE Fuel Price Committee has announced the fuel prices for October 2025, reflecting a slight increase across all fuel types compared to September.

No threat found: New Jersey’s Joint military base McGuire lifts hour-long lockdown; false shooter report triggers chaos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-threat-found-new-jerseys-joint-military-base-mcguire-lifts-hour-long-lockdown-false-shooter-report-triggers-chaos/articleshow/124241101.cms,"New Jersey's Joint base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL) (Pic credit: AP)

Why is Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst significant?







A lockdown at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL) in Burlington County, New Jersey, was lifted around noon on Tuesday after a hoax shooter threat.A lockdown was imposed just before 11 am ET, which lasted approximately one hour following a report of an active shooter at the major US military installation. However, authorities later determined there was no active shooter threat.Base officials an hour later confirmed in a Facebook post stating, “ALL CLEAR. All personnel are to resume normal operations.” The lockdown had been ordered just before 11 am, with an earlier advisory urging personnel outdoors to take cover.“Our priority is the safety and security of everyone on the installation,” Col. Michael Stefanovic, JBMDL commander, said in a statement. “We worked closely with local law enforcement and emergency responders to ensure the situation was investigated and resolved as quickly as possible.”Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, located in central New Jersey, is a key tri-service US military installation, formed in 2009 through the merger of McGuire Air Force Base, Fort Dix, and Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst. Spanning over 42,000 acres across Burlington and Ocean counties, the base supports air mobility, training, and engineering operations critical to national defense.The installation is home to more than 40 units and mission partners, including the Air Force’s 305th Air Mobility Wing, Army Reserve and Guard units, and Navy test and evaluation programs. Its strategic location allows for rapid global deployment of personnel and equipment, while also serving as a central training hub for service members."," lockdown at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst lifted after hoax shooter threat. lockdown was imposed just before 11 am ET, which lasted approximately one hour.

Thinking of inviting your parents, siblings, or even a friend, to visit you in the UAE? You’ll now need to show what’s in your paycheck. The country has introduced new income rules for sponsoring visitors, with different salary slabs depending on who you’re inviting. It’s part of a bigger shake-up to the UAE’s visa system, which now includes new categories, special permits, and updated rules for families, professionals, and humanitarian cases.Inviting someone to the UAE on a visit visa now depends not just on who they are, but also on how much you earn. As part of sweeping updates to its visa system, the UAE’s Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has introduced income-based eligibility rules for residents sponsoring friends and family.According to the ICP, the updated policy lays out three distinct salary thresholds:These new requirements are part of a broader set of regulatory updates introduced by the ICP. The income-based criteria are intended to ensure financial responsibility on the part of the sponsor and to streamline the process in a way that supports transparency and sustainable immigration management.According to the ICP, the changes were introduced following extensive studies that examined present and future trends in residency and international mobility.The analysis also incorporated feedback from customers, stakeholders, and frontline service centers. These insights were gathered via mechanisms such as customer councils, call centers, and the authority’s complaints and inquiry platforms.Once the visit visa is approved, visitors, whether family or friends, can generally stay in the UAE for 30 to 90 days, depending on the visa type issued. Some of these visas also come with the option to extend the stay, usually in two stages:These extensions are not automatic and are subject to approval and additional fees.If you're planning to sponsor a friend or relative, make sure all the required documents and conditions are in place before applying. The process is straightforward, but attention to detail matters. Here’s what’s expected:If you’re sponsoring a relative, you’ll need to submit proof of kinship and a valid justification for the visit. For instance, if you're sponsoring a foreign woman whose husband resides in the GCC, you must also attach a copy of his UAE or GCC residence permit.As part of the updated framework, the UAE has launched four new types of visit visas tailored to specific professional and economic sectors:These new categories are intended to attract global talent and enhance the UAE’s visibility as a destination for innovation, leisure, and industry-specific gatherings.Also read: UAE launches 4 new special Visit Visas for AI, cruise, events, and entertainment Beyond the visit visa updates, the ICP has introduced sweeping changes to residency rules, aimed at offering more flexibility across humanitarian, family, and professional circumstances. Here’s a summary of key developments:A one-year renewable residency permit can now be issued to foreigners from countries experiencing war, disasters, or unrest. Notably, this permit does not require a guarantor or host. Its issuance or cancellation will be based on reports by the General Directorate of Identity and Foreigners Affairs.Importantly, the Director General of Identity and Foreigners Affairs has the authority to waive standard requirements like financial solvency or kinship degree in special humanitarian cases involving relatives or in-laws. This aims to ensure compassionate handling of vulnerable individuals.Two categories of women are now eligible for a renewable one-year residence permit:All applicants must demonstrate financial capability and adequate housing. Custody disputes will be settled by a designated legal committee.Applicants must now either prove strong financial solvency related to their planned business, or clearly demonstrate they are already actively engaged in a similar business either abroad or through a registered UAE-based entity.Regulations for truck drivers have been streamlined. These visas can be single or multiple-entry and must be sponsored by licensed freight or logistics companies. Conditions include providing a financial guarantee, valid health insurance, and paying required government fees.","Residents must earn between AED 4,000 and AED 15,000 monthly to sponsor family or friends for UAE visit visas.

Trump’s Most Awkward Speech Yet? Generals Refuse to Clap, Silence Fills the Room | WATCH





US defense secretary Pete Hegseth on Tuesday announced new directives for the military, including implementing gender-neutral physical fitness standards and eliminating what he described as ""woke"" culture from the armed forces. The announcement came during an in-person meeting with military officials at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia.The new policies are guided by what Hegseth calls the “1990 test,” which examines whether changes to military standards since 1990 were necessary due to evolving combat needs or were influenced by other priorities. “The 1990s test is simple. What were the military standards in 1990, and if they have changed, tell me why: Was it a necessary change based on the evolving landscape of combat, or was the change due to a softening, weakening or gender-based pursuit of other priorities?” he explained.“I don’t want my son serving alongside troops who are out of shape, or in a combat unit with females who can’t meet the same Combat Arms physical standards as men, or troops who are not fully proficient on their assigned weapons, platform, or task, or under a leader who was the first but not the best. Standards must be uniform, gender neutral and high,” Hegseth said.Women were first allowed in direct combat roles during the Obama administration.While Hegseth did not announce a full rollback of women in combat, he made it clear that the “highest male standards” would now apply to all combat roles. He acknowledged that this could result in fewer women qualifying for some positions.“We very much value the impact of female troops — our female officers and NCOs are the absolute best in the world. But when it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender-neutral,” he said. “If women can make it, excellent. If not, it is what it is. If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it. That is not the intent, but it could be the result. ”Under the new rules, all combat personnel, including generals and admirals, will be required to pass two yearly physical tests. Hegseth emphasized that the standards are “gender neutral” but will be based on the “highest male standard” for physical fitness in combat roles.","US defense secretary Pete Hegseth on Tuesday announced new directives for the military.

Who can marry in Abu Dhabi? Eligibility and legal framework



How to apply and what documents you need



The ceremony, legal effect and practical aftercare

Why expatriates are choosing Abu Dhabi for civil marriage

Legal benefits and global recognition of Abu Dhabi civil marriage





Abu Dhabi’s civil marriage service lets couples solemnize a legally recognized, secular marriage at the Abu Dhabi Civil Family Court under Law No. 14 of 2021. The service is open to most residents and visitors (with a key exception for Muslim UAE nationals) and is designed to be fast, internationally recognised and simple to navigate. If you’re planning to marry in Abu Dhabi, here’s a clear, practical guide to who can apply, what to prepare, how the ceremony works, the fees and why the reform matters for expatriates.Abu Dhabi’s civil-marriage scheme is governed by Abu Dhabi Law No. 14 of 2021 and applies to people regardless of religion or nationality, except for UAE nationals who are Muslims they remain subject to Sharia-based family law. Applicants must be at least 18 years old, give mutual consent, must not be married to someone else, and must not be related within the first or second degree. Tourists and non-residents can apply online and must travel to Abu Dhabi for the ceremony once approved. The move to allow civil marriage grew from wider UAE reforms introduced since 2021 to provide non-religious personal-status options and align with international norms.Couples can submit applications through the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department’s online portal or at authorised typing centres. The core documents are passports (and Emirates ID if resident), a completed application form, and proof that any prior marriage has been legally dissolved (divorce decree or death certificate).A prenuptial agreement is optional. There are two service tracks: the standard service (about AED 300, processed within roughly 10 working days) and an express option (around AED 2,500) that can be processed in one working day and lets couples choose the ceremony date. After approval, the court schedules the ceremony at its Civil Family Court.On the ceremony day both parties attend the Abu Dhabi Civil Family Court with IDs; no external witnesses are required because the civil marriage officer serves as the legal witness. Vows are played via a pre-recorded audio available in multiple languages, though couples can exchange rings, recite their own vows and bring guests or a photographer. After signing, the marriage certificate is legally binding; many couples choose to have the certificate attested by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for overseas use and embassy recognition. The process is intentionally straightforward to ensure the marriage is widely accepted by foreign authorities.Abu Dhabi has emerged as a preferred destination for non-Muslim expatriates and mixed-nationality couples seeking to formalize their unions legally. For many, coming from countries with strict marriage laws, religious restrictions, or cumbersome bureaucratic processes, Abu Dhabi offers a simpler, faster, and transparent system. Unlike traditional procedures that may require approval from multiple authorities or religious institutions, the civil marriage framework in Abu Dhabi allows couples to complete the process efficiently through a single legal channel.The system is particularly appealing for couples who previously faced hurdles due to differences in religion or nationality. Expats report that the process is streamlined, well-documented, and predictable, reducing both time and administrative stress. By providing a legally recognized, state-backed platform, Abu Dhabi has become a go-to destination for couples who want their marriage to be valid, hassle-free, and compliant with international legal standards.One of the biggest draws of Abu Dhabi’s civil marriage system is its legal robustness and international recognition. Marriage certificates issued here are accepted in most countries worldwide, making them highly valuable for practical purposes such as visa applications, bank accounts, inheritance rights, and other family law matters.This global validity ensures that couples do not face disputes or complications when moving, working, or studying abroad. The civil certificate also acts as a formal proof of marital status, recognized by governments and institutions alike, which can simplify processes like sponsorship for spouses, property ownership, and social benefits. For expatriates, having a legally enforceable marriage document from Abu Dhabi provides peace of mind, ensuring that their rights and obligations are protected both locally and internationally.","Abu Dhabi’s civil marriage service lets couples solemnize a legally recognized, secular marriage at the Abu Dhabi Civil Family Court. The service is open to most residents and visitors (with a key exception for Muslim UAE nationals) Applicants must be at least 18 years old, give mutual consent, and must not be married to someone else.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124227975,imgsize-1511355,width-400,resizemode-4/say-i-do.jpg"
‘Fatness and success’: Chunk the brown bear wins Fat Bear Week 2025; overcame broken jaw,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fatness-and-success-chunk-the-brown-bear-wins-fat-bear-week-2025-overcame-broken-jaw/articleshow/124268646.cms,"AP file photo





A brown bear weighing over 500kg (78st 8lb) has triumphed in Fat Bear Week 2025 despite suffering a broken jaw. Chunk, often called “the most dominant brown bear on the river,” won the competition at Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska, which celebrates the bears that best embody “fatness and success” as they prepare for winter hibernation.Locals believe Chunk’s jaw injury resulted from a battle with another male over a female, making his victory even more remarkable.""He reminded us how resilient bears are and how they have the ability to recover from injury and hardship,"" ranger Naomi Boak was quoted as saying by the BBC.Adult male brown bears typically weigh up to 408kg in mid-summer and can gain around 25 percent of their body weight by autumn, with the largest males exceeding 540kg. In this year’s contest, Chunk surpassed one of the river’s biggest bears, known as 856, by over 30,000 votes.The annual bracket-style competition compares wild bears using before-and-after photos that highlight their weight gain in preparation for winter, along with their personalities and notable bear behaviors, as reported by the Guardian.Chunk has unseated 128 Grazer, the female bear who held Katmai’s Fat Bear title for the past two years, as the Brooks River’s fattest bear.This year’s contest drew over 1.5 million public votes, the highest yet, naturalist Mike Fitz noted during the livestream.Katmai is renowned as the habitat of some of the world’s largest brown bears, with the biggest males reaching more than 1,200lbs (544kg) by autumn. The competition offers viewers a live camera feed capturing the bears fishing for salmon, navigating the river, and occasionally engaging in skirmishes with one another.During the summer of 2024, 32 Chunk killed the young cub of 128 Grazer, despite the mother bear’s desperate efforts to protect it, a confrontation captured on the live cameras. That year, 128 Grazer went on to defeat Chunk in the Fat Bear competition by more than 40,000 votes.Despite his previous reputation as the “villain,” Chunk, described as having “narrowly-set eyes, dark brown fur, and a prominent brow ridge” with “a distinctive scar across his muzzle”, won over the public this year with his story of perseverance.The contest is the brainchild of Mike Fitz, a former park ranger. What began in 2014 as a one-day event with roughly 1,700 votes has since grown into a global phenomenon, attracting and educating fans from around the world.“No matter who wins fat bear week, each bear was fully committed to the effort. They needed to get fat to find success,” Fitz said in a livestream.","Chunk, often called “the most dominant brown bear on the river,” won the competition at Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska.

How common and lengthy are government shutdowns?

The United States government officially shut down at 12:01 am Wednesday (October 1) after Congress and Republicans failed to reach a funding deal, and now the stalemate may stay for at least three days.The Senate is expected to commence its next rounds of voting on government funding after 1.30 pm on Friday, according to Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso. Votes on competing proposals from Democrats and Republicans are planned.The Senate has adjourned until noon on Thursday and will resume voting on Friday. Senators will not vote on Thursday in recognition of the Yom Kippur holiday, which begins at sundown on Wednesday.""We will be in session tomorrow, starting tomorrow afternoon. So the floor will be available if people want to give speeches,"" Thune said, adding that he expected it to be ""fairly quiet around here"" because of the Jewish holiday.The last government shutdown — from December 2018 to January 2019 — was the longest in US history, stretching 35 days.It began on December 22, 2018, when Democrats refused to meet President Trump’s demand for border wall funding.Mounting pressure — including widespread travel delays caused by air traffic controllers calling out sick — forced Trump to back down. On Jan. 25, 2019, he agreed to a temporary deal to reopen the government without wall funding. The five-week standoff cost the US an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Since 1976, there have been 20 funding gaps, though most were short. Ten since 1981 lasted three days or fewer, often over weekends. The most consequential shutdowns came in the 1990s, when clashes between President Bill Clinton and Speaker Newt Gingrich over balancing the budget closed the government for five days in November 1995 and then for 21 days through early 1996. Republicans, widely blamed in polls, eventually accepted Clinton’s terms.The next major standoff came in 2013, when House Republicans refused to pass a spending bill funding the Affordable Care Act. The 16-day shutdown ended only after bipartisan Senate talks produced minor concessions. A 2023 congressional report estimated it reduced GDP growth by $20 billion and cost $2 billion in lost work hours.Shutdowns only became possible after a pair of legal opinions from US Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti in 1980–81. Interpreting the Antideficiency Act, Civiletti concluded federal employees could not work without appropriations, except in limited cases involving safety or property. His rulings, he later admitted, unintentionally set the stage for shutdowns to become a recurring political weapon.Since then, there have been eight shutdowns in the 1980s, three in the 1990s, and three more in the 2000s — nearly all brief. But the modern era has seen longer, costlier showdowns, with public blame typically split between both parties.","Since 1976, there have been 20 funding gaps, though most were short.

The Trump administration on Wednesday announced a freeze on roughly $18 billion in funding for two major New York City infrastructure projects.The funding was earmarked for the Hudson River Tunnel Project (Gateway) and the Second Avenue Subway project, according to Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought.In a post on X, Vought wrote: “Roughly $18 billion in New York City infrastructure projects have been put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles.”DEI refers to diversity, equity and inclusion policies, which have come under scrutiny by the Trump administration.Vought’s announcement came on the first day of a US government shutdown, triggered after Congress failed to pass stopgap funding bills that would have kept federal agencies and services operating for at least seven more weeks.The Trump administration has blamed the two top Democrats in Congress, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both from New York City, for the shutdown.The Gateway project, costing more than $16 billion, aims to build a second rail tunnel under the Hudson River, adding capacity to two single-track tunnels that carry Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains to Penn Station, Midtown Manhattan, from New Jersey and back.The Second Avenue Subway is an ongoing expansion along Manhattan’s East Side.The Hudson River rail tunnel has been a long-delayed project, intended to ease the strain on a century-old tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey. Hundreds of Amtrak and commuter trains carry hundreds of thousands of passengers through the tunnel daily, with delays potentially affecting travel along the East Coast between Boston and Washington.","The funding was earmarked for the Hudson River Tunnel Project (Gateway) and the Second Avenue Subway project.

The Trump administration has warned that mass layoffs of 'nonessential' federal employees could begin within days if the ongoing US government shutdown continues.At a White House press briefing on Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt announced that federal layoffs are imminent, slamming Democrats for the looming cuts. “We believe layoffs are imminent. They are, unfortunately, a consequence of this government shutdown,” she told reporters.“Sometimes you have to do things you don’t want to do and it’s because the Democrats have put us in this position. If the Democrats did not vote to shut down the government, we would not be talking about layoffs today.”Leavitt stated that President Donald Trump and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russ Vought are working with agencies “across the board” to identify where cuts may be implemented.However, she did not state a specific percentage of layoffs that will occur. She also did not state a specific day when the layoffs would happen, but simply said it would occur ""soon.""Leavitt confirmed that Vought will discuss the layoffs with members of the House Republican Conference to prepare them for constituent backlash. “It would be irresponsible of us not to take a look at each and every agency and get an understanding of what we’re going to have to do moving forward to do the best we can in the midst of this government shutdown,” she added.Vice President JD Vance, who joined the briefing at the White House, stressed that “nonessential” employees would be the first to lose their jobs if the standoff persists. “We’re not targeting federal agencies based on politics. We’re targeting the people’s government so that as much as possible of the essential services can continue to function,” he said. Vance added that the administration would “have to save money in some places so the essential services don’t get turned off in other places. ”Nonessential employees are generally those whose roles are not vital to national security or public health. They include administrative personnel, staff at national parks and museums, certain research positions,The remarks came a day after President Trump said he would use the shutdown to fire “a lot” of civil servants and cut federal programs and benefits he opposes.The US government officially entered shutdown at 12:01 am Wednesday after lawmakers failed to reconcile competing spending bills.

The Commonwealth Observer Group (COG) has officially released its report on Pakistan’s 2024 general elections, noting “conditions that appeared to impact one party’s ability to fairly contest the election” — namely the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), led by incarcerated former Prime Minister Imran Khan The report, which included a ""Letter of Transmittal"" by COG chairperson and former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, cited the denial to PTI of its election symbol, Khan’s consecutive convictions ahead of polling, and restrictions on freedom of association and assembly.Jonathan wrote: “When looked at in isolation, some – though not all – of the arguments advanced by key institutions in support of their actions appear somewhat justifiable. Yet, collectively, it could not go unnoticed that these decisions consistently limited one party's ability to contest the election on a level playing field.”The observers expressed particular concern over the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s revocation of PTI’s iconic “bat” symbol — linked to Khan’s cricketing past — on grounds that the party failed to hold intra-party elections. With the decision coming just weeks before polling, PTI candidates were forced to run as independents, depriving them of a unifying symbol.The group also flagged Khan’s multiple convictions shortly before polling day, along with restrictions on PTI’s rallies and gatherings. “There were also limitations on fundamental political rights, including freedom of association and assembly. These limitations were felt most acutely by PTI and its supporters,” the report said.The COG called for reforms to strengthen transparency and ensure a level playing field for all parties in future Pakistani elections.The report found that mainstream English-language media “broadly followed the principles of fair and accurate election reporting,” though PTI-affiliated independent candidates received ""less positive"" coverage.By contrast, state-owned PTV News lacked balance, focusing mainly on the ruling PML-N and PPP, and reportedly barred references to Khan by name. The group concluded that these factors may have “impinged on the credibility, transparency and inclusiveness of the electoral process.”The report had been controversial after media reports suggested the Commonwealth had “buried” it following widespread problems in the February 8 polls. Submitted to the Commonwealth secretary-general on November 20, 2024, the publication was delayed without explanation.The PTI had repeatedly demanded its release, arguing it confirmed “systemic rigging, institutional bias, and deliberate targeting” of the party and its founder.","Commonwealth Observer Group releases report on Pakistan's 2024 general elections.

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





At least nine people, including four militants, were killed in two separate bomb-related incidents on Tuesday in South Waziristan district of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, reported news agency PTI.The first explosion occurred in Ashangi Lagad village, where five villagers were killed instantly after coming into contact with a bomb-like object lying on the road.The powerful blast sparked panic in the area, with residents demanding that authorities step up efforts to clear unexploded devices and protect civilians. Security forces and local administration officials later reached the site and launched an investigation.Hours later, in the Wacha Khawora area of Wana, four militants were killed when an improvised explosive device (IED) they were attempting to plant went off prematurely. Among those killed were a local militant commander, Yar Muhammad Muslim, Zameed Alam of the Ashangi tribe, and two unidentified associates.Earlier, at least ten people were killed and several others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside the paramilitary headquarters in Quetta on Tuesday.The blast was reportedly heard miles away, and ambulances quickly arrived to transport the wounded to nearby hospitals.“The blast occurred as an explosive-laden vehicle took a turn from Model Town towards Hali Road, near the Frontier Constabulary (FC) headquarters,” said Muhammad Baloch, SSP special operations Quetta.This follows heightened tensions in the region. On September 3, a suicide bombing at a political rally in Quetta killed 11 leaving over 40 injured.

Amid Trump-Sharif Meeting, Political Expert Explains Why US is Eyeing Pakistan As Military Launchpad





: In an effort to worm its way back into Washington’s good books, Pakistan ’s hybrid military-civilian leadership flashed glimpses of its purported rare earths bearing mineral wealth during a meeting with US President Donald Trump last week, going by a photo released by the White House.Among a dozen photos featured in the White House picture gallery relating to the Shahbaz Sharif- Asim Munir meeting with Trump is one where the duo is showing Trump an open 18x18 inch wooden box with colorful stones presumably bearing some mineral deposits. Two of the larger rocks appear to be bastanzite and monazite clumps that typically bear rare earths elements (REE) such as cerium, lanthanum, and neodymium. Some of the smaller candy-colored pebbles look like gemstones.Pakistan has long spoken of its vast untapped oil, gas, and mineral ores, some bearing rare earths, mostly in the troubled Balochistan region wracked with insurgency, and also in Khyber-Pakhtoonwa. While none of the mineral deposits are commercially proven or quantified, Pakistan’s leadership showcased the baubles to the US President to highlight collaboration and exploration bids it has signed with a private US firm earlier this month.The charm offensive also included PM Sharif wearing a lapel pin the had both the US and Pakistani flags, a gesture some Pakistani trolls on social media termed as “embarrassing.”While there is no direct government-to-government agreement to explore or exploit the mineral wealth, Pakistan's Frontier Works Organization (FWO)—a military-linked engineering and mining entity—signed an MoU on September 8 with the Missouri-based US Strategic Metals (USSM), a private US firm specializing in critical minerals.The agreement, with an initial funding of $ 500 million from USSM, envisages three phases: Phase 1 (Immediate, 2025–2026) involving export of readily available minerals (e.g., antimony and copper concentrates) to US markets, generating quick revenue. Phase 2 (Medium-term, 2026–2028) involving construction of processing plants and refineries in Pakistan, with technology transfer for REE separation and purification. Phase 3 (Long-term, 2028+), involving large-scale exploration and exploitation, including drilling in high-potential REE belts; and developing 5–10 mining projects.Islamabad's rare earths gambit with the US — which could cause Pakistan's patron China to burst a blood vessel since it has a stranglehold on rare earths supply to the US — comes on the heels of the its crypto caper, where it used a British-Pakistani entrepreneur to position itself as crypto capital where American businesses with ties to the Trump family could make a fortune.","Pakistan has long spoken of its vast untapped oil, gas, and mineral ores, some bearing rare earths.

NEW YORK: Despite being among one of the world's worst performers when it comes to democracy, and registering a high number of human rights violation cases, Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif defended the country's 'hybrid model' of governance where the army and civilian leadership work hand in glove in running the country.He made the remarks in an interview to British-American journalist Mehdi Hasan while defending Pakistan. Asif called the US democracy a ""deep state"" and tried to brush away the charges of military might in Pak governance.When asked by Hasan, ""It's a strange system you have in Pakistan. I think you've called it a hybrid model - where the military and civilian leaders effectively share power. But the military leaders are really the ones in charge, are they not? In most countries, the head of the army answers to the defence minister. In your country you, the defence minister, answer to the head of the army, don't you? Asim Munir is a more powerful person than you are. "" Khawaja Asif rejected the statements. and said: ""No, it's not like that... I'm a political appointee.""When confronted with the example of how in the US, Pete Hegseth, the secretary of war, has the power to fire American generals, but the same cannot be said for Pakistan, Asif sourly retorted, saying, ""They (US) have a different model over here.It's called deep state.""On Hasan further saying, ""In your country (Pakistan) the deep state's in charge.

Seventeen militants linked to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Saturday were killed in a joint operation by Pakistan’s Frontier Corps (FC) and police in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, officials told news agency AP.According to District Police Officer (DPO) Karak Shahbaz Elahi, the intelligence-led operation took place in the Karak district on Friday following credible reports about the presence of militants affiliated with the TTP and the Mullah Nazir group.As security forces approached, the militants opened fire, prompting retaliation in which all 17 were killed. A substantial cache of arms and ammunition was recovered from the scene. Three security personnel sustained injuries in the firefight.The slain militants were reportedly wanted for multiple crimes, including attacks on security forces, kidnapping for ransom, and other terrorist activities. A curfew was later imposed in Darsha Khel and surrounding villages to facilitate a wider combing operation, as several militants were believed to have fled the area.Separately, at least 23 civilians, including women and children, were reportedly killed in an airstrike in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Monday.","Seventeen militants linked to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed in a joint operation by Pakistan’s Frontier Corps (FC) and police in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

China 'not worried' about Pak's flirtations with US



Awkward contradictions on Imran Khan







Pakistan's defence minister, Khawaja Asif , has once again defended his country's ""hybrid model"" of governance, insisting that the military and civilian leadership work ""by consensus"" in managing state affairs.Speaking to British-American journalist Mehdi Hasan, Asif dismissed suggestions that the army dominates Pakistan's politics, while controversially describing US democracy as a ""deep state.""When asked whether Pakistan's generals hold more power than elected ministers, Asif retorted, ""No, it's not like that. I'm a political appointee, I’m a political worker."" Pressed further with comparisons to the United States, where civilian leaders have the authority to dismiss top generals, he claimed, ""They (the US) have a different model over here. It's called deep state.""Hasan pointed out that in Pakistan, critics accuse the military of being the real decision-maker. Asif acknowledged the perception, blaming ""past military rulers"" for the image, but insisted the system was based on consensus. Asked directly who prevails if he and Army chief Asim Munir disagree, Asif said: ""It's not equal. We can agree to disagree. It is by consensus, whatever is taking place.""Earlier this year, Asif had described the hybrid arrangement as a ""practical necessity,"" saying that while not an ideal form of democracy, it was helping Pakistan manage its economic and governance crises. Local daily Dawn has reported that Asif often praises the military-civilian partnership, despite critics branding it undemocratic.Turning to geopolitics, Asif insisted Pakistan's tilt toward Washington under US President Donald Trump, with new mineral and crypto trade deals, would not jeopardise Islamabad's ties with Beijing. ""We are not worried about that, because it's a time-tested relationship with China since the late 50s. China is not worried about our flirtations or whatever you call it,"" he remarked.Highlighting defence ties, he said: ""In the past, even today and in the future also, China has been a very reliable ally. Our Air Force, submarines, planes — almost a major portion of our arms are from China, and our defence cooperation is increasing. It is much more robust than before, with China, the main reason is unreliability of other sources like the United States.""He underscored geography as another factor: ""They (China) are reliable and they are our neighbours. We share borders and we share the geography.""The interview also turned uncomfortable when Asif was confronted about his shifting claims on jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan's social media activity. At one point, he alleged Khan was operating his account from Adiala Jail. When reminded that he had earlier accused India of controlling Khan's account, Asif appeared flustered.""You just made two different allegations. Is it Imran in his prison cell or is it India?"" Hasan asked. Asif responded, ""Either he is operating from the cell or he should at least identify who is operating the jail cell.""Pressed further on evidence, Asif cited ""intelligence sources"" but refused to provide details, insisting: ""The evidence I cannot publicly disclose… but it is there.""","Pakistan's defence minister defends country's ""hybrid model"" of governance.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban’s first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that “eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place “until further notice.”Just last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan’s fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide “to prevent immoral activities.” They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

Yes No





At least one student was killed, dozens were injured, and 65 were feared buried in the debris after Al Khoziny Islamic boarding school building collapsed in Indonesia.Rescue workers, police, and soldiers, who had been digging through the night, pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java. Additional bodies were spotted, suggesting the death toll could rise, AP reported.Families of the students gathered at hospitals and near the collapsed building, anxiously awaiting news of their children. Relatives wailed as they watched rescuers pull a dusty, injured student from the buried prayer hall.A notice board at the command post established in the boarding school complex listed 65 students as missing as of Tuesday morning. They were mostly boys in Class 7 to Class 11, aged between twelve and seventeen.“Oh my God... my son is still buried, oh my God please help!” a mother cried hysterically upon seeing her child's name on the board, followed by the cries of other parents facing similar losses.“Please, sir, please find my child immediately,” pleaded a father, holding the hand of one of the rescue team members. Heavy slabs of concrete, rubble, and unstable parts of the building hampered search and rescue efforts, said Nanang Sigit, a search and rescue officer leading the operation.Heavy equipment was available but not being used due to concerns it could cause further collapse. “We have been running oxygen and water to those still trapped under the debris and keeping them alive while we work hard to get them out,” Sigit said.He added that rescuers had seen several bodies under the rubble but were focused on saving those still alive. Several hundred rescuers participated in the effort, equipped with breathing apparatus, extrication tools, medical evacuation equipment, and other support devices.The students had been performing afternoon prayers in a building undergoing an unauthorised expansion when it suddenly collapsed on top of them, provincial police spokesperson Jules Abraham Abast said. Residents, teachers, and administrators assisted injured students, many with head injuries and broken bones.Female students were praying in another part of the building and managed to escape, survivors said. One male student, a thirteen-year-old boy, was killed, and ninety-nine other students were injured and taken to hospitals, some in critical condition, officials said. Authorities were investigating the cause of the collapse. Abast said the old prayer hall was two stories, but two additional floors were being added without a permit.“The old building's foundation was apparently unable to support two floors of concrete and collapsed during the pouring process,” Abast said.","Rescue workers, police, and soldiers pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java.

Nepal PM Oli ‘Planning To Flee To Dubai’, Gen Z Bring ‘Corrupt’ Govt To Its Knees | Watch





Nepal's former Prime Minister and CPN-UML chairman KP Sharma Oli has publicly dismissed speculation that he plans to leave the country, accusing the Sushila Karki-led government of attempting to strip him of his security and official entitlements amid ongoing political tension, reported news agency ANI.Addressing a gathering of Yuwa Sangh Nepal, the youth wing of his party, in Gundu, Bhaktapur, Oli declared, ""Do you think we will flee by handing over the nation to this groundless government?"" He said he remained committed to restoring “peace, good governance and constitutional order”, as quoted by the agency.Oli’s remarks come weeks after the fall of his government on September 9, which followed large-scale Gen Z-led protests. Since vacating the Prime Minister’s official residence in Baluwatar, Oli has relocated to a rented house in Gundu, following an arson attack on his private residence in Balkot by protestors.The CPN-UML chief alleged that the current administration lacked democratic legitimacy and was formed through “vandalism and arson”, not the people’s mandate.Challenging the government to disclose any communication he had with state authorities during the protests, Oli said, “Publish them with courage.Make public the instructions I gave.” He denied any wrongdoing and questioned the basis of efforts to link him to the violent unrest.He also raised concerns over reported threats to his safety and criticised the government for inaction. “On social media, there are open calls to attack my residence. What is the government doing? Just watching?” he asked.The former PM expressed strong objection to reports that the government was planning to withhold passports of several political leaders, including himself, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Arzu Rana Deuba, Ramesh Lekhak, and Deepak Khadka.Oli accused the ruling dispensation of creating a climate of insecurity and targeting opposition leaders. “This government is throwing the country into insecurity,” he alleged.Meanwhile, a recent monitoring report by Nepal’s national human rights commission (NHRC) blamed the previous government, led by Oli and then-home minister Ramesh Lekhak, for failing to anticipate the scale of the Gen Z protests. The NHRC said that while the initial demonstrations on September 8 were peaceful, the use of excessive force by security personnel on September 9 led to dozens of deaths and widespread violence.Rights groups have held Oli and Lekhak accountable for the crackdown, which played a key role in the fall of their administration. The NHRC report highlighted poor coordination, declining morale among security forces, and inadequate preparation as contributing factors to the high casualties.","KP Sharma Oli accuses Sushila Karki-led government of attempting to strip him of his security and official entitlements.

India Dragged Into Bangladesh Politics: Muhammad Yunus Accuses New Delhi of Spreading Propaganda





DHAKA: Bangladesh's student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) threatens to halt elections after the Election Commission (EC) refused to allocate the symbol it demanded ahead of the February polls.NCP, a large offshoot of Students against Discrimination (SAD), which led last year's street campaign dubbed as the July Uprising, toppling then prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League and installing professor Muhammad Yunus as the chief adviser.""The commission could not show any legal logic for not allocating the 'shapla' (water lily) as our symbol and therefore we are sticking to our demand,"" NCP's convenor Nahid Islam was quoted as saying on Wednesday by newspapers a day after the EC revealed its decision on the issue.Islam said NCP would give its ""final reaction"" once the EC takes its ""formal decision"".However, the party's chief coordinator for northern Bangladesh, Sarjis Alam, threatened to halt the polls unless their demand was met.""Since there is no legal barrier, the NCP must get the 'shapla' as its symbol; there is no other option. Unless we get it, we will see how the election is held and how someone could dream of attaining power,"" Alam posted on social media.EC's senior secretary, Akhter Ahmed, on Tuesday told a media briefing that NCP would not be allotted the symbol they demanded as it is ""not included in the list of electoral symbols as per the regulations"".""The 'shapla' is not on our list of 115 electoral symbols. According to the rules, political parties must choose a symbol from the approved list,"" he said.The ""shapla"" is the national emblem of Bangladesh.NCP chief coordinator Nasiruddin Patwary led the party delegation to the EC to get its registration earlier and said the party must be registered with the ""shapla"" symbol.Asked how they would secure the symbol since it was not included in the EC's revised list, he said amendments could be made at any time.Patwary also said the party expected to win around 150 constituencies out of 300, with nominations including former army officers, as well as women, farmers, and workers involved in the July uprising.Several political analysts, however, speculate a bleak fate for NCP in elections, particularly after their nominees witnessed a landslide defeat in students' union elections in two major public universities - the premier Dhaka University and suburban Jahangirnagar University.Bangladesh's largest Islamist Party, Jamaat-e-Islami-backed Islami Chhaita Shibir, won in most of the posts in both elections.

Yunus discusses SAARC revival with US envoy Gor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/yunus-discusses-saarc-revival-with-us-ambassador-designate-to-india-sergio-gor/articleshow/124078736.cms,"File photos





While it’s well known that Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived, he has now raised the issue with Sergio Gor, the US ambassador-designate to India who will also play the role of Special Envoy for South and Central Asia.Yunus met Gor on the margins of the ongoing UNGA session in New York. According to Dhaka, the chief advisor noted that the interim government has intensified efforts to revive SAARC, which has not held a summit in over a decade.SAARC summits are held biennially but the process has remained stalled since the summit in Kathmandu in 2014. The Uri terrorist attack in 2016 put paid to the summit that Pakistan was scheduled to host that year and India has since maintained Pakistan’s continued support for cross-border terrorism has made unfeasible the SAARC dialogue, including summits and important meetings.However, India has continued to support SAARC activities in diverse sectors for closer cooperation and blamed Pakistan for blocking trade and connectivity initiatives in the region. While it hasn’t withdrawn from the Association, India has sought to strengthen regional cooperation through the BIMSTEC grouping in which Pakistan is not a member.The US readout said regional cooperation was discussed but didn’t specifically mention SAARC.Bangladesh didn’t say what Gor’s response was to Yunus’ remarks on SAARC but India will be wary of any external pressure to resume the summit process. The idea of Pakistan hosting even a virtual summit has been rendered a non-starter because of the Pahalgam terrorist attack that led to a dramatic military clash between India and Pakistan.India sees the appointment of Gor as ambassador by the Trump administration as a welcome development but will guard against any US attempt to intrude into South Asian affairs through Gor’s dual role, particularly if it has any security fallout for the region. India is already worried about security challenges that Dhaka’s warming ties with Pakistan might entail. It has shown little interest so far in Yunus’ efforts to, as he said earlier, revive the spirit of SAARC.While countries like Bangladesh and Nepal seek a resumption of the summit process, India maintains that there has been no material change in the situation since the 19th summit that Pakistan had to host was postponed and that there’s no consensus among members on the meeting.India closely followed a China-Pakistan-Bangladesh trilateral meeting at Kunming, taking note of reports that this was an effort to create a new bloc in the region, However, Dhaka later denied this was an effort to forge an alliance against any country.Yunus also discussed with Gor the Rohingya crisis, and the “proliferation of disinformation targeting Dhaka”. Yunus has in the past described as fake news some of the reports in Indian media about targeting of Hindus in Bangladesh .According to Dhaka, Yunus also expressed Bangladesh’s interest in joining ASEAN, stating that integration with Southeast Asian economies could significantly accelerate the country’s development. He told Gor Dhaka ismaking “comprehensive preparations” to ensure a free, fair, and peaceful general election in the first half of February.","Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived.

Her research proved that primates display behaviors remarkably similar to humans, including communication, individual personalities, and the ability to make and use tools.Her discoveries as an ethologist “revolutionized science, and she was a tireless advocate for the protection and restoration of our natural world,” the institute said. Goodall later earned a PhD in ethology from the University of Cambridge, with her thesis documenting the first five years of her study at the Gombe Stream Reserve.In 1977, she co-founded the Jane Goodall Institute with Genevieve di San Faustino. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., with offices in 25 cities worldwide, the institute works to improve the treatment and understanding of primates through public education and legal representation.Goodall’s work earned her both scientific recognition and global fame. She is credited with inspiring generations of women to pursue careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). According to the Jane Goodall Institute, the number of women in STEM has grown from 7% in 1970 to 26% by 2011.In April 2002, Goodall was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace. Even in her 80s and 90s, she remained active in advocating for environmental conservation and sustainable practices around the world.Her passing marks the end of an era in primatology and environmental advocacy, leaving behind a legacy of scientific achievement and tireless dedication to the natural world.","Jane Goodall, the legendary British primatologist, conservationist, and founder of the Jane Goodall Institute, passed away at the age of 91 due to natural causes.

How Indian nationals are snapping up British buy-to-lets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/how-indian-nationals-are-snapping-up-british-buy-to-lets/articleshow/124261789.cms,"TOI Correspondent from London:





Indian nationals are the largest non-UK shareholders of buy-to-let companies in Britain this year, according to analysis by estate agency Hamptons.Analysis of data by Hamptons shows that Indian investors are followed by Nigerians, Poles and Irish. Indians have made up the largest group since 2023; in 2022, they were the second-largest.In the first half of this year, Indian nationals founded 684 new buy-to-let companies, with more registered in Hillingdon than in any other area. Nigerian investors follow closely with 647 new incorporations. This shift reflects wider post-Brexit migration patterns.Buy-to-let companies are special-purpose companies set up to buy and manage residential rental properties.EU nationals now account for 49% of non-UK shareholders, down from 65% in 2016. There has been a general fall in shareholders from the Anglosphere, too. In 2016, Irish, Americans, South Africans and Australians all featured in the top 10. By 2025, only Irish nationals remained, ranking fourth. Instead, Indian and Nigerian investors are stepping into the spotlight, despite rents falling this year for the first time in five years.There were approximately 127,000 more Nigerian nationals and 178,000 more Indian nationals immigrating to the UK in 2023 compared with 2019, according to the Office of National Statistics.Twenty per cent of buy-to-let companies set up in the UK so far this year are owned by non-UK national shareholders, up from 13% in 2016. The remaining 80% are owned by UK shareholders. Seven per cent of Indian nationals who own UK buy-to-let companies set up over the past decade live in India.At current rates, around 67,000 new companies will be set up by the end of 2025, with around 13,500 owned, at least in part, by non-UK nationals. Companies are a more tax-efficient way of managing rental properties in Britain.Whilst London has always been an attractive investment choice for foreign landlords, between 2016 and 2025 the share of new non-UK national landlords has more than doubled in the East Midlands, West Midlands and Scotland.Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons, said: “While overseas-based investors are part of the picture, the majority of purchases by non-UK nationals reflect domestic demand. Up until 2021, this demand was most likely to come from EU nationals based in the UK, but since then it has shifted to reflect changes in broader migration patterns.

Shehbaz Sharif Left Red-Faced as UN Probes Political Sloganeering During Pakistan PM's UNGA Speech

Why is PoK witnessing protests?





Ongoing protests in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) have raised “serious concern” among a UK parliamentary group, which has written to the British government over the unrest in the region.Imran Hussain, chair of the Kashmir All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), shared a letter on social media on Tuesday highlighting the issue to Hamish Falconer, the UK minister responsible for Pakistan at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO).Hussain, a member of the ruling Labour Party, wrote, ""Reports from the ground indicate a complete communications blackout, with mobile, internet, and landline services suspended across the region.”The Bradford East MP added, ""These actions have caused deep anxiety among many of our constituents, who are unable to contact loved ones. The atmosphere has been further strained by reports of heavy deployment of police and paramilitary forces, raising serious concerns about the safety and well-being of residents.""In its statement, the Kashmir APPG condemned both the communications shutdown and the use of force, calling them a “significant” human rights issue.It urged the UK government to engage diplomatically with Islamabad and press for a “peaceful and negotiated settlement” in the region.“We respectfully request that the FCDO urgently raise this matter with the Pakistani government and push for the immediate restoration of communications, de-escalation of tensions, and meaningful dialogue with stakeholders. We urge the government to act with urgency and moral clarity to prevent further deterioration of the situation,” the letter read.The FCDO has not yet issued a response. However, Falconer has previously reaffirmed the UK’s commitment to working with international partners to promote “longer-term stability” in the region.The protests initially began with demands for a regular and subsidised supply of flour and electricity in PoK.Over time, the movement has grown to encompass a wider array of issues, including reducing the privileges of the Kashmiri elite, abolishing reserved assembly seats, and securing access to free education and healthcare. Activists say the renewed demonstrations stem from the government’s failure to fully implement earlier agreements with protesters, fuelling widespread frustration across local communities.The protesters have now submitted a 38-point charter of demands, calling for measures such as ending the 12 reserved seats for refugees, rolling back elite privileges, completing pending road construction projects, providing tax relief, maintaining subsidies on flour and electricity, and reforming the judiciary.",Kashmir All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) writes to UK government over protests.

LONDON: Bodies representing Indian students, UK academics and UK universities have slammed plans by Labour to impose a levy on international students to pay for maintenance grants for domestic students from low-income families at university or college, saying it will put off international students and hit university finances hard.UK education secretary Bridget Phillipson pledged to introduce the new means-tested maintenance grants by the end of this parliament in her speech at the Labour Party conference on Monday.The grants will be fully funded by a new international student levy, the Labour Party confirmed, saying this would “ensure revenue from international students is used to benefit working-class domestic students”.The immigration white paper published in May had proposed a 6% levy on international student fees.INSA UK president Amit Tiwari said a 6% levy risked pricing Indian students out of Britain’s higher education market.In the year ending June 2025 Indian students were the second-largest cohort, after Chinese students, to study in the UK, with 98,014 study visas granted.“Indian students alone contributed over £4 billion to the UK economy last year,” Tiwari said. “Adding a new charge will push them towards Canada, Australia and the US.”Policy consultancy Public First predicts a 6% levy will lead to a loss of 16,100 international students in the first year, leading to a £240 million loss of fee income to the sector, and a loss of 77,000 international students in the first five years, leading to a loss of £2.2 billion.The shortfall of funds could lead to 33,000 fewer places for British students in the first year, and 135,000 fewer places in five years.Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, said a levy would mean universities have even less of their scant resources to invest into expanding access.Jonathan Simons, partner at Public First, said: “Around 40% of our universities are currently in deficit; a levy will lead to a further loss of jobs and places for UK students. There is a real danger that the very students govt wishes to help won’t be able to access a course at all because the international students won’t be there to subsidise them.”“Treating international students as cash cows to fund maintenance grants amounts to robbing Peter to pay Paul,” said Jo Grade, general secretary of University and College Union. “This country is already charging international students through the roof.","UK education secretary Bridget Phillipson pledged to introduce the new means- tested maintenance grants by the end of this parliament.

Prince William and Kate Middleton face backlash over “no-go zone” near Windsor home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/prince-william-and-kate-middleton-face-backlash-over-no-go-zone-near-windsor-home/articleshow/124256239.cms,"Prince William & Kate Middleton's ‘Forever Home’ Dream Leaves Neighbours Homeless

What changed on the ground

Cranbourne Gate, a popular entrance used by local dog walkers and cyclists, has been permanently shut despite residents paying for annual passes to use it.

Gates at Sandpit Gate, Woodend Gate and South Forest have also been closed to the public.

The restrictions are legally enforced under Section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, making entry without permission a criminal offence.

Security measures now include fencing, round-the-clock surveillance, and tree planting to increase privacy.

Voices of frustration

“We have walked our dogs here for 20 years. To be told we cannot anymore feels like a kick in the teeth,” said one resident.

“We pay for the park through passes and maintenance. Now part of it is closed off without much explanation,” another added.

“It is frustrating, but they are high-profile figures. I can understand why their team wants maximum protection.”

Windsor Great Park: history and symbolism

A pattern of royal security clashes

When William and Kate moved to Adelaide Cottage in 2022, additional security measures drew concern from nearby residents.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s tenure at Frogmore Cottage also led to debates about security funding and access limitations.

Buckingham Palace itself has seen long-running disputes over traffic restrictions, public protests and the balance between safety and visibility.

Why this row matters beyond Windsor

Privacy versus public access

Local impact

Image of the monarchy





Prince William and Kate Middleton are preparing to move into Forest Lodge, a Georgian mansion within Windsor Great Park. The property is intended to serve as their long-term family base. But the decision has provoked anger among locals after a large exclusion zone was imposed around the estate.The restricted area spans about 150 acres and is enclosed by a 2.3-mile perimeter. Access points that residents have used for decades are now closed. Security fences, cameras, tree cover and privacy screens are being set up to prevent outsiders from approaching or viewing the royal property.While royal security is always a sensitive subject, the changes have reignited the long-standing debate in Britain about how much public space should be restricted for the benefit of the monarchy.For many in the Windsor area, the change means longer journeys, blocked walking routes and the loss of familiar open spaces.Locals have expressed deep disappointment at the speed and scale of the restrictions. Many say they were given little notice.At the same time, some community members recognise the security needs of the Prince and Princess of Wales.Officials have responded by stressing that the restricted area represents a very small portion of Windsor Great Park, which stretches across thousands of acres.The dispute matters because Windsor Great Park is not just a green space. The park has been a royal hunting ground, ceremonial site and public space for centuries. It covers more than 5,000 acres and attracts walkers, cyclists and tourists from across the world.Historically, the park was the preserve of monarchs and aristocrats. Over time, large sections were opened to the public. That shift helped reinforce the royal family’s image of accessibility and connection with ordinary citizens. Restrictions on routes and entrances, therefore, can feel like a reversal of that tradition.This is not the first time royal security has clashed with public rights.These examples show the tension between maintaining strong protective boundaries and keeping the royal family connected with the public.High-profile figures require extraordinary security. But the closure of traditional paths inside Windsor Great Park strikes at a larger issue: how much public land should be sacrificed to protect the royals.The changes affect everyday life. Dog walkers have to reroute, cyclists face longer journeys and some residents feel they have lost the value of annual passes.The royals are under pressure to maintain public support in a changing Britain. Moves that look like exclusion can feed a narrative of distance at a time when the family tries to show relatability and modern relevance.William and Kate are expected to move into Forest Lodge later this year. Whether the protests subside or continue will depend on how officials manage local anger. Some campaigners want partial access restored. Others demand compensation for residents who paid for now-useless passes.For the royal couple, the controversy is a reminder that every move they make is scrutinised not just for security, but also for its impact on communities. Windsor Great Park may remain largely open, but the row over Forest Lodge shows that even small areas of exclusion can cause outsized debate in Britain and abroad.","Prince William and Kate Middleton are preparing to move into Forest Lodge, a Georgian mansion within Windsor Great Park.

£5bn Bitcoin scam busted: Chinese national convicted in UK in largest cryptocurrency seizure; pleads guilty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/5bn-bitcoin-scam-busted-chinese-national-convicted-in-uk-in-largest-cryptocurrency-seizure-pleads-guilty/articleshow/124226701.cms,"



A Chinese national pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency, worth more than £5 billion ($6.7 billion).Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, led a large-scale scam in China by cheating more than 1,28,000 victims and storing the stolen funds in bitcoin assets between 2014-2017, the Met Police said in a statement, as per BBC.The Met said that the 47-year-old's guilty plea followed a seven-year probe into a global money laundering web. A total of 61,000 bitcoins were seized from Qian, the Met reported. Police said the probe began in 2018 after receiving a tip-off about the transfer of criminal assets.Qian had been ""evading justice"" for five years up to her arrest, necessitating a complex investigation involving multiple jurisdictions, said Detective Sergeant Isabella Grotto, who led the Met's investigation.She fled China using false documents and entered the UK, where she attempted to launder the stolen money by purchasing property, the Met stated. Qian received assistance from a Chinese takeaway worker named Jian Wen, who was jailed for six years and eight months last year for her role in the criminal operation.Wen, 44, laundered the proceeds from the scam and moved from living above a restaurant to a ""multi-crore rented house"" in North London, according to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) earlier this year.She also purchased two properties in Dubai worth more than £500,000, the CPS reported. The Met said it seized more than £300m worth of bitcoin from Wen. Wen claimed that she bought the properties for an employer from China.However, the CPS stated that the large amount of bitcoin and lack of evidence regarding its acquisition indicated it was from a criminal source. Chinese media outlet Lifeweek reported in 2024 that investors, mostly between 50 and 75 years old, had poured ""hundreds of thousands to tens of millions"" of yuan into investments promoted by Qian. The schemes capitalised on cryptocurrency's popularity in China at the time, promising daily dividends and guaranteed profits, according to Lifeweek.Qian's company claimed it would help China become a hub for finance and technology and showcased projects and investments it said it had across the country. Some of the victims—including business people, bank employees and members of the judiciary—were reportedly urged to invest in Qian's scheme by friends and family.The investors reportedly knew little about Qian, who was described as ""the goddess of wealth."" ""Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are increasingly being used by organised criminals to disguise and transfer assets, so that fraudsters may enjoy the benefits of their criminal conduct,"" said Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor Robin Weyell.""This case, involving the largest cryptocurrency seizure in the UK, illustrates the scale of criminal proceeds available to those fraudsters,"" Weyell added. Monday's conviction marked the ""culmination of years of dedicated investigation"", which involved the police and Chinese law enforcement teams, said Will Lyne, the Met's Head of Economic and Cybercrime Command.The Met stated the investigation is still ongoing. The CPS is working to ensure the fraudsters do not get hold of the stolen funds, the Met reported. Many of the victims had some of their money returned to them by a compensation scheme established in China, the CPS said last year. Qian is being held in custody ahead of sentencing. The date of her sentencing has yet to be fixed.","Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, led a large-scale scam in China.

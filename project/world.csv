'Democrat hoax': Was Trump an FBI informant against Jeffrey Epstein?

Bipartisan push for files





House Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday claimed, in a striking remark, that Donald Trump had served as an FBI “informant” against Jeffrey Epstein — even as the US president dismissed bipartisan efforts to release all federal files on Epstein as a “Democrat hoax.”Johnson, a Republican ally of Trump, said the president had cooperated with federal authorities “for decades,” dating back to Epstein’s association with Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club.“He’s not saying what Epstein did is a hoax — it’s a terrible, unspeakable evil, and he believes that himself. When he first heard the rumour, he kicked him (Epstein) out of Mar-a-Lago. He was an FBI informant trying to take this down,” Johnson told reporters. He added that Trump “has great sympathy for the women who have suffered these unspeakable harms”.The two had discussed the matter “as recently as 24 hours ago”, he further stated.The White House has not commented on Johnson’s assertion.While Johnson sought to defend Trump, the latter has repeatedly dismissed demands for greater transparency in the Epstein case, insisting the push for full disclosure is ""politically motivated.""In Congress, momentum is building for a legislation to declassify the complete Epstein file. Reps. Thomas Massie (Republican; Kentucky.) and Rohit ""Ro"" Khanna (Democrat; California) are leading a bipartisan bill, with Massie also pushing a discharge petition to force a House vote.Massie said on X that 214 lawmakers had signed the petition — just four short of the 218 required. “I’m 99% certain we’ll get 218,” he wrote, warning that Johnson might try to change House rules to block the vote.So far, only three other Republicans — Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace — have signed on, CNN reported. Survivors, frustrated by government inaction, have threatened to compile their own list of Epstein’s alleged associates.Massie further suggested that while survivors’ private list may not appear “any time soon,” lawmakers could use congressional immunity to disclose names on the House floor.",Bipartisan push for files on Jeffrey Epstein is building in Congress.

‘Not surrendering’: NYC Mayor Eric Adams targets Zohran Mamdani; dismisses exit rumors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-surrendering-nyc-mayor-eric-adams-targets-zohran-mamdani-dismisses-exit-rumors/articleshow/123729196.cms,"Eric Adams (AP)





New York City mayor Eric Adams on Friday reaffirmed that he will not step down from his reelection bid, emphasising his commitment to the race amid reports suggesting that he has been approached about a potential role in a future Trump administration.“I am in this race. And I am the only one who can beat Mamdani,"" he said while referring to the democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani “How many times have I been told throughout this journey to step aside, to surrender, to give up, to give in,” he said. “That’s the same thing we tell everyday New Yorkers. Everyday New Yorkers are not giving up, are not giving in, are not surrendering, so their mayor is not going to do that.”Close advisers to US president Donald Trump had been working on a plan to nominate Adams as US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, hoping the move would persuade him to drop his struggling reelection bid, said four people familiar with the talks, as cited by the New York Times.The effort was reportedly pushed by Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff, a Trump aide, who met Adams in Florida this week and spoke with people in the mayor’s circle.The plan, however, appeared to stall by late Friday amid political backlash and growing public criticism of any such deal. Adams held a press conference on Friday afternoon, making it clear that he was not stepping aside.He firmly declared he would stay in the race and dismissed his rivals as “spoiled brats.”“He is free to do what he wants,” Trump said regarding Adams, shortly after the latter made the announcement.The US president went on to comment on the broader race, suggesting that former Governor Andrew Cuomo would have a viable chance against Zohran Mamdani in a direct, one-on-one contest. However, he noted that with multiple challengers in the field, defeating Mamdani would be unlikely.Trump has said previously that he does not want to see Zohran Mamdani, 33, become mayor of the nation’s largest city. He said he would prefer that two of the other leading candidates, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who, like Adams, is running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa, step aside to clear the way for a direct, one-on-one race against Mamdani.","New York City mayor Eric Adams reaffirmed that he will not step down from his reelection bid.

Jimmy Kimmel on Trump’s Crazy Summer, Rumors That He Died & Colbert’s Cancellation





US late-night host Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday dismissed speculation that he was leaving the country. The comedian clarified that despite recently gaining Italian citizenship, he had “no intention” of moving abroad.Kimmel, during his summer break, had appeared on the Sarah Silverman Podcast and mentioned that he had obtained Italian citizenship. Conservative outlets and Trump supporters claimed this meant he was planning to leave the US.Kimmel returned directly addressed those rumours on his show, saying, “I’m not moving to Italy. I never said that. This is where I live. This is my country. I’m not running away from it, especially because of Donald Trump,” he said. He joked that if given a choice, he would move into Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort “just to drive him insane.”Kimmel clarified that his Italian citizenship was unrelated to politics. He said he had been trying to get it for nearly 20 years because of his love for Italy. “Mostly what I like to do is bring my passport to parties and show it to people and make them jealous,” he said with humour.The comedian has often criticised Trump in his monologues. In April, he mocked Trump’s first 100 days in office, saying they were more “prehistoric” than historic.","Kimmel, during his summer break, had appeared on the Sarah Silverman Podcast and mentioned that he had obtained Italian citizenship.

Aleema Khan, sister of Pakistan 's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , was attacked with an egg while addressing reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday.A video of the episode has gone viral on social media, showing the egg hitting Aleema as she spoke to the media.Supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party quickly apprehended two women accused of throwing the eggs and handed them over to police, news agency PTI reported.Rawalpindi police said the arrested women were PTI party supporters who had travelled with members of the All-Government Employees Grand Alliance to protest against unmet demands.The statement added that the egg was thrown after Aleema did not respond to questions from the two women. Both were later taken into custody and moved to the Adiala checkpoint.PTI condemned the act as “shameful,” alleging the women were planted for political motives and accusing police of helping them escape in a car. “The women were sent to Aleema's media talk as part of an agenda,” the party said.Leaders across the political spectrum criticized the attack.Balochistan National Party-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal condemned the act, calling it “the lowest form of politics.”He said, “Even in enmity, a woman deserves dignity. Targeting women is the lowest form of politics, and this cheap stunt must be condemned in the strongest words.”Federal minister for development Ahsan Iqbal said, “Politics must remain a contest of ideas, not of violence or hatred. We should all work to keep it healthy and respectful.”Meanwhile, PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique described the incident as “shameful, vile and crude.”Imran Khan has been in prison for more than two years facing multiple charges. In January 2025, a Pakistani tribunal sentenced the former prime minister to 14 years in prison, while his wife, Bushra Bibi, received a seven-year sentence in connection with a corruption case involving land graft.The allegations centred on the acceptance of land from a property magnate in exchange for facilitating money laundering during Khan’s tenure as prime minister.Prior to this verdict, Khan had received three separate convictions related to corruption, disclosure of state secrets, and violations of marriage laws, carrying sentences of 10, 14 and seven years respectively.","Aleema Khan, sister of Pakistan's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, was attacked with an egg while addressing reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday.

‘Department of war’: Trump signs order renaming defence department; what it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/department-of-war-trump-signs-order-renaming-defence-department-what-it-means/articleshow/123728737.cms,"US president Donald Trump (AP photo)

What the renaming means





US president Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order renaming the Department of Defence as the Department of War.The Department of War was created in 1789 to oversee the Army. It carried the name until president Harry Truman reorganised the military in 1947, merging the Army, Navy and newly created Air Force under the Department of Defence.Trump said the change was meant to reflect American military toughness. “It’s a much more appropriate name, especially in light of where the world is right now,” he said. He argued that the Defence title was “woke” and insisted, “We decided to go woke and change the name to Department of Defence. So we’re going Department of War.”Trump earlier argued that the War title “just sounded better,” telling reporters in August, “Everybody likes that we had an unbelievable history of victory when it was Department of War. Then we changed it to Department of Defense.""Trump cannot legally bring back the old name on his own, as only Congress can make that change. His executive order, signed on Friday, does not make it official.Instead, the White House said the “Department of War” will be used only as a secondary title for the agency, writes Forbes. Defence secretary Pete Hegseth will also be able to identify himself as “secretary of war” in official documents and ceremonies.The order also tells Hegseth to propose steps needed to permanently change the Department of Defense’s name to the Department of War.The renaming marks a symbolic shift, reflecting Trump and Hegseth’s push to roll back what they call “woke” policies in the military. It also ties back to earlier efforts to restore names of bases once linked to Confederate leaders, which had been renamed under a 2023 law.The move does not change the structure or powers of the Pentagon, but it revives a historic label first introduced under George Washington in 1789 and retired after World War II.At the announcement, defence secretary Pete Hegseth supported the move, saying: “We haven’t won a major war since the name change. We’re going to go on offence, not just on defence.”Democrats sharply criticised Trump’s move to rename the Department of Defence, arguing that it glorifies “war” while doing little for troops. They called it a costly and performative step instead of a real investment in service members.Senator Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran, told Reuters: “Why not spend this money on military families or on diplomats who help prevent wars? Trump would rather use the military for political points than strengthen national security or support our servicemembers.”","Department of War was created in 1789 to oversee the Army.

From ‘Lost India To China’ To PM Modi's Praise: Donald Trump Rushes Into Damage Control Mode





: Slipping into damage control mode after he and his lieutenants singed ties with India with incendiary remarks, US President Donald Trump on Friday said US and India have a special relationship and there is ""nothing to worry about. ""Hours after his ""Truth Social"" post saying he had lost India and Russia to China, Trump did an about turn in a White House chat with media, asserting, “I don’t think we have (lost India). I’m disappointed that India is buying Russian oil and I’ve let them know with very big tariff...50% tariff.""""I will always be friends with Modi... he is a great Prime Minister, ... I just don't like what he is doing at this particular moment, but India and the United States have a special relationship. There is nothing to worry about,"" Trump said, when asked by ANI if he is ready to reset the relationship.The remarks came after New Delhi bluntly rejected US demand that it stop buying Russian oil, with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman defiantly saying, “Where we buy our oil from, especially a big-ticket foreign exchange item...we will have to take a call on what suits us best.”“We will undoubtedly be buying (Russian oil),” she told CNN-IBM.Separately, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal adopted a more conciliatory tone, saying the trade row was just a temporary wrinkle in an otherwise consequential relationship that will not be easily derailed.That message came after US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick publicly laid out a laundry list of US demands from India, including not buying Russian oil and pulling out of BRICS and predicted that India would make a trade deal with Trump within two months after saying sorry.Separately, White House trade counselor Peter Navarro, Lutnick's comrade-in-incendiary rhetoric, reacted to a Washington Post story about the damage he is doing to the relationship, saying ""India can't handle truth/spins @washpo Leftist American fake news."" Navarro has accused India of being ""Kremlin's laundromat"" and characterized the Russia-Ukraine war as ""Modi's war"" among other offensive comments.Ridiculed even in the US for faking quotes for his book, Navarro and his MAGA cohorts are now canvassing for tariffing foreign remote workers, including outsourcing to India, action that would tip the relationship into uncharted territory.Trump's latest on Modi: I get along very well with Modi. In fact, we went to the Rose Garden and the grass was so soaking wet. It was such a terrible place to have a news conference. I said, well, let's use a beautiful white stone, emblematic of the White House, and it's been very well received. But we had a news conference on the grass. It was my last news conference I had on the grass because everybody sunk in. You probably sunk in. Every reporter out there, they ruined their shoes.","US President Donald Trump on Friday said US and India have a special relationship and there is ""nothing to worry about"" The remarks came after New Delhi bluntly rejected US demand that it stop buying Russian oil, with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman defiantly saying, “We will have to take a call on what suits us best”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123728680,imgsize-929805,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump-and-pm-modi-file-photos.jpg"

US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that Democrat Zohran Mamdani is likely to become New York City's next mayor unless two of his three major rivals drop out. However, the Republican leader declined to name which candidates he thought should quit.Speaking at a White House dinner with tech executives, Trump denied urging anyone to exit the race but suggested the crowded field benefits Mamdani. ""I don't think you can win unless you have one-on-one, and somehow he's gotten a little bit of a lead,"" Trump said. ""I would like to see two people drop out and have it be one-on-one, and I think that's a race that could be won.""Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, became the presumptive frontrunner after defeating former governor Andrew Cuomo in June's Democratic primary. But both Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams remain on the ballot as independents, joined by Republican Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels.Behind the scenes, Trump allies have floated scenarios for narrowing the race. Intermediaries recently reached out to Adams' circle about the possibility of him dropping his campaign for a federal role, according to people familiar with the talks, AP reported. Adams, indicted last year on corruption charges before prosecutors dropped the case, has said he will not leave the race.""No pressure, no diamonds,"" Adams said Thursday.Cuomo has openly called for Adams to quit, arguing that Mamdani poses ""an existential threat"" to Democrats. Sliwa, meanwhile, rejected speculation that Adams' voters would automatically migrate to Cuomo and insisted he is staying in the race. ""I can assure you for the 9,852th time: I'm not dropping out. I'm in it until November 4,"" Sliwa said.Meanwhile, Mamdani threw down a challenge to Trump, daring him to face off in a televised debate. This came after Cuomo urged him to take part in five debates, one in each borough.""Let's cut out the middle man,"" Mamdani told The New York Post. ""Why should I debate Donald Trump's puppet when I could debate Donald Trump himself?""""If Donald Trump is serious about intervening in the mayoral race, he should come to New York City and debate me directly about why he's cutting SNAP benefits for hungry New Yorkers to give tax breaks to his wealthy donors,"" Mamdani told New York Post.","US President Donald Trump says Democrat Zohran Mamdani is likely to become New York City's next mayor unless two of his three major rivals drop out.

The White House on Thursday announced that US President Donald Trump is renaming the department of defence to ""department of war,"" fulfilling his long-standing wish of rebranding it to project a more powerful image.White House, in an official statement, said that Trump will sign an executive order permitting use of the ""department of war"" as a ""secondary title"" for the sprawling department, as Congress establishes its official title.According to Fox News, the move to formally restore the Pentagon's historic name, directing the department of Defence to be once again called the department of war is part of the administration's ""warrior ethos"" campaign.It will make ""department of war"" a secondary title for the agency, with defence secretary Pete Hegseth adopting the title ""secretary of war."" A White House fact sheet says the order also instructs Hegseth to propose legislative and executive steps to make the change permanent.The rebranding will extend beyond titles. A White House official said Pentagon websites and signage will be updated, including renaming the public affairs briefing room the ""Pentagon War Annex.""Longer-term changes are being planned.Trump has teased the shift in recent days, telling reporters on August 25, ""Everybody likes that we had an unbelievable history of victory when it was department of war.

US president Donald Trump on Thursday hosted a dinner at the White House with America's top tech leaders. The meeting focused on artificial intelligence and investments in the United States.More than a dozen CEOs attended the event, including Bill Gates, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai. Trump, seated between first lady Melania Trump and Zuckerberg, asked each executive to share how much their companies were investing in America.One conspicuous absence was Elon Musk. The Tesla and SpaceX chief, once among Trump’s closest industry allies, has distanced himself in recent months following clashes over space policy and government contracts.Five Indian-origin executives — including Satya Nadella (Microsoft), Sundar Pichai (Google), Sanjay Mehrotra (Micron), Vivek Ranadive (TIBCO) and Shyam Sankar (Palantir) — were at the table. Their presence underscored the growing clout of Indian Americans in Silicon Valley and Washington, even as Trump moved to crack down on immigration.Trump brushed aside the significance of Friday’s jobs report, arguing that the “real economic numbers” will only be visible a year from now.He also downplayed current gains as being mostly construction-related and promised that the US would soon witness job growth “like our country has never seen before.”When asked if he planned to speak with Russian president Vladimir Putin, Trump confirmed, “I will be, yeah. We’re having a very good dialogue.” The remark came as Russia’s war in Ukraine drags on with no ceasefire in sight. Trump added that resolving the conflict had turned out to be “a bit tougher” than he initially expected, despite his claimed success in settling seven other wars.Sundar Pichai thanked Trump, telling him, “I’m glad it’s over” after a US judge threw out a landmark case that sought to break up Google’s Chrome browser. The ruling sparked a surge in Alphabet’s market value, which crossed $2.5 trillion this week. For Pichai, the dinner was a chance to reset ties with an administration that had frequently accused Google of bias.Bill Gates openly praised Trump’s Covid-19 vaccine initiative, calling it a model for rapid medical innovation. He said Microsoft was committed to helping the US government in disease research and listed ongoing projects on HIV, polio and sickle cell. Gates’ comments were made just hours after RFK Jr’s contentious hearing over vaccine policy.Trump said he did not watch health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr’s Senate testimony but heard he performed “very well.” Calling Kennedy a “very good person” who “means very well,” Trump noted he appreciates his different ideas, even if they are contentious. The hearing itself was marked by heated clashes over Kennedy’s sweeping health care and vaccine policy changes.","US president Donald Trump hosted a dinner at the White House with America's top tech leaders.

America goes on the offensive replacing DoD with war department,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/america-goes-on-the-offensive-replacing-dod-with-war-department/articleshow/123728801.cms,"



TOI correspondent from Washington: A president who came to office as peacemaker pledging no more wars will rebrand the US department of defence as the department of war on Friday.In yet another of his quixotic acts, MAGA supremo Donald Trump maintained that department of war has a ""stronger sound"" and the change would reflect offensive capability that is missing in the name being eclipsed. ""As you know, we won World War I. We won World War II. We won everything. We want to be defensive, but we want to be offensive, too, if we have to be,"" he told reporters in a brief preview of the makeover.The announcement, which had been in the works for weeks, came 48 hours after China rolled out a spectacular military parade showcasing impressive advances in hardware that clearly rattled Washington. Trump maintained that the US was still ahead of China in its capabilities, but the renaming was necessary because ""defence is too defensive"".Trump's defence secretary Pete Hegseth, who will consequently be called war secretary, said the department had already re-established a ""warrior ethos"", asserting the name change would refocus the military on its core mission of ""warfighting, lethality, meritocracy, standards and readiness"" and away from what he has described as ""woke culture"" and social issues.There was instant smackdown of the renaming from critics, some of whom saw it as a wasteful distraction from more pressing matters.The renaming is expected to cost millions of dollars as everything from signboards to seals to stationery and publications will need to be changed.Trump was also taunted for insisting on a change because of his sketchy military record. ""Only someone who avoided the draft would want to rename the department of defence to the department of war,"" said Mark Kelly, Democratic Senator from Arizona and a former Naval officer and retired astronaut, referring to Trump's bailing out on service citing bone spurs. ""Nothing says Nobel Peace prize quite like the changing the name of the department of defence to the department of war,"" another social media critic noted.The DoD, informally called the Pentagon because it is headquartered in a building in that shape, was originally called the war department going back to the days of the first President George Washington. A 1949 amendment changed it to the department of defence.The rationale behind the renaming evoked a scabrous commentary by the insightful comedian George Carlin, who in a 1990 skit shredded America's penchant for war.""We like war! We're a war-like people! We like war because we're good at it...because we get a lot of practice. This country's only 200 years old and already, we've had 10 major wars. We average a major war every 20 years in this country so we're good at it! And it's a good thing we are because we're not very good at anything else anymore! Can't build a decent car, can't make a TV set or a VCR worth a f**k, got no steel industry left, can't educate our young people, can't get health care to our old people, but we can bomb the shit out of your country all right! Especially if your country is full of brown people!"" Carlin observed in a comedic take-down of Washington's perennially offensive posture.","Donald Trump will rename the US department of defence as the department of war on Friday.

‘Non-controversial vaccines’: Trump says people should take ones that work; distances himself from Florida policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/non-controversial-vaccines-trump-says-people-should-take-ones-that-work-distances-himself-from-florida-policy/articleshow/123728580.cms,"AFP file photo





US president Donald Trump on Friday said Americans should take vaccines that are “not controversial,” as he distanced himself from Florida’s plan to scrap all vaccine mandates, including those for schoolchildren.Trump’s remarks came when a reporter asked for his response to the new policy pushed by Florida governor Ron DeSantis. It also comes at a time when his health and human services secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, is facing criticism inside the CDC for his long-held scepticism of vaccines.“I think we have to be very careful,” Trump said. “Look, you have some vaccines that are so amazing.” He praised the polio vaccine as “amazing” and noted that many people consider the Covid-19 vaccine to be the same.“I think you have to be very careful when you say that some people don’t have to be vaccinated. It’s a very tough position,” he added. “Look, you have vaccines that work. They just pure and simple work. They’re not controversial at all. And I think those vaccines should be used; otherwise, some people are going to catch it and they endanger other people. And when you don't have controversy at all, I think people should take it.Meanwhile, Kennedy, whom Trump has continued to back, has drawn criticism for his actions as health secretary. In June, he dismissed all 17 members of the federal vaccine safety advisory committee and replaced them with his own picks. The FDA tightened its rules in August on who can receive the latest Covid-19 vaccines, recommending them only for people over 65 or those with underlying health conditions.Trump also fired CDC director Susan Monarez on August 27 after she clashed with Kennedy on vaccine policy.Kennedy faced a heated Senate finance committee hearing on Thursday, where he refused to accept that more than 1 million Americans died from coronavirus. “I don’t know how many died. I don’t think anybody knows because there was so much data chaos coming out of the CDC,” he said.","Florida governor Ron DeSantis wants to scrap all vaccine mandates, including those for schoolchildren. “I think we have to be very careful,” Trump said.

US President Donald Trump on Friday said that he will always be friends with Prime Minister Narendra Modi but added that he does not like what PM Modi is doing at this particular moment.While talking to reporters at the Oval Office, Trump said that the Washington and New Delhi shares a ""very special relationship"" and adding that there is ""nothing to worry about"" in the ties between the two countries.""I always will. I'll always be friends with (PM) Modi. He's a great Prime Minister. I'll always be friends, but I just don't like what he is doing at this particular moment. But India and the United States have a very special relationship,"" Trump said.""There is nothing to worry about. We just have moments on occasion,"" he added.Trump also responded to his earlier post on Truth Social, where he said the US had ""lost India and Russia to China.""""I've been very disappointed that India would be buying so much oil from Russia. I let them know that. We put a very big tariff on India- 50 per cent, very high tariff. I get along very well with (PM) Modi as you know. He was here couple of months ago, in fact we went to the Rose Garden and had a press conference,"" he said.This comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently attended the SCO summit in China amid the ongoing tussle with US over 50% tariffs.Trump has imposed 25 per cent reciprocal tariffs on India and an additional 25 per cent for Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil.India has termed the tariffs imposed on it as “unjustified and unreasonable.”“Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” India has said.Meanwhile, on Friday, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that most of Trump's sweeping global tariffs are unlawful.","US President Donald Trump on Friday said that he will always be friends with Prime Minister Narendra Modi but added that he does not like what PM Modi is doing at this particular moment.

""Everybody wants it there because it's right next to the airport, it's the best location, it's beautiful, a beautiful everything. ""Trump, who has faced repeated accusations of enriching himself during his presidencies, emphasised that he would not personally profit from hosting the summit. ""We will not make any money on it. We're doing a deal where it's not going to be money, there's no money in it. I just want it to go well,"" he said, as quoted by AFP.He also noted practical reasons for the choice, saying that most Miami hotels are usually fully booked in December. ""Each country will have its own building. I think it will be really a beautiful thing,"" Trump added.Trump, a native of New York who has made Florida his home, owns Mar-a-Lago in West Palm Beach and the Doral resort near Miami. He had previously proposed hosting the 2020 G7 summit at Doral during his first presidency, but that plan faced intense criticism from Democrats, who called it a “brazen example” of presidential corruption.The summit was eventually canceled due to media backlash and the Covid-19 pandemic.Regarding international leaders, Trump said he would be open to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping attending the 2026 summit. ""I would love them to, if they want to,"" he said. ""They would be observers, and I'm not sure if they'd want to come as observers,"" even though both countries are G20 members.Trump also confirmed that he would skip this year’s G20 summit in South Africa and instead send vice president JD Vance.

US navy Seals shot and killed several North Korean civilians during a covert operation in 2019, according to a New York Times report published Friday.The mission, which aimed to plant a listening device inside the country, was personally approved by then-President Donald Trump as he prepared for high-stakes talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.The plan was designed to close a “blind spot” in US intelligence by intercepting Kim’s communications, potentially giving Trump an advantage before their summit. But the mission unraveled when a detachment of Seals encountered civilians diving for shellfish.The Americans opened fire, killing everyone on a small fishing vessel, the report said, without specifying the number of casualties.In 2019, the Seals were dispatched to North Korean waters in a nuclear-powered submarine and deployed in two mini-subs to reach the shore. A team of eight was supposed to slip past border forces, install the device, and escape undetected. Instead, after the deadly encounter, the unit withdrew without completing its task.A classified Pentagon review later concluded the killings were justified under the rules of engagement, the Times reported. Neither Washington nor Pyongyang has ever publicly acknowledged the botched operation. White House officials had initially warned that even a small military action risked provoking “catastrophic retaliation” from North Korea The newspaper said the plan drew inspiration from a similar mission approved by former President George W Bush in 2005. The White House, Pentagon, and US embassy in Seoul did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Since Trump’s last summit with Kim in 2019, diplomatic talks have collapsed as North Korea accelerated its nuclear and missile programs. This week, Trump claimed US forces killed 11 people in a strike on a boat in international waters allegedly carrying drugs to the US.The White House provided few details, saying the operation targeted Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang.",US navy Seals shot and killed several North Korean civilians during a covert operation in 2019.

TOI correspondent from Washington:: Amid the tumult of what is basically a trade war Trumpian America has declared on India, an incongruous spectacle is unfolding in Alaska between the two countries. They are in the midst of one of the largest bilateral military exercises in terms of troops mobilized by the Indian Army.In what could well be a form of good natured trolling, India on Friday underscored the ongoing Exercise Yudh Abhyas (war practice) 2025 in Fairbanks, Alaska, describing it as ""elevating India US Strategic and Defence Partnership,"" hours after Trump had suggested New Delhi and Moscow had thrown their lot with Moscow and Beijing.""Today, Yudh Abhyas stands as a flagship, high-complexity Army-to-Army exercise. It has become one of the cornerstones of India US military cooperation,"" the Indian Embassy in Washington said in a press release, underlining that ""India conducts more military exercises with the US than with any other country.""The release was accompanied by photographs of military personnel from both sides fraternizing during the 21 st edition of the exercise that commenced on September 1 at Fort Wainwright and will continue through September 14.An Indian Army contingent comprising 450 personnel led by a battalion of the Madras Regiment is training alongside US soldiers from the 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment (“Bobcats”), part of the 1st Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Arctic Wolves), 11th Airborne Division, the release said.This edition of the exercise, the release revealed, emphasizes Mountain and high-altitude operations under sub-arctic conditions; Heliborne and air-mobility integration, backed by artillery and aviation assets; Electronic warfare, surveillance, and counter-drone systems; Medical evacuation and combat casualty care in field conditions; and Live-fire tactical drills to validate seamless interoperability.Since its inception in 2002 as a platoon-level exercise, Yudh Abhyas has expanded greatly both in scope and participation, the release said, adding that past editions have explored diverse terrains: high-altitude warfare in India’s Auli and Chaubattia; desert manoeuvres in Rajasthan; urban and cold environment training at Joint Base Lewis-McChord and Alaska.The timing of the release mid-exercise appeared to suggest New Delhi believes the trade dispute will blow over, and longer term U.S-India engagement and equities will remain intact.""It (the exercises) demonstrates how our two democracies continue to work towards peace, security and prosperity, including in the Indo-Pacific region,"" the Embassy release said, amid concern in many quarters that Trump is down on the Quad and ready to jettison the Indo-Pacific formulation to enhance New Delhi's role in the region.Several bureaucrats have told TNN in background conversations that the US officialdom is not on the same page as the White House, where India policy is being driven by ""trade whisperers"" who are feeding into Trump's biases on the issue without regard to a broader partnership between the two countries.","India on Friday underscored the ongoing Exercise Yudh Abhyas (war practice) 2025 in Fairbanks, Alaska.

Congressional support





US President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order renaming the Department of Defense as the Department of War, reviving a historic title last used in 1947.Trump said the change was meant to reflect American military toughness.“It's a much more appropriate name, especially in light of where the world is right now,” Trump said. He added that the old title was “woke” and insisted, “We decided to go woke and change the name to Department of Defense. So we're going Department of War.”The Department of War was created in 1789 and oversaw the Army until President Harry Truman reorganised it in 1947, merging it with the Navy and newly created Air Force into the Department of Defense.Trump has argued that the War title “just sounded better,” telling reporters in August, “Everybody likes that we had an unbelievable history of victory when it was Department of War. Then we changed it to Department of Defense,” as quoted by AP.Pentagon leader Pete Hegseth , who joined Trump at the announcement, welcomed the move. “We haven't won a major war since” the name change, he said. “We’re going to go on offense, not just on defense.”Hegseth and Trump have also targeted what they call “woke” ideology in the military. They recently moved to restore names of nine bases once linked to Confederate leaders, which had been renamed under a 2023 congressional mandate. Because the old names were barred, officials picked replacements with similar namesakes.Some of Trump’s closest allies in Congress are pushing to make the change permanent. Rep Greg Steube of Florida, an Army veteran, said, “From 1789 until the end of World War II, the United States military fought under the banner of the Department of War. It is only fitting that we pay tribute to their eternal example and renowned commitment to lethality by restoring the name of the ‘Department of War’ to our Armed Forces. ”","US President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order renaming the Department of Defense as Department of War.

Challenges in store for green-card sponsoring companies as Trump admin looks at tightening norms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/challenges-in-store-for-green-card-sponsoring-companies-as-trump-admin-looks-at-tightening-norms/articleshow/123723446.cms,"AP photo





The Trump administration has placed green card reforms squarely on its near-term agenda, signalling potential changes that could affect employers, skilled workers, and investors seeking permanent residence in the US.One of the most closely watched proposals will relate to employment-linked green card categories (EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3), which are relied upon by highly skilled professionals, researchers, and employer-sponsored skilled workers.Mitch Wexler, senior counsellor at Fragomen, a global immigration law firm explained that, “The proposed rule would define what constitutes a ‘bona fide job offer’ in employer-sponsored cases and outline the authority of immigration agencies to conduct site visits.”The proposed plan of action in this regard has been outlined by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the recently issued first regulatory agenda of the Trump administration. The proposed rule is slated for publication in January 2026.Immigration experts are largely of the view that the proposed rule would translate into heightened scrutiny of job descriptions, recruitment practices, and wage offers. Employers may need to provide more documentation to prove that a role is genuine and permanent.Further, explicit authorization for USCIS for site visits means employers sponsoring green cards could face more frequent audits and workplace inspections that would push up compliance costs.DHS’s regulatory agenda outlines that the proposed rule would also codify current policy guidance and implement administrative decisions regarding ‘successorship-in-interest’ and ability to pay, If a sponsoring employer merges, is acquired, or restructures, the new company can take over the green card process — but only if it assumes the same job offer, obligations, and pay commitments. This prevents workers from having to restart the process if their employer changes.In this context, an immigration consultant pointed out, that “Smaller companies may find it harder to meet stricter financial and organizational thresholds that may be prescribed under the codified successorship-in-interest norms.”.The proposed rule would also revise (tighten) eligibility criteria for EB-1 category (meant for those having extraordinary abilities and outstanding researchers). Evidentiary requirements for the EB-1, EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW) applications would also be revised. This would make obtaining green cards under these categories more challenging.Individuals can file green card applications on their own only in limited cases – such as the EB-1 category meant for those with extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics. However, EB-1 petitions for outstanding professors/researchers and multinational managers must be filed by an employer.The EB-2 category (meant for professionals with advanced degrees or exceptional ability) generally requires an employer sponsor and a job offer, but if applying under National Interest Waiver, an individual can self-petition without employer sponsorship The EB-3 category (meant for skilled workers with at least two years of experience, professionals with a bachelor's degree) always requires an employer sponsor and a permanent, full-time job offer.Annually the US sets aside only 1.40 lakh green cards for employment-based applicants and there is a 7% per country cap. According to a study by Cato Institute, the employment based green card backlog from India (EB-2 and EB-3 skilled category) has reached 10.7 lakh in March 2023. If factors such as death and ageing out are considered (which will lead to these individuals dropping from the backlog statistics) the wait for a green card is 54 years, else it is a whopping 134 years.Changes are also in store for the EB-5 program or investment linked green card program. In Nov, DHS is expected to publish rules implementing the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 and incorporate feedback from a 2017 public consultation on the Regional Center program. A separate rule is also likely to increase fees.DHS says the reforms are intended to strengthen the integrity of these green card programs, and align regulations with existing policy guidance and administrative decisions.Wexler adds that the regulatory agendas are an early indication of policy direction: most proposals must first be published in draft form, followed by a 30- to 60-day public comment period. Agencies are required to review feedback before issuing final rules, which also need clearance from the Office of Management and Budget — a process that typically takes several months. In urgent circumstances, interim or temporary rules may be implemented on an expedited basis.",The proposed plan of action in this regard has been outlined by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the recently issued first regulatory agenda of the Trump administration. The proposed rule is slated for publication in January 2026.

US President Donald Trump on Friday again slammed bipartisan demands for the release of Epstein files, calling the high-profile investigation into the deceased sex offender “a Democrat hoax. ”Trump defended his administration’s handling of the documents while criticising Democrats and framing the case as politically motivated.Taking to his Truth Social Friday, Trump said Democrats “did nothing about Jeffrey Epstein while he was alive except befriend him, socialise with him, travel to his Island, and take his money” and claimed those calling for transparency are disingenuously “seeming to show such love and heartfelt concern for his victims.”“The now dying ... Epstein case was only brought back to life by the Radical Left Democrats because they are doing so poorly, with the lowest poll numbers in the history of the Party ... while the Republicans are doing so well, among the highest approval numbers the Party has ever had,” he added.Trump repeated his claim that the matter is “merely another Democrat HOAX, just like Russia, Russia, Russia, and all of the others, in order to deflect and distract from the great success of a Republican President, and the record setting failure of the previous Administration, and the Democrat Party,” accusing the opposition of not caring about Epstein’s many victims.His latest remarks come just two days after he criticized a group of Epstein’s victims during an Oval Office appearance alongside the president of Poland.When asked about the Epstein records, Trump called the issue “a Democrat hoax that never ends” and compared it to the decades-long process of releasing files related to the assassination of the late president John F Kennedy, noting that “nobody’s ever satisfied” with what the government has produced in either case.“From what I understand, thousands of pages of documents have been given. But it's really a Democrat hoax, because they're trying to get people to talk about something that's totally irrelevant to the success that we've had as a nation since I've been President,” Trump said.In reality, members of the committee from both parties have complained that much of what has been produced is already in the public domain, and what little is original has been heavily redacted.Trump’s remarks have drawn condemnation from Epstein’s victims and their families, many of whom rallied for transparency at the Capitol while he dismissed the matter.Two House members, Reps Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie, have filed a discharge petition to force a vote on legislation that would order the release of all files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The petition would require a majority of members to sign on to circumvent leadership and hold a vote on the House floor. Even if successful, the bill would likely die in the GOP-controlled Senate.","US President Donald Trump on Friday again slammed bipartisan demands for the release of Epstein files.

IuM-Pakistan claims suicide bomb attack on army convoy in KP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/ium-pakistan-claims-suicide-bomb-attack-on-army-convoy-in-kp/articleshow/123688414.cms,"



A relatively unknown militant group, Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.The outfit claimed the attack, which involved a car rigged with IED, killed more than two dozen members of the Frontier Corps but Pakistan acknowledged only six fatalities. Predictably, it blamed India for the attack. Pakistan claimed to have neutralised five operatives in a 12-hour counter operation but the group asserted that its 'fidayeen' blew themselves up after carrying out the attack. One of the suicide bombers was identified by the group as Abdul Aziz alias Qassid Mohajir, a resident of Afghanistan's Paktika province.The Pakistan army camp suffered massive destruction in the suicide attack. Pakistan military's ISPR played down the incident, the latest in a series of attacks on Pakistani military personnel. ""During early hours of Sept 2, Indian proxy 'Fitna al Khwarij' targeted the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Bannu district. The Indian-sponsored Kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by vigilant and resolute response.In their desperation, the Kahrjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians,"" ISPR said.IuM Pakistan, active since April, comprises fighters from outfits like Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam and Jamaat-Ul-Ahrar. In the last few months, it has claimed multiple attacks in areas like North Waziristan, Miranshah and Tirah Valley. Its strikes included sniper, rocket launcher and grenade attacks, and ambushes on convoys, besides drone strikes. Its formation had attracted criticism from groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan which termed itself as the most structured and legitimate jihadi group in Pakistan.","Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.

In March, the Baloch Liberation Army seized a train, taking passengers hostage and killing off-duty troops in a three-day siege.Since January 1, over 430 people, mostly security forces, have died in attacks by armed groups in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Op Sindoor: Report Reveals Pakistan Lost Rs 1240cr In 2 Months After Shutting Airspace For India

The Express Tribune





Pakistan’s flagship social safety programme, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), is once again under fire for corruption, with the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) uncovering large-scale graft involving its own employees. According to audit findings, as many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million, local media reported on Sunday.Citing the AGP’s revelations,said the rot runs through every level of the bureaucracy. What was envisioned as a lifeline for the country’s poorest has been consistently hollowed out by systemic fraud and abuse. And the Rs 37 million loss, auditors warn, may only scratch the surface.Just months earlier, audit reports for FY24 exposed irregularities worth Rs 141 billion in BISP, ranging from payments to ineligible beneficiaries to bogus biometric verifications and even funds being transferred to the accounts of deceased individuals.“In effect, those entrusted with administering aid to the poor are instead perpetuating poverty,” the report noted.The AGP findings also highlight the involvement of not just BISP employees but also banks and retailers, some of whom were caught illegally skimming fees from beneficiaries using BISP cards. Despite being identified, several perpetrators reportedly “escaped criminal charges despite being caught red-handed and named publicly,”reported.The culture of impunity, it added, remains entrenched. “Even if guilty officials are prosecuted and terminated, recent history has shown that the fear of consequences has not particularly slowed corruption in most government departments, and BISP is no different.”The report stressed that the system’s checks must be tightened: “Controls need to be more proactive, including transparent biometric systems, stricter verification processes and independent monitoring mechanisms.”With BISP catering to roughly 58 million people—nearly a quarter of Pakistan’s population—its credibility carries enormous weight. “Allowing it to become a corrupt and untrusted institution is not just a betrayal of honest and deserving beneficiaries, but of every single taxpayer and international donor supporting the programme,” the report warned.","As many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million.

It included eight baskets covering all major issues between India and Pakistan.The process broke down after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks and has not been revived in its full form since.Dar, who is also Pakistan’s deputy prime minister, said that during the recent conflict, Pakistan’s position was acknowledged internationally through what he described as proactive diplomacy.India conducted precision strikes under Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.In retaliation, Pakistan attempted strikes on Indian military bases on May 8, 9 and 10. Indian forces carried out counter-attacks on several Pakistani military sites.The two countries reached an understanding on May 10 to end the hostilities after four days of cross-border drone and missile strikes.",Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar on Friday said that his country was prepared for a composite dialogue with India on all outstanding issues.

Pakistan blames India for waterlogging on its side of Wagah border,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-blames-india-for-waterlogging-on-its-side-of-wagah-border/articleshow/123573511.cms,".

Flood Threat For Pakistan As India Releases Water From Swollen Rivers Day After Alerting Islamabad





AMRITSAR: Embarrassed by a viral video showing its side of the parade path at Wagah border badly waterlogged - and its Rangers standing in knee-deep water - while the Indian side looks clean, Pakistan has blamed the elevation of Grand Trunk Road on the Indian side for the mess.The fact is India has already implemented a rainwater harvesting system and improved drainage management to prevent waterlogging.Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days. Its side of the parade area at the site of the daily flag ceremony at the Wagah joint checkpost is wallowing in muddy knee-deep water. Sandbags are seen piled up at a few places on the Pakistani side ahead of the ceremony. In contrast, the Indian side is free of water, except for a small area near the international border gates.Sources say Pakistan has raised the elevation of GT Road with Indian authorities. Pakistan also hastily constructed drainage channels and elevated a portion of the road to facilitate water outflow. BSF IG, Punjab Frontier, Atul Fulzele said there was incessant and heavy rainfall on Aug 8-9, and the video was likely from that period.""There has been no waterlogging at any of the three sites of the ceremonial flag-lowering ceremonies - Attari, Hussainiwala, and Sadqi. "" However, several border outposts (BoPs) along the Punjab Frontier were inundated due to heavy rainfall, and some had to be evacuated, he said.BoPs located in enclaves beyond the Ravi river and short of the international border are also being evacuated due to severe flooding.","Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days.

"After Afghanistan quake, many rescuers aided men but not women",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/after-afghanistan-quake-many-rescuers-aided-men-but-not-women/articleshow/123728957.cms,"



The first rescue workers reached Bibi Aysha’s village more than 36 hours after an earthquake devastated settlements across eastern Afghanistan’s mountainous areas Sunday. But instead of bringing relief, the sight of them heightened her fears; not a single woman was among them. Afghan cultural norms, enforced even in emergencies by the ruling Taliban, forbid physical contact between men and women who are not family members.In the village of Andarluckak, in Kunar province, the emergency team hurriedly carried out wounded men and children, and treated their wounds, said Aysha, 19. But she and other women and adolescent girls, some of them bleeding, were pushed aside.“They gathered us in one corner and forgot about us,” she said. No one offered them help, asked what they needed or even approached them.Tahzeebullah Muhazeb, a male volunteer who traveled to Mazar Dara, also in Kunar province, said members of the allmale medical team there were hesitant to pull women out from under the rubble. Trapped and injured women were left under stones, waiting for women from other villages to reach the site and dig them out.If no male relative was present, he said, rescue workers dragged dead women out by their clothes so as not to make skin contact.More than 2,200 people died and 3,600 others were injured in thequake, as per figures released by govt.The response to the quake has epitomised the dual standards women and girls face in Afghanistan, aid groups say, trapped both under the rubble and weight of gender discrimination. In Aysha’s village, not a single female aid worker had come as of Thursday, she said. She and her 3-year-old son had spent the past three nights out in the open. “God saved me and my son... But after that night, I understood — being a woman here means we are always the last to be seen. ”","More than 2,200 people died and 3,600 others were injured in thequake.

"Taiwan Military Aircraft Detection: Taiwan detects 9 Chinese aircraft, 6 vessels around its territory",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/taiwan-mnd-detects-9-chinese-aircraft-6-vessels-around-its-territory/articleshow/117365376.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)

TAIPEI: Taiwan's ministry of national defence (MSD) has detected nine Chinese aircraft and six naval vessels around the island as of 6 am (UTC+8) on Sunday.Among them, four aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's southwestern and eastern Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ).Sharing a post on X, MND wrote, ""9 PLA aircraft and 6 PLAN vessels operating around Taiwan were detected up until 6 am (UTC+8) today.""""4 of the aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's southwestern and eastern ADIZ. We have monitored the situation and responded accordingly,"" the post added.On Saturday, MND detected 17 aircraft and six naval vessels of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) operating around the island. Thirteen of the aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's southwestern ADIZ.In recent weeks, China has been visibly boosting its ability to invade Taiwanese beaches with innovative new naval equipment. This includes the formal launching of an enormous landing helicopter assault (LHA) vessel, the likes of which no other navy in the world possesses, and mass production of floating bridge docks to assist the unloading of ships during beach landings. Both type of equipment are strong indications that China is serious about one day invading Taiwan.The Taiwan-China issue is a complex and longstanding geopolitical conflict centred on Taiwan's sovereignty. Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China (ROC), operates its own government, military, and economy, functioning as a de facto independent state.However, China considers Taiwan a breakaway province and insists on the ""One China"" policy, which asserts that there is only one China, with Beijing as its capital.This has fuelled decades of tension, especially since the Chinese Civil War (1945-1949), when the ROC government retreated to Taiwan after the Communist Party, led by Mao Zedong, took control of mainland China.Beijing has consistently expressed its goal of reunification with Taiwan, using diplomatic, economic, and military pressure to isolate Taiwan internationally. Meanwhile, Taiwan, supported by a significant portion of its population, continues to maintain its independence.",Taiwan detected nine Chinese aircraft and six naval vessels around the island as of 6 am (UTC+8) on Sunday.

"Patients dying in hospital corridors, say British nurses",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/patients-dying-in-hospital-corridors-say-british-nurses/articleshow/117365290.cms,"File photo

LONDON: Patients are dying in the corridors of Britain’s hospitals. Pregnant women are receiving miscarriage treatments in semipublic places. Incontinent patients are cleaned next to vending machines. Those are just some of the shocking revelations in a report published Thursday by the Royal College of Nursing, a British nursing union. In the report, nurses described an overcrowding crisis that they said has led to a collapse in care, confidentiality and dignity across the country’s National Health Service.“Vulnerable people are being stripped of their dignity and nursing staff are being denied access to vital lifesaving equipment,” Nicola Ranger, the general secretary and CEO of the union, said in a statement. The nation’s healthcare staff had reached a “breaking point,” she added in the report.The 460-page report, which features anonymised testimony from over 5,400 nurses surveyed from Dec 18, 2024 to Jan 11, is the latest mayday from British medical professionals. The union granted its members anonymity in order to speak freely, preventing repercussions from employers and protecting patient confidentiality, a spokesperson said.Doctors and nurses have struggled to care for the nearly 70 million people in the UK after years of challenges, including chronic underinvestment in the NHS under Conservative-led govts that held power from 2010 to 2024.The report described how patients have had to wait for CPR as nurses struggled to manoeuvre through a cramped corridor to get there in time. Often, patients endured unhygienic conditions, nurses said. Some had been sprayed with each other’s vomit. Incontinent patients are cleaned in corridors without privacy. The toll is particularly evident for dying people. Patients have had to face their own deaths in cramped and busy places, according to the report, without any privacy. A corpse was discovered in hallways hours after death, a nurse said.“This must be a watershed moment, a line in the sand,” Dr Adrian Boyle, the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said in a statement. Boyle was one of several leading British physicians to express solidarity with the nurses. He called the testimonies “harrowing.”The report, which de scribes a crisis of “corridor care,” comes just months after another blockbuster report found that the NHS was in “critical” condition. Patients routinely waited hours for treatment as doctors tried to work without adequate medical equipment or sufficient space in hospitals, according to that report, which was commissioned by the govt.Many Britons see a functioning NHS — which was created after World War II and delivers healthcare that is free at the point of use to all Britons through a tax-funded model — as a core obligation of their govt.","Nurses say overcrowding has led to a collapse in care, confidentiality and dignity.

Mike Johnson recalls his 'fear' when Joe Biden forgot signing executive order: 'Who is running the country?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mike-johnson-recalls-his-fear-when-joe-biden-forgot-signing-executive-order-who-is-running-the-country/articleshow/117365022.cms,"House Speaker Mike Johnson recalled meeting with Joe Biden (File pics)

President Biden was unsure if he signed a critical executive order during a conversation with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson last year, according to a revelation by Johnson, who said he left the meeting concerned about the nation's leadership.In an interview with Free Press, Johnson claimed that Biden insisted to Johnson that he never issued an order to freeze new liquid natural gas export permits , despite signing it less than a month earlier. The House speaker told the podcast host Bari Weiss that he believed Biden ""genuinely didn't know what he had signed.""The meeting reportedly took place in the Oval Office in early 2024, where they discussed the latest aid package for Ukraine. Johnson questioned Biden over an executive order pausing new permits for American liquid natural gas exports to European allies, a crucial issue for his constituents in Louisiana.""Why would you do that? Cause you understand we just talked about Ukraine, you understand you are fueling Vladimir Putin 's war machine, because they gotta get their gas from him,"" Johnson said he told Biden.Biden appeared bewildered, Johnson noted. ""I didn't do that,"" the president responded, according to Johnson.""Sir, you paused it, I know. I have the export terminals in my state. I talked to those people in my state, I've talked to those people this morning, this is doing massive damage to our economy, national security,"" Johnson recalled telling the president.After initially denying the export freeze, Biden eventually remembered signing the order, explaining it was meant to study the fuel's effects.""I walked out of that meeting with fear and loathing because I thought, 'We are in serious trouble—who is running the country?'"" Johnson said.The interview also got a reaction from Tesla and X owner Elon Musk . ""As I said a few years ago, Biden was not in charge. Whoever controlled his teleprompter was,"" he said.A December report revealed that White House aides had been covering up Biden's mental decline since the beginning of his term, rearranging his schedules and limiting in-person interactions, according to the New York Post.Meanwhile, Biden admitted in a USA Today interview that he wasn't sure if he would have had the ""vigor"" for another term had he won re-election. He dropped out of the 2024 race following a debate performance against now-President-elect Donald Trump , where he gave garbled answers and lost his train of thought. Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who was defeated by Trump in November's presidential race.","House Speaker Mike Johnson recalled meeting with Joe Biden in 2024.

Chicago to see immigration raids next week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/chicago-to-see-immigration-raids-next-week/articleshow/117365160.cms,"Reuters photo

WASHINGTON: The incoming Trump administration intends to carry out “post-inauguration” immigration raids in Chicago next week, according to two people familiar with the planning and correspondence reviewed by The New York Times, an opening step in Trump’s goal to oversee the largest deportation operation in American history.The plan, called “Operation Safeguard” by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, would start Tuesday, the day after Trump is inaugurated, and last until the following Monday, according to the people familiar with it and the correspondence. The dates were still being finalized, however, and could change.The size of the planned operation was unclear. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) routinely conducts deportations in cities throughout the US. But the agency was taking additional steps to ramp up enforcement for the operation and tied it to Trump’s inauguration in a message sent to personnel throughout the agency.Hundreds of agents were asked to volunteer and participate in the “post-inauguration” operation targeting immigrants in the United States illegally. ICE is planning on sending roughly 150 agents to Chicago for the raids.For Trump, the optics of immigration agents sporting ballistic gear and arresting immigrants with uncertain or contested status in a Democratic-led city could be enough. The incoming administration is eager to find ways to send a message that it is cracking down on immigrants without legal permanent status and punishing so-called sanctuary cities — communities like Chicago that refuse to hand over immigrants.Don Terry, a spokesperson for the Chicago police, said the department would not “intervene or interfere with any other govt agencies performing their duties,” but that it “does not document immigration status” and “will not share information with federal authorities.” The planned raids were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.Tom Homan, Trump’s pick to oversee his promised mass deportations, has said the public should expect immigration action in the early days of the Trump presidency that creates “shock and awe.”","The plan would start Tuesday, the day after Trump is inaugurated, and last until the following Monday.

Donald Trump arrived in Washington on Saturday evening (local time) to celebrate with family, supporters, and political allies ahead of his second inauguration as president on Monday, according to the Assoicated Press reports.This marks a triumphant return for the Republican four years after he left the city following the Capitol attack by his supporters.Trump travelled aboard Special Air Mission 47 from West Palm Beach, Florida, accompanied by Melania Trump and their son Barron. The flight number acknowledges his upcoming role as the 47th president. The customary practice involves the departing administration providing government aircraft access to the incoming leadership. However, when President Joe Biden was preparing for his inauguration in January 2021, this tradition was not observed by Trump's administration, necessitating Biden's travel to Washington aboard a private chartered plane.The celebration began with a fireworks showcase at his Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, about 30 miles outside Washington. He arrived in the capital as organisers scrambled to move most of the outdoor inauguration day events, including the swearing-in ceremony, inside due to forecasted frigid temperatures. This will be the first time since President Ronald Reagan's second term in 1985 that the ceremony will be held inside the US Capitol.In a phone interview with NBC News on Saturday, Trump said, ""I think we made the right decision. We'll be very comfortable now.""The inauguration will feature performances by country music stars Carrie Underwood, Billy Ray Cyrus , and Jason Aldean, as well as appearances by actor Jon Voight and wrestler Hulk Hogan. Tech executives Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Shou Zi Chew are also expected to attend.On the inauguration eve, Trump will take part in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery on Sunday, followed by a rally at Capital One Arena and a private dinner.Then, on the Inauguration Day, Trump will participate in the traditional prayer service at St. John's Episcopal Church before heading to the White House for tea with the outgoing president and first lady. The swearing-in ceremony will be held inside the Capitol Rotunda due to the cold weather, followed by an indoor parade and a signing ceremony in the Oval Office.As the soon-to-president looks forward to the formal oath, protesters began taking to the streets in the morning as a light sleet fell. Melody Hamoud, a Washington resident, wore a pink hat from the 2017 march protesting Trump's first inauguration, saying, ""I just didn't want to sit home and fret in front of the TV. I wanted to feel like our movement still has energy and be around others who felt the same.""Meanwhile, talking about the decisions that his administration would work on, Trump confirmed he would likely grant an extension allowing TikTok to continue operating in the US beyond Sunday when a law prohibiting its distribution takes effect. He also stated that his administration would begin its effort to follow through on a campaign promise of mass deportations of migrants living in the country without legal permission ""very early, very quickly.""","Donald Trump arrived in Washington on Saturday evening (local time) to celebrate with family, supporters, and political allies.

Trump's Huge TikTok Announcement In US; Chinese App's CEO Thanks President-Elect | Watch

US President-elect Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he will likely grant TikTok a 90-day extension to negotiate a deal that could prevent the popular video-sharing app from being banned in the country. In an interview with NBC News, Trump said he had not made a final decision but was considering granting TikTok a reprieve after his inauguration on Monday.Under a law passed by Congress and signed by President Joe Biden last year, TikTok's China-based parent company was given nine months to sell its US operations to an approved buyer. The law, set to take effect on Sunday, prohibits mobile app stores and internet hosting services from distributing TikTok to US users. However, the sitting president has the authority to grant an extension if a sale is underway.Trump told ""Meet the Press"" moderator Kristen Welker in a phone interview, ""I think that would be, certainly, an option that we look at. The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate. You know, it's appropriate."" He added, ""We have to look at it carefully. It's a very big situation.""The President-elect said if he decides to grant the extension, he will likely announce it on Monday.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco clarified on Friday that the Biden administration would leave implementing the law to Trump, given that his inauguration falls the day after the ban takes effect.In a statement released Friday, TikTok requested a definitive response from the Biden administration, asking that it not enforce the law or fine app store operators and other US companies if TikTok remains available after Sunday. Without assurances, TikTok warned it might ""go dark,"" without specifying whether it would voluntarily suspend its US operations or shut down after losing access to essential service providers.On Saturday, the White House dismissed TikTok's statement as a ""stunt."" Jean-Pierre said, ""We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday. We have laid out our position clearly and straightforwardly: actions to implement this law will fall to the next administration. So TikTok and other companies should take up any concerns with them.""","US President-elect Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he will likely grant TikTok a 90-day extension to negotiate a deal that could prevent the popular video-sharing app from being banned in the country.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday said his government would not be able to move forward with the truce unless they had received a list of hostages who would be released by Hamas.Netanyahu also said that Israel reserved the ""right to resume war if necessary"" with US support.""We will be unable to move forward with the framework until we receive the list of the hostages who will be released, as was agreed. Israel will not tolerate violations of the agreement. Hamas is solely responsible,"" Netanyahu said in a post on X.The Israeli PM demanded that names of hostages to be freed on Sunday before the prisoner swap , reported news agency AFP.Though uncertainty remains regarding the identities of the 33 hostages scheduled for release during the initial six-week phase and their survival status, the second ceasefire of this war will commence on Sunday.In a significant development on early Saturday, Israel's Cabinet endorsed a ceasefire agreement for Gaza, which would secure the release of numerous hostages and temporarily halt the 15-month conflict with Hamas.This marks a potential turning point in their most devastating confrontation to date.Despite Qatar and the US announcing the ceasefire on Wednesday, the agreement faced delays due to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu citing last-minute complications with Hamas.The Cabinet's decision to meet beyond the start of the Jewish Sabbath highlighted the crucial nature of these discussions. Traditional Jewish law typically restricts government activities during Sabbath except for life-threatening emergencies.Netanyahu has directed a specialised team to prepare for the hostages' return from Gaza, with affected families receiving confirmation of the agreement. The agreement includes the release of numerous Palestinian detainees and promises increased humanitarian assistance to the severely damaged Gaza region.A preliminary list of 737 Palestinian prisoners, primarily women and minors, has already been published by Israel’s justice ministry.The war, triggered by Hamas’s cross-border attack, has left over 46,000 Palestinians dead, according to Gaza’s health ministry, with international calls for a ceasefire growing louder.","Israel's Cabinet endorsed a ceasefire agreement for Gaza, which would secure the release of numerous hostages and temporarily halt the 15-month conflict with Hamas.

LIVE: Thousands attend protest in Washington D.C. ahead of Donald Trump inauguration

Thousands of people from across the United States gathered in Washington, DC, on Saturday to rally for women's reproductive rights and other causes they believe are threatened by the incoming Trump administration. The march, held days before President-elect Donald Trump 's inauguration, echoed the original Women's March that occurred eight years ago at the start of Trump's first term.Marchers expressed their determination to support issues such as women's access to abortion, transgender rights , and combating climate change. The event was one of several protests, rallies, and vigils planned ahead of the inauguration, with over 350 similar marches taking place across every state in the country.Jill Parrish, a participant from Austin, Texas, shared her reason for attending the protest: ""Most importantly, I'm here to demonstrate my fear, about the state of our democracy."" Rick Glatz from Manchester, New Hampshire, said, ""I'm a grandpa. And that's why I'm marching.""Demonstrators marched to the Lincoln Memorial for a larger rally and fair, where organizations at various levels hosted information tables. They carried signs with slogans such as ""Save America,"" ""Against abortions? Then don't have one,"" and ""Hate won't win.""Brief moments of tension arose between protesters and Trump supporters, but police intervened and peacefully separated the groups.Rachel O'Leary Carmona, executive director of Women's March, stressed perseverance, saying, ""Before we do anything about democracy, we have to fight our own despair.""The rally, rebranded as the People's March, sought to broaden support during a reflective moment for progressive organizing following Trump's decisive win in November. While the crowd was significantly smaller than the 500,000 marchers who attended the Washington rally in 2017, participants remained committed to their cause.","Thousands of people from across the United States gathered in Washington, DC, on Saturday to rally for women's reproductive rights.

'Poured a bucket of urine onto Minton’s head'

Allegations of ‘Deranged’ behavior

Feces vandalism alleged by owners

Trakas alleges money extortion

Owners of a TikTok-famous vintage photo booth in New York have sued their neighbor, Maggie Trakas, for engaging in aggressive and unsanitary behavior towards them and their customers. Trakas was so upset by the photo booth set up next door to her Lower East Side home that she allegedly threw a bucket of urine onto the owners and customers, according to the lawsuit.Zoë Lazerson and Brandon Minton, the owners of the popular vintage photo booth located on the Lower East Side in New York City, claim that since opening in December, Trakas has been attempting to disrupt their business. The lawsuit alleges that Trakas has thrown a bucket of urine from her second-story window onto Minton and waiting customers, painted feces along the booth's fence and planters, and made verbal and physical threats.""This is war!"" Trakas reportedly said the day after the booth relocated to its new, more popular location at 145 Allen St. on December 9, according to the lawsuit.On January 5, the lawsuit claims Trakas “leaned out of her second-floor window and poured a bucket of urine directly onto Minton’s head, causing the urine to splash onto queuing customers.” It adds that responding police officers and paramedics confirmed the substance was urine.“While the police and paramedics were writing reports of the incident, Trakas was laughing and taunting the plaintiffs and customers,” the suit states, also alleging she had been drunk earlier in the day and knocked Minton’s phone out of his hands.“I threw vinegar on him later that day,” Trakas said, as quoted by the New York Post. “It was not urine.”“It was cleaning vinegar because he’s been calling me and threatening me,” she said, claiming he referred to her as a “scum bag, Karen, miserable bitch.”She also denied assaulting Minton, saying that he was shoving his phone in her face.The lawsuit alleges that the truly ""deranged"" actions started this month when Trakas referred to booth visitors as “narcissistic r—-ds” on January 2.“I said it was narcissism on steroids,” Trakas told The New York Post.The following day, according to the lawsuit, Minton found “frozen urine” on a chair next to the photo booth.Trakas admits to supergluing locks on Minton's maintenance van, claiming it was in response to him vandalizing her bikes.The most serious allegation in the lawsuit involves Trakas allegedly painting a plywood board with feces and dumping the remains into planters installed by Minton.Minton claims that he arrived at his booth one morning to find it covered in a foul-smelling substance. In the complaint, Minton says that he ""observed what appeared to be feces smeared and dumped all around [a] planter box."" He also alleges that video footage from the night of the incident shows Trakas using ""a paint can filled with brown liquid feces"" to deface a plywood board he had recently installed to block her view of the booth. Minton claims that he and his team had to wear KN-95 masks and spend over three hours cleaning the booth.The lawsuit seeks damages for the alleged vandalism and the time and effort required to restore the photo booth to its original condition. In addition to seeking over $500,000 in damages, the social media influencers have already been granted a temporary restraining order, preventing Trakas from interfering with or vandalizing the booth.Trakas denies the allegations of throwing urine and claims that the lawsuit is an attempt by the booth owners to extort money from her before the potential ban of TikTok, the platform largely responsible for the booth's popularity, according to a report by New York Post.""On the weekends and over the holidays, it has been unmanageable,"" Trakas said, referring to the long lines of people waiting to use the photo booth. ""We're talking up to hundreds of people on the line, all the same age demographic. No one local, not even NYU.""To Trakas, the lawsuit represents “wealthy kids from Utah who showed up in 2023” attempting to “exploit” her.“My sense is because this is a TikTok sensation and Sunday, TikTok might be going away, he’s getting nervous and coming after me and fabricating incredible lies,” Trakas said.The case is ongoing, and both parties maintain their respective positions on the alleged incidents.",Maggie Trakas allegedly threw a bucket of urine onto the owners and customers of a photo booth set up next door to her home.

For Donald Trump and his MAGA millions from across the country, his inauguration was going to be a party like never before.Then Trump announced that an Arctic blast -- which will dump snow on Sunday night and drive temperatures as low as -10c on the morning of the inauguration at noon on Monday -- is pushing the spectacle indoors inside the US Capitol where only a few hundreds can be accommodated, which means place only for the VIPs and elites.Left out in the cold, the disappointed MAGA flock is now making the best of the weather-driven debacle, casing the city for bars and restaurants to watch the spectacle on television. Many have cancelled their trips and are grumbling about the elites bowing to the weather on such a milestone for the movement. ""Trump’s inauguration is being moved indoors due to the dangerously cold weather. At this point let’s just move it to Mar-A-Lago!"" pro-Trump lawmaker Matt Gaetz joked.Democrats are having a field day at MAGA disquiet with snarky gags. Among them ""The great thing about moving Trump’s inauguration to the rotunda (the central hall of) is that all of his supporters already know how to get there,"" a reference to the January 6 uprising when some MAGA elements stormed the Capitol.Except this time only Trump VIPs will get to be at the rotunda. One daily published a photo of a forlorn Navin Adhari, a volunteer who was folding up chairs that have been laid out in neat rows in front of the Capitol steps, with the caption ""Imagine being the guy who just set up 100,000 chairs on the National Mall and they announce they’re moving the inauguration.""Even in the moment of MAGA triumph conspiracy theories abound. Some MAGA principals are suggesting that the real reason Trump was forced to move the inauguration inside is because of extreme security concerns. ""Helicopters are scanning the area for 'nuclear irregularities'"" one Trump supporter wrote on X while another who defended the move indoors argued that the threat from drone attacks has reached unprecedented levels and all it takes is one small drone with poison on the end to take out any world leader.There is as much attention on who won't attend the inauguration as who will. Trump loyalists are excoriating Michelle Obama and Nancy Pelosi for skipping the event, forgetting that Trump and his family did not attend the Biden inauguration either. Others are finding joy in entertainers such as Carrie Underwood and Snoop Dogg, neither of whom are Trumpists, performing at the inauguration.Some are still unhappy over the Trump surrounding himself with tech elites, of whom Bill Gates is the latest to talk up the MAGO Supremo, after a ""long and actually quite intriguing dinner with him"" at Mara Lago last week. Others are even more agitated over foreign tech honchos attendign the inauguration. ""Why is the CCP affiliated TikTok CEO getting front-row access to President Trump’s inauguration? This is a national security threat and goes against everything MAGA stands for. TikTok has been labeled a danger to our country, yet its leadership is being welcomed during one of our country's most significant events,"" raged Laura Loomer, the incendiary Trump loyalist.","Donald Trump's inauguration is being moved indoors due to the dangerously cold weather.

"NYPD Reward: NYPD awards $10,000 to teens who helped capture NYC subway killer after initial denial",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nypd-awards-10000-to-teens-who-helped-capture-nyc-subway-killer-after-initial-denial/articleshow/117358021.cms,"The NYPD has finally decided to give $10,000 in reward money to three heroic teenagers after initially denying them due to a technicality, New York Post reports.The boys, all 14, were praised for their quick thinking and bravery in reporting a subway arson suspect , but were first told they were ineligible for the reward because they used 911 instead of the Crimestoppers hotline .The families of Kingson, Navid, and Christos had felt overlooked when they asked about the promised reward. The NYPD had initially informed them that since the boys called 911, they didn’t qualify. “They told me that since the kids didn’t use the tip hotline and called 911, that’s why they’re not eligible,” Navid’s father said.However, after public outcry and criticism from media reports, the NYPD reversed its decision. The young heroes will now evenly split the reward, and they will also receive a Nintendo Switch, according to their families.“It’s good news. Thank you for picking up on it because I don’t know if this would have happened any other way,” Christos’ mother said after receiving the call. Another parent expressed surprise at the quick turnaround: “It’s interesting. You write an article and then all of a sudden they’re scrambling to do this… literally in that matter of 24 hours?”Despite the good news, there was confusion at first about why the families were misled. Neither the NYPD nor Crimestoppers had kept the families’ contact information, making it unclear how they would be reached if the reward was reconsidered. This raised concerns that the teenagers might miss out on what they deserved.The situation attracted attention from generous individuals, with former MTA chairman and one-time New York Post owner Peter Kalikow stepping in. Kalikow, who created the “See Something, Say Something” slogan, publicly supported the boys and offered to personally match the reward. “These young men called 911 and identified the criminal who set this poor woman on fire and took action to help in his capture,” Kalikow said. “The fact that they didn’t have the Crimestoppers tip line shouldn’t deprive them of this well-earned reward.”The teenagers, overjoyed by the news, have described feeling “over the moon.” Their quick actions on the subway not only led to the arrest of the suspect but also inspired countless New Yorkers to step up and commend their bravery.“It’s good to know people see the value in what we did,” Christos said. “We just did what we thought was right.”On December 22, Navid, Kingson, and Christos spotted suspect Sebastian Zapeta-Calil on a Queens-bound F train. Hours earlier, Zapeta-Calil, a 33-year-old man, had allegedly set a homeless woman named Debbie Kawam, 57, on fire while she slept on the train. The teenagers quickly took action, calling 911 to report their sighting. Law enforcement soon stopped the train, and Zapeta-Calil was arrested.","The boys, all 14, were praised for their quick thinking and bravery in reporting a subway arson suspect.

'Get Out, Illegal Aliens': Trump's Shocking Mass Deportation Raid Order | Key Details

Trump administration planning 'large-scale immigration raid' Tuesday in Chicago: Reports

The US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) will carry out large-scale arrests of undocumented immigrants nationwide starting Tuesday, according to Tom Homan, a top border official in the incoming administration of US President-elect Donald Trump . The move aligns with Trump 's campaign promise to deport millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States.Homan, who previously served as the acting director of ICE and oversaw a policy that separated migrant parents and children at the border during the first Trump administration, told Fox News, ""There's going to be a big raid across the country. Chicago is just one of many places.""""On Tuesday, ICE is finally going to go out and do their job. We're going to take the handcuffs off ICE and let them go arrest criminal aliens,"" he added.Homan stressed that while the focus will initially be on ""public safety threats,"" no one is exempt from deportation if they are in the country illegally.""What we're telling ICE, you're going to enforce the immigration law without apology. You're going to concentrate on the worst first, public safety threats first, but no one is off the table. If they're in the country illegally, they got a problem,"" he said.Reports from the Wall Street Journal and other US outlets suggest that the ""large-scale immigration raid"" in Chicago is expected to commence on Tuesday, a day after Trump's inauguration, and ""last all week,"" involving 100 to 200 ICE officers.Don Terry, a Chicago police spokesman, told the New York Times that the department will not ""intervene or interfere with any other government agencies performing their duties."" However, he clarified that the department ""does not document immigration status"" and ""will not share information with federal immigration authorities.""Chicago is one of several Democrat-led US cities that have declared themselves ""sanctuaries"" for migrants, meaning individuals will not be arrested solely for lacking legal immigrant status.","US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) will carry out large-scale arrests of undocumented immigrants nationwide starting Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: President-elect Donald Trump ’s real estate business partners in India will attend his inauguration on Monday. They include Kalpesh Mehta, founder of Tribeca Developers which is co-developing 10 Trump Towers in India, and Pankaj Bansal , director of M3M developing Trump Tower in Gurgaon. “Had a great day discussing the new Trump India projects with Eric Trump at the stunning Mar-a-Lago club. Deal announcements coming soon!” Mehta said on SM earlier this week.“First time I met Donald Trump Jr in 2017 for the signing up of Trump Towers Delhi NCR. What a fantastic growth story it has been since then. Both the brands have grown strength to strength! Excited to meet again in Washington DC,” Bansal said on SM Saturday.From India, Union external affairs minister S Jaishankar will attend the inauguration. So will Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani and Reliance Foundation founder Nita Ambani.India is a key country for President Trump’s real estate business. Outside of the US, India is likely to get the maximum number of Trump Towers. From four all-residential high-rise luxury residential Trump Towers in Mumbai, Pune, Gurgaon and Kolkata, the number will swell to 10 in next 5-6 years with as many more projects — including office, golf course and villas — going to be built in Noida, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Gurgaon and Pune.“I did my MBA from Wharton, where the Temp family, including President Trump, went to. A professor there connected me to Donald Trump junior. We met at a bar in New York 13-14 years ago and on the back of a cocktail pier napkin discussed and made our initial plans which eventually became a reality. President Trump’s advice when we subsequently tied up and since then has been just this: ‘We don’t want to do too many projects, but whatever we do should we the best in class’,” Mehta (46), who comes from a family of architects, had told TOI last Nov after Trump won the US presidential polls.","President-elect Donald Trump’s real estate business partners in India will attend his inauguration on Monday.

Did Kamala Harris post about an amendment that doesn't exist?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-kamala-harris-post-about-an-amendment-that-doesnt-exist/articleshow/117354021.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris recently stirred debate with a statement asserting that the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) is ""the law of the land."" However, the ERA, despite its historic significance and decades of advocacy, has not been certified as part of the US Constitution, raising questions about Harris’s remarks.The ERA, aimed at guaranteeing equal legal rights regardless of sex, was first introduced in Congress in 1923. It gained momentum in 1972 when lawmakers passed it with the required two-thirds majority and sent it to the states for ratification. Thirty-eight states were needed to ratify the amendment by a deadline initially set at seven years, later extended to ten. However, by the time the deadline expired in 1982, only 35 states had ratified it.More recently, advocates have claimed victory after additional states symbolically ratified the amendment decades later, bringing the total to 38. Harris referenced this movement in her statement, asserting, ""It makes our nation stronger, and it is the law of the land because the American people have spoken in states across our nation.""Despite Harris's claim, the Archivist of the United States has stated otherwise. Archivist Dr Colleen Shogan and Deputy Archivist William J. Bosanko released a detailed response emphasising that the ERA cannot be recognised as part of the Constitution due to established legal deadlines. ""In 2020 and again in 2022, the Office of Legal Counsel affirmed that the ratification deadline is valid and enforceable,"" their statement read. Furthermore, court rulings at multiple levels have upheld these deadlines, leaving the ERA in legal limbo.Harris’s comments come amid renewed calls for gender equality and the protection of civil rights. In her statement, she championed the ERA’s intent, highlighting its importance for women and society at large. ""When we lift up women, we lift up children, families, communities, and all of society,"" she said. However, her assertion that the amendment has been fully enacted contradicts legal and judicial findings.For the ERA to move forward, Congress would need to take new legislative action to remove or extend the ratification deadline. Until then, the Archivist’s office has made it clear that personal opinions, no matter how passionate, cannot override legal precedent.","Vice President Kamala Harris recently said that the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) is ""the law of the land"" However, the Archivist of the United States has stated that the amendment has not been certified as part of the US Constitution.

Pak authorities demolish pre-Partition Ahmadi worship place,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-authorities-demolish-pre-partition-ahmadi-worship-place/articleshow/117361970.cms,"File photo

ISLAMABAD: A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab’s Sialkot district, Pakistani media reported on Saturday.The place was built by Chaudhry Zafarullah Khan , Pakistan’s first foreign minister and an Ahmadi by faith, in his native town of Daska, Sialkot. A renowned lawyer in British India, he was a crucial champion for the Ahmadi cause in significant trials.This historical structure was razed on Jan 16, two days after local authorities claimed that an extension of the structure was illegal as it encroached 13 feet onto a public road, a claim rejected by community members.Despite this, Amir Mahmood, spokesperson for the marginalised community, said they had complied with the govt notice and a wall was constructed on the inner side on Jan 15, but the area’s assistant commissioner, accompanied by police, proceeded with the demolition the next day and flattened the entire structure. “It is clear that using the illegal encroachments as an excuse, the administration targeted and demolished the Ahmadi community’s place of worship,” Mahmood said, adding the structure had not been altered or extended since its original construction by Khan’s family before Partition. He blamed the local administration for continuously targeting the community’s properties and ignoring their grievances.The operation lasted from 7pm until 11pm, and electricity to the place of worship and neighbouring areas was also cut off. The action was not strictly administrative as during the entire time, locals said, a number of people had gathered chanting provocative slogans against the persecuted community. This was the latest in a series of actions targeting Ahmadis. According to data, at least 22 of their places of worship were destroyed across Punjab in 2024.","A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan condemned the court's verdict in the Al Qadir Trust case, calling it a ""mockery"" of justice and pledged to fight till the last ball and refuse any deals, The Express Tribune reported.In a statement shared on social media platforms Facebook and X, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan condemned the court's decision in the Al Qadir Trust case, calling it a premeditated move with the verdict and sentencing already leaked to the media before the official announcement.Khan called the judicial process a ""mockery"" of justice and said that the individuals who wrote the judgement leaked it to the media, undermining the integrity of the legal system, according to The Express Tribune report. PTI founder reiterated his stance against the "" military-backed regime "" and vowed to never accept it.He said, ""I will continue my struggle for true freedom and democracy, even if it means spending more time in jail,"" while emphasising that he will make no compromise on his principles or the fight for Pakistan's true independence, The Express Tribune reported.Imran Khan pledged to continue fighting for democracy, the rule of law, and true freedom for the people of Pakistan. He said, ""We will fight till the last ball, and I will not make any deals. I will face all the false cases brought against me.""He called on the people of Pakistan to read the Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report and compare it to the actions of General Yahya Khan, who he claimed similarly caused the downfall of Pakistan. He said that the current rulers were following the same path, acting in their personal interests and pushing Pakistan towards destruction.On Al-Qadir Trust case , PTI founder accused the judiciary of causing further damaging to its credibility and added that judges who backed ""military rule"" and acted as per their instructions were given rewards. He said that the case should have been focused on Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif and his son for allegedly selling their property worth 9 billion pound to a business tycoon for 18 billion pound, raising questions on the source of their wealth and why they had not given the requested receipts in the Panama Papers case.He accused Pakistan's former chief justice Qazi Faez Isa of facilitating money laundering in the Hudaibiya Paper Mills case , where billions of rupees were forgiven. On Al-Qadir University, Khan called the institution as non-profit, welfare-focused project like other educational ventures like Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Namal University.PTI founder said that he and his wife, Bushra Bibi , did not gain any financial benefit from the university. He called the decision a deliberate attempt to target his wife, Bushra Bibi, who he said has faced repeated false charges and her punishment was part of a broader attempt to pressure him by hurting his family, The Express Tribune reported.He said, ""My wife is a housewife with no connection to politics. She has always stood by me, considering these challenges as tests from Allah.""On negotiations with government, Khan warned that if no progress was made on establishing a judicial commission for May 9 and November 26 incidents, the discussions would be pointless and accused the government of evading accountability.Imran Khan made the remarks after an accountability court in Rawalpindi sentenced Imran Khan to 14 years in prison and Bushra Bibi to 7 years in the 190 million pound Al-Qadir Trust case. After the verdict, Imran Khan's wife was arrested in the court.In addition, Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were asked to pay a fine of PakistRupees (PKR) 1 million and PKR 500,000 respectively. Failure to pay the fines would result in additional six months jail time for Khan and three months for his wife.","Imran Khan condemned court's verdict in Al-Qadir Trust case, vows to 'fight till last ball' Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder called the judicial process a ""mockery"" of justice.

"Imran, wife sentenced to jail in corruption case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-wife-sentenced-to-jail-in-corruption-case/articleshow/117340821.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Jailed Pakistani former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively, after an accountability court found the couple guilty of corruption by receiving land as a bribe from a Pakistani real-estate czar.The makeshift court operating from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where Khan has been incarcerated since Aug 2023, had reserved its verdict three times in the £190-million (about Rs 2,003 crore in Indian currency) Al-Qadir Trust case since Dec last year. Following the ruling, Bushra was arrested from the courtroom.Accountability court judge Nasir Javed Rana also fined Khan Pakistani Rs 1 million ($3,500), while Bibi was fined half that amount.Failure to pay the fines would result in an additional six months in jail for Imran and three months for Bushra, the judge said.According to the verdict, the property of the “sham trust Al-Qadir University Project Trust is hereby forfeited to the federal govt”.“Both convicts are present before the court; they be taken into custody in this case and be handed over to the jail superintendent along with the committal warrant to serve the sentences so awarded,” it added.The couple were indicted in the case on Feb 27, 2024, shortly after the general elections.The case alleges that Khan and his wife had acquired land worth billions of rupees (millions of US dollars) for the Al-Qadir Trust from Malik Riaz Hussain, a prominent property tycoon in Pakistan, to establish a nonprofit educational institute for the poor. In return, Pakistan’s anti-corruption watchdog alleged, Khan’s govt from Aug 2018 to April 2022 had provided legal cover to Riaz’s black money (£130 million), which Britain’s National Crime Agency had recovered and handed over to the Pakistan govt.This has been the fourth major case in which the former cricket star has been convicted. Last year, Khan was convicted in cases related to selling state gifts, leaking state secrets, and unlawful marriage, all of which were later overturned or suspended by the Islamabad high court. Despite this, Khan remains behind bars, with dozens of cases pending against him. He describes the cases as a political witch-hunt.Khan was first arrested in connection with the Al-Qadir Trust case on May 9, 2023, spending just two days in detention. However, the arrest had sparked nationwide protests during which Khan’s supporters had stormed govt buildings and military installations in multiple cities.Speaking to reporters inside the courtroom after his conviction, Imran rejected the notion of striking a deal with anyone to get himself freed from prison. “I will neither make any deal nor seek any relief,” he told reporters, adding that those who stand against dictatorship are punished.His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI)condemned the conviction as a continuation of “bogus persecution” against Khan and his wife. “While the party awaits the detailed decision, it is important to note that the Al Qadir Trust case against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi lacks any solid foundation and is bound to collapse,” the PTI said. “All evidence and witness testimonies confirm that there has been no mismanagement or wrongdoing. Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi are merely trustees, with no further involvement in the matter,” it added.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively.

Pakistan International Airlines: PIA apologises for controversial ad featuring Eiffel Tower after brutal trolling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pia-apologises-for-controversial-ad-featuring-eiffel-tower-after-brutal-trolling/articleshow/117332061.cms,"Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has issued an apology after an advert featuring a plane flying toward the Eiffel Tower sparked outrage online.The image, posted on the airline’s official X account, was intended to mark the first flight to Paris since safety restrictions were lifted, but it quickly drew criticism for its perceived insensitivity.“Unfortunately, this was blown out of proportion, with connotations and perceptions that were not intended,” PIA spokesman Abdullah Khan told AFP. “It may have triggered some negative emotions, for which we sincerely apologise,” he added.The post showed a PIA aircraft heading directly toward the famous French landmark, with the caption “Paris, we are coming today.” Many users on social media compared the visual to the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US, where hijacked planes crashed into the Twin Towers in New York, killing nearly 3,000 people.Thousands of comments pointed out the similarities between the advert and the 2001 attacks, where two planes were flown into the World Trade Center. Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan by US forces in 2011, and a Pakistani militant, currently detained in Guantanamo Bay, is believed to have been the chief mastermind of those attacks.Critics were quick to voice their concerns online.

However, the airline remains barred from flying in the UK and the US.PIA continues to fly to multiple cities across Pakistan, including in the mountainous north, and also serves destinations in the Gulf and Southeast Asia.Despite the backlash, Khan noted that the airline’s return to Europe has been welcomed with positive feedback.

Poll Do You Believe Diplomatic Talks Can Resolve Tensions Between Neighboring Countries? Depends on the Severity of the Situation Yes, They Can Help Find Peaceful Solutions

Why it matters: Pakistan’s waning influence on Taliban

This burgeoning relationship comes at a time of growing tension between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Islamabad, once a staunch ally of the Taliban, now finds itself at odds with Kabul over issues like cross-border militancy and refugee repatriation. The changing dynamics between these three players have implications for regional trade, security, and diplomacy.

Pakistan has historically maintained a stronghold over Afghanistan through its support for the Taliban, often viewed as a strategic counterweight to India. However, tensions between Islamabad and Kabul have reached a boiling point. Pakistan accuses Afghanistan of harboring militants from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has been responsible for escalating attacks in Pakistan.

(TTP), which has been responsible for escalating attacks in Pakistan. India’s increasing engagement with Afghanistan threatens to erode Pakistan’s strategic leverage over its neighbor. Islamabad now faces the possibility of being diplomatically isolated as Kabul looks beyond its traditional ties.

Economic implications: The decision to use Chabahar port could significantly impact Pakistan’s economy. Landlocked Afghanistan relies heavily on Pakistan for its trade routes, but the use of Chabahar provides an alternative that reduces Islamabad’s economic and strategic importance. This could further strain Pakistan’s already struggling economy, which is grappling with high inflation and a depreciating currency.

The big picture

Regional power shift: India’s growing involvement in Afghanistan represents a broader shift in regional power dynamics. By aligning itself with Kabul, New Delhi is positioning itself as a counterbalance to China and Pakistan’s influence in South Asia.

Despite not officially recognizing the Taliban government, India understands the importance of maintaining a foothold in Afghanistan. It has invested over $3 billion in development projects in Afghanistan over the last two decades, including schools, roads, and dams. Engaging with Kabul allows India to protect its past investments while also positioning itself as a key player in Afghanistan’s future development. The move also aligns with India’s broader regional strategy, which seeks to counter China’s Belt and Road Initiative and its influence in neighboring Pakistan.

Afghanistan’s balancing act

Between the lines

India’s outreach to the Taliban highlights a pragmatic shift in its foreign policy, but it also underscores the limitations of Pakistan’s influence in Afghanistan. For Islamabad, the growing proximity between Kabul and New Delhi represents a failure of its long-standing strategy of using Afghanistan as a buffer state against India.

The Taliban’s willingness to engage with India reflects its desire to reduce dependency on Pakistan while seeking new avenues for trade and development. This realignment, however, does not come without risks. By engaging with a regime criticized for human rights abuses, India risks undermining its global image as a democracy and a defender of human rights.

For Pakistan, the stakes are even higher. The loss of influence in Afghanistan not only weakens its strategic position but also complicates its efforts to address domestic security challenges. The growing isolation of Pakistan in the region could force Islamabad to rethink its approach toward both Afghanistan and India.

What’s next

India’s evolving role:

India’s quiet yet deliberate engagement with the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan is reshaping South Asia’s strategic landscape, leaving Pakistan in a precarious position.For the Taliban, engaging with India is a strategic move to demonstrate autonomy and reduce dependency on Pakistan. The Taliban’s acting foreign Mmnister Muttaqi described India as a “significant regional partner,” signaling Kabul’s intent to strengthen ties with New Delhi.By diversifying its partnerships, Afghanistan can navigate its way out of economic isolation while countering narratives that it is merely a puppet of Pakistan. This approach also provides the Taliban with an opportunity to attract aid and investments from other regional players, including Iran and China.Analysts like Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s former UN ambassador, stress that Pakistan must prioritize trust-building with Afghanistan to repair strained ties and regain lost influence. However, Islamabad’s frequent border closures, airstrikes, and repatriation of Afghan refugees have created resentment, pushing the Taliban to seek alternatives.India is likely to deepen its engagement with Afghanistan through development projects, trade, and humanitarian aid. However, this involvement will remain cautious, as India balances its interests with concerns about the Taliban’s human rights record and its potential to harbor anti-India elements.The resumption of visas for Afghans, particularly for medical and educational purposes, could be a key step in strengthening people-to-people ties. This move could also enhance India’s soft power in the region, providing it with leverage in future diplomatic engagements.(With inputs from agencies)","India’s outreach to the Taliban highlights a pragmatic shift in its foreign policy.

It has recommended reforms to ensure that the PM can face a no-confidence motion in parliament.To prevent the concentration of power in the hands of an individual or institution, it has proposed the creation of a constitutional body - national constitutional council (NCC) - to establish a system of checks and balances between the three branches of the state and the two executive positions - PM and president.This council would include the president, chief justice, PM, leaders of opposition of both houses, speakers and deputy speakers from the opposition, and a representative of other parties. The commission has recommended decentralising the judiciary by maintaining the unitary structure of Supreme Court, while establishing permanent high court benches with jurisdiction in all divisional cities.It has also provided a framework for an interim govt to be formed after the dissolution of parliament, and recommended that selection of advisers to such govts should be solely the NCC's responsibility.",The Constitution Reform Commission has recommended introducing a two-term limit on the PM's tenure.

They had previously been sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment in the case, which SC termed ""malicious"".Following the verdict, there are now no legal barriers preventing the two-time former PM from contesting the upcoming national elections.Khaleda and her son are currently residing in London.SC overturned the judgments delivered during the regime of ousted PM Sheikh Hasina by the high court and trial court. The trial court had sentenced Khaleda to five years' imprisonment, while Tarique and the other accused received 10 years each. Later, HC doubled Khaleda's sentence to 10 years while upholding trial court's verdict for the other accused.In its ruling, SC observed that the prosecution of the Zia Orphanage Trust case was ""malicious"" and noted that the accused, who did not appeal the HC verdict, would also benefit from this judgment ""restoring their dignity as innocent individuals"".A five-member bench of the appellate division, led by Chief Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, delivered the unanimous verdict. The ruling came after hearings on two appeals filed by Khaleda and individual appeals made by Kazi Kamal and businessman Sharafuddin Ahmed. Khaleda had initially been jailed on Feb 8, 2018 after a special court in Dhaka sentenced her to five years in prison for her involvement in the case. The other accused - Kazi Kamal, Sharafuddin, Kamal Uddin Siddique and Mominur Rahman - were sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment for misappropriating over BDT 2.1 crore, which was intended as foreign grants for orphans.","Khaleda Zia, her son and BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman were acquitted on Wednesday by the appellate division of Bangladesh Supreme Court.

"Bangladesh commission suggests dropping 'secularism', 'socialism' from Constitution; proposes bicameral House",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-commission-suggests-dropping-secularism-socialism-from-constitution-proposes-bicameral-house/articleshow/117279914.cms,"The Constitution Reform Commission on Wednesday submitted its report to interim government chief Muhammad Yunus , proposing the replacement of the state principles of secularism, socialism and nationalism. The commission set up by the Yunus administration, after the ouster of Sheikh Hasina as prime minister following a mass agitation led by students, also proposed a bicameral parliament for the country and a two-term limit on a premier's tenure.The three principles are among the four enshrined as ""fundamental principles of state policy"" in the country's constitution. Under the new proposals, only one -- ""democracy"", remains unchanged.""We are proposing five state principles -- equality, human dignity, social justice, pluralism, and democracy -- for reflection of the great ideals of the 1971 Liberation War and the people's aspiration during the 2024 mass upsurge,"" commission chairman Ali Riaz said in a video statement.The report kept ""democracy"" alone in the constitution's preamble alongside the four new principles as it presented the report to Yunus.The chief advisor's press wing in a statement quoted Riaz as saying the commission recommended the formation of a bicameral parliament with a lower house named the National Assembly and an upper house named the Senate with 105 and 400 seats respectively.The report suggested both the proposed houses will have a term of four years instead of the existing five-year term of the parliament.The commission suggested the lower house be based on majority representation and the upper one on proportional representation.The commission believes that one of the main reasons the ""autocratic authoritarianism Bangladesh"" faced over the past 16 years was because of the absence of an institutional power balance and concentration of power in the prime minister's office.It recommended a two-term limit on the premier's tenure.The report said, therefore, it proposed the creation of a constitutional body named the National Constitutional Council to establish a system of checks and balances between the three branches of the state and the two executive positions - the prime minister and the president.This council would include the president, the chief justice, the prime minister and the leader of the opposition (both elected through the parliament), speakers of both houses, deputy speakers from the opposition, and a representative of other parties.The report said the commission believes this institution would ensure transparency and accountability in the appointment process as a constitutional body.Riaz said the commission proposed the reintroduction of the referendum system for amending the constitution. Under the existing provisions, the parliament on its own can amend the constitution with a two-thirds majority.Bangladesh's constitution has been amended so far 17 times since it was framed in 1971, a year after the emergence of independent Bangladesh following a nine-month Liberation War against Pakistan.The leaders of the Anti-Discrimination Students Movement that led the July-August uprising toppling then prime minister Sheikh Hasina's nearly 16 years Awami League regime called the constitution a ""Mujibist"" charter, a reference to Bangladesh's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina's father.They demanded scrapping of the ""Mujibist 1972 Constitution"". However, this has been opposed as well by Awami League's arch-rival former prime minister Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).The BNP on Tuesday formally demanded general elections in July-August this year, opposing Yunus's expressed desire to stage the polls by the year-end or mid-2026 after accomplishing some basic reforms.However, after an overnight meeting of the highest policy-making steering committee with the party's acting Chairperson Tarique Rahman in London through a virtual platform BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said reform was a continuous process.He said the BNP was committed to reforms as it has always been at the ""forefront of reforms as in 2016 we presented 'Vision 2030', and in 2023 we introduced a 31-point plan"".Most of her senior leaders and cabinet colleagues are on the run at home and abroad while some are in jail to face graft and criminal charges as the ruthless crackdown on the campaigners claimed several hundred lives.","The Constitution Reform Commission submitted its report to interim government chief Muhammad Yunus.

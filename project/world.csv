Emergency crews assess damage

Tornado watch continues





More than 100 homes were damaged on Monday afternoon after a tornado hit Harris County, Texas authorities said.Officials said there were no serious injuries or deaths. Brian Murray from the county’s office of homeland security and emergency Management said teams earlier moved through the debris to check if anyone was trapped or hurt, CNN reported.The National Weather Service has confirmed a tornado struck the area but has not yet rated its intensity.The storm formed as warm air met a cold front in the Houston region, creating unstable conditions and strong winds that led to supercell thunderstorms and several tornado reports.Drone footage showed torn-off rooftops and debris scattered across yards and pools.Photos posted by the Cy-Fair fire department showed shattered windows, damaged fences and broken structures across the area.County officials urged residents to avoid travelling because of downed power lines and widespread debris. “Our priority is the safety of our residents,” Herman said. “We are using every resource to find the injured, secure the area and support our community.”Herman called it a “severe weather event” that caused “widespread and significant damage.”The Harris County emergency services campus was also hit. A maintenance building lost its roof and back wall, according to spokesperson Miranda Sevcik.Two workers inside took cover and escaped without injury.Sevcik said large trees “snapped like toothpicks.” She was in another building during the tornado and described hearing shutters fall, feeling a sudden pressure drop, and then a brief silence before the storm moved on.“What sounded like hail turned out to just be the shutters dropping, and then all of a sudden, you could feel the pressure drop, and then it just got really, really quiet,” Sevcik described. “It went by very, very fast. And then we opened the doors, thankfully …and we saw the damage. We’re like, ‘oh, my gosh,’ just like matchsticks.”A tornado watch is in place until 1 am CT for much of eastern Texas, including Houston. The watch also covers parts of western and central Louisiana.","More than 100 homes damaged in Harris County, Texas. No serious injuries or deaths reported.

A coordinated attack involving suicide bombers and gunmen targeted the headquarters of the Federal Constabulary (FC) paramilitary force in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Peshawar on Monday. Rebel group Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) has claimed responsibility for the attack. While the group claimed around two dozen casualties and death of three of its fighters, Pakistani authorities said there were six deaths, including that of three soldiers.The JuA, which is comprised of soldiers from Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), was also behind the suicide bombing at a judicial complex in Islamabad a day after the blast in Delhi. Monday's operation began with a suicide bomber detonating explosives at the main entrance of the highly secured FC headquarters, a compound located in a densely populated area on Sunehri Masjid Road in Peshawar Cantonment.Following the initial blast, at least two other attackers breached the premises and engaged security forces, sources said. Several personnel and civilians were also reported injured and rushed to nearby hospitals.Over two dozen people were admitted for treatment.Peshawar capital city police officer Mian Saeed Ahmad told local media that the three personnel killed were stationed at the main gate. Ahmad claimed that the quick response of security forces resulted in the timely elimination of the remaining two attackers, preventing a potentially high casualty count as a large number of personnel were reportedly gathered inside for parade drills.A representative of JuA posted on Telegram about the attack, saying: ""Three suicide mujahideen are participating in the attack. We want the complete and 100% implementation of Sharia. If the enemy agrees to 99% but refuses even 1%, then our jihad against them will continue. Insha'Allah...""The JuA split from TTP in 2014 due to ideological differences. However, it joined hands with TTP again a few years ago.

Laura Loomer and Marjorie Taylor Greene drama gets louder on X





A big rumor spread fast on X when an account called @DissidentWire posted that Laura Loomer was pregnant with Ian Miles Cheong’s child. The post got millions of views very quickly, and many people started talking about it. But the truth came out just as fast. Laura Loomer saw the rumor and said it was completely fake. She wrote on X, “Stop lying. One, I’m not pregnant.” She also joked about her body to show how silly the rumor was.The account that started the claim has a parody label in its bio. It makes joke posts about many famous people, so the rumor was not real from the start. Also, no big news site or trusted source has said anything about Laura Loomer being pregnant. There is no proof anywhere that she is having Ian Miles Cheong’s baby. The whole talk came from one joke post that went viral.While the fake pregnancy story was growing online, Laura Loomer was already in the news for her posts about Marjorie Taylor Greene. When Donald Trump pulled his support from Marjorie Taylor Greene and said she had become “a ranting lunatic,” Laura Loomer joked about moving to Georgia. She asked if she should go there since Trump wanted Greene to face a new challenger.Later, when Marjorie Taylor Greene said she would step down from her role in January 2026, Laura Loomer made many posts about it. She wrote that she was “enjoying” Greene’s problems. She said Greene once pushed her out of Trump’s campaign and spread lies about her. Laura Loomer wrote that she had waited “years” to see Greene face trouble and said she finally felt like she got “some justice.”Laura Loomer has also shared more posts attacking Marjorie Taylor Greene, showing that their fight has been going on for a long time. Their argument has nothing to do with the pregnancy rumor, but both stories were trending at the same time, which made people talk even more.There is no real report, no trusted source, and no proof that Laura Loomer is pregnant. She said the rumor is fake. The account that posted it is a parody page that makes joke posts about many people.

Why did the World's wealthiest choose Dubai?

Naïa Island

Ultra-Exclusive Hospitality: The island will host the region's first Cheval Blanc Maison , part of the prestigious LVMH luxury group. This anchor provides residents with intimate, hotel-standard luxury services, from concierge to curated wellness and fine dining.

, part of the prestigious luxury group. This anchor provides residents with intimate, hotel-standard luxury services, from concierge to curated wellness and fine dining. Private Beach Access: Unlike many of Dubai’s developments, Naïa Island offers a limited collection of branded residences and estate plots, and every single one is designed with private beach access, ensuring maximum seclusion and direct contact with the Arabian Gulf.

Low-Rise Design: The masterplan deliberately employs low-rise architecture. This unique feature guarantees unobstructed sea views and views of iconic Dubai landmarks, differentiating it from the city's vertical landscape and emphasizing space and tranquility.

Maritime Luxury: A crucial amenity is the dedicated private marina with yacht berthing facilities, catering directly to the maritime pursuits of global elites.

Who is Lakshmi Mittal?

The Cost to Naïa Island

Looking ahead





Steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal has stepped back from full-time UK residency and will spend far more time in Dubai and Switzerland as Britain tightens tax rules for the super-rich. The move follows Labour’s package of wealth and inheritance tax changes that have prompted several high-net-worth individuals to rethink their tax residency.The exodus of Lakshmi Mittal from the UK, where his family owned the legendary ""Taj Mittal"" mansion, is fundamentally driven by economics. The billionaire is moving away from the UK’s impending tax reforms, which include a proposed 20% exit tax, a potential mansion tax, the abolition of the non-domicile tax regime, and high 40% inheritance taxes.Dubai’s financial landscape is the polar opposite. By making Dubai his main residence, Mittal benefits from a system built on certainty and growth, most crucially offering zero inheritance tax. This stability allows him and his peers to manage and protect their immense global wealth, making it the preferred destination for a growing list of individuals seeking to secure their assets from high tax levies and policy unpredictability in their home countries. This financial security, in turn, allows for investment in Dubai’s most exclusive residential projects.Reports say Mittal has cemented his commitment to the UAE by acquiring property on Naïa Island, an ambitious new luxury enclave developed by Shamal Holding, in addition to an existing residence.This island is engineered specifically to attract the UHNW segment, offering unmatched privacy and prestige off the Jumeirah coastline.The specialty of Naïa Island lies in its unique, low-density features:Naïa Island is positioned as a legacy investment, a timeless retreat where exclusivity, natural beauty, and sophistication converge, with the project expected to reach completion around 2029.Lakshmi Niwas Mittal is one of the world's foremost figures in the steel industry, known for his relentless consolidation of the fragmented global market. Born in Rajasthan, India, his career trajectory led him to become the founder and Executive Chairman of ArcelorMittal, the world’s leading steel and mining company outside of China. Mittal built his empire through a series of bold and often aggressive acquisitions throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including a landmark merger in 2006 that created the current global giant.His company is critical to the construction, infrastructure, and renewable energy sectors globally, reflecting his influence on modern industrialization. Previously one of Britain's wealthiest residents, his move from the UK to Dubai signifies a major shift in the global financial landscape for this steel magnate.Lakshmi Mittal's future residence on Naïa Island will be a custom-built, ultra-low-density estate leveraging the island’s exclusive design. His property, likely on one of the large 21,000 to over 48,000 square foot estate plots, will feature mandatory private beachfront access and seamless access to the private residents' marina for yachting, while benefiting from integrated, hotel-standard services provided by the nearby Cheval Blanc Maison (LVMH).For those aspiring to buy a piece of this luxury, the cost is immense: while small 4-bedroom villas are estimated to start around AED 45 million (INR 109.3 crores), a custom estate plot requires substantially higher capital. The purchase process is strictly managed as an off-plan development (completion expected around 2029), necessitating an Expression of Interest (EOI), adherence to a structured payment plan, and the payment of a 4% DLD fee, though the investment qualifies the owner for the coveted 10-year Golden Visa.For Dubai, the arrival (or increased presence) of well-known billionaires notably brings headline value, increasingly potential local spending and faster growth in the ultra-luxury property and services sectors. For the UK, these departures are however politically sensitive, and they highlight how tax policy discreetly influences where mobile wealth ultimately chooses to liveThe broader pattern is already visible: bankers, industrialists and investors are weighing residency options as fiscal rules change. Policymakers on both sides will watch whether the trend is temporary or a sustained reshaping of where global capital and wealthy families choose to base themselves.","Steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal has stepped back from full-time UK residency and will spend far more time in Dubai and Switzerland as Britain tightens tax rules for the super-rich.

Khalistanis In Panic Mode As India And Canada Intensify Security Cooperation Against Terror Networks





Thousands of Canadian Sikhs carrying yellow Khalistan flags queued for hours to take part in an unofficial so-called “Khalistan Referendum” in Ottawa on Sunday in freezing temperatures, icy winds and snow.The non-binding referendum, organised by Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), which is banned in India under UAPA for its subversive activities, asked them to vote on whether they wanted a separate homeland called “Khalistan” and for Punjab to secede from India.More than 53,000 Canadian Sikhs from Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec queued for two km to cast their ballots, SFJ claimed.“From new-born children to seniors using walkers, families remained in line all day. Thousands were still waiting when the 3pm closing time arrived, and voting continued to ensure they could cast their ballots,” SFJ claimed, questioning why Canadian PM Mark Carney met PM Narendra Modi on the margins of the G20 leaders’ summit in South Africa on the very same day.Videos taken by Alberta-based “Media Bezirgan” show Sikhs queuing round the block to vote at the McNabb Community Centre. Police liaison officers stood around as Khalistan supporters chanted “kill” slogans against India’s politicians and govt officials. SFJ general counsel Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, designated a terrorist by India, addressed voters through a satellite message.The “referendum” concluded with the desecration of the Indian flag.","Thousands of Canadian Sikhs queued for hours to take part in an unofficial so- called “Khalistan Referendum” in Ottawa on Sunday in freezing temperatures, icy winds and snow.

New details on Gold Card visa program

The application is to be filed with the Department of Commerce

The $15,000 fee per application is non-refundable

The petition is to be filed with USCIS, following which USCIS would assess the applicant's eligibility for the new visa category.

The vetting process also includes a check on whether the fund originated from a lawful source.

Once the petition is approved and when an immigrant visa number is available, then the applicant has to complete the consular processing at the embassy.

The applicant would then get an immigrant visa to travel to the US and be admitted as a lawful permanent resident.

What is the $5 million visa program?





In a major update of Donald Trump's Gold Card visa program, which is to be implemented by December 18, the Department of Homeland Security and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services prepared the draft of the petition that an applicant has to submit. Form I-140G, also known as Immigration Petition for the Gold Card Program, have been submitted for clearance with the Office of Management and Budget. Bloomberg reported that the department has already got an emergency approval from White House.An individual would be eligible for permanent residence under this visa program after a donation of $1 million and for corporate petitioners, the amount is $2 million. The application fee would be $15,000 per applicant. After creating a ripple when the president launched the program and the administration officials claimed that they would be selling 1,000 Gold Cards a day, the program took a backseat amid the administration's hard approach to immigrants. But now things have started rolling ahead of the December 18 deadline, announced by Trump earlier.The donation would make the foreign nationals eligible for permanent residence under the EB-1 preference category for individuals of extraordinary ability or the EB-2 National Interest Waiver category.The $5 million visa program is Trump's Platinum Card though initially Gold Card was said to be priced at $5 million. The price which is being called a donation to the US government was revised and now the $5 million card is Trump's Platinum Card. This will give applicants the ability to spend up to 270 days in the US without being subject to US taxes on non-US income. No further details of this program have been released yeat and there is an option to join the waitlist for this card.","The $15,000 fee per application is non-refundable.

$9.12 million for a comic? Yes! A copy of the first Superman comic, discovered by three brothers while cleaning out their late mother’s attic, sold for $9.12 million this month at a Texas auction house, setting a new record for the most expensive comic book ever sold.The brothers discovered the comic book in a cardboard box beneath layers of brittle newspapers, dust and cobwebs in their deceased mother's San Francisco home last year, alongside a handful of other rare comics that she and her sibling had collected on the cusp of World War II.She had told her children she had a valuable comic book collection hidden away, but they had never seen it until they put her house up for sale and decided to comb through the basement for heirlooms, said Lon Allen, vice president of comics at Heritage Auctions.The brothers uncovered the box of comics and sent a message to the auction company, leading Allen to fly out to San Francisco earlier this year to inspect their copy of ""Superman No. 1"" and show it to other experts for appraisal.A small, in-house advertisement in the comic book helped experts identify it as originating from the first edition of 500,000 Superman No. 1 copies ever printed. Allen estimates there are fewer than 500 in existence today.“It was just in an attic, sitting in a box, could have easily been thrown away, could’ve easily been destroyed in a thousand different ways,” Allen said, as quoted by AP. “A lot of people got excited because it’s just every factor in collecting that you could possibly want all rolled into one.”The ""Superman No. 1"" comic, released in 1939 by Detective Comics Inc., is one of a small number of copies known to be in existence and is in excellent condition. The Man of Steel was the first superhero to enter pop culture, helping boost the copy's value among collectors, alongside its improbable backstory, Allen said.The copy was not given any special protection, but the cool Northern California climate helped preserve it, leaving it with a firm spine, vibrant colors and crisp corners, according to a statement from Dallas-based Heritage Auctions. The copy was rated a 9.0 out of 10 by comics grading company CGC, meaning it had only the slightest signs of wear and aging.The previous record for the world's most expensive comic book had been set last year, when an ""Action Comics No. 1"" — which first introduced Superman to the world as part of an anthology — sold for $6 million. In 2022, another Superman No. 1 sold for $5.3 million.The three brothers, in their 50s and 60s, did not wish to be identified due to the windfall involved nor did the buyer of the comic book, according to the auction house.“This isn’t simply a story about old paper and ink,” one brother said in a statement released by the auction house. “This was never just about a collectible. This is a testament to memory, family and the unexpected ways the past finds its way back to us.”","A copy of the first Superman comic, discovered by three brothers while cleaning out their late mother’s attic, sold for $9.12 million this month at a Texas auction house.

Trump Targets Muslim Brotherhood as Terrorist Organization





US president Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order to start the process of declaring certain branches of the Muslim Brotherhood as foreign terrorist organisations. The order names chapters in Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan.According to the order, these branches “engage in or facilitate and support violence and destabilisation campaigns” that harm their regions, US citizens and US interests.“President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood’s transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilisation campaigns against US interests and allies in the Middle East,” the White House said.The Muslim Brotherhood is a pan-Islamist movement founded in Egypt in 1928. Its founder, Hassan al-Banna, believed that returning to Islamic principles would help the Muslim world resist Western influence.A US “terrorist” designation allows Washington to freeze any assets the group may hold in the country and block members from entering the United States.The Muslim Brotherhood is already banned in several countries, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Jordan outlawed it in April this year, accusing the group of making and storing weapons and planning to destabilise the kingdom.The group, however, remains popular in Jordan and continues to operate even after a 2020 court ruling to dissolve it.In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood has been banned since 2013, after the military removed its leader and then-president Mohamed Morsi. The coup was led by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has remained in power since and built a close partnership with Washington.In May, French president Emmanuel Macron asked his government to draft measures to limit the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood and curb the spread of political Islam in France.","The order names chapters in Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan.

The decision came after the court ruled that president Donald Trump’s appointment of interim US attorney Lindsey Halligan in Virginia was invalid.Judge Cameron McGowan Currie, in her order, wrote that the attorney general’s attempt to install Halligan as the interim US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia “was invalid,” and that all actions taken under her “defective appointment”, including the indictments, were unlawful.Letitia James welcomed the decision, saying, “I am heartened by today’s victory and grateful for the prayers and support I have received from around the country,” she said. “I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day.”Comey responded in an Instagram video, saying, “I’m grateful that the court ended the case against me, which was a prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence and a reflection of what the department of justice has become under Donald Trump, which is heartbreaking.”The White House said the justice department will appeal the ruling.Attorney general Pam Bondi repeated this at a press conference, saying the government would take “all available legal action” to hold Comey and James accountable.Currie explained that only judges of the eastern district of Virginia can appoint a temporary US attorney until the Senate confirms a nominee. Halligan, a former White House adviser, had taken over after the Trump administration pushed out her predecessor. Defence lawyers argued that the 120-day limit for interim appointments had already expired when she stepped in, making her appointment unlawful. Currie agreed, saying the government cannot bypass Senate confirmation by repeatedly installing short-term appointees.The judge also noted that accepting the government’s argument would allow officials to send “any private citizen off the street” to lead a grand jury, as long as the attorney general approved it later, something she said “cannot be the law.”Comey had been accused of passing information to reporters through his lawyer in 2017 and of giving false statements to Congress. James faced charges of making false statements to a financial institution and bank fraud, which she also denied.Trump has repeatedly demanded prosecutions of Comey, James, and other critics. In one Truth Social post, he wrote that they were “guilty as hell,” though the justice department argued these posts were opinions, not directives.",Indictments against James Comey and Letitia James dismissed. Judge rules interim US attorney Lindsey Halligan's appointment was invalid. White House says the justice department will appeal the ruling.

Nikki Haley’s son, Nalin Haley has hinted that he sees Vice President JD Vance as the potential leader of the Republican Party in 2028, even as he distances himself from many of his mother’s political views.The 24-year-old Indian-origin has emerged as one of MAGA's youngest voices. Nalin's ideas are polar opposite of his mother Nikki Haley, who was Donald Trump’s last major challenger in the 2024 Republican primary.Nalin has been a strong critic of the H-1B visa system, saying all legal and illegal immigration should be stopped. He has also argued that dual citizenship is a “stupid idea” and that people living in America must speak only English. Nalin has claimed that foreign enrolment conflicts with the “America First” agenda and that immigrants are taking jobs and opportunities from native-born Americans. He also claimed that naturalised citizens should not hold public office in US.Nalin campaigned with his mother during her 2024 run, but says he did it out of family duty rather than shared politics. He told the Journal that he was simply being a “good son” and was “never going to be an advocate for a view that I did not have.”Nalin’s hardline stance on sensitive issues has stirred a row across party lines, mainly due to his own immigrant roots. Some in the MAGA base and the far right told him that he, too, is “an immigrant by blood” and should “self-deport”. Democrats and liberals accused him of hypocrisy and argued that Nikki Haley had “not taught her son well”. Despite the criticism, Nalin maintains that his loyalty is to America and America only.","The 24-year-old Indian-origin has emerged as one of MAGA's youngest voices.

Indian-origin immigration lawyer shares 'Plan B' for H-1B holders facing layoffs: 'Biggest mistake is assuming...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-immigration-lawyer-shares-plan-b-for-h-1b-holders-facing-layoffs-biggest-mistake-is-assuming-/articleshow/125548154.cms,"So what’s Plan B that every H-1B-holding employee should have?

A timely B-2 visitor status filing can give a worker extra months in US and can offer space to regroup even though it does not allow employment.

Some choose to move to an F-1 student status to upskill and remain in status legally, given the academic start date fits within the grace period.

One of the most underrated routes is the H-4 dependent status for those whose spouse holds an H-1B. It is often the safest and least disruptive option, especially if the worker qualifies for H-4 employment authorisation.

For others, returning to their home country may seem straightforward, but even this carries new risks. Travelling out of the United States and re-entering on a fresh H-1B approval may trigger the new $100,000 H-1B fee rule for many workers that Trump enforced in September.

Who is Rahul Reddy?





H-1B professionals often assume that strong performance, loyalty will protect them from layoffs, but immigration experts are warning that this belief is increasingly dangerous.Amid Trump's latest H1-B visa U-turn, tech and defence is restructuring itself in the United States. Foreign workers often face the harshest consequences because the immigration clock begins ticking the moment a job ends.According to Indian-origin Houston-based immigration lawyer Rahul Reddy, many H-1B workers are often stunned when layoffs hit. He says the biggest mistake for visa holders is assuming “it won’t happen to me”. Once employment stops, the worker enters a strict 60-day grace period. It may sound generous, but Reddy warns that those two months disappear fast when a person is trying to absorb the shock, find a new employer willing to file an H-1B transfer and manage paperwork at the same time.Reddy says many fall into the same traps. They believe their job is secure because the company is doing well. They assume a new role will be easy to find in a tight job market.Some wait too long before acting, hoping the employer will reconsider a layoff decision. “They rarely do,” he says.The message from immigration lawyers is that planning a backup early is important, not pessimistic. It is simple survival for anyone whose legal status depends entirely on their job.Reddy outlines several options that can act as a buffer if a layoff occurs.Reddy is the founding partner of Reddy Neumann Brown PC and has practised employment-based immigration for more than 28 years. He founded the firm in 1997 and has long been an active member of the immigrant community. He has been with the American Immigration Lawyers Association since 1995.","H-1B professionals often assume that strong performance, loyalty will protect them from layoffs.

What is Temporary Protected Status?





The Donald Trump administration Monday announced ending the Temporary Protected Status for Myanmar which will be effective on January 26, 2026. The situation in Myanmar has improved enough that Burmese nationals can now go home, Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem said.“This decision restores TPS to its original status as temporary,” said Secretary Kristi Noem. “The situation in Burma has improved enough that it is safe for Burmese citizens to return home, so we are terminating the Temporary Protected Status. Burma has made notable progress in governance and stability, including the end of its state of emergency, plans for free and fair elections, successful ceasefire agreements, and improved local governance contributing to enhanced public service delivery and national reconciliation,"" Noem said, adding that given the improvement in the situation in Myanmar permitting Burmese nationals to remain temporarily in the US is contrary to the national interest of the US.The Department of Homeland Security estimates there are nearly 4,000 people from Myanmar currently living in the United States under the TPS designation.It is an immigration status in the US which is given to people who are from countries that are experiencing war or armed conflict, natural disasters or any other unsafe conditions. If the US government designates a country for TPS, people from that country who are already in the US can apply to stay legally for a set period.They can also legally work in the US.The TPS status for Myanmar had been extended for 18 months from May 26, 2024, until Nov. 25 under the administration of Trump's Democratic predecessor Joe Biden.At least 60 days before a TPS designation expires, the secretary, after consultation with appropriate US government agencies, is required to review the conditions in a country designated for TPS to determine whether the conditions supporting the designation continue to be met, and, if so, how long to extend the designation, the DHS note said explaining the process of how the status is reviewed.""If the secretary determines that the conditions in the foreign state continue to meet the specific statutory criteria for Temporary Protected Status designation, Temporary Protected Status will be extended for an additional period of 6 months or, in the Secretary’s discretion, 12 or 18 months. If the Secretary determines that the foreign state no longer meets the conditions for Temporary Protected Status designation, the Secretary must terminate the designation,"" it said.","The situation in Myanmar has improved enough that Burmese nationals can now go home.

""This is the hard truth & now it's up to the states to fix it,"" Ramaswamy wrote as he shared the Department of Labor data. The data revealed what Ramaswamy has been claiming for a long time that the education system needs to be reformed as school children are not proficient in maths and reading but his argument is always seen in the prism of the great H-1B debat that he triggered last Christmas by calling Americans lazy.The data that Ramaswamy shared claimed that 78% 12th graders are not proficient in math and 65% are not proficient in reading. The US department of labor shared the 2024 data and termed the percentage 'unacceptable'.""By continuing the status quo of federal education bureaucracy, we’re letting our students down,"" the department posted.But when Vivek Ramaswamy shared it he was slammed for his 'Hindu supremacism' and 'American student bashing'.The criticism came from a user who claimed that America is not devoid of smart kids who study hard and pursue STEM subjects for higher studies.They do not party, as Ramaswamy earlier claimed, and work their way through very hard academic programs only to face unemployment as the STEM labor markets are filled with foreigners, the user wrote.Calling Vivek Ramaswamy's narrative of American students faring poorly in maths, though backed by government data, the long criticism included a dig at the IQ of the Indians.""He's telling you that American STEM grads deserve that because why? Because Indians are smarter? Nope - on average they have 77 IQs (meaning they can't do arithmetic, for actual math of any kind).

Suicide Bombers Storm Pakistan’s FC Headquarters In Peshawar As Explosions Rock High-Security Zone

How it unfolded



Rise in militant attacks







Pakistan’s northwestern city of Peshawar witnessed a major security breach on Monday morning when suicide bombers targeted the headquarters of the Federal Constabulary (FC), a paramilitary force stationed in a densely populated area near the military cantonment. The assault left at least three FC personnel dead and several others injured, prompting a large-scale operation to clear the compound and secure the neighbourhood.Police and rescue officials confirmed that the attackers struck just after 8am, hitting the main entrance before attempting to push further inside. According to senior officers, the security response prevented a mass-casualty event, especially as dozens of FC personnel were gathered on the parade ground at the time.Officials said the assault began when one suicide bomber blew himself up at the main gate. “The first suicide bomber first carried out an attack on the main entrance of the constabulary and the other one entered the compound,” a senior official told Reuters.Police Chief Saeed Ahmad said one attacker detonated his explosives at the main gate, while the second bomber was shot dead near the parking area. He confirmed that several terrorists were on foot and attempting to reach the parade ground.“The terrorists involved in today's attack were on foot and failed to reach the parade area and a timely response by our forces prevented a much larger tragedy,” he told AP.Other security officials reported that three militants in total attempted to storm the complex. “One attacker detonated himself at the main gate of the FC Headquarters, while two others managed to enter the premises,” CCPO Dr Mian Saeed said, adding that both were killed in the ensuing gun battle. The FC immediately cordoned off the area, diverted traffic and launched a sweeping search operation.Hospital officials confirmed that at least five people, including FC personnel and civilians, were injured. Emergency measures were declared at Lady Reading Hospital and Khyber Teaching Hospital, where all the wounded were reported to be in stable condition.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the assault, saying “Timely action taken by security forces saved us from major harm,” while President Asif Ali Zardari warned that “externally backed Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken Pakistan’s unity, resilience or resolve”.No group claimed responsibility, but the incident comes amid a sharp rise in militant attacks since the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) ended a ceasefire in 2022. Islamabad has repeatedly accused the TTP of operating from Afghan soil—an allegation Kabul denies.Monday’s bombing marks the second major attack on a security installation in Peshawar in recent years, following the 2023 Police Lines mosque blast that killed 84 people.

Ex-CIA Reveals Savage Reply To Imran Khan’s PTI After Apology Demand Over His India-Pak War Analysis





Former CIA officer John Kiriakou -- who once headed the agency’s counterterrorism operations in Pakistan -- said Pakistani officials sent him a letter demanding an apology for his remark that India would defeat Pakistan in a conventional war.Reacting to the letter on the podcast of internet personality Julian Dorey, Kiriakou used blunt language as he mocked former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan and his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) for the demand of apology.Kiriakou has recently made a series of striking claims in an interview with ANI news agency, including that the White House had expected “India to strike back after the 2001 and 2008 attacks.” He also recounted how Osama bin Laden escaped from the Tora Bora mountains into Pakistan.Kiriakou was speaking about the 2001 Parliament attack in New Delhi, carried out by Pakistan-backed Jaish-e-Mohammad, and the 2008 Mumbai attacks launched by Lashkar-e-Taiba, another Pakistan-nurtured terror outfit. The United States itself had suffered a devastating blow just months before India’s Parliament attack -- the 9/11 strikes by Osama bin Laden–led Al-Qaeda on the World Trade Center in New York.Recalling the events at Tora Bora, Kiriakou said American forces had cornered Bin Laden in the mountains as heavy bombing continued. “We knew we had Bin Laden cornered. We told him to come down the mountain,” he said. Bin Laden asked for time until dawn, claiming he needed to evacuate women and children.“But then,” Kiriakou said, “Osama bin Laden dressed as a woman and escaped under the cover of darkness in the back of a pickup truck into Pakistan.”Kiriakou also claimed the US had effectively “purchased” Pakistan’s then-president Pervez Musharraf . He said this after remarking that “the United States loves working with dictators.” According to him, Washington paid “tens of millions of dollars in cash to the Pakistani intelligence service.”Speaking about the attacks on India, he said, “The Indian government would have been perfectly within its rights to respond by striking Pakistan.” He added: “At the White House, we expected the Indians to strike back and they did not.”He then went further, making an explosive assertion about Pakistan’s nuclear weapons. “In 2002, I was told, unofficially, that the Pentagon controlled Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal,” Kiriakou said.And in a blunt assessment of the military balance between the two neighbours, he stated: “Pakistan cannot win a conventional war against India.”","Former CIA officer John Kiriakou said Pakistani officials sent him a letter demanding an apology for his remark that India would defeat Pakistan in a conventional war.

Police reported that the factory manager had been arrested, while the owner fled the scene shortly after the blast.The explosion occurred at the industrial unit in Punjab province, severely damaging the building and triggering a fire that spread panic across the neighbourhood. Local administrator Raja Jahangir said the cause of the blast was being investigated and confirmed that nearby homes had also been affected.Police official Mohammad Aslam said an investigation was underway to determine what led to the boiler failure. Pakistan Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif expressed condolences to the families of the victims and directed officials to provide the best possible medical care to the injured.Industrial accidents remain common in Pakistan, where poor safety standards often contribute to fatal incidents. In 2024, a similar boiler explosion at a Faisalabad textile mill left a dozen workers injured. Just last week, four workers were killed in a blast at a firecrackers factory in Karachi.","The explosion occurred at the industrial unit in Punjab province, severely damaging the building and triggering a fire that spread panic across the neighbourhood.

5.7-magnitude earthquake in Bangladesh triggers tremors across Kolkata, northeast





An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 struck Pakistan in the early hours of Friday, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS). The agency said the quake occurred at a depth of 135 kilometres, with tremors recorded at 03:09:12 IST.In a post on X, the NCS said, “EQ of M: 5.2, On: 21/11/2025 03:09:12 IST, Lat: 36.12 N, Long: 71.51 E, Depth: 135 Km, Location: Pakistan.” Officials said more information is awaited.The NCS also shared details of another recent tremor. On Thursday, a magnitude 3.9 earthquake struck Pakistan at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres, making the region susceptible to aftershocks. The agency posted: “EQ of M: 3.9, On: 20/11/2025 17:19:20 IST, Lat: 35.02 N, Long: 71.63 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Pakistan.”Earlier on November 10, an earthquake of magnitude 3.6 was recorded at 02:42 AM at a depth of 90 kilometres. The NCS said on X, “EQ of M: 3.6, On: 10/11/2025 02:42:55 IST, Lat: 35.20 N, Long: 73.40 E, Depth: 90 Km, Location: Pakistan.”Seismologists note that shallow earthquakes are generally more dangerous because seismic waves have less distance to travel, resulting in stronger ground shaking and greater potential damage.Pakistan lies in one of the world’s most seismically active zones, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide. The region frequently experiences moderate to strong earthquakes, often felt across borders in Afghanistan and northern India.Multiple provinces lie close to major fault lines. Balochistan sits near the active boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plates. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan fall along the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Punjab and Sindh are positioned on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate, making large parts of the country vulnerable to frequent seismic activity.","The quake occurred at a depth of 135 kilometres, with tremors recorded at 03:09:12 IST.

Munir’s expanding power base



(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment reshapes the balance of power in favour of the military. Behind the crisis is the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, a sweeping package pushed through parliament within days. Lawyers, judges and opposition parties argue that it has weakened the courts and elevated the military’s top commander to a position with no modern parallel.Since then, Pakistan’s judiciary has been hit by a series of high-profile resignations. On Saturday, Lahore High Court judge Shams Mehmood Mirza stepped down, and his family said his decision was directly linked to the 27th Amendment. His departure followed those of Supreme Court justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, who issued sharply worded letters condemning the amendment as a direct attack on judicial independence.The creation of a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) lies at the heart of judicial restructuring. The FCC now holds exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters, stripping the Supreme Court of its original powers. Pending petitions have already been shifted to the new court. President Zardari swore in Justice Aminuddin Khan as its first chief justice; six other judges were appointed, including serving Supreme Court and high court judges, though one judge reportedly refused to join.The FCC’s establishment has sparked intense concern. Critics say the president’s new power to transfer judges risks becoming a tool to sideline dissenting voices. Opposition groups argue this will fundamentally weaken judicial independence and concentrate constitutional authority in the executive and military leadership.Government ministers, however, hailed the package as “historic” and a step toward greater efficiency and national unity. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the amendment proved that “solidarity” prevailed during a time of national strain.With judges resigning, courts being reconfigured, and the military gaining unprecedented constitutional control, Pakistan faces a moment of reckoning.The amendment passed with overwhelming numbers in both houses has dramatically restructured Pakistan’s defence architecture, elevating army chief Asim Munir to Chief of Defence Forces with command over all three military branches. His five-year tenure now resets from the date of notification, enabling him to remain in office until 2030.The Senate has since rushed through four related bills, including amendments to the Army, Air Force and Navy Acts, along with changes to Supreme Court practice rules. These laws remove the earlier equality among service chiefs and replace references to the Joint Chiefs of Staff system with a new “National Strategic Command”, further centralising military authority under Munir.Dawn reported that appointments, extensions, and tenures under these reforms “shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.Experts quoted in multiple reports warn that the shift risks internal military tensions and further erodes civilian oversight. Lawyer Osama Malik described the reforms as something “usually granted in absolute monarchies”, arguing they grant lifetime protections not only to Munir but also to President Zardari.Opposition lawmakers responded with uproar, shredding copies of the bill and walking out. PTI leaders labelled the move “deeply undemocratic” and “the final nail in the coffin of an independent judiciary”. Critics say these changes could reshape the political landscape, particularly for nearly 200 cases involving former prime minister Imran Khan.","Pakistan's judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Military reforms: Asim Munir at the helm



Judicial restructuring: Federal constitutional court



Political reactions



What next







Pakistan’s National Assembly on Wednesday passed the 27th constitutional amendment bill, granting sweeping powers to the military in general and country’s army chief Asim Munir in specific, and restructuring the judiciary.The vote, held amid a ruckus in the lower house, saw 234 lawmakers in favour and only four against, speaker Ayaz Sadiq announced. The session was attended by top political leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.The amendment comes at a time of heightened political tension in Pakistan, with the ruling coalition seeking to consolidate control over key defence and judicial institutions. The legislation follows earlier Senate approval, where it received 64 votes in favour and no opposition, as the opposition benches boycotted proceedings.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the passage as a demonstration of national unity, saying the house exhibited solidarity. He also condemned a recent terrorist incident in Wana, drawing parallels to the Army Public School massacre, and praised law enforcement for securing the safety of students and cadets.The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces, giving him constitutional authority over all three branches: army, navy, and air force. Honorary five-star ranks such as field marshal, marshal of the air force, and admiral of the fleet remain lifetime titles. According to the country's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the reform “aims to bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while preserving military honour and tradition.The bill also establishes a federal constitutional court (FCC) to handle constitutional and provincial matters, leaving the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases. The FCC will have equal representation from all provinces and the power to take suo motu notices on constitutional petitions. The Judicial Commission will oversee judge transfers; refusal of a transfer will be treated as retirement.The ruling coalition, including PML-N, PPP, MQM-P, and allies, backed the amendment. Opposition lawmakers condemned it as unconstitutional. PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan called it the “Baku Amendments” and accused the government of undermining democracy. Mehmood Khan Achakzai of PkMAP protested by tearing a copy of the bill in the house.The amendment now returns to the Senate for final approval before becoming law. Analysts say the 27th amendment significantly strengthens Munir’s role in Pakistan’s military hierarchy while altering judicial oversight, marking a shift in Pakistan’s institutional framework.(With input from agencies, Dawn)","The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Why it matters

The big picture

The Field Marshal’s expanding power evokes a hybrid of Pakistan’s two most dominant military rulers:

Ayub Khan, who introduced centralized presidential control and laid the foundations for military-led governance.

Zia-ul-Haq, who used the Army and Islamization to seize power, marginalize the judiciary, and suppress civilian opposition.

Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament.

If Zia’s coup was loud and brutal against a strong popular leadership, Munir’s is silent, yet possibly more far reaching, being done through a political front office that’s pliant and dependent on the Army for authority. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.

Pranab Dhal Samanta in the Economic Times

Zoom in

The transformation follows the India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025, a four-day exchange of air and missile strikes after the Pahalgam terror attack.

India’s Operation Sindoor targeted Pakistani airbases, radars, and command centers.

Pakistan requested a ceasefire after intense damage - a request reportedly initiated by Pakistan’s DGMO.

Donald Trump, who claimed to have brokered the truce(India has repeatedly denied the US President's claims), was effusively thanked by Munir and PM Shehbaz Sharif. Trump now calls Munir his “favorite field marshal.”

The Financial Times described their dynamic as a “bromance,” with Trump showcased on billboards across Pakistan alongside Munir and Sharif.

This international validation was followed by Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, the second such promotion in Pakistan’s history - and the first codified under the Constitution.

Between the lines

This isn’t just about military command - it’s about rewriting the DNA of the Pakistani state.

The amendment creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, potentially diluting the powers of the Supreme Court and creating ambiguity about the hierarchy of judicial authority.

President Zardari is also granted lifelong immunity in the amendment, mirroring the legal shield given to Munir.

This dual protection signals a strategic alliance between the military and top civilian figures to institutionalize mutual insulation from accountability.

“Too much has been left to ad hoc and arbitrary decisions,” Mazari warned.

The domestic question: Can repression deliver reform?

The three-front storm: Taliban, TTP, and India

“If you nurture snakes in your backyard, they will bite you,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military’s official spokesman, referencing the Taliban. What a comeuppance : The remark could just as well apply to all Pakistan-grown terror groups and the TTP, whose resurgence is a grim case of blowback.

The bottom line





In Pakistan, where generals have often ruled with impunity and influence, Field Marshal Asim Munir is scripting a new playbook-quiet, precise, and constitutionally sealed. His rise is not just another chapter in the country’s well-worn saga of military dominance. It is, as one senior opposition leader put it, “a rewrite of the entire power manual.”Pakistan’s controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment proposes to recast the country’s military command structure by abolishing the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and creating the role of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) - a position that will be held by the Army Chief, currently Field Marshal Asim Munir •The amendment vests unprecedented legal and constitutional power in the CDF, giving Munir operational and institutional control over the army, navy, and air force, as well as the country’s nuclear command.•It also grants five-star officers life-long rank, privileges, and immunity, a move seen as creating a parallel unelected authority beyond the reach of civilian or judicial oversight.“This amendment appears tailored to benefit a specific individual rather than to strengthen the defence structure,” Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, former defence secretary, told Dawn.The CJCSC post - created after the 1971 war to ensure coordination among services - will be dissolved on November 27, 2025, when the current chairman, Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, retires.The 27th Amendment represents the largest shift in Pakistan’s civil-military balance since the Zia era, codifying the military’s supremacy in a way that future civilian governments may struggle to reverse.•The military will no longer merely influence governance from behind the scenes - it will be constitutionally entrenched at the center of executive authority.•Strategic nuclear assets, previously overseen by the National Command Authority, will now fall under the commander of national strategic command, appointed by the PM on the army chief’s advice, and selected from within the army.“All nuclear weapons and delivery systems will be under army control, including second-strike missiles traditionally under the Navy,” warned Dr Shireen Mazari, former human rights minister, a Dawn report said.•The change grants the army a monopoly over promotions, transfers, and postings across the services, threatening morale and inter-service harmony.“If promotions in the Air Force and Navy are determined by an army-origin CDF, it could lead to festering resentments,” Mazari cautioned.At home, Munir is both omnipresent and embattled. According to a Financial Times report, his supporters compare him to Mohammed bin Salman or South Korea’s General Park - ruthless modernisers willing to bulldoze institutions in the name of reform. His critics, however, see echoes of Zia-ul-Haq’s theocratic militarism cloaked in constitutional legitimacy.The judiciary is already split, thanks to a proposed constitutional court that would dilute the Supreme Court’s power. Journalists are censored, civil rights groups are muzzled, and political opponents - most notably former Prime Minister Imran Khan - are jailed or silenced.And yet, Munir has cast himself as the architect of reform. In his speech at the Pakistan Military Academy, he spoke of “treasures hidden beneath our land” and claimed that Pakistan had begun to “regain its rightful place in the comity of nations.”But the economy tells another story. As per the FT report, Pakistan’s investment rate is the lowest in South Asia, its poverty rate has risen to 25%, and its youth unemployment is dangerously high. The country remains dependent on IMF bailouts and Gulf financing that has yet to materialise in promised volumes.While Munir consolidates power at home, Pakistan finds itself encircled by a resurgent triangle of threats - each historically rooted, each dangerously revived. In the west, the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has proved more liability than leverage. Once covertly supported by Pakistan’s security establishment, the Taliban now resist Islamabad’s demands and turn a blind eye to cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil.More ominously, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot long declared outlawed, has regrouped in Afghanistan and resumed attacks in Pakistan’s tribal belt and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This year alone, militant violence has killed over 1,400 people - the highest toll in a decade.“The military simply lacks political support on the ground there,” Iftikhar Firdous, founder of The Khorasan Diary, told FT. “The crackdown has alienated entire communities.”Simultaneously, Pakistan’s eastern border with India remains fragile after the four-day air conflict in May.Add to that domestic insurgencies in Balochistan and the Pashtun belt, and Pakistan now faces not one, but three overlapping security fronts. Instead of acting as a force-multiplier, the military’s expanding political and economic footprint is beginning to stretch its operational capacity thin.The 27th Amendment enshrines military supremacy in Pakistan's Constitution under the guise of reform and modernization.•It moves the country further away from parliamentary democracy, and deeper into military-led constitutional authoritarianism.•As Field Marshal Asim Munir prepares to become the first Chief of Defence Forces, Pakistan’s most consequential question remains: Can a military man fix a failing nation - or will history repeat itself?(With inputs from agencies)","Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment.

ISLAMABAD: A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence that the defence minister said had pushed the country into a ""state of war"".Pakistani govt ministers accused neighbouring Afghanistan of complicity in the bloodshed - an accusation Kabul denied - and vowed retaliation if Afghan authorities failed to rein in the militants Islamabad says were responsible. ""We are in a state of war,"" said defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif after the attack, the first strike on civilians in Islamabad in a decade. ""Bringing this war to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which Pakistan has the full power to respond. ""The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said. The court bomber blew himself up near the entrance at around lunchtime. Images on local media showed people covered in blood lying next to a police van. A vehicle was seen on fire and another car was badly damaged. Police cordoned off the site. Naqvi said the bomber had tried to enter the court building on foot but, unable to find a way in, detonated the device outside, close to a police vehicle.Several of the wounded were in critical condition, a hospital source said.No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The main Pakistani militant group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denied involvement in the attacks. But a group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, according to The Khorasan Diary, a digital platform in Islamabad that monitors militant activity in the region.TTP militants have in recent years focused attacks on security forces. Civilians had not been hit in Islamabad for a decade, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group that tracks attacks.Islamabad says that the Pakistani Taliban and other militants are based in Afghanistan, with the support of India. ""We are totally clear that Afghanistan has to stop them. In case of a failure, we have no option but to take care of those terrorists who are attacking our country,"" Naqvi said, speaking at the scene of the court bombing. The Taliban administration spokesperson in Kabul did not respond to a request for comment on Pakistan's accusations.The court attack happened hours after militants stormed a school near the Afghan border on Monday. The attack on the school in Wana, in the north west, began Monday, when a suicide vehicle rammed the main entrance, killing three people, Naqvi said. Militants then entered the school, which is run by the military but educates civilians.By Tuesday evening, three militants were still inside the compound, security officials said, with rescue operations under way for the students trapped in another part of the school. Naqvi said that the school assailants were in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan during the attack.Reuters","A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence.

Surge in militant violence and worsening ties with Afghanistan







Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country was “in a state of war” after a suicide bomber struck outside the Islamabad district courts on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 27.The blast one of the deadliest to hit the capital in recent years has intensified tensions with Afghanistan, with Asif accusing the Taliban government in Kabul of allowing militants to operate freely.In a post on X, Asif said: “Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: This is a war for all of Pakistan.”He wrote that Pakistan’s military was making “daily sacrifices while providing citizens with a sense of protection and security”, but warned that hoping for negotiations with Kabul would be a “mistake”. Asif insisted that Afghanistan “has the ability to prevent terrorist attacks inside Pakistan” and that bringing the conflict to the capital was “a message from Kabul”.He added that Pakistan “has the strength to respond fully”, saying the attack had erased any remaining doubts about the threat posed by militants operating from Afghan soil.The explosion took place around midday in Islamabad’s G-11 district, just outside the judicial complex where hundreds of lawyers and visitors were present. Police said the attacker tried to enter the court premises but failed, eventually detonating explosives next to a police vehicle, igniting cars and sending a fireball through the street.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed that 12 people were killed and 27 wounded. He said authorities had recovered a severed head believed to be that of the attacker, and CCTV footage captured him moments before the blast. Witnesses described scenes of chaos, with people screaming for help as ambulances rushed to the site.The blast comes amid a sharp rise in militant violence across Pakistan. Security officials say the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has carried out hundreds of attacks this year, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border, but strikes in major cities have been rare. Islamabad was last hit by a suicide attack three years ago.On Monday night, militants also attempted to storm an army-run college in Wana, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Security forces killed two attackers quickly, while others were cornered inside an administrative building. Students and staff were evacuated, and the military said the assault resembled the TTP’s 2014 massacre in Peshawar that killed 154 people.Pakistan says the Afghan Taliban have allowed TTP fighters to take refuge across the border. Afghanistan denies harbouring the group.

NEW DELHI: A 5.5-magnitude earthquake struck central Bangladesh on Friday, killing at least six people and injuring several, AP reported citing officials. The quake, which shook buildings in Dhaka and sent residents fleeing outdoors, was felt across several parts of the country and in neighbouring regions of India including Kolkata.Also read: West Bengal: Strong tremors jolt Kolkata; no damage reported yet The US Geological Survey said the earthquake occurred at 10:38 am, with the epicentre located in the Ghorashal area of Narsingdi district, about 25 kilometres from Dhaka, at a depth of 10 kilometres. Dhaka-based DBC Television reported that six people died in the capital, including three who were killed when a roof and a wall collapsed, and three pedestrians who were struck by falling building railings.Authorities said the tremors caused significant panic in Dhaka, one of the world’s most densely populated cities with more than 30,000 people per square kilometre. Bangladesh’s central region is typically less seismically active than the north and southeast, where interactions between the India and Eurasia plates make earthquakes more common.A separate update from ANI said a 5.5-magnitude quake near Narsingdi was felt widely across Dhaka around 10:40 am and also in parts of India including West Bengal and areas of the northeast.The USGS recorded the event at 10:08 am IST. As per the ANI report, “There have been no reports of casualties or damage so far,” though later official updates confirmed fatalities in the capital.Last month, Bangladesh recorded a magnitude 3.4 earthquake, according to the National Centre for Seismology. Experts note that shallow earthquakes can produce stronger surface shaking because seismic waves travel a shorter distance.Citing USGS figures, The Daily Star reported that a magnitude 4.0 earthquake releases energy equivalent to about 6 tons of TNT, while a magnitude 5.0 quake corresponds to around 200 tons. The energy rises steeply with each magnitude, with a 7.0 quake equalling nearly 199,000 tons of TNT and a 9.0 quake releasing about 99 million tons, comparable to roughly 25,000 nuclear bombs.Bangladesh sits at the junction of the Indian, Eurasian and Burma plates, which move several centimetres each year. The country is intersected by major faults including the Bogura, Tripura, Shillong Plateau, Dauki and Assam faults, placing it within 13 recognised earthquake-prone zones. Regions such as Chattogram, the Chattogram Hill Tracts and Jaintiapur in Sylhet fall within the highest-risk category.Visuals from Dhaka on Friday showed emergency teams assessing damage as authorities monitored aftershocks and structural impacts across the capital.(With inputs from AP and ANI)","A 5.5-magnitude earthquake struck central Bangladesh on Friday, killing at least six people.

'Yunus can't touch my mother': Sheikh Hasina's son slams death verdict; thanks India for saving her life,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/yunus-cant-touch-my-mother-sheikh-hasinas-son-slams-death-verdict-thanks-india-for-saving-her-life/articleshow/125475793.cms,"Sheikh Hasina (ANI file photo)

'Eternally Grateful': Sheikh Hasina's Son Thanks PM Modi For Saving His Mother's Life, Slams Yunus





Ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ’s son, Sajeeb Wazed, on Thursday alleged that country's interim leader Muhammad Yunus would not be able to harm his mother. He insisted that “Yunus cannot touch my mother and he cannot do anything to her.”His remarks come at a time when Hasina’s future hangs in the balance after a tribunal in Bangladesh sentenced her to death over alleged involvement in the deadly student-led uprising of 2024. The tribunal linked her to the violent crackdown that preceded her ouster. Chief adviser and interim leader Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus welcomed the verdict, insisting that no one is above the law.Speaking to IANS, Wazed said: “They will not be able to kill her, but they will execute the verdict. First of all, they can’t get her. And once there is a rule of law, this entire process will get thrown out. Everything here is so illegal and unconstitutional and violates every legal principle that, once there is rule of law, everything will get thrown out and it will not be sustainable. So, Yunus cannot touch my mother, and he cannot do anything to her. ”Launching a sharp attack on Bangladesh’s extradition request, Sajeeb Wazed thanked India for protecting Hasina’s life.He also reacted to calls for Yunus’ Nobel Peace Prize to be revoked amid allegations of rights abuses under the interim administration. “Well, Nobel committees never take back their prizes. But look at Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in Myanmar. She won the Nobel Prize as well. The Peace Prize is basically given by lobbying. But she led to Rohingyas getting killed, and now Yunus is turning Bangladesh into a failed state and an Islamist terrorist state,” he said.Asked what the Congress party in India might have done if it had been in power, the Indian-origin politician replied: “The Congress party would have done the exact same thing that the present government has done. In India, there is rule of law and you have constitutional process. You people have always followed the Constitution and laws.”Wazed sharply criticised the trial process that ended in Hasina’s death sentence, calling it entirely illegal. “This has been done completely illegally. It’s a mockery. First of all, there is a government that is unelected, unconstitutional, and illegal. Then, in order to fast-track the trial in the tribunals, they had to amend laws, which you can only amend with a Parliament. Currently, there is no Parliament. So the process itself was completely illegal. They terminated 17 judges on this tribunal and appointed a new judge who has no experience. He has publicly made a nasty comment about my mother. So he is clearly biased.”He accused authorities of denying Hasina her right to legal representation. “They have not allowed my mother to appoint any lawyer. They appointed their own lawyers to defend my mother. In the history of Bangladesh, such trials take years of hearings, but they completed this in 140 days. So, it’s a complete mockery of justice. There has been no due process. This is a joke,” he added.The ruling marks one of the most consequential legal decisions against a former Bangladeshi leader in decades and comes months before national elections expected in early February. Hasina, 78, has refused to return from India for the trial. The court examined allegations that she ordered a violent response to the mass student uprising that eventually forced her out of power in August 2024.The former prime minister -- Bangladesh’s longest-serving leader -- is facing multiple charges stemming from the period of unrest. A UN rights office report estimated that up to 1,400 people were killed between July 15 and August 15 during the “July Uprising,” which followed a sweeping security crackdown ordered by her government.",Sheikh Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed slams interim leader Muhammad Yunus.

WhistlinDiesel claims gag order blocks him from talking about his case





WhistlinDiesel has claimed that Tennessee state officials are trying to stop him from speaking publicly after his arrest for tax evasion. The popular YouTuber, whose real name is Cody Detwiler, shared the accusation in a video posted earlier this week. He told his millions of followers that the issue began after his November arrest at his home in Tennessee and has now turned into what he believes is an attempt to mute him online.Cody Detwiler said he was shocked by both the arrest and the rules that followed. He explained that he had no idea there was a tax issue until officers arrived. He also said that after reviewing court papers, he now believes the state is trying to limit what he can share while the case moves forward.In his latest video, WhistlinDiesel explained that a court motion filed by Tennessee prosecutors includes what he describes as a gag order.He said the document stops him from making any pre-trial statements about the case across social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and X.“They don’t want me talking at all,” he said in the video. “They’re saying my reach could affect the case.” According to WhistlinDiesel, the filing points to his massive online audience, noting that he has more than 20 million followers across platforms.Prosecutors allegedly argued that his comments could influence potential jurors and hurt the state’s case. The court motion also mentioned his merchandise, which includes images of the public indictment page released after his arrest.WhistlinDiesel pushed back on the claims. He told viewers he has never threatened anyone connected to the case and asked his audience not to harass or target any officials.“I don’t want anyone going after these people,” he said. “This is between me and the state.”The YouTuber also shared parts of an investigative report that outlined how the case was built.He said state officials contacted more than a dozen people and businesses linked to his Ferrari F8, including his accountant. WhistlinDiesel claimed his accountant was advised not to inform him while the investigation was ongoing.WhistlinDiesel stated that the charge centers on unpaid sales tax tied to the Ferrari, a car that later burned down.He said he never received a tax bill or warning before the arrest and only learned the full details after receiving the investigative report about two weeks later.The case is still active, and court proceedings are expected to continue in Tennessee. For now, WhistlinDiesel says he is sharing what he legally can, while questioning why he believes the state is trying to keep him quiet as the legal process plays out.Also Read: Top 5 IShowSpeed Viral Moments In 2025 That Made Him Streamer Of The Year","WhistlinDiesel claims gag order blocks him from talking about his case on social media.

‘He admitted he’s racist’: Piers Morgan fires back after Nick Fuentes explodes over family racism question,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/he-admitted-hes-racist-piers-morgan-fires-back-after-nick-fuentes-explodes-over-family-racism-question/articleshow/125851892.cms,"Piers Morgan fires back after Nick Fuentes explodes over family racism question (Image via Getty)

Piers Morgan responds after Nick Fuentes calls his question a “new low”





Nick Fuentes, a far-right political streamer with a long history of racist remarks, clashed sharply with Piers Morgan during a tense episode of Piers Morgan Uncensored. What started as a discussion about Fuentes’ own words quickly turned into an angry exchange about race, family, and responsibility. The moment drew even more attention after Morgan posted a blunt response on social media.The argument began when Morgan asked Fuentes about a story he had shared earlier on his own podcast. In that story, Fuentes said his father avoided restaurants like Applebee’s and Red Lobster because many Black people ate there. Morgan asked if growing up with that thinking meant Fuentes was raised in a racist environment.Fuentes reacted strongly and accused Morgan of attacking his parents. Piers Morgan said the question was fair because the story came from Fuentes himself. After the episode aired, the debate did not stop. Morgan took to X, formerly Twitter, and posted a fiery message defending his approach and calling out Fuentes directly. The interview and Morgan’s post were later reported by Mediaite, keeping the controversy alive across social media.During the show, Piers Morgan quoted Fuentes’ past words directly.He said, “There was an episode of your podcast where you talked about your father, Bill Fuentes, and how he wouldn’t take the family, including you, to certain restaurants because he believed they were associated with African-Americans.”Morgan then asked, “Do you think you grew up in a racist environment?”Fuentes immediately pushed back. “I would say it’s a new low,” he said. “I’ve been attacked for being a racist many times, but to attack my father?”Morgan stopped him and replied, “Hang on, it’s your anecdote.”When Fuentes said his father was not there to defend himself, Morgan answered, “You are. You told the story.”Fuentes claimed his parents were not racist and talked about their gun-training business, saying many of their clients were Black. He later made negative comments about crime in Chicago and blamed Black communities, which has drawn criticism in the past.After the interview aired, Morgan addressed the backlash on X. He wrote, “The guy literally admitted he’s a racist. I didn’t have to ‘gotcha’ him – he’s proud of it. Maybe you should have asked him about his racism in between all your softballs?”Piers Morgan made it clear he stood by his questions and rejected claims that he treated Fuentes gently. He said the interview was about examining Fuentes’ own words and letting viewers decide.The exchange added to Nick Fuentes’ long record of racist and antisemitic comments. The heated moment, along with Morgan’s direct social media response, turned the interview into a major talking point online.Also Read: Nick Fuentes Calls Out Candace Owens After Her Tough Talk Does Not Match Her TPUSA Move In Charlie Kirk Case","Nick Fuentes, a far-right political streamer with a long history of racist remarks, clashed sharply with Piers Morgan during a tense interview.

Eugenia Cooney’s appearance brings back long-standing health concerns





Influencer Eugenia Cooney has been seen back in Florida, and the sighting has once again raised serious concern among her fans. Cooney was spotted on Sunday at Orlando International Airport, marking her first public appearance in more than a month. This moment quickly caught attention because she has stayed away from social media since June and has not been seen much in public since an October trip to Disney World, according to TMZ.People who saw Cooney at the airport said she looked extremely thin. As pictures began to spread online, fans shared worried messages and asked if she was doing okay. Many said the sight was upsetting because Cooney has a long history of health struggles that she has spoken about in the past. An eyewitness spoke to TMZ and described the scene at the airport. The source said Cooney kept to herself and did not draw attention. She was sitting near baggage claim with her brother after landing on a JetBlue flight from New York City. Their mother was with them as well.The eyewitness told TMZ, “Eugenia Cooney kept it low-key as she sat with her brother near baggage claim. The siblings had just exited a JetBlue flight from NYC with their mom, who was seen grabbing their luggage for them.”The source also said that neither Cooney nor her brother helped their mother carry the bags. This quiet moment quickly turned into a big talking point after photos from the airport surfaced online.In the photos, Eugenia Cooney was dressed in her usual fashion style. She wore ripped jeans, an oversized purple sweatshirt, dark sunglasses, and carried a Mickey Mouse purse over her shoulder. While some fans commented on her outfit, most focused on how thin she looked.Eugenia Cooney has been open about her struggles before. In 2019, she confirmed that she had an eating disorder. She also shared that friends once placed her on a psychiatric hold because they were worried about her health. Cooney later said that experience made her feel hurt and betrayed by people close to her.Fans have continued to express concern for years. The worry grew stronger during a May livestream, when many viewers felt she looked unwell and seemed to be getting sick on camera.The situation even reached local authorities. In October, the Greenwich Police Department in Connecticut told TMZ that there had been an increase in calls during the summer related to concerns about Cooney’s health.

Planning your year around UAE holidays





Local authorities may add extra holidays

Public holidays are not carried forward if they fall on weekends or overlap with another holiday

Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, so slight adjustments are possible





Residents of the UAE have much to look forward to in 2026, with several public holidays promising opportunities for long weekends and family time. From Eid celebrations to the National Day, a mix of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar holidays will shape the holiday calendar. Here is a detailed guide to all predicted public holidays, how they are determined, and tips to plan your time off.UAE public holidays are a combination of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar calendar dates. Gregorian holidays, such as New Year’s Day and National Day, occur on the same date each year. Islamic holidays, including Eid Al Fitr, Eid Al Adha, Islamic New Year, and Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday (PBUH), shift each year based on moon sightings.The UAE Public Holiday Law, established in April 2024 and implemented from January 2025, allows certain holidays to be shifted to the start or end of the week to create long weekends, except for Eid holidays. Cabinet Resolution No. 27 of 2024 also permits local governments to declare additional holidays for special occasions.Holidays that fall on weekends or coincide with another public holiday are not carried forward, but 2026 predictions indicate no overlap between Islamic holidays and Gregorian holidays.Residents in the UAE can expect at least 12 public holidays in 2026. While final dates depend on moon sightings and government announcements, current predictions give a clear picture of the likely schedule:Transferable holidays: Islamic holidays such as Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al Adha are not transferable. Other holidays, including the Islamic New Year, Prophet’s Birthday, and National Day, may be moved to create long weekends based on Cabinet resolutions.2026 promises several opportunities for extended breaks:Residents are advised to plan ahead, as Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, which may adjust official dates.Public and private schools in the UAE align their breaks with national holidays, though exact dates differ by curriculum and school authority:This schedule helps families coordinate holidays and make the most of predicted long weekends.Understanding the mix of fixed and lunar based holidays allows residents to strategically plan annual leave. For example, taking just a few days off around Eid or National Day can maximize time away from work. While the UAE government confirms official dates closer to each holiday, these predictions serve as a reliable guide for 2026.Residents should note:With this guide, UAE residents can look forward to a year of well timed breaks, long weekends, and ample family and leisure time.","UAE residents in 2026 can enjoy 12 public holidays, including Eid, National Day, and school breaks.

Who is Oscar Solorzano? Twice deported illegal immigrant charged in Charlotte light rail stabbing case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/oscar-solorzano-twice-deported-charged-in-charlotte-light-rail-stabbing-case/articleshow/125812245.cms,"



An illegal immigrant, who is identified as Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia, was taken into custody in connection with a stabbing on a light rail in Charlotte, North Carolina.While investigating the case, the police discovered that the 33-year-old suspect was actually deported twice back to his country.Solorzano-Garcia was issued a final deportation order in 2018 and was removed from the United States on March 9 of that year, DHS said. He was arrested crossing the border illegally again in 2021 and removed a second time. DHS said he apparently re-entered the US a third time at an unknown date and location.DHS Secretary Kristi Noem condemned the alleged stabbing, saying the incident “should have never happened.“This heinous stabbing by this twice removed illegal alien should have NEVER happened. ICE lodged an arrest detainer to ensure Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia is not released back into North Carolina neighborhoods. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the county will honor the detainer since they have a history of not cooperating with ICE,” said Secretary Noem in a press statement released by DHS.“Under President Trump, ICE is being unleashed to ensure public safety for all Americans. Make no mistake: We will not rest until every depraved criminal illegal alien is removed from our communities,"" she added.What are the charges against him?Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia has been charged with first-degree murder after allegedly attacking a male passenger with a large knife, according to DHS. ICE said Solorzano-Garcia is in the country illegally.Authorities said Solorzano-Garcia has a criminal history that includes prior arrests for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, destroying evidence, resisting arrest and using a false ID, as well as convictions for robbery and illegal reentry.","Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia, 33, has been charged with first-degree murder after allegedly attacking a male passenger with a large knife.

‘Whole thing just disgusts...’: CEO Brian Thompson’s colleague slams fans of his killer Luigi Mangione,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/whole-thing-just-disgusts-ceo-brian-thompsons-colleague-slams-fans-of-his-killer-luigi-mangione/articleshow/125809962.cms,"Luigi Mangione Gets 200+ Letters A Day; Some Too Explicit To Read Out Loud





A former colleague of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson , who was killed by Luigi Mangione , is not happy with the fans who give attention to the shooter.It has been one year since the executive was shot dead in Manhattan, but the case of Mangione is still ongoing.“It was the Luigi show,” said Terrie Martin, an independent Medicare broker from Texas who met Thompson at a conference months before his death, reports the New York Post.She described how Brian was an innocent family guy: “The whole thing just disgusts me — the way it was handled, the way it was portrayed, the way everybody jumped to celebrate when they weren’t even thinking this guy was a father, a husband, a boss or anything. That was just appalling.”50-year-old Thompson was fatally shot outside the Hilton Hotel in New York on December 4, 2024. The assassination was caught on camera.26-year-old Mangione managed to flee New York but was arrested after a five-day manhunt at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania. Federal prosecutors ruled that Mangione was hostile towards the healthcare industry.Thompson's accomplice said he bore no resemblance to the “caricature” painted by Mangione’s supporters.“He really and truly wanted to know how to make it better, nuts and bolts from people who are working on the ground in the trenches. What’s beneficial, what’s lacking, how can we make it better? He was really, really set on that very sincerely. He was actually trying to make a difference. That’s what made me so sad.”She recalled Thompson’s humility: “The one thing that I noticed from the very beginning was that everyone called him BT. They didn’t call him Brian or Mr. Thompson… I’ve never seen a dynamic like that before in corporate America.”Martin also remembered an awkward moment when she realised she had been speaking to the CEO. “He just laughed. He was so gracious about it. If you had met him anywhere like in line at a grocery store or a sporting event, you would never have guessed he was a CEO. Never. He was just such a really nice, humble, everyday kinda guy.”Earlier this week, a Manhattan judge reviewed key evidence in Mangione’s murder case, including a 911 call from the Altoona McDonald’s where he was arrested days after the killing. Prosecutors played surveillance footage of a masked gunman shooting Thompson. Mangione's defence seeks to suppress evidence from his arrest, including a handgun, a magazine, and a notebook.Meanwhile, supporters gathered outside the court in costume, holding “Free Luigi” signs.","Former colleague of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is not happy with the fans who give attention to Luigi Mangione.

A powerful magnitude-7.0 earthquake struck in a remote area near the border between Alaska and the Canadian territory of Yukon on Saturday.There was no tsunami warning, and officials said there were no immediate reports of damage or injury, AP news agency reported.The U.S. Geological Survey said it struck about 230 miles (370 kilometres) northwest of Juneau, Alaska, and 155 miles (250 kilometres) west of Whitehorse, Yukon.In Whitehorse, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sgt. Calista MacLeod said the detachment received two 911 calls about the quake. “It definitely was felt,” MacLeod said. “There are a lot of people on social media, people felt it.”Alison Bird, a seismologist with Natural Resources Canada, said the part of Yukon most affected by the temblor is mountainous and has few people. “Mostly people have reported things falling off shelves and walls,” Bird said. “It doesn’t seem like we’ve seen anything in terms of structural damage.”The Canadian community nearest to the epicentre is Haines Junction, about 80 miles (130 kilometres) away, Bird said. The Yukon Bureau of Statistics listed its population at 1,018 for 2022. The quake was also about 56 miles (91 kilometres) from Yakutat, Alaska, which the USGS said has 662 residents.It struck at a depth of about 6 miles (10 kilometres) and was followed by multiple smaller aftershocks.","There was no tsunami warning, and officials said there were no immediate reports of damage or injury.

Biggest ever US travel ban in the works?

The United States is planning to expand the number of countries that were covered by its travel ban - and the new list may include over 30 countries.US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, on Thursday, during an interview on Fox News’ The Ingraham Angle, when asked whether President Donald Trump’s administration would increase the number to 32, she said “I won’t be specific on the number, but it’s over 30, and the president is continuing to evaluate countries. ""In June, Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats, Reuters reported.The bans applied to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travellers.Noem did not specify which countries would be added to the list. “If they don’t have a stable government there, if they don’t have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” she said.Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was considering banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable.An expansion of the list would mark a further escalation of migration measures the administration had taken since the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week.Investigators said the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement programme under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting. Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” although he did not identify any by name or define “third-world countries.”Prior to that, officials from the Department of Homeland Security said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the administration of his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, and Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries. Since returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border. His administration has frequently highlighted the deportation push, but until now it has put less emphasis on efforts to reshape legal immigration.","US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the president is 'continuing to evaluate countries' In June, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States.

Survivors were in 'clear distress'

Survivors were trying to 'stay in the fight'

Trump says Pete 'didn't know what people were talking about'





Two people who survived the September 2nd US strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean were seen waving before they were killed in a second follow-up strike, sources familiar with a video shown to lawmakers revealed.One source said the gestures could be interpreted as the survivors either calling for help or surrendering to avoid another strike.The operation was the first of more than 20 US attacks on suspected drug-carrying vessels under the Trump administration. The GOP leader has defended the campaign as a necessary way to curb narcotics trafficking. However, the premise remains legally questionable. The Pentagon has reported that more than 80 people have died in these strikes, including 11 in the initial September 2 attack.Members of Congress were shown video of the strikes, including the follow-up attack that killed the two survivors, during a closed-door briefing with the operation's commander, Adm. Mitch Bradley, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, according to CBS News.Democratic Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut described the scene as one of the most difficult things hes ever seen in his life. He said the survivors appeared “in clear distress without any means of locomotion.”Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas defended the strikes. He said the survivors were “trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight” and clarified that the strikes were “entirely lawful and needful.”US President Donald Trump hinted he would support releasing the video to the public, but denied knowledge of any order given to target survivors. “I don't know that that happened. And Pete said he did not want that — he didn't even know what people were talking about. We'll look into it. But no, I wouldn't have wanted that. Not a second strike,” he said.Trump has also said that Venezuela’s airspace should now be considered “closed” amid rising tensions.Defensed department officials have defended the operations as legal and necessary. Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told The Washington Post that “ongoing operations to dismantle narcoterrorism and to protect the Homeland from deadly drugs have been a resounding success.”Defense secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes were “lethal, kinetic strikes” aimed at stopping drug trafficking and destroying vessels affiliated with “Designated Terrorist Organisations.”Legal experts and lawmakers have expressed concern that targeting survivors could constitute a war crime.","Survivors seen waving before they were killed in a second follow-up strike.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday evening hosted the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees in the Oval Office for a medal-presentation ceremony.“This is a great evening, it’s a great honour,” Trump said. “And I’m delighted to welcome to the Oval Office – the world-famous, most famous office in the world, most powerful office in the world – our truly exceptional 2025 Kennedy Center honorees. ”Trump said the honorees “inspired, uplifted and unified millions and millions of Americans”, calling them “the most accomplished and renowned class of Kennedy Center honorees ever assembled”.Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell stood behind Trump as the President presented the medals. Grenell, who was appointed by Trump in February this year to head the centre, is also a special envoy to Latin America for the administration.This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone , singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford , Guardian reported.The medallions to the honorees were “re-designed” by Tiffany and Co, Trump said. “They have done a fantastic job, they’re wonderful people – I know them very well because they’re right next to Trump Tower, I’ve lived with them many years,” he said.Trump never visited the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in his first term, and did not take part in its annual awards programme.But he has taken a keen interest in his second. Since taking office, he has ousted the Kennedy Center’s board of trustees and replaced them with supporters. He has promised to “fully renovate” the Kennedy Center’s infrastructure, and make it a “crown jewel” of arts and culture in the US.It was unclear how this year’s honorees were chosen, but Trump said in August when presenting the list that he had been “about 98% involved”.The Kennedy Center Honors programme and its series of tribute performances for each recipient is set to be taped on Sunday, and will be broadcast later in December.The President said in August that he would host the show, and Trump on Saturday set expectations high: “I believe – and I’m going to make a prediction: this will be the highest-rated show that they’ve ever done,” Trump said about Sunday’s event during the medal ceremony. “And they’ve gotten some pretty good ratings. But there’s nothing like what’s going to happen tomorrow night.”Presidents traditionally attend the programme, but none has ever presented the show, a fact Trump appeared aware of as well. “We never had a president hosting the awards before, this is a first. I’m sure they’ll give me great reviews, right?” Trump quipped. “No, we’ll do fine. I’ve watched some of the people that host. Jimmy Kimmel was horrible.”“If I can’t beat out Jimmy Kimmel in terms of talent, then I don’t think I should be President,” Trump added.","US President Donald Trump hosted the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees in the Oval Office for a medal-presentation ceremony.

‘India should not be dumping rice’: Trump signals fresh tariffs as US farmers decry cheap imports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/india-should-not-be-dumping-rice-trump-signals-fresh-tariffs-as-us-farmers-decry-cheap-imports/articleshow/125854789.cms,"Trump Warns India On Rice Dumping As US Farmers Demand Action Against Cheap Imports





US President Donald Trump may impose new tariffs on agricultural imports, including Indian rice and Canadian fertilizers, after hearing farmers’ complaints about cheap foreign goods that are undercutting US producers.The remarks came at a White House meeting where he unveiled $12 billion in fresh support for American farmers. He said imports were challenging domestic producers and reiterated his intent to address the issue.Trump said he would ""take care"" of alleged dumping of Indian rice into the US. Farmers have pointed to falling rice prices, claiming imports from countries like India, Vietnam and Thailand are undercutting their crops. ""They shouldn't be dumping,"" Trump said. ""I mean, I heard that, I heard that from others. You can't do that.""He also suggested possible tariff measures on fertiliser coming from Canada to encourage local production. ""A lot of it does come in from Canada, and so we'll end up putting very severe tariffs on that, if we have to, because that's the way you want to bolster here,"" he said, adding, ""And we can do it here. We can all do that here.""The comments came amid ongoing economic pressures, including concerns about inflation and consumer prices. Farmers, a key support base for Trump, have faced rising costs and market challenges linked to tariff policies.Negotiations with both Canada and India aimed at stabilising trade ties have encountered difficulties. Earlier this year, Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods, citing trade barriers and energy purchases. A US delegation is expected to visit India this week for further talks, although no major breakthrough is anticipated.Trump has also previously raised tariff concerns with Canada, including threats to increase duties on products not covered by the North American trade deal. Recent statements have suggested the possibility of revisiting the agreement itself.","US President Donald Trump may impose new tariffs on agricultural imports, including Indian rice and Canadian fertilizers.

Courtroom bombshell: Bodycam shows police find loaded magazine hidden in wet underwear in Luigi Mangione’s bag,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/courtroom-bombshell-bodycam-shows-police-find-loaded-magazine-hidden-in-wet-underwear-in-luigi-mangiones-bag/articleshow/125854221.cms,"Luigi Mangione Gets 200+ Letters A Day; Some Too Explicit To Read Out Loud





Luigi Mangione pumped his fist in court on Monday as body-camera footage allegedly showed officers finding a loaded magazine tucked inside wet underwear in the suspect’s backpack.The video was aired during day 5 of the hearings at Manhattan Criminal Court to decide whether some evidence should be excluded from his trial.Mangione is accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024. He returned to court on Monday morning for the suppression hearing.Body-camera footage showed Altoona, Pennsylvania, Police Officer Christy Wasser searching Mangione’s backpack at the time of his arrest and discovering a magazine with bullets wrapped in wet underwear. “There was another magazine hidden in his underwear,” Wasser can be heard saying, Fox News reported.As Wasser held up the magazine, someone off camera said “it’s fu****g him.” Wasser testified that she had gone to the McDonald’s in Altoona on her own to assist Officer Joseph Detwiler. She began searching the bag after Mangione was placed under arrest and invoked his right to remain silent when officers asked if there was anything inside that they should be worried about.Wasser said that his silence heightened her concern and led her to search for a bomb, although she did not order restaurant staff or patrons out of the area.Her search uncovered the magazine, and she said she was then instructed to finish and return to the station. She told the court that two fellow officers debated whether a warrant was needed or if probable cause existed to continue the search.Mangione was arrested at the McDonald’s on December 9-2024 after an employee recognised him and alerted police. He faces multiple state and federal charges related to the alleged murder.His lawyers are asking the judge to suppress evidence taken from his backpack and statements he made to police at the time of arrest. They argued Fourth and Fifth Amendment concerns, which protect against unreasonable searches and seizures and ensure the right to due process. Prosecutors contend that the warrantless search was lawful and that Mangione’s only un-Mirandized statement was giving officers a fake name.Last week, prosecutors released the 911 call that led to Mangione’s arrest. “I’m a manager at Plank Road McDonald’s out here on the boulevard,” a manager told the dispatcher. “And I have a customer here, that some other customers were suspicious of, that he looks like the CEO shooter from New York.”",Luigi Mangione is accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024.

Who are Jan Jahanzeb and Israr Niazal? Afghan asylum seekers jailed for raping 15-year-old girl in Britain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-are-jan-jahanzeb-and-israr-niazal-afghan-asylum-seekers-jailed-for-raping-15-year-old-girl-in-britain/articleshow/125846927.cms,"



Two Afghan asylum seekers who arrived in Britain on small boats have been jailed for raping a 15-year-old girl in Leamington Spa after dragging her into a dark park.Jan Jahanzeb and Israr Niazal, both 17, lured the teenager away from her friends on May 10 before forcing her to perform oral sex in a secluded area, reports the Daily Mail. The girl screamed for help and filmed harrowing footage on her phone as she was led away, the clip was played in Warwick Crown Court.Judge Sylvia de Bertodano sentenced Jahanzeb to 10 years and eight months and Niazal to nine years and 10 months, noting the younger boy’s age at the time of the offence.“No child should have to suffer the ordeal (the victim) has suffered. The fact is, you two have robbed her of her childhood and nothing that the sentence of this court and nothing I can do today can restore that,” the judge said.She added: “You have betrayed the interests of those, like you, who come here fleeing harm and seeking safety and for that you should feel a deep and lasting sense of shame.”CCTV released after sentencing showed the boys leading the victim across a bridge at 9.21pm, flanking her on either side. At one point Jahanzeb covered her mouth as she screamed. The girl later escaped and recorded further videos describing her ordeal before a passerby took her to a police station.Prosecutor Shawn Williams said: “The evidence of lack of consent is overwhelming. The facts reveal a deeply distressing and predatory sexual offence on a vulnerable and highly intoxicated 15-year-old.”In her victim impact statement, the girl said: “The day I was raped changed me as a person. I'm no longer a happy, care-free teenager. This was my first sexual experience. When I go out, I no longer feel safe, so much so that I have started to avoid it all together.”According to the court, Jahanzeb had crossed the Channel in January after three failed attempts, while Niazal arrived in November 2024. Both were living in taxpayer-funded housing at the time of the attack. Jahanzeb now faces deportation, though Niazal may remain in the UK because he pleaded guilty a day before turning 17.Defence lawyers tried to keep the teenagers anonymous, claiming the footage was so gruesome it could trigger public disorder. The judge rejected those arguments and said the public interest in identifying them was greater.","Jan Jahanzeb and Israr Niazal, both 17, lured the teenager away from her friends before forcing her to perform oral sex in a secluded area.

Alina Habba, former personal attorney to US President Donald Trump, has resigned as acting US attorney for New Jersey after a federal appeals court ruled that she had been serving unlawfully.Habba announced her resignation via X, saying she stepped down “to protect the stability and integrity of the office which I love.”She added: “But do not mistake compliance for surrender. This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me.”The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a ruling by US District Judge Matthew Brann, who had found that the Trump administration violated federal appointments law when naming Habba as acting US attorney. Brann disqualified her from participating in ongoing cases, creating a legal standoff that delayed proceedings in New Jersey’s federal courts.Habba’s departure is the latest setback for Trump and his Justice Department as they attempt to place loyalists in key US attorney positions. Her appointment had been challenged by multiple criminal defendants, and her limited federal court experience, along with opposition from New Jersey’s Democratic senators, made Senate confirmation unlikely.Attorney General Pam Bondi also announced her resignation on X and described Habba’s resignation as “particularly unfortunate” and blamed the court for making her position “untenable.” Bondi praised Habba’s work and said her contributions to reducing crime in Camden and Newark are notable. Bondi confirmed that Habba would remain in the Justice Department as a senior adviser to the attorney general. Bondi also said the department would continue to appeal the court ruling and were positive that Habba could return to her role if the decision is reversed.41-year-old Habba had gained national attention as one of Trump’s strongest legal defenders, frequently appearing on television and representing him in high-profile cases. She was appointed acting US attorney in March and served a temporary term enforcing federal criminal and civil law. Her resignation follows months of controversy over the legality of her appointment and her role in overseeing prosecutions.Her exit raises questions about the GOP administration’s approach to installing loyalists in key Justice Department positions. Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche accused judges of bias in similar cases involving other Trump-appointed prosecutors and vowed to continue legal challenges to restore their appointments.","Alina Habba, former personal attorney to US President Donald Trump, has resigned as acting US attorney for New Jersey.

A wealthy American student at Goldsmiths in London, Joshua Michals, has been convicted of murdering his girlfriend Zhe Wang, inside her London apartment with a knife after she accused him of giving him a sexually transmitted infection. The murder took place in 2024 when Michals went to Wang's flat to end the fight they were having, but ended Wang's life and then called his father for a lawyer before calling an ambulance.Michals told the investigators that they had been dating for six months and had only had sex once because Wang was a germophobe. She would disinfect his sofa at his apartment before she sat on it, cleaned his apartment when she came to visit and even gave detailed instructions when they agreed to have sex. The instructions were on how to enter her apartment, wash himself, put on the condom before coming to the bedroom etc.Wang insisted that Michals showed her his SIT result before sex but after their sex, Wang developed a rash and asked Michals to go through another test, When Michals refused, Wang accused him of ruining her life and threatened to report to the university. On the day of the murder, when Michals went to her apartment, a fight broke out and Michals claimed Wang attacked him with a knife, resulting in a knife fight.Autopsy confirmed that Wang died from stab wounds to the head and compression to the neck.Michals told the jurors that he did not mean to attack Wang but just tried to defend himself.Prosecutors said Wang might have survived if Michals had called the ambulance instead of calling his father to get the details of a solicitor.Born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, Michals studied filmmaking at university before moving to London to pursue a year-long master’s degree at Goldsmiths. Wang was a creative writing student at Goldsmiths. They met on the campus and began an on-and-off casual relationship in 2023.","Joshua Michals, a wealthy American student at Goldsmiths in London, has been convicted of murdering his girlfriend Zhe Wang.

Indian-origin Congressman Shri Thanedar fired back at US vice president JD Vance after the MAGA leader claimed that mass migration results in the “theft of the American Dream.”Thanedar shared a family photograph of Vance’s wife, Usha’s family, celebrating Thanksgiving in 2024. He captioned the image and said: “By your own logic, your wife’s entire family is ‘stealing the American dream. ’”The image shows around 20 people of colour, along with Vance and has stirred a lot of controversy among the conservative MAGA base.The row originates from Vance’s repeated criticism of immigration. On social media, he said: “Mass migration is theft of the American Dream,” adding that studies suggesting otherwise are funded by “the people getting rich off of the old system.”Vance made similar comments during a New York Post podcast, saying it is totally normal for people to live among neighbours who share the same culture. He added that they are not obligated to speak a different language and must share a common culture. Recently, he doubled down, asserting that the only common language in America is English.Vance and his supporters blame the Biden administration for an immigration system that “promoted division” in the United States.He has also said that migrants are “undercutting the wages of American workers” and defended Donald Trump’s H-1B visa reforms as a way to protect American jobs by associating more foreign skilled workers in US industries.Furthermore, Vance’s personal life is also involved. His wife, Usha, was born into a Hindu-Indian family, which is not quite liked by the conservative base. Last month, Vance said he hoped she might eventually convert to Christianity, telling supporters she attends church with him and he wishes she might one day share his faith. Vance later clarified that she “has no plans to convert.”","Indian-origin Congressman Shri Thanedar fired back at US vice president JD Vance after the MAGA leader claimed that mass migration results in the “theft of the American Dream” Vance's wife, Usha, was born into a Hindu-Indian family, which is not quite liked by the conservative base.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125846007,imgsize-1208900,width-400,resizemode-4/125846007.jpg"

Ex-DOGE lead Elon Musk stirred a row after posting on X that “raising a foreign flag is treason and should result in immediate deportation.”His remark came in response to a video showing Syrian immigrants in Germany celebrating a milestone they referred to as “Liberation Day,” marking the first anniversary of the fall of the Assad regime.Musk’s post reflects a larger, more MAGA-like pattern: In recent months, he has repeatedly criticised the European Union and immigration policies across Western countries.Musk was fined a multibillion-euro block against his social media platform X by the EU. He described the EU bloc as a “bureaucratic monster” and called for its abolition. The Tesla CEO even claimed that national sovereignty should be restored to individual European states and that a nation that does not share a common culture is no nation at all.His stance on migration is also hardline, with selective aggression against criminals. He said on X: “Close the borders and deport criminals.”At the same time, Musk has voiced support for the legal immigration of skilled workers, including H-1B visa,s to the United States. He said the US has “benefitted immensely from talented [foreign] engineers and scientists.” His stance on H1-B aligns with the MAGA chief, Trump himself.However, he condemns the use of visa for illegal and illicit practices like scams and fraud.Musk has constantly spoken about migrant‑linked crime and violence going on in Europe.

American immigration lawyer Brad Bernstein commented on the ongoing ICE crackdowns all across the country and observed that the pattern of ICE arrests has changed. They are not raiding criminals; they are lifting undocumented people from workplaces, airports, Green Card interviews. Berstein claimed that when President Donald Trump took office, 46% of ICE arrests involved someone with a criminal conviction, but by mid-October, the percentage dropped to 28.""If the idea is to get rid of criminals, that's not what's happening. But if the idea is to get rid of people who don't look like me, that's what is happening,"" the immigration lawyer said.Many people who are being arrested and will now be thrown out of the US have a traffic ticket against them as the maximum offence and zero criminal record.""The new federal ICE crackdowns look like they’re aimed at violent criminals, but the numbers tell an entirely different story. In major operations across Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington DC, and Massachusetts, more than half of the people arrested had zero criminal history. In Washington DC, that number jumped to 84 percent. Violent convictions were almost nonexistent: 2 to 6 percent, depending on the city. Nationwide, ICE has shifted away from arresting people with criminal backgrounds,"" Bernstein said.These immigration raids are taking place with big deployments of officials in military gear but they are arresting people with no criminal record, the lawyer said.ICE is targeting city after city and arresting en masse, spreading fear among immigrants. While this has been going on for quite some time, the pace has now picked up after the DC shooting that prompted the administration to ban any immigration requests from 19 countries of concern. Nationals from these countries got their citizenship ceremonies canceled which is the last step before getting US citizenship and are left clueless about what lies for them in future.UC Berkeley's Deportation Data Project has revealed that ICE arrested nearly 75,000 undocumented immigrants with no criminal records in the first nine months of Trump's administration.

Investigative journalist Kenneth Klippenstein revealed a leaked Justice Department memo that instructs FBI to begin compiling a list of American individuals and groups who can become potential domestic extremists.The document was reportedly signed by Attorney General Pam Bondi. It has a sweeping plan to identify, track and investigate citizens based on political and ideological indicators rather than specific acts of violence.According to the memo, the FBI is ordered to “compile a list of groups or entities engaging in acts that may constitute domestic terrorism”. The criteria almost perfectly align with President Trump’s directive, National Security Presidential Memorandum 7, which the memo says it aims to implement.The memo explicitly lists categories of people who may be referred for federal scrutiny. According to its wording, individuals or groups may be flagged if they display any of the following:Furthermore, the memo instructs the FBI to create a cash reward system for information leading to arrests, expand its public tip line and encourage cooperators who can provide testimony against others.The directive cites the killing of conservative activist and MAGA ally Charlie Kirk as a turning point and orders task forces to map networks “inside and outside the United States”.The revelations come amid growing concern about NSPM 7 and the possibility of a new domestic counterterrorism framework that could place millions of Americans under suspicion for their political beliefs, according to Kenneth Klippenstein.National Security Presidential Memorandum 7 is a directive signed by President Trump that sets out broad criteria for identifying domestic extremist threats inside the United States. It focuses heavily on ideological indicators rather than violent acts, raising concerns that the policy could blur the line between dissent and terrorism.Kenneth Klippenstein is an American investigative journalist known for publishing leaked government documents and exposing internal law enforcement practices.

Steve Bannon, the former adviser to President Donald Trump, who always called H-1B visa program indentured servitude, again called out the program on his show as he spoke about the ongoing crackdown on migrants. Bannon said Elon Musk must understand that the H-1B visa program cannot be reformed as it is 'scam from start to finish'. Bannon said to become a tech worker in modern America, a kid has to be dedidated to STEM, they have to do great in high school and then go to a great college, which is now flooded by Chinese and Asians with no place for Americans.""Let me just be blunt about H-1Bs for Elmo (Elon) Musk.

Florida governor Ron DeSantis weighed in on the ongoing debate over the H-1B visa program, calling it “labor arbitrage” that benefits big companies and hurts domestic American workers.His comments came in response to a social media post that said many companies hire H-1B workers to save labor costs and not exceptional talent. The post said that companies could pay an American worker three times as much for the same job, but instead they hire foreign workers whose pay is kept low and predictable, keeping them as long-term, cheaper employees.Many “America First” voices, including Nikki Haley’s son Nalin Haley, have expressed similar opinions about immigrant salaries. He said that people from abroad are willing to work for half the pay of American workers, which limits opportunities and jobs for Americans.The row over H-1B visas has intensified this year, especially after the federal government raised the application fee to $100,000 for new in September. This steep increase was officially intended to curb abuse of the visa system and prioritize American workers. However, the policy could severely impact immigrant workers, particularly from India, who have historically received the majority of H-1B approvals.Adding to the tension, US tightened screening of H-1B and dependent H-4 visa holders, now including social media checks. Companies hiring international talent also face stricter compliance rules, contributing to a sharp drop in H-1B approvals—reaching a 10-year low in fiscal 2025.Amid these challenges, a US congressman of Indian-origin, Raja Krishnamoorthi, reintroduced the HIRE Act, aiming to double the annual H-1B cap from 65,000 to 130,000 to ensure a steady flow of skilled workers in sectors like IT, healthcare, and research.The row comes amid an internal divide among GOP conservatives over H-1B visas. The MAGA chief, Donald Trump, said last month that the US needs skilled foreign workers to fill crucial sectors such as tech and defence.

‘Go Back To Your Hell’: US President Targets 19 Non-European Nations In New Immigration Suspension





: A resurfaced video of an Indian-American immigration attorney unleashing a profanity-laced attack on President Donald Trump at an Indian IT lobbying group conference has ignited a furious MAGA backlash, intensifying scrutiny of the H-1B visa system and prompting entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to drop out of the group’s 2025 conference in Puerto Rico this past weekend.What began as a routine motivational address to immigrant tech workers has now snowballed one of the most intense political controversies the $500-billion IT consulting sector has faced in years. The video, recorded at an undated ITServe Seattle chapter meeting but posted online only in November, shows Sheela Murthy, a prominent immigration lawyer, telling delegates to kick Donald Trump’s ass, while mocking his marriages to immigrant spouses and asserting “the president is not God. ” A second clip shows Murthy riffing on the word “fraud,” discussing how companies should respond to federal audits.MAGA activists seized on the clips as evidence of systemic abuse inside the visa system, calling the lobbying group ITServe a “foreign lobbying cartel writing H-1B policy” and tagging Vice President J.D. Vance and FBI Director Kash Patel. Influencer Waqas Khan labeled Murthy the “ringleader of the H-1B crime syndicate,” while other accounts warned that Murthy’s comments amounted to threats against a sitting president.But immigration advocates and industry figures maintained that the backlash cherry-picked stray inflammatory lines from a conference several years ago, asserting that the full speech shows Murthy urging confidence, unity, and civic participation — not literal violence. The clips, they say, were weaponized in a climate where H-1B visas are a political lightning rod, with some ITServ insiders noting that fake MAGA-aligned accounts—some linked to Pakistan—amplified the controversy, further inflaming tensions.Murthy’s firm has filed more than 10,000 H-1B and PERM cases since 2020, giving her rare visibility among foreign-born IT workers anxious about Trump’s second-term push to raise H-1B fees by $100,000 and expand social-media vetting. Murthy herself has won laurels in Maryland, a Democrat-run state, for her community work and contributions to society.Facing mounting outrage, ITServe Alliance released a statement on December 3, distancing itself from Murthy and asserting support for the administration’s immigration priorities.""Our organization and leadership are committed to working with President Trump and his administration on common-sense immigration reforms... ITServe Alliance wants to be clear that we stand with President Trump and his administration in stopping illegal immigration and reforming the system with merit-based solutions,” the group declared—an extraordinary move for an organization that typically avoids partisan alignment.The escalating controversy also forced Republican candidate for Ohio Governor Vivek Ramaswamy to withdraw from delivering a keynote at Synergy 2025, ITServe’s flagship conference in Puerto Rico on December 4–5.Founded in 2010 by Indian American entrepreneurs, mostly from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, ITServe has grown into the nation’s largest association of IT services and staffing firms, representing more than 2,200 member companies. The group advocates for predictable H-1B rules, expansion of STEM talent pathways, streamlined audits and business-friendly immigration reforms.But critics, including MAGA-aligned activists and U.S. labor groups, accuse ITServe of functioning as a pressure bloc for outsourcing firms. They cite over 30 lawsuits the group has filed to loosen H-1B regulations. Supporters counter that ITServe adheres to federal rules and contributes to U.S. innovation, scholarships, and job growth.With Trump’s administration intensifying enforcement, pursuing FARA investigations, and pushing Senate Republicans to advance bills which tightens work visa rules, Indian-origin tech workers—who receive 70% of all H-1B visas—are feeling acute pressure. For ITServe, the fallout threatens political relationships during a pivotal regulatory year. As one long-time member put it: “We drive on the highway like everyone else—some may speed, but that doesn’t make the entire system illegal. ITServe isn’t anti-American. We’re part of America’s tech backbone.”","Video shows Sheela Murthy telling delegates to kick Donald Trump’s ass, while mocking his marriages to immigrant spouses and asserting “the president is not God. ” A second clip shows Murthy riffing on the word “fraud,” discussing how companies should respond to federal audits.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





Pakistan’s defence ministry on Friday officially notified the appointment of Field Marshal Asim Munir as the country’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).The ""president, on the advice of the prime minister, is pleased to appoint Field Marshal Asim Munir (NI) M as the chief of army staff, concurrently the chief of defence forces for a tenure of five years,” the notification read, news agency PTI reported citing Dawn.This comes a day after President Asif Ali Zardari approved his appointment on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.According to the notification issued under Article 243 of Pakistan’s Constitution and the amended Pakistan Army Act, Munir will serve concurrently as Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces for a tenure of five years. The notification marks the most significant restructuring of Pakistan’s military command since the 1970s.The appointment follows the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment last month, which created the new CDF post to establish a unified command structure and enable faster decision-making in critical situations.The amendment also abolished the office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which had coordinated the tri-services since 1976. The CJCSC post formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.With the restructuring, operational, administrative and strategic authority of the armed forces has been consolidated into a single office headed by the CDF. The revised Article 243 provides that the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, will appoint the army chief, who will concurrently serve as the CDF.Munir was first appointed Army Chief in November 2022 for three years. His tenure was extended to five years in 2024 after amendments to the Pakistan Army Act.He was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal days after the four-day conflict with India in May, becoming only the second officer in Pakistan’s history to hold the rank after Field Marshal Ayub Khan.Alongside Munir’s notification, the defence ministry also confirmed a two-year extension for Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu. His extended tenure as Chief of the Air Staff will begin in March 2026 and continue till March 2028.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Munir on his “historic” appointment, saying his leadership had been pivotal in guiding Pakistan’s armed forces. He also praised the air chief for his command during recent operations. defence minister Khawaja Asif and other senior leaders also extended their congratulations, according to Dawn.Information minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan’s defence had strengthened with the establishment of a unified command. Dismissing speculation over the delay in the notification, he said rumours circulating on social and electronic media had proven baseless.Earlier uncertainty had followed the abolition of the CJCSC post and the end of Munir’s original three-year term in late November, leading to political speculation over upcoming four-star appointments. Government officials maintained that the delay was procedural and linked to the prime minister’s travel schedule.Explaining the significance of the new post, army spokesman Lt General Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry said the CDF headquarters would improve coordination across modern, multi-domain warfare involving land, sea, air, cyber, space and intelligence operations. He added that many countries already operate under similar unified command structures.Under the amended military laws, the five-year tenure of the first COAS-plus-CDF is deemed to begin from the date of notification, effectively resetting Munir’s term. The law also allows future reappointments or extensions of up to five years, creating the legal framework for continuity in leadership.The next major step under the new structure will be the appointment of the Commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), a four-star position responsible for strategic assets. The NSC commander will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the CDF.Meanwhile, law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the defence ministry is finalising a new organogram for the CDF to clearly define command flows between the CDF, the service chiefs and the newly created strategic command.Politically, the 27th Constitutional Amendment has drawn mixed reactions. While the ruling coalition hailed it as a step towards efficiency and national security, opposition leaders warned that it concentrates excessive power in the military and could weaken democratic and provincial autonomy.",Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions

Why Imran Khan still remains a threat to Asim Munir





PTI without Imran: Still a major force





PTI was barred from contesting the 2024 general elections.

Dozens of PTI leaders were detained.

PTI-backed independents still won more seats than any other group.

Popularity that has not faded





A 2023 Gallup Pakistan survey showed 61% of Pakistanis had a “good opinion” of him -- the highest rating among all national leaders as reported by Dawn.

Arab News quoted analysts saying Khan remains ""too politically relevant to sideline.""

Televised appearances that trigger unrest





Nationwide protests

Arson and clashes

Attacks on military installations, including the Corps Commander’s residence in Lahore

Nationwide mobile shutdowns and troop deployment

Why Pak army cannot 'eliminate' Imran Khan





Key factors keeping Khan politically alive:





Victimhood narrative: Solitary confinement and restricted access cast him as a political prisoner, a powerful image in Pakistan’s grievance-driven politics.

Mobilisation without presence: PTI’s digital machinery enables mass mobilisation even without Khan physically present.

Diaspora and social media influence: Global PTI networks amplify every statement, intensifying scrutiny on Pakistan’s military.

High-risk optics: Every court appearance or televised moment risks sparking unrest.

The state vs sentiment





The jail sentence - not the silence





Constitutional shift and expanding military power





Munir's foreign outreach and US engagement





Imran's strength: Mobilisation without access





Why the military needs more than power









Is Imran Khan still a threat to Asim Munir ? The question looms over Pakistan ’s power structure. Former Prime Minister and cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, now over two years into imprisonment, remains a potent challenge to army chief Asim Munir — whose rapid ascent and consolidation of authority have made him Pakistan’s de facto ruler.With Munir now elevated as the Pakistan's first chief of defence forces, commanding the army, navy and air force, his institutional power is at its strongest — yet the confrontation with Khan, even from behind bars, continues to shadow that authority. The two have been locked in a prolonged, deeply personal confrontation.Despite being confined, Khan has transformed from a jailed political leader into a symbolic and political counterweight to Munir’s expanding military-political dominance.Far from fading, the rivalry between the two men has only sharpened. Munir commands the state; Khan commands sentiment. And as the events of the last two years show, sentiment can be far harder to control.Imran Khan's incarceration has fuelled a narrative of persecution and martyrdom among supporters. Long spells of isolation, restrictions on visits, and recurring allegations of mistreatment have strengthened this perception, with some analysts warning that these measures risk backfiring.Imtiaz Gul, executive director of the Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), told Al Jazeera: ""The primary objective of blocking access and keeping Khan in solitary confinement is apparently meant to break him into (agreeing to) a compromise and neutralise the groundswell of anti-government sentiment.”Increasingly, barring visits to Khan is viewed not merely as a security decision, but as a political strategy that may harm the governing PML-N and reinforce Khan’s narrative of institutional overreach.Even without its leader on the ballot, PTI remains one of Pakistan's strongest political forces.PTI claims widespread rigging, accusing the government and military of manipulating the results, allegations echoed by several independent observers. The establishment denies all wrongdoing, but the perception of electoral injustice has only strengthened PTI’s street momentum.For perspective, Imran Khan’s PTI had won 151 seats in the 2018 elections, defeating Nawaz Sharif’s PML-N (81 seats) and PPP (54). That victory was hailed by PTI as ""the end of an era,"" breaking the decades-long political monopoly of the PML-N, PPP and the military establishment.Despite his imprisonment, Khan remains Pakistan’s most popular political figure.This enduring popularity, even at a time of complete political inability, poses a direct challenge to Munir's authority.Even brief, controlled public appearances continue to spark major political reactions.During the May 2023 unrest, Imran Khan's court appearance -- after his dramatic arrest by paramilitary forces -- showed him flashing a victory sign. The televised images spread instantly and triggered:These scenes were unprecedented not only for their scale but because the anger erupted in Punjab, the heart of Pakistan's military recruitment and administrative base.More recently, when false rumours about Khan’s death spread, PTI supporters mobilised across Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, again forcing an immediate government response.A leader who provokes unrest without speaking remains difficult to contain.An analysis in The Diplomat warns that the army ""cannot afford to eliminate"" a leader with deep political roots in Punjab.Such an act, the report cautions, could ""unleash one that the state may not survive.""Khan is ethnically Pashtun but politically anchored in Punjab, with support stretching across Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the diaspora. His arrest in 2023 showed that anger against the military establishment now emerges in Punjab.Eliminating him would not neutralise his influence; it would likely create a ""martyr"" of unprecedented scale.Munir commands the state apparatus. Khan commands sentiment.And in Pakistan, sentiment has repeatedly proved more enduring than power.No prime minister has survived a confrontation with the military, but no army chief has faced a jailed leader with such widespread support and political resilience.Since August 2023, Khan has faced a series of corruption and security-related cases. In January 2025, he received a 14-year sentence in a land-graft case, a verdict his supporters claim was engineered to keep him out of politics.Khan’s public statements from jail fuel the perception of political persecution. He has directly accused Munir of ""moral bankruptcy,"" and called him ""mentally unstable man"" claiming Pakistan's constitution and rule of law have collapsed under him: ""I have been kept in complete solitary confinement, locked inside a cell with no contact with a single human being for four weeks… even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been taken away from us. ""His family members have echoed concerns about his treatment. His sister, after visiting him, said he told her they were subjecting him to ""mental torture"" and held Asim Munir responsible.The recent 27th amendment -- widely called a ""constitutional coup"" -- has entrenched military dominance further. Munir's elevation as chief of defence forces gives him command over all three services.Mahmood Khan Achakzai, head of Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan, warned: ""There is no constitution in Pakistan now. No judiciary. No social contract. They have made one man into a king above all.""Months ago, Munir's increasing visibility included multiple meetings with Donald Trump. Munir even nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, crediting him with easing India–Pakistan high military tensions, a move driven by a desire for US recognition. Trump later referred to him as his ""favourite field marshal.""It is often assumed that political power requires physical presence. Imran's continuing influence disproves that assumption.His followers still speak of him not as a convicted convict, but as a leader wronged. The slogans, the sense of injustice, the personal stories -- all add up to mobilisation potential. And that potential doesn’t require Khan’s freedom; it only requires people’s belief.Statements from his family amplify this -- for instance, the anguish voiced by his son over not knowing whether his father is safe in jail. Such public airing of fear and trauma becomes a magnet for sympathy and solidarity.""Not knowing whether your father is safe, injured or even alive is a form of psychological torture,"" he had said in written remarks.However, Imran Khan's sister was eventually allowed to meet the former prime minister. After the visit, she said, ""Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he told me they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this.""For the military leadership under Asim Munir, the calculus is not just about brute strength, it is about legitimacy. Pakistan’s power dynamics have long relied on a veneer of neutrality: the idea that the army guards the system while politics handles politics. Overplaying that role risks shattering the illusion.From Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan to Zia-ul-Haq and Pervez Musharraf , every era of military rule reinforced the pattern: the army positioned itself not merely as a defender of borders, but as the ultimate arbiter of Pakistan's politics and identity.Each takeover was justified through narratives of chaos, corruption, or national security, allowing the establishment to retain dominance even during civilian periods. Today, under Asim Munir, this pattern continues in a more sophisticated form: instead of overt coups, power is exercised through constitutional engineering, judicial pressure, and political sidelining, most visibly in the dismantling of Imran Khan’s political career. The military’s quest is not only to command the state but to remain indispensable to its very definition.As long as Imran Khan remains a contested figure, not just legally, but symbolically, the army's claim to neutrality becomes harder to maintain.International pressure, media scrutiny, and internal dissent all rise with every heavy-handed move.Hence, the challenge for Munir may be deeper than suppressing one man, it is about managing optics, institutional trust and political fallout.",Is Imran Khan still a threat to Asim Munir? The question looms over Pakistan ’s power structure. Khan has transformed from a jailed political leader into a symbolic and political counterweight to Munir’s expanding military-political dominance.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125789753,imgsize-1800195,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-62.jpg"

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday formally appointed Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir as Pakistan’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) for a period of five years.The move follows the recent passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment on November 12, which created the post of CDF to unify command across the armed forces and streamline decision-making during critical situations.The newly created CDF replaces the abolished office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.President Zardari approved the recommendation submitted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for Munir’s appointment. A press release from the President’s office extended best wishes to Munir in his new role.The same release also announced a two-year extension in the service of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu, Chief of Air Staff, effective from the completion of his current tenure in March 2026.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the reforms “bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while maintaining military honour and tradition” and confirmed there were no legal or political obstacles to Munir’s appointment. He also stated that the Defence Ministry was preparing a new organogram for the CDF to reflect the changes.Field Marshal Munir, who was initially appointed as COAS in November 2022 for three years, had his tenure extended to five years in 2024.With this appointment, he assumes a historic dual role, serving simultaneously as Chief of Army Staff and the first Chief of Defence Forces, marking a significant shift in Pakistan’s military hierarchy and institutional structure.The 27th Constitutional Amendment elevates the army chief to the role of CDF with constitutional authority over all three branches of the military: army, navy and air force.It also introduces judicial reforms, including the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) to handle constitutional matters, allowing the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the amendment as a demonstration of national unity, highlighting the role of law enforcement in recent counterterrorism efforts.While the ruling coalition including PPP, PML-N, and MQM-P, supported the amendment, opposition parties criticized it as unconstitutional, warning it could concentrate excessive power in the military.PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan described it as the “Baku Amendments,” accusing the government of undermining democracy. PPP Senator Raza Rabbani warned the changes could damage provincial autonomy and roll back powers devolved under the 18th Amendment, according to Dawn.Following Munir’s appointment, the next key step will be appointing the commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), a four-star position previously under the CJCSC. The NSC commander will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the CDF.","President Asif Ali Zardari formally appointed Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir as Pakistan’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) for a period of five years.

Parallel governance, ‘parchi’ systems and water mafias





Several informal systems operated during this period:

The ‘Parchi’ System: Residents, businesses and even small schools were required to obtain a stamped permission slip or parchi from PAC offices to build, renovate, operate stalls or open new ventures. What looked like a routine approval process effectively served as taxation, a tool of surveillance and a means to regulate economic activity.

Water and Tanker Control: Amid persistent water shortages across Karachi, PAC factions captured key pipeline points and operated illegal hydrants. Water was sold through tankers at inflated rates, turning a basic utility into one of the most profitable sources of revenue for the gangs. Control over water distribution also gave PAC leverage over entire neighbourhoods.

Welfare Patronage and ‘Robin Hood’ Politics: A share of illicit earnings was used to sponsor madrassas, support religious events, organise football tournaments, fund community funerals and assist poor families. This welfare strategy deepened PAC’s influence and aligned it with PPP’s political base, reinforcing the perception of gang leaders as protectors rather than mere criminals.

PPP, the Bhuttos and the contested 'protector' narrative





A factual account of the events surrounding Benazir’s return and death underscores this point:

Karsaz bombing (18 October 2007): Benazir was in an open truck surrounded by PPP volunteers, not in a car. Her protection was largely handled by party workers and an informal crowd, not gang networks.

Assassination in Rawalpindi December, 27, 2007: At the time she was targeted, she was travelling in a white Toyota Land Cruiser driven by Javed Rehman, a trained PPP driver, not Rehman Dakait. No credible evidence links the gangster to her security detail.

Post-war Lyari: Quiet streets, unresolved questions









NEW DELHI: Karachi’s Lyari has long been associated with a dual identity. To its residents, it is the “mother of Karachi” – one of the city’s oldest settlements powered by dockworkers, truck drivers, boxers and footballers. To the rest of Pakistan, especially through the 1990s and 2000s, it came to signify something very different: a “mini Brazil” of football-obsessed alleys, heavily armed gangs, and extortion rackets, long branded as Karachi’s “wild west.”It is this layered, contradictory Lyari that Aditya Dhar’s recent 'Dhurandhar' turns into cinema. The film revolves around characters that seem to be inspired by gangster Rehman Dakait, police officer Chaudhry Aslam and a shadowy military-intelligence player resembling Ilyas Kashmiri (fictionalised as Major Iqbal). Alongside Pakistani security figures, the narrative hints at a foreign intelligence angle featuring an unnamed “Indian spy chief” — a character with echoes of a former top security official who, in real life, has been involved in covert roles in regional conflicts in Pakistan. These references remain ambiguous on screen, but they mirror real allegations that have circulated for years through local press conferences, dossiers and counterclaims on both sides of the border.Reacting to the controversy around Dhurandhar and the a case file in Delhi high court, Major Mohit Sharma’s brother, Madhur Sharma, said the petition was filed due to ongoing speculation that the film was inspired by the Ashok Chakra awardee’s life without any transparency from the makers. Madhur clarified that the family is not opposed to a film based on Major Sharma, but objected to the possibility of using his story without consent. “We would be proud if a film is made on him. Even in 2021, a film was announced and we supported the producers. He has left a legacy, and it should live on,” he said. The family maintains that they are only seeking clarity and dignity for the officer: “There is no benefit the parents are looking for… If the film is based on him, just say, ‘Sorry ma’am, we didn’t inform you.’ If not, say the hype is untrue.”The Delhi high court heard the plea filed by Major Sharma’s parents seeking a review before the film’s release. While the court did not stay the December 5 release of Dhurandhar, it acknowledged the legitimacy of the family’s concerns regarding similarities to a real-life officer without consent. The court referred the matter to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) for examination, noting the need for regulatory scrutiny before the film proceeds.Following the controversy, director Aditya Dhar issued a clarification on X addressed to the family. He wrote: “Hi, sir - our film Dhurandhar is not based on the life of braveheart Major Mohit Sharma AC(P) SM. This is an official clarification. I assure you, if we do make a biopic on Mohit sir in the future, we will do it with full consent and in complete consultation with the family, and in a way that truly honors his sacrifice for the nation and the legacy it has left for all of us. Jai Hind.”This blurred mix of fact, rumour and state narrative reflects Lyari’s history itself. For more than six decades, the neighbourhood has moved on two parallel tracks. One is a working-class community that powered Karachi’s docks, produced champion boxers and footballers, and remained a loyal base of the Pakistan People's Party ( PPP ). The other is a network of gangs and protection rackets that emerged from the hashish trade of the 1960s and later expanded into narcotics trafficking, extortion, land capture and control of water tankers.Successive governments, including PPP administrations, did not simply fight these groups; at various points they bargained with them, funded them or turned a blind eye. Leaders like Rehman Dakait, and later Uzair Baloch, acted not only as crime bosses but as political intermediaries who ran parallel governance under the banner of the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC), often brandishing PPP flags at their offices. As Taliban networks poured into Karachi in the 2000s and regional intelligence rivalries spilled into the city, Lyari’s gangs were no longer seen merely as enforcers protecting a vote bank — they were gradually treated as potential pieces in a wider security chessboard.With Dhurandhar reigniting attention, this story revisits how Lyari transformed from a labour colony to PPP stronghold to a battleground shaped by gang wars, state patronage, counter-terror operations and allegations of espionage. What emerges is not simply the tale of feared men, but the story of a neighbourhood where poverty, politics and competing security agendas turned everyday life into a prolonged and violent conflict.a long, violent war.Lyari is among the oldest continuously inhabited parts of Karachi and holds a foundational place in the city’s history. Long before Karachi became Pakistan’s financial hub, Lyari evolved as a working-class settlement dominated by Baloch communities who migrated from coastal and interior regions in search of livelihoods. During the 18th and 19th centuries, as the port emerged as the centre of colonial trade, Baloch labourers became indispensable to loading cargo, building roads and supporting maritime activities. This early dependence on manual workers gradually transformed Lyari into a labour colony closely interlinked with Karachi’s industrial and infrastructural growth.Despite its importance in sustaining the city’s economy, the locality remained neglected in terms of urban development. Narrow lanes, dense housing clusters, unreliable utilities and limited state services came to define its daily reality. Yet, Lyari’s social fabric remained strong: sports, community centres and local cultural traditions created a sense of belonging that distinguished it from other Karachi neighbourhoods.In politics, Lyari’s identity further crystallised with the rise of the Pakistan People's Party. Since the 1970s, the PPP’s populist messaging—centred on economic justice and empowerment of marginalised groups—found deep resonance in Lyari. During decades of shifting political power in Karachi, the locality consistently returned PPP candidates to provincial and national assemblies. This loyalty turned Lyari into the party’s most dependable urban stronghold, a constituency where electoral victories were seldom in doubt.Over time, however, this relationship between Lyari and the PPP took a complex turn. As Karachi’s security landscape deteriorated in the 1980s and 1990s, the party increasingly relied on local strongmen, community leaders and later armed groups to maintain influence and protect its vote bank. Patronage networks developed, blurring the lines between politics, street authority and organised crime. What began as a working-class community with a vibrant political identity would eventually become the focal point of Karachi’s most violent gang conflict—one in which loyalty, power and criminality became deeply entangled.The roots of the Lyari gang war go back to the 1960s, when the area emerged as a key node in the local hashish trade. According to both journalistic and academic accounts, early figures like Dad Muhammad (“Dadal”) and his brother Sheru moved into the hashish business in the mid-1960s, challenging the dominance of an older drug boss known as “Kala Nag”.Kala Nag was eventually killed in what was officially described as a police encounter, and the hashish economy fragmented into rival factions. Violence at this stage largely revolved around knives and small arms, with public killings used to send messages and enforce territorial control.In the 1990s, a more educated generation of criminals appeared. One of the most prominent was Iqbal, known locally as “Babu Dacoit”, who reportedly held a Master’s degree in physics. Operating across a wider network, he ran drugs and other rackets while remaining largely beyond the reach of the police. His later arrest, when he was already paralysed, symbolised a shift from small-scale street crime to more organised, networked operations.A major shift in Lyari’s politics and crime landscape came with the ascent of Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch, widely known as Rehman Dakait. Born into a family already linked to smuggling networks, Rehman entered the criminal world at a young age. By the mid-1990s, he had developed a reputation for extreme violence, with local accounts even alleging that he murdered his own mother during a domestic dispute—an unverified but persistent story that reinforced his notoriety.By the early 2000s, Rehman had consolidated control over large parts of Lyari’s illicit economy, including drug trafficking, extortion and gambling rackets. Yet, he also cultivated an image as a benefactor. Oral histories, media reporting and academic studies describe how he funded small clinics, madrassas, football tournaments, neighbourhood parks and schools, using criminal proceeds to build patronage. This dual identity—provider and predator—helped him secure legitimacy among segments of the local population who felt abandoned by the state.Rehman’s rise coincided with Lyari’s continued loyalty to the PPP. As political competition intensified in Karachi, PPP leaders increasingly saw strategic value in a local armed actor who could protect the party’s dominance and mobilise votes. Political alignment, according to multiple accounts, allowed Rehman to operate with greater impunity and helped formalise gang influence under a new name: the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC).Formed around 2008, the PAC presented itself as a community “peace” organisation but functioned as an institutionalised version of Rehman’s operations. It opened offices, appointed local commanders, mediated disputes, collected protection money and distributed welfare. In a context of chronic state neglect, many residents began to rely on the PAC as a parallel administration, making it one of the most powerful non-state authorities Karachi had ever seen.The roots of Lyari’s modern gang war lie in an older conflict shaped by ransom kidnappings, shifting alliances and internal betrayals. In the 1980s and 1990s, parts of Lyari’s criminal economy were dominated by a figure known as Haji Lalu, with another notorious operator, Dadal, working as one of his trusted aides. Disputes over ransom money extorted from wealthy businessmen gradually fractured this relationship. The split laid the foundation for two rival blocs: one centred on Lalu and his son, Arshad Pappu, and the other aligned with Dadal’s family, including his son, Rehman Dakait.The rivalry intensified through the 1990s. Dadal’s murder—widely believed to have been carried out by a competing gang—created a vacuum that Rehman moved to fill, initially with Lalu’s support. But a later dispute over a substantial ransom sum allegedly taken behind Rehman’s back marked the end of that partnership. The fallout turned the former allies into adversaries, cementing a bitter feud between Rehman’s camp and that of Haji Lalu and Arshad Pappu.A separate event subsequently brought an important new actor onto the scene: Uzair Jan Baloch, the son of a transport businessman, Faiz Muhammad, known locally as Mama Faizu. According to both police records and local accounts, Faizu was kidnapped and killed in 2003 by men linked to Arshad Pappu. Uzair initially attempted to seek justice through legal channels but reportedly faced threats and obstruction. Sharing a common enemy in Pappu, he turned instead toward his cousin, Rehman Dakait, joining his organisation.Over the following years, the Rehman–Uzair alliance fought a sustained war against the Pappu–Lalu network. What began as a dispute over illicit profits evolved into a violent cycle of killings, reprisals and territorial battles. By the mid-2000s, the feud had escalated into one of the deadliest urban conflicts in Karachi, with casualties running into the hundreds and paving the way for a new era of militarised gang politics.With the rise of Rehman Dakait and, later, Uzair Baloch, the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC) grew beyond a criminal network and evolved into a parallel governance structure in Lyari. Between roughly 2008 and 2013, researchers describe Lyari as effectively under PAC’s informal administration, with neighbourhood “commanders’’ exercising authority over small jurisdictions. These commanders managed disputes, issued permissions and collected funds in a manner that closely resembled state functions.These overlapping spheres blurred boundaries between state actors and non-state power. PAC offices routinely displayed both their own banners and PPP flags, while police operations in Lyari were often delayed, curtailed or influenced by political pressure. For a period, the PAC did not simply challenge state authority—it partially replaced it.Within Lyari, Rehman Dakait was widely viewed as being closely aligned with senior leaders of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP). Journalistic reporting and local accounts repeatedly describe him as someone who maintained proximity to the Bhutto leadership and attended major PPP political events.A popular narrative in Lyari claims that Rehman “saved” former prime minister Benazir Bhutto during the 18 October 2007 Karsaz attack in Karachi, when two explosions targeted her homecoming procession. In these accounts, Rehman is portrayed as part of an informal security circle that helped her escape following the blast. The story has fuelled his “protector” image and contributed to his Robin Hood-style mystique.However, despite the narrative’s frequency in oral history, there is no independent, verifiable evidence confirming that Rehman personally rescued Benazir or served as her driver or official security guard at any point. What is more clearly documented is the broader political relationship: Lyari’s gangs and the PPP operated in a framework of mutual benefit for years, with the party relying on armed control of the constituency and the gangs receiving political space to operate.After the PPP returned to power in 2008, Rehman publicly rebranded himself as Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch, presenting the Peoples’ Aman Committee as a community organisation rather than a gang body. His growing political visibility, and reported sympathies with certain Baloch nationalist circles, are believed by some analysts and residents to have contributed to his killing in a controversial police “encounter” in 2009.As media scrutiny of Lyari intensified and gang violence spread to other parts of Karachi, state pressure began to mount. At the centre of this response was SSP Chaudhry Aslam Khan, an officer in the Crime Investigation Department (CID) known for aggressive policing tactics. Aslam cultivated a reputation as an “encounter specialist,” targeting both militant groups and organised crime. His public stance against Lyari gangs put him in direct confrontation with Rehman Dakait, who by the mid-2000s had become one of the most influential figures in Karachi’s underworld.Law enforcement records and press reports from the period describe a tense cat-and-mouse dynamic between the two men. Rehman repeatedly evaded capture; in at least two documented incidents, he escaped custody after allegedly bribing police officers. According to local media accounts and later investigations, Rehman paid select CID and jail officials to secure temporary releases or avoid charges, a practice facilitated by weak internal oversight and political protection. These incidents contributed to Aslam’s personal resolve. Journalists covering Karachi’s crime beat recall that Aslam increasingly framed the pursuit of Rehman as a matter of professional and personal credibility for the police force.On 9 August 2009, police announced that Rehman had been killed in a shootout near Steel Town, on Karachi’s outskirts. Officials claimed that Rehman and three accomplices opened fire on police and were killed in retaliatory fire. However, from the outset, rights groups and local residents questioned the official account. Activists, lawyers and researchers later described the killing as a likely extrajudicial execution, consistent with a broader pattern of “encounters” used in Karachi to bypass a slow judicial system and fragile witness protections.With Rehman removed, the gang landscape did not stabilise. Instead, the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC), which he had informally led, underwent a leadership transition. Within weeks, Uzair Jan Baloch was positioned as Rehman’s successor, assuming both the criminal networks and the political connections tied to PPP support. Unlike Rehman, whose authority rested heavily on personality and charisma, Uzair’s tenure was marked by greater bureaucratisation—defined commanders, more formalised extortion systems and deeper conflict with the state. This period would set the stage for some of the bloodiest episodes of the Lyari gang war.After Rehman Dakait’s killing in 2009, leadership of the Lyari network did not pass smoothly to a single successor. Uzair Jan Baloch projected himself as the political head of the organisation: educated, relatively well-spoken, and comfortable appearing alongside PPP leaders. His image contrasted sharply with the operational commander Noor Muhammad, better known as “Baba Ladla”, who had a reputation for ruthlessness built over years as an enforcer in neighbourhood turf battles.Initially, the two worked side by side under the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC) banner. But disagreements over extortion routes, neighbourhood control and access to political patrons gradually turned into open rivalry. Within Lyari, some commanders gravitated toward Uzair’s political authority and alleged links to provincial leadership; others aligned with Baba Ladla’s street power. This divide transformed PAC from a single entity into competing armed factions.The conflict reached its most infamous moment in March 2013, with the killing of rival gangster Arshad Pappu. According to court filings and media reporting, Pappu and his brother Yasir Arafat were abducted from Karachi’s Defence neighbourhood and taken to Lyari. Both were tortured, killed and later mutilated. Their remains were reportedly burned and dumped—widely interpreted as Uzair’s retaliation for the killing of his father, Faiz Muhammad. Some later accounts, including police dossiers and local testimonies, alleged that gang members kicked or played football with severed heads, turning the murders into a grim public spectacle that circulated in local narratives.By this stage, the greatest toll fell on ordinary residents. Prolonged firefights between splinter factions left neighbourhoods barricaded for days. Homes and small businesses were commandeered as torture rooms or lookout posts. Young men were coerced into gang recruitment, teachers and shopkeepers were forced to pay “taxes,” and ambulance workers trying to retrieve bodies were threatened by both sides. In response, the state increasingly turned to large-scale fires, sieges and heavy weaponry, culminating in the militarised crackdowns that would soon follow.In April–May 2012, the Sindh government initiated one of Karachi’s largest security actions against gang networks, later known as Operation Lyari. The police deployed thousands of personnel, armoured carriers and specialised units with the stated goal of clearing the area and arresting key commanders linked to the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC). For the first time, a formal state crackdown directly targeted the network that had operated for years through political patronage and parallel governance.The operation, however, quickly encountered intense resistance. Armed groups used heavy weaponry, including rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), to attack the advancing police. Several armoured personnel carriers were damaged or destroyed, and police units struggled to push through Lyari’s dense alleyways, where snipers and lookout positions gave gang members a tactical advantage. After several days of fighting, rising casualties, and growing criticism from political circles, the operation stalled. It ended without major arrests and was widely perceived as a failure that exposed both the state’s limitations and PAC’s entrenched power.For residents, the consequences were immediate and severe. Lyari was effectively sealed off for about a week, with restricted movement in and out of the neighbourhood. Power and water supplies were disrupted, markets were shut, and families already living under economic strain faced shortages of food and basic essentials. Humanitarian groups and ambulance services reported being blocked or delayed from providing aid, amid police suspicions that relief efforts could serve as a cover to transport weapons or militants.The failed siege deepened mistrust between civilians, gangs and the state. Many residents had already endured years of coercive “taxes” and violence under PAC rule; the security operation then subjected them to collective punishment, indiscriminate fire and deprivation. Instead of restoring confidence, the crackdown reinforced the perception that both the state and the gangs were willing to sacrifice ordinary people to protect their own interests.Even as Lyari’s gang networks fought prolonged turf wars, Karachi was simultaneously becoming a logistical base for militant organisations, particularly factions of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). As security operations intensified in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt, militants sought anonymity in large urban centres. Pashtun-majority neighbourhoods such as Sohrab Goth, Manghopir and SITE became key sanctuaries and transit corridors where fighters, explosives and finances could be moved with relative ease.The turning point came on 8 June 2014, when ten militants launched an armed assault on Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, using automatic weapons, grenades and a rocket launcher. The attack triggered an overnight battle that left at least 36 people dead, including all ten assailants. The incident severely embarrassed federal authorities and exposed vulnerabilities in Karachi’s security infrastructure. The scale of the attack underscored that the city’s violence was no longer just about gangs—it was also linked to national insurgency networks.In the aftermath, the state expanded its response. The federal and provincial governments granted Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) extensive policing and detention powers to target both militants and criminal networks. These operations aligned with ongoing national counterinsurgency campaigns, including Operation Zarb-e-Azb and later Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad, which aimed to dismantle militant networks and disrupt their finances and recruitment pipelines.In Karachi, this translated into a sustained, multi-year crackdown led by the Rangers. Tactical raids, mass arrests, prolonged detentions under special legal provisions and high-profile encounters became common features of urban policing. In Lyari, the result was a shrinking space for gangs to openly control territory. The Peoples’ Aman Committee and splinter factions still operated, but their public influence diminished as armed checkpoints, displays of heavy weaponry and enforced taxation became more difficult to sustain. Although pockets of violence persisted, the crackdown marked the beginning of the end of large, overt gang administrations in the city.One of the most high-profile casualties in the post-2014 security phase was SSP Chaudhry Aslam Khan, the police officer who had led major operations against both Lyari gangs and militant networks. On 9 January 2014, a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into Aslam’s convoy in Karachi, killing him and at least three others. The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility, calling the attack revenge for police operations against its fighters and financiers. Aslam’s death was widely perceived as a serious setback to the city’s counter-terror and anti-gang efforts, though operations continued under other police officers and with greater reliance on Pakistan Rangers (Sindh).For Lyari’s armed groups, the most decisive blow came three years later. Acting on intelligence reports, Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) launched a pre-dawn raid on 2 February 2017 in Phool Patti Lane, Lyari, targeting Noor Muhammad, better known as “Baba Ladla.” According to Rangers’ statements, a gun battle lasting over 30 minutes ensued, during which gang members used automatic weapons and grenades. By the end of the raid, Rangers announced that Baba Ladla and two close associates had been killed.Listed for years among Pakistan’s “most wanted” criminals, Baba Ladla faced cases ranging from murder and extortion to armed attacks on police and suspected collaborations with extremist groups. His death effectively dismantled a key pillar of the Uzair-era structure, removing the most prominent operational commander who had challenged both rivals inside Lyari and the security forces sent to eliminate them.By the mid-2010s, as state pressure intensified and gang structures were fractured by successive operations, Uzair Jan Baloch left Pakistan. In December 2015, Interpol arrested him at Dubai International Airport, reportedly while he was travelling from Muscat. He was subsequently handed over to Pakistani authorities and brought back to Karachi.From 2016 onward, Uzair was charged in dozens of criminal cases, ranging from murder and attempted murder to extortion, kidnapping and terrorism. Many of these cases have since resulted in acquittals due to lack of evidence, hostile witnesses or procedural weaknesses—a pattern that has long characterised Karachi’s organised crime trials, where intimidation makes witness testimony difficult.In April 2017, a new dimension emerged when the Pakistan Army took custody of Uzair to try him under military law. He was accused of espionage and leaking sensitive information to a foreign intelligence agency, reportedly linked to Iran. In April 2020, a military court sentenced him to 12 years in prison on espionage charges, marking a significant shift in how the state officially characterized him—not merely as a gang leader, but as a potential national security threat.Pakistani officials and segments of local media have occasionally linked Uzair’s alleged intelligence connections to the controversial case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Indian national sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court in 2017. One strand of narrative suggests that Uzair’s alleged contacts in Iran overlapped with networks also linked to Jadhav. However, India has rejected Pakistan’s claims in the Jadhav case as coerced and unsubstantiated, and publicly verifiable evidence connecting Uzair directly to operational support for Jadhav remains limited.What is clearer is that, from the perspective of the Pakistani state, Uzair Baloch’s profile evolved from that of a gang leader embedded in local politics to an alleged cross-border security risk—reshaping the narrative around Lyari’s gangs and their significance.As violence worsened and Lyari began drawing national and even international scrutiny, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) gradually shifted its stance on the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC). Between 2012 and 2013, amid pressure from rival parties, security agencies and media coverage, the PPP formally disowned the PAC, despite years of visible proximity.Senior party leaders later framed PAC figures as rogue actors or products of state neglect, arguing that they were not part of a deliberate political strategy. Critics, however—including journalists, residents and some researchers—contend that the PPP benefitted for years from PAC’s armed control of Lyari, only distancing itself once the political and reputational costs became unsustainable.This distancing reflected a broader shift: as the state redefined Lyari’s gangs from political intermediaries to security liabilities, political actors recalibrated their alliances. What had once been an informal partnership built on patronage and vote control became a liability in the age of counterterrorism and international scrutiny.Security indicators suggest that overt gang violence in Lyari has dropped sharply since the mid-2010s. Rangers-led operations, the removal or incarceration of key gang leaders such as Rehman, Uzair and Baba Ladla, and broader counter-terror campaigns have reduced the frequency of armed clashes and targeted killings in the area.The legacy of the Lyari gang war remains unfinished. For many families, the years of kidnappings, torture, blockades and forced recruitment left deep social and economic scars. Questions continue to surround extrajudicial killings, disappearances and the conduct of both the gangs and state agencies tasked with fighting them. Although large armed networks have been dismantled, traces of informal control and low-level criminality persist in new forms.At the same time, Lyari’s cultural and political identity is evolving again. The football grounds, community schools and cultural centres that once defined the neighbourhood are re-emerging, even as residents remain wary of new power brokers. In popular culture, recent portrayals such as Dhurandhar and other planned projects reflect an enduring public fascination with Lyari—its blurred boundaries between criminal groups, political actors and state security agencies, and the unanswered questions they leave behind.Seen in retrospect, the gang war was not merely the story of violent figures in a marginalised settlement. It grew out of structural inequality, weak state institutions and a political party’s reliance on armed intermediaries to protect its vote bank. As militancy and regional intelligence rivalries later intersected with local crime networks, a neighbourhood built from labour and sport became entangled in national security narratives.Lyari today is quieter, but its past continues to shape how residents understand politics, policing and protection. The names of Rehman Dakait, Uzair Baloch, Baba Ladla and Arshad Pappu remain part of local memory—sometimes condemned as criminals, sometimes recalled as flawed protectors, always as evidence of how quickly a working-class community can become a battleground when crime, politics and security policy converge.","Karachi’s Lyari has long been associated with a dual identity. To its residents, it is the ‘mother of Karachi’ – powered by dockworkers, truck drivers, boxers and footballers. To the rest of Pakistan, especially through the 1990s and 2000s, it came to signify something very different: a “mini Brazil” of football- obsessed alleys, heavily armed gangs, and extortion rackets. It is this layered, contradictory Lyari that Aditya Dhar's recent 'Dhurandhar' turns into cinema.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125768364,imgsize-87724,width-400,resizemode-4/lyari-gang-war.jpg"

'Munir Is A Mentally Unstable Man': Ex-Pakistan PM Imran Khan Blames Army Chief of Fueling Terrorism





Pakistan’s jailed former prime minister Imran Khan on Wednesday launched a sharp attack on the country’s army chief and de-facto ruler Asim Munir , calling him a ""mentally unstable man."" He also claimed that field marshal Munir’s policies were ""disastrous"" for Pakistan and accused him of intentionally ""igniting tensions"" with Afghanistan.The 73-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician shared these remarks on social media a day after his sister, Dr Uzma Khan, met him in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail. The meeting took place after more than a month, following “special permission” from Shehbaz Sharif ’s government, amid widespread rumours on social media about Imran’s health and safety after he was placed in solitary confinement.In a post on X written in Urdu, Khan said, “Asim Munir’s policies are disastrous for Pakistan. Because of his policies, terrorism has spiralled out of control that grieves me deeply.”He further alleged, “Asim Munir has no concern for Pakistan’s national interests. He is doing all this merely to please Western powers. He deliberately ignited tensions with Afghanistan so that he could be seen internationally as a so-called 'mujahid'.”The PTI founder said he had always opposed “drone attacks and military operations against own people in the country which he said would only fuel more terrorism.”He claimed, “Munir first threatened Afghans, then expelled refugees from Pakistan and carried out drone strikes whose consequences we now face in the form of rising terrorism.”Calling Munir a “mentally unstable man,” Khan alleged that the army chief’s “moral bankruptcy has led to the complete collapse of the Constitution and rule of law in Pakistan.”He also accused Munir of being behind the cases against him and his wife, saying they had been “imprisoned in fabricated cases and subjected to the worst form of psychological torture.”Khan described his prison conditions, saying, “I have been kept in complete solitary confinement, locked inside a cell with no contact with a single human being for four weeks. I was kept entirely cut off from the outside world, and even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been taken away from us.”He added that despite court orders, his meetings with political colleagues were stopped, and now even his access to lawyers and family had been cut off. “Pick up any human rights charter, psychological torture is considered 'torture' and is deemed even more severe than physical torture. My sister Noreen Niazi was dragged on the road simply for demanding her legitimate right to meet me,” he said.Khan praised Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi for showing courage during what he called an “environment of repression.” He wrote, “I ask him to continue to play on the front foot. There is no law or Constitution in this country. The law is enforced only against PTI as everyone else is exempt. Those threatening governor’s rule in KP should impose it today rather than tomorrow and then watch what happens to them. ”Speculation about Khan’s health had grown after an undeclared ban was imposed on meeting him. Uzma, after seeing her brother, said his health was “perfectly fine” but he was being subjected to “mental torture in solitary confinement.”“Praise be to Allah! His health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture,” she said.","Imran Khan says Asim Munir's policies are ""disastrous"" for Pakistan. He accuses Munir of intentionally ""igniting tensions"" with Afghanistan.

Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), state media reported on Wednesday.The loss-making airline is being privatised as part of a $7 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) program , which requires the federal government to reform or divest struggling state enterprises. A previous attempt to offload PIA last year was scrapped after the government failed to receive a sufficiently attractive offer.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with corporate entities and company representatives involved in the process, according to a press release shared by state broadcaster PTV News. “PIA’s bidding will take place on December 23, which will be broadcast live on all media. We are ensuring transparency and merit in the privatisation process,” the statement quoted him as saying.Sharif said the process was proceeding “smoothly” and argued that privatisation would help restore the airline’s “lost prestige,” align it with modern aviation requirements and facilitate the restoration of PIA’s global flight operations — a step he said was crucial for overseas Pakistanis.If completed, the transaction would mark Pakistan’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.Founded in October 1946, PIA is based at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, the country’s second-busiest airport and its largest city’s main aviation hub.","Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines.

NEW DELHI: Imran Khan’s sister on Tuesday said the former Pakistan prime minister is “completely fine” and in good health, after she was finally allowed to meet him inside Adiala Jail following weeks of restricted access that had fuelled protests and rumours about his condition.Authorities at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail permitted Imran’s sister Uzma Khanum to meet him on Tuesday, breaking a prolonged period during which family members and PTI leaders were repeatedly denied access. According to Pakistan news outlet Dawn, Uzma entered the prison as several PTI supporters gathered outside demanding transparency on Imran’s health.Following the meeting, PTI USA shared her remarks, quoting her as saying, “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he said that they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this.”AccordingUzma said that Imran Khan was kept in his room throughout the day, allowed only limited time outside, and had no communication with anyone. The meeting lasted around 30 minutes, she told the publication.Read more: Can Imran Khan meet visitors in jail?

There has been absolutely no contact with Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan , which has intensified speculation about his possible death. Demanding access to the PTI founder, party members have decided to stage a protest despite the restrictions imposed by the Pakistan government.Following the PTI workers' announcement of protests outside the Islamabad High Court and Adiala Jail, Section 144 was enforced in both cities. However, the order has not deterred Imran Khan’s supporters. They declared their protest plans even as restrictions have been in place since November 18 for two months.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday declared that the party would stage a major protest outside the Islamabad High Court on Monday, followed by another demonstration outside Adiala Jail on Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference at the CM House, Afridi claimed that Imran Khan, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, has been held in “complete isolation” since November 4, with no one granted access to him.He said that Khan’s sisters, senior party leaders, lawyers, and even doctors have all been barred from meeting him, effectively placing him in total solitary confinement—a situation he described as “extremely alarming.”PTI leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan. After KP CM Afridi ordered the party members to immediately move to Islamabad, the party has also asked the supporters to gather outside the Adiala Jail later.Talking to reporters, Afridi said that on Tuesday, all parliamentarians would first gather at the IHC to stage a strong protest before the court’s chief justice, noting that despite judicial orders, he himself was not allowed to meet Khan.“This is blatant contempt of court. We will hold a protest at the IHC,” Afridi asserted.He said the parliamentarians would then move to Adiala Jail to attempt to meet Khan and to express solidarity with his sisters.Following the announcement of protests, the Rawalpindi deputy commissioner's office issued the notice on Monday that Section 144 shall be imposed in the city from December 1 to December 3. According to the notice, the order has been enforced on the basis of “imminent threats” identified by the district intelligence committee (DIC), particularly in and around sensitive installations, major roads and other critical infrastructure. The committee’s assessment underpinned the local government’s decision to restrict public gatherings during this period.The Rawalpindi notification prohibits all kinds of gatherings of more than five people. As per the statement, ""All kinds of Assemblies, Gatherings, Sits-in, Rallies, Processions, Demonstrations, Jalsas, Dharnas, Protests and such like other activities, i.e gathering of 05 or more persons.""""Carrying of weapons, spikes, laden batons, gaulails, ball bearings, petrol bombs, improvised explosives or any other instrument that could potentially be used for violence,"" is also listed as one of the restrictions in the notice.Along with these, pillion riding and the use of loudspeakers or display of ""arms and hatred speeches"" are also prohibited.The Islamabad district magistrate’s office issued the order after what it described as “certain segments of society … planning to organise unlawful assemblies … within the jurisdiction of Islamabad Capital Territory,” according to a report in Dawn. The announcement in Rawalpindi came through a notification from the deputy commissioner’s office, which cited security concerns due to potential large gatherings.In Islamabad, the order did not define what would constitute an “unlawful assembly” but noted that authorities deemed it “necessary to control such types of illegal activities which present a threat to public peace, tranquillity and maintenance of law & order.”Pakistan’s former Prime Minister has remained completely out of sight for more than six weeks, with neither his party members nor his family able to establish any direct contact during this period. His prolonged absence from public view has intensified anxiety across the country, fuelling widespread speculation and deepening fears about his safety.The lack of verified updates or appearances has further heightened concerns, with many questioning whether the politician-turned-cricketer may have become the target of a possible assassination attempt or is otherwise being kept in undisclosed conditions.Khan’s sons fear authorities may be hiding “something irreversible” about his condition. His son, Kasim Khan, told Reuters that the family has had no direct or verifiable contact with the jailed former Prime Minister, despite a court order allowing weekly meetings.“Not knowing whether your father is safe, harmed, or even alive is psychological torture,” he said, noting that there has been no independently confirmed communication for months.“We have no reliable information about his condition,” he added. “Our deepest fear is that something irreversible is being kept from us.”Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, filed a contempt of court petition in the IHC on November 28 against the Adiala Jail superintendent and other officials, alleging they prevented her from meeting her brother.Submitting the petition in the presence of Chief Minister Afridi, she cited the IHC’s March 24 order, which had restored a twice-weekly visitation schedule for the 73-year-old former prime minister.Pakistan government officials have rejected rumours that Imran Khan has died in custody or been quietly moved out of Adiala Jail, insisting he remains inside the Rawalpindi facility and is in stable condition.“There is no truth to claims of his transfer from Adiala Jail. He is in good health and receiving full medical care,” Geo News quoted Rawalpindi prison officials as saying.Imran Khan is currently being held in Adiala Jail, where a court first handed him a three-year prison term in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Since then, successive corruption convictions have pushed his total sentence to 14 years, the longest jail term imposed on him so far.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi claimed that Imran Khan has been held in “complete isolation” since November 4. Khan’s sisters, senior party leaders, lawyers, and even doctors have all been barred from meeting him.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125710838,imgsize-1508415,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

In a first, the Baloch Liberation Front (BLF) used a woman fidayeen operative to storm a heavily-guarded complex belonging to the Frontier Corps and housing a Chinese copper and gold mining project center located in Chagai, Balochistan. Six Pak personnel were reportedly killed in Sunday evening’s attack but there was no official word from the Pak authorities.The BLF also released the photo of the bomber, Zareena Rafiq aka Trang Mahoo, who detonated herself at the barrier to allow the rebel fighters to breach the main compound. The attack is significant because it is the first time the BLF has used a suicide bomber, a tactic exclusive to Majeed Brigade of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) which has carried out a series of attacks including the Jaffar Express hijack in the region.The fact that the complex was linked to the Saindak and Reko Diq projects, managed by Chinese companies and a Canadian firm, indicates the change in rebels’ strategy to strike high-value assets with geopolitical significance, sources said. In a statement released on Telegram, the BLF spokesperson Gwahram Baloch said that the Fidayeen operation was carried out by its ‘selfsacrifice’ unit, Saddo Operational Battalion (SOB), named after Martyred Commander Waja Sado aka Sadath Marri.Meanwhile the BLA released a statement on the wave of coordinated attacks carried out at multiple locations between Nov 28-29, claiming 27 Pak army personnel were killed in 29 attacks. The BLA also said it had taken control of motorways and seized weapons.BLA fighters struck the Pakistani army’s Coast Guard camp in the Pasni area of Gwadar with multiple grenade launchers. They targeted military intelligence personnel in the Jiwani area of Gwadar with a remote-controlled IED attack while they were returning after extorting money from vehicles, the BLA said. Another attack was on the residence of a Pakistani army major in Mastung city.Six blasts were reported at defence installations in Quetta as well.

Pakistan Rages At UN After Criticism Of Munir’s Immunity Amendment Amid Fears Of Deeper Militarism

Also Read |





Author and National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) member Tilak Devasher claimed that Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is “intentionally” staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).Created through the 27th amendment to Pakistan’s constitution, the post is set to be assumed by Field Marshal Asim Munir, potentially making him the most powerful army chief in the country’s history.Speaking to ANI, Devasher highlighted that Sharif left for Bahrain and then London, leading to speculation that he's ""deliberately"" staying away to avoid issuing the notification.“Very smartly, the Pakistan PM went to Bahrain and then to London. He clearly does not want to issue the notification giving Asim Munir five years as army chief and as Chief of Defence Forces. He seems to believe that by staying away and avoiding signing the notification, he can escape the consequences,” said Devasher, author of four books on Pakistan.The comment comes after Sharif’s government failed to issue the required notification appointing Munir as the first-ever CDF by the November 29 deadline—the day his original three-year term as army chief ended.With the creation of the CDF post, the office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee has formally been abolished.Devasher added that Pakistan is currently navigating a “very messy” situation.“If it turns out that he (Asim Munir) is no longer the army chief, then Pakistan finds itself without an army chief, and even the nuclear command authority—meant to fall under the new Strategic Forces Command—is effectively leaderless. It’s an extremely strange situation,” he remarked.Legal experts remain divided over whether the notification is necessary. Under the amended Constitution, the Chief of Army Staff’s term is meant to run concurrently with the CDF, lasting five years.Some analysts, however, argue that the issue may already be addressed by the Pakistan Army Act’s 2024 amendment, which extended the tenure of service chiefs to five years, according to Dawn. The amendment includes a “deeming” clause stating it “shall always be deemed to have been part of the Pakistan Army Act,” implying that Munir’s current term could automatically extend from three to five years without any additional notification.Devasher, however, called this interpretation “controversial,” questioning the view that a notification may not be required.“Some people argue that the Army Act was amended in 2004, setting the army chief’s tenure at five years. Since he has already served three, he supposedly has another two years remaining. From this perspective, no new notification would be required. This is controversial, and it’s unclear how the judiciary or the government will view it. But the fact remains that it makes his position very tenuous,” Devasher said.He also pointed to what he described as political manoeuvring within the military. “There are reports that other generals are now jostling for the position of army chief or for the two newly created four-star posts,” he stated.Devasher added that Prime Minister Sharif’s absence is only deepening the uncertainty. “But this situation cannot continue,” he warned. “A nuclear-armed country cannot function without a Chief of the Army Staff or someone in charge of the nuclear command authority.”","Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is ""intentionally"" staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces.

Pakistan Army General Warns Of Hybrid-To-Full War As Pakistan Reshapes Military Power Under Munir





Fresh violence broke out in Pakistan after a suicide bomber detonated himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan, sparking an intense exchange of fire and a major security response, Dawn reported.The attack, claimed to be the work of militants described by officials as Fitna-al-Khawarij — the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — triggered a swift retaliatory operation in which three attackers were killed.According to FC Balochistan South, the assault began when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance, allowing several armed militants to force their way into the compound. Security personnel from the quick response force immediately engaged the attackers, with heavy gunfire reported from the area. Officials said at least six gunmen were believed to have entered the headquarters, prompting a full-scale clearance operation that continued through the day.In a statement, the FC spokesperson said troops were determined to neutralise the remaining threat, adding that the “last of the terrorists will also be” dealt with.Local reports described sustained firing inside the headquarters as forces worked room-to-room to secure the facility.The incident comes just days after a similar assault on an FC compound in the northwestern city of Peshawar, where gunmen and two suicide bombers stormed a paramilitary headquarters, killing three people. Police had said the first bomber detonated at the main entrance while the second entered the compound, forcing law enforcement to cordon off the busy FC Chowk area amid multiple explosions.These attacks form part of a broader escalation in militant violence this year. Earlier attacks in Quetta — including a deadly car bomb outside a paramilitary base and a suicide blast at a political rally — have added to growing instability in Balochistan. The province has endured a long-running insurgency, with hundreds of security personnel killed in 2024 alone, alongside attacks claimed by separatist groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army.","Suicide bomber detonates himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan.

Pakistan Army General Warns Of Hybrid-To-Full War As Pakistan Reshapes Military Power Under Munir





At least seven explosions were reported in Pakistan’s Balochistan province over the past 24 hours, with suspected insurgents targeting sites in Quetta and Dera Murad Jamali. No casualties were reported, although two security guards with a construction company were injured in the attacks.The incidents triggered fear and panic in the provincial capital.On Saturday, insurgents hurled hand grenades at a police checkpoint in Quetta, followed by the detonation of an IED near an Anti-Terrorism Department vehicle. Three additional explosions took place later in the evening, as cited by PTI.Senior Superintendent of Police Asif Khan said the blast near Lohr Karez, on the outskirts of Quetta, damaged the main line connecting the city with other parts of the country.SSP Khan said the attackers had planted IEDs on a railway track and detonated them as a train was scheduled to arrive at Quetta station. The blast damaged the track and forced the suspension of rail services.Khan added that armed men also attacked a construction company site on Quetta’s Sariab Road with hand grenades, damaging machinery and injuring two security guards. In another incident, motorcycle-borne insurgents hurled two hand grenades at the Manzoor Shaheed police station, one of which exploded while the other was defused by a bomb disposal squad.In Dera Murad Jamali, a patrolling police vehicle was targeted with hand grenades.Attackers also threw hand grenades in the Kech Beg area near a police patrol post in Quetta.No group immediately claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attacks, but insurgent activity resumed on Sunday morning.Earlier this year, at least ten people were killed and several others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside the paramilitary headquarters in Quetta.On September 3, a suicide bombing at a political rally in the city killed 11 people and wounded more than 40, targeting a stadium parking area where hundreds of Balochistan National Party supporters had gathered.Pakistani forces continue to battle a longstanding insurgency in Balochistan, which has claimed 782 lives in 2024. In March, the Baloch Liberation Army hijacked a train and killed off-duty troops. Since January, more than 430 people, most of them security personnel, have been killed in various attacks, including six soldiers in Bannu.","At least seven explosions reported in Pakistan's Balochistan province over the past 24 hours.

Myanmar: Drug production booming amid civil war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/myanmar-drug-production-booming-amid-civil-war/articleshow/125832333.cms,"Representative image (AI-generated)

Chinese cartels protected in the Golden Triangle

Meth production spurred by civil war

Drug-related crisis 'rapidly expanding'

Farmers and fighters dependent on drug sales

Myanmar heroin found in Africa, Europe





New data on opium and methamphetamine production in Myanmar from the United Nations puts the war-torn country at the epicenter of Asia's multi-billion-dollar illicit drug trade.Opium poppy cultivation rose 17% to over 53,000 hectares (131,000 acres) over the past year, the most in a decade, according to the latest opium survey of Myanmar by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC), published this week.Most notably, Myanmar is still the world's top opium producer. The country claimed that spot from Afghanistan in 2023, two years after the Taliban seized control of the country and eradicated the vast majority of its poppy fields.Data published by the UNODC earlier this year also show methamphetamine seizures across East and Southeast Asia in 2024 hitting a record 236 tons.Most of the drug is believed to be produced in Myanmar. According to the UN, the combination of rising seizures and falling street prices suggest that production inside Myanmar continues to grow.""I wouldn't really say Myanmar as a country is a supplier, but there [are] criminal groups that are engaging in producing and trafficking this meth and heroin,"" Inshik Sim, the UNODC's illicit drugs research officer for the Asia Pacific region, told DW.Myanmar has been a major drug producer for decades, partly due to its geography. The nation, once known as Burma, incorporates one corner of the infamous Golden Triangle, where its rugged, crime-infested borderlands in the east meet Laos and Thailand.In Myanmar's Shan state, criminal cartels have set up under the protection of warlords who rule over enclaves where the government has little to no sway. Most of the drug cartels now based there have moved in from China.The chaotic civil war triggered by a 2021 military coup has created favorable conditions for the growth of Myanmar's drug trade, according to the UN. The country's official economy has collapsed, law enforcement has deteriorated, and warlords needed more money to fund their private armies.""Because of the conflict, there is some need for people to raise money, whether it's armed groups or farmers, because the conflict disrupts the economy…. And I think opium poppy cultivation is one area that we can see,"" said Sim.Methamphetamine production was on the rise well before the coup, but, according to Sim, the civil war has likely boosted this trend as well.Thailand has borne the brunt of drug boom happening across its border with Myanmar. Last year, Thai officials seized massive amounts of Myanmar methamphetamine, including a record 1 billion meth tablets.""These numbers are a clear warning that the drug problem is not only ongoing but expanding now rapidly,"" said Thanapon Thanikkun, head of intelligence at Thailand's Office of the Narcotics Control Board.He warned that the traffickers are exploiting Thailand's well-developed transport network to ship their product on land, air and sea, while also leaving a growing drug use problem in their wake.The UNODC confirms meth use in on the rise in Thailand and much of Southeast Asia.For the armed groups supplying this regional demand from Myanmar, selling drugs is a quick way of arming up, said Khun Oo, vice chair of the Pa-O Youth Organization, a non-government group tackling social issues across the Shan state. The Pa-O are one of the state's main ethnic groups.""They [armed groups] need guns, they need … human resources and money, so this is the way that they can get it, from the drug trafficking,"" he said.Unlike methamphetamine, which can be churned out of small labs in huge volumes by a few people, opium production also puts many farmers to work.Poppy has long been a go-to cash crop in Myanmar during hard times. Khun Oo says the civil war has made it much harder for farmers to get their usual crops to market, whereas the drug traffickers who buy opium come to them.""In the past, they still could do farming [of] other crops,"" he said, but now, ""they have no options"" except growing opium.Khun Oo said the traffickers are also paying farmers up to $500 (€429) for about a kilogram of raw opium in some areas, at least twice what they paid before the coup, making poppy all the more attractive.Products from Myanmar's poppy fields and meth labs travel far and wide across the region and the world.After pouring out of Myanmar into Laos and Thailand, they cascade across the rest of Southeast Asia, and from there may be sold at premium prices in countries like Japan and Australia.Last year, the Australian Federal Police estimated that as much as 70% of the crystal methamphetamine consumed the country came from Myanmar.Sim said China is probably still the main market for Myanmar's heroin. The latest drug seizures, however, suggest the traffickers are now looking westward as well.The UNODC notes a spate of recent meth and heroin seizures over in northeastern India, which also shares a border with Myanmar.Additionally, a string of relatively small but unusual seizures of Myanmar heroin in Nigeria and parts of Europe, by way of Thailand, may indicate that Myanmar cartels are seeking to expand their markets onto new continents.""We didn't really see this kind of heroin trafficking flow from this region to others, because the traditional markets of heroin coming out of the Golden Triangle is basically East and Southeast Asia and parts of Oceania. However, we see that more westward flow happens as well,"" said Sim.","Opium poppy cultivation rose 17% to over 53,000 hectares (131,000 acres) over the past year, according to the latest opium survey of Myanmar. Data published by the UNODC earlier this year also show methamphetamine seizures across East and Southeast Asia in 2024 hitting a record 236 tons.

US President Donald Trump held a closed-door multilateral meeting with European leaders at the White House on Monday to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine, along with guarantees to be provided by European nations in coordination with the United States.Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and seven European leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, Nato secretary general Mark Rutte, and European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen.During the meeting, a hot mic inadvertently caught audio of Trump whispering to Emmanuel Macron during the meeting.“I think he [Russian President Vladimir Putin] wants to make a deal,” Trump said. “I think he wants to make a deal for me, you understand that? As crazy as it sounds,” thereported.The remark suggested that Trump believed Putin was inclined to strike an agreement, offering further insight into his assessment of his recent talks with the Russian leader.Trump had met Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday. Both leaders described the meeting in positive terms, but no formal agreement or signed deal was announced.Trump stated, “We had an extremely productive meeting, and many points were agreed to,” while adding, “We didn’t get there.” Addressing reporters, he remarked, “There’s no deal until there’s a deal.”Trump and special presidential envoy Steve Witkoff, who also participated in the Alaska summit, claimed that they had secured Putin’s agreement to allow US and other NATO forces to come to Ukraine’s defense should Moscow violate any terms of a potential peace arrangement.Following Monday’s consultations with Zelenskyy and European leaders, Trump said he called Putin to begin preparing a direct meeting between the two warring sides, which would be followed by a trilateral session including the US president. He confirmed the plan in a post on Truth Social.","US President Donald Trump held a closed-door multilateral meeting with European leaders at the White House on Monday to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine.

‘I don’t know what Quran he is reading’: Eric Adams slams Zohran Mamdani over prostitution stance; questions religious values,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-dont-know-what-quran-he-is-reading-eric-adams-slams-zohran-mamdani-over-prostitution-stance-questions-religious-values/articleshow/123352756.cms,"File photo: Mayor Eric Adams (left) and Zohran Mamdani (Picture credit: AP)

Mamdani’s record on sex work

Supporters vs critics





Mayor Eric Adams has taken aim at his main rival in the upcoming New York City mayoral race, Zohran Mamdani , criticising the Democrat’s record of backing the decriminalisation of prostitution and questioning how such a stance aligns with his religious faith.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Adams said, “I can’t be more clear. I’m a man of God, just as Mamdani says he’s a Muslim. I don’t know where in his Quran it states that it’s okay for a woman to be on the streets selling their body. I don’t know what Quran he is reading. It’s not in my Bible. As a man who said he is of faith, I don’t quite understand what religion supports prostitution.”Mamdani’s religion is Islam, which prohibits prostitution under its laws of morality.The comments followed reporting by the reports highlighting Mamdani’s history of pushing to change state law so that selling sex would no longer be treated as a crime.As per the New York Post, Adams argued that such a policy would fuel trafficking and crime, saying, “I think he’s lost on the fact that sex trafficking is very much part of prostitution. We are trying to bring down crime and he is talking about legalising sex work.”He added, “You’re not doing any service to a woman who is on the street who is forced to sell her body for whatever reason. No one should be on our streets selling their bodies. No one.”According to the New York Post, Mamdani has been a consistent advocate of decriminalisation since his first run for the state Assembly in 2020, when he declared: “Not only must we decriminalise sex work, we need a comprehensive platform of justice for all.”Since then, the 33-year-old Socialist has co-sponsored several bills in Albany that would remove criminal penalties for sex work across New York state. In 2021, he told colleagues at an Assembly meeting, “I would like to register my support for [decriminalising sex work] legislation, my eagerness for that debate and for my fundamental belief that sex work is work”, as per the New York Post.Despite that record, Mamdani has said little about the issue since entering the mayoral race, raising concerns among critics that he may attempt to advance such measures from City Hall if elected.As mayor, he would not be able to change state law on his own, but he would hold a powerful platform to campaign for reforms and could also deprioritise prostitution enforcement by the NYPD.Supporters of decriminalisation argue that legalising sex work makes those in the industry less vulnerable to violence from pimps, clients and police. However, research in places such as Nevada and parts of Europe has shown that trafficking often rises when prostitution is legalised, as organised crime expands to meet demand.Sonia Ossorio, executive director of the National Organization for Women NYC, has warned that Mamdani’s plans could turn the city into a “sex tourism destination” comparable to Amsterdam’s Red Light District.Rosa Sanchez of the Restore Roosevelt Avenue Coalition was cited by the Post saying her Queens community is already struggling with prostitution and gang activity, and predicted matters would worsen under Mamdani.Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa also warned the city risked seeing “all 350 neighbourhoods” turned into red-light districts if Mamdani wins.Mamdani’s campaign hit back on Sunday, though it stopped short of confirming whether he still supports decriminalisation.A spokesperson said, “Mayor Adams’ reckless budget cut over $3 million in funding from Safe Horizon, putting thousands of victims of crimes related to sex trafficking and prostitution in harm’s way. As Mayor, Zohran will prioritise genuine public safety for all, including investing $40M through his Department of Community Safety towards victims services.”Former governor Andrew Cuomo stressed he had long opposed attempts by Mamdani and other progressives to decriminalise prostitution during his time in Albany.Adams, running as an independent for re-election, framed the debate as a question of protecting vulnerable women and ensuring public safety.“Our city needs to be a safe city. It should not be a city where women are standing on corners, or boys are standing on corners, or young men standing on corners selling their bodies,” he said. “If that is his belief, it is a danger for our city.”",Zohran Mamdani has been a consistent advocate of decriminalisation since his first run for the state Assembly in 2020.

The video of a semi-truck taking a wrong U-turn on the Florida Turnpike, killing 3 went viral as social media users claimed that the driver must be from India.

Trump THREATENS DC Takeover: 1,000 National Guard Troops To ‘CLEAN UP’ Washington?

Trump federalises policing in Washington

Protests and pushback

Concerns over law enforcement role

White House claims success





National Guard members patrolling the US capital as part of President Donald Trump’s policing plan may soon be carrying weapons, a Guard spokesperson confirmed on Sunday.Army Senior Master Sgt Craig Clapper was quoted by NPR as saying that “Guard members may be armed consistent with their mission and training.”He stressed their role was “focused on supporting civil authorities and ensuring the safety of the community they serve,” adding that the Guard “remains committed to assisting the District of Columbia and serving its residents and visitors whenever called upon.”Just days earlier, the Army had said Guard personnel would not carry weapons in public and would not be making arrests. At that point, officials insisted their weapons would remain in the armoury, to be used only if needed, and that deployed troops would instead act as a “visible crime deterrent” while equipped with protective gear such as body armour.The deployment follows President Trump’s announcement earlier this month that the federal government would assume control of the Metropolitan Police Department and flood Washington with hundreds of federal law enforcement officers and National Guard members.According to the news agency AP, about 800 DC Guard members have already been activated.On Saturday, Republican governors from West Virginia, South Carolina and Ohio pledged to send additional reinforcements, between 150 and 400 troops each, to strengthen the federal presence.“West Virginia is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation’s capital,” Governor Patrick Morrisey said, as per AP.Trump has defended the takeover, claiming the city has been “overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged out maniacs and homeless people.”However, official data shows violent crime in Washington has actually fallen by 26% compared with last year.The move has triggered strong opposition from residents, local officials and activists, who say the federal intervention represents an overreach of power.DC Mayor Muriel Bowser warned on Friday that the city’s “limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now.”On Saturday, hundreds marched from Dupont Circle to the White House, chanting against what they described as a “military occupation.” Protesters held banners reading “No fascist takeover of DC.”Jamie Dickstein, a 24-year-old teacher, was cited by AP as saying that she was “very uncomfortable and worried” for her students’ safety with “unmarked officers of all types” detaining people. John Finnigan, a local resident for nearly three decades, called Trump’s actions “ridiculous” given crime levels are falling.At the Asbury United Methodist Church on Sunday, Rev Ronald Bell Jr used his sermon to call on Black leaders to guide the community through the moment peacefully. Bell, who previously served in Minnesota during the unrest after George Floyd’s killing, said, “I think we have learned lessons from the past. I think we are well equipped to handle this moment.”Some experts have also raised alarms about the National Guard taking on quasi-policing duties. Rosa Brooks, a Georgetown Law professor and former reserve officer with the Metropolitan Police Department, was quoted by NPR as saying, “I think what we’re seeing is the effort to habituate people to the idea that you’re going to have armed federal personnel in your business, asking questions, stopping you, and that’s just truly scary. ”The Posse Comitatus Act restricts the use of federal armed forces in civilian law enforcement, unless specifically authorised by Congress. But Guard troops, who operate under state control unless federalised, have sometimes been deployed to cities with weapons, most recently to patrol the New York City transit system.Despite criticism, the White House insists Trump’s crackdown is working. Officials said that since 7 August, 308 people had been arrested in Washington, including 135 immigrants living in the US illegally. They added that 53 firearms had been seized.“President Trump’s bold leadership is quickly making our nation’s capital safer,” spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said on Sunday.“In less than ten days, over 300 dangerous criminals have already been arrested and taken off the streets of Washington, DC President Trump is delivering on his campaign promise to clean up this city and restore American greatness to our cherished capital”, Rogers added.","National Guard members patrolling US capital may soon be carrying weapons, a Guard spokesperson confirmed on Sunday.

The State Department made a major announcement of halting all visitor visas for people from Gaza for the time being, as it conducts a full and thorough review of the ""process and procedures"" used to issue medial-humanitarian visas in recent days.“All visitor visas for individuals from Gaza are being stopped while we conduct a full and thorough review of the process and procedures used to issue a small number of temporary medical-humanitarian visas in recent days,” the department wrote in a statement posted to X.The announcement came after MAGA activist Laura Loomer ranted for a day how Palestinians have been entering the country via a humanitarian organization through various airports.

A shooting incident in Tremonton, Utah, left at least three police officers injured on Sunday night after a suspect opened fire during a disturbance call.The Brigham City Police Department, which is handling public information on the case, confirmed that the suspect fired at officers responding to the scene near 700 North and 200 East, close to North Park Elementary School, around 9:30 pm (local time), according to Fox 13 Now.Detective Crystal Beck of Brigham City Police told reporters that three officers were shot and later taken to hospital for treatment, though their conditions remain unknown. She also explained that officers had called for backup during the confrontation but eventually stopped responding over their radios.The situation initially caused confusion after Tremonton Mayor Lyle Holmgren posted a statement on Facebook suggesting that two officers had died. Both the city and Holmgren later retracted the claim, with the mayor telling KSL TV’s Alex Cabrero that he could not confirm any details as the scene was still active.The shooting sparked a huge police response, with support from neighbouring law enforcement agencies. As per Newsweek, the suspect was eventually taken into custody and moved to Box Elder County Jail. Authorities confirmed there is no ongoing threat to the public, although residents were asked to stay away from the area.A temporary “shelter in place” order had been issued earlier in the night. Officials also said no civilians were hurt.A local resident, Randy Kidman, described his frightening experience when a stray bullet struck his car. “I thought there was somebody lighting off fireworks,” he was quoted as saying by Fox 13 Now. “I come up the road, and I saw two cop cars and something in the road, and decided it wasn’t a good situation. I went to go back out, and when I went to back out, I caught a bullet through the driver’s side door and it went out my windshield… It’s pretty freaky. ”Reported scanner audio from Box Elder County is going viral on social media, which captured the tense exchanges between officers during the incident, including calls for SWAT support and reports of two officers down at the intersection near the school. However, the authenticity of the audio can’t be verified.The name of the suspect has not yet been released.","A shooting incident in Tremonton, Utah, left at least three police officers injured on Sunday night after a suspect opened fire during a disturbance call.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday expressed his gratitude to US First Lady Melania Trump for penning a “peace letter” to Russian president Vladimir Putin, addressing the abduction of Ukrainian children.Zelenskyy said the abductions highlighted one of the most “painful and difficult issues” of the conflict and reaffirmed his commitment to pursuing an “all-for-all” exchange of prisoners of war.“I want to thank @FLOTUS Melania Trump for her attention to one of the most painful and difficult issues of this war, the abduction of Ukrainian children by Russia. We deeply appreciate her compassion and her letter to Putin,” Zelenskyy said through a post on X.‘This issue lies at the heart of the war’s humanitarian tragedy, our children, broken families, the pain of separation. At least 20,000 children were taken,” Zelenskyy said. He added that he gave US president Donald Trump a letter from Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, to be passed on to Melania Trump.“Her (Melania's) voice matters, and her care gives strength to this cause,” Zelenskyy added.The Ukrainian president said the government continued efforts to secure the return of children, as well as prisoners of war and civilians held in Russia.Some of those detainees, he noted, have been imprisoned since 2014.“Thousands of people still need to be freed – and this is a part of making peace. We will work to negotiate all-for-all prisoners of war exchange, and we are grateful to have strong friends who help,” Zelenskyy said.Zelenskyy’s comments came after Trump said on Tuesday that he and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen discussed the “massive worldwide problem of missing children.” Trump described the issue as a priority and said efforts would be made to reunite children with their families.""Ursula von der Leyen, the distinguished and highly respected president of the European Commission, and I have been discussing the massive worldwide problem of missing children.

This time, there were more smiles, warmer words and discussions about security guarantees for Kyiv.The talks came just days after Trump’s Alaska summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin , which failed to deliver a ceasefire but left the US leader convinced Moscow wanted a deal. Trump even phoned Putin after Monday’s session to brief him directly, and later revealed that arrangements had begun for a Zelenskyy-Putin meeting.The summit also offered moments of levity, with Zelenskyy dressed in formal attire, a charm offensive directed at Trump, and even a hot mic capturing the US President’s private views on Putin. But behind the pleasantries, difficult questions remained: How to guarantee Ukraine’s security, whether a ceasefire is essential, and what compromises – if any – should be made on territory.A central theme was Trump’s openness to backing European-led security guarantees for Ukraine, even while ruling out Nato membership. “European countries want to give protection and they feel very strongly about it and we’ll help them out with that,” Trump said. Zelenskyy welcomed the message, calling it “such (a) strong signal.” While no details were finalised, the discussion ranged from large-scale peacekeeping deployments to smaller “tripwire” or observer forces. Trump has not committed US troops, but he left the door open. European leaders stressed that guarantees must deter future Russian aggression, with Macron warning they are about “the whole security of the European continent.”European leaders sought to show unity, flanking Trump with praise while signalling that complex negotiations lay ahead. Nato chief Mark Rutte addressed Trump as “dear Donald” and later called him “amazing” on Fox News. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed “real progress” and a “real sense of unity.” But German Chancellor Friedrich Merz struck a cautionary tone, saying “the path is open now” though next steps were “more complicated. ” Ursula von der Leyen insisted that talks must aim for a “just and lasting peace.” Trump himself was noncommittal, remarking: “If we can do the ceasefire, great,” but quickly aligning with Putin’s view that peace, not a ceasefire, should be the priority.Zelenskyy’s latest Oval Office appearance stood in stark contrast to February, when Trump and Vance scolded him for ingratitude and even mocked his attire. This time, Ukraine’s President arrived in a black suit and shirt, prompting right-wing reporter Brian Glenn to tell him: “You look fabulous.” Trump immediately chimed in: “I said the same thing!” Zelenskyy deflected with humour, joking to Glenn: “You are in the same suit. I changed. You did not.” The mood was lighter, with both presidents clasping their hands calmly as they fielded questions. Zelenskyy also expressed repeated gratitude, even thanking First Lady Melania Trump for sending Putin a letter about the war’s toll on children.Even as European leaders pressed their case, Putin loomed large in Trump’s remarks. The US President repeatedly said the Russian leader “wants it to end” and spoke about updating him on progress. At one point, Trump phoned Putin directly after the meeting, holding a 40-minute call. German Chancellor Merz compared Russia’s demand that Ukraine cede Donbas territory to the US giving up Florida. Still, Trump suggested Putin was open to “security guarantees,” with envoy Steve Witkoff claiming Moscow could accept Nato-style protections for Kyiv. Macron reinforced the message, insisting that “security guarantees” meant safeguarding the entire European continent.Trump, who during his presidential campaign claimed that he could end the war “in a day,” tempered but still played up expectations. “A week or two weeks, we’ll know whether we’re going to solve this, or if this horrible fighting is going to continue,” he said. He insisted the issues were not “overly complex,” though they include territory, Ukraine’s future military capacity and enduring security guarantees. Outside the White House, Zelenskyy admitted no date had been set for a Putin meeting but that Trump was pressing for it “as soon as possible. ” He added that questions of land concessions would be left to “between me and Putin.”Trump announced he was arranging a face-to-face between Putin and Zelenskyy, to be followed by a trilateral summit including himself. On Truth Social, he wrote: “Everyone is very happy about the possibility of PEACE for Russia/Ukraine.” Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov later said Putin and Trump had spoken “in favour” of continuing direct talks, though no location was confirmed. Zelenskyy told reporters he was “ready” for such a meeting, while Macron floated the idea of expanding it to include top European leaders. If confirmed, it would mark the first encounter between Putin and Zelenskyy since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.Before the formal talks began, Trump was caught on a hot mic with Macron. Whispering in the East Room, he said of Putin: “I think he wants to make a deal. I think he wants to make a deal for me, you understand that? As crazy as it sounds.” The remark underscored Trump’s belief that Putin views him as a unique broker for peace. Trump also mentioned setting up a trilateral meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy, echoing what he would later announce publicly. The candid aside highlighted the unusual role Trump sees for himself — both as mediator and as the dealmaker Putin allegedly prefers.One of the sharpest divides emerged over whether a ceasefire is a prerequisite for negotiations. Trump downplayed its necessity, saying: “I don’t know that it’s necessary.” That aligned with Putin’s view but clashed with European leaders. Merz was blunt: “I can’t imagine that the next meeting would take place without a ceasefire.” He pressed for more pressure on Russia, while Macron and others echoed calls for de-escalation. Zelenskyy, notably, did not repeat his earlier demands for a ceasefire, instead leaving the matter open. The question now threatens to shape the next phase of talks, with Trump willing to sidestep it in favour of pursuing longer-term agreements.Mindful of his rocky last visit, Zelenskyy embarked on a deliberate charm offensive. Within minutes he offered six “thank yous,” presented Trump with a letter from his wife to Melania Trump, and dressed in a formal suit. Trump reacted warmly, joking: “I cannot believe it. I love it. Look at you.” Zelenskyy also kept the humour going when Glenn, the conservative reporter who previously mocked him, complimented his new look. The Ukrainian leader replied: “I changed, you have not.” European leaders, meanwhile, dialled up their flattery of Trump, with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni saying “something had changed” thanks to him, while Nato chief Rutte praised his “leadership.”Zelenskyy revealed that part of the security guarantees under discussion involved a massive arms package. He told reporters the US and Ukraine had reached a preliminary $90 billion agreement for advanced weapons, including aviation and anti-missile systems. He also said the US would purchase Ukrainian-made drones to fund their domestic production. The Financial Times reported Ukraine had agreed to buy $100 billion in US weapons financed by Europe in return for American security backing. Trump remained vague but promised: “We’ll give them good protection.” Zelenskyy said terms could be finalised within 10 days, with leaders framing it as a foundation for future peace talks.","US President Donald Trump met with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy and top European leaders.

Rescuers in Pakistan are struggling to recover bodies after flash floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains killed at least 321 people in the past 48 hours, officials told AFP on Saturday. Most casualties were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where 307 people died as rivers burst their banks and houses collapsed.A video shared by RT.com showed the scale of destruction as torrents swept through towns and villages, leaving entire neighbourhoods in ruins. The floods, described by residents as “doomsday”, have left many communities cut off with relief efforts hampered by washed-out roads and ongoing rainfall.Authorities said around 2,000 rescue workers are engaged in operations across nine districts, but access remains severely restricted.“Heavy rainfall, landslides in several areas, and washed-out roads are causing significant challenges in delivering aid, particularly in transporting heavy machinery and ambulances,” Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesman for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s rescue agency, told AFP.“Due to road closures in most areas, rescue workers are travelling on foot to conduct operations in remote regions,” he added.Buner district has been hardest hit, recording at least 184 deaths. Other badly affected areas include Shangla, Mansehra, Swat, Bajaur and Battagram. The provincial government has declared these mountainous districts as disaster zones.Survivors have described terrifying scenes as torrents tore through homes without warning.“I heard a loud noise as if the mountain was sliding. I rushed outside and saw the entire area shaking, like it was the end of the world,” Azizullah told AFP. “The ground was trembling due to the force of the water, and it felt like death was staring me in the face.”Mass funerals were held across affected districts on Friday, with mourners grieving in front of rows of bodies covered by blankets. Local schoolteacher Saifullah Khan said: “We still have no clear idea who in this small village is alive and who is dead. I help retrieve the bodies of the children I taught, I keep wondering what kind of trial nature has imposed on these kids.”Officials warned the death toll is likely to rise further as dozens remain missing. Pakistan’s meteorological department has issued more rain alerts, warning that the intensity of the monsoon will worsen over the next two weeks.","Floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains have killed at least 321 people in Pakistan.

Climate crisis drives displacement





After decades of war, Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.Since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including dams and canals, to harness river flows that spill into Iran, Pakistan, and Central Asia.But as per news agency AFP, these efforts are fuelling disputes, with climate change worsening water shortages across the region.The most contentious initiative is the Qosh Tepa canal, a mega-project designed to irrigate 560,000 hectares of farmland in northern Afghanistan. Experts say it could divert up to 21 per cent of the Amu Darya’s flow, a river already vital for water-stressed Central Asian states. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, backed by Kazakhstan, have raised alarms that the project could further shrink the Aral Sea and destabilise the region’s water-sharing arrangements, which date back to the Soviet era.Water governance specialist Mohd Faizee cautioned and was quoted by AFP as saying, “No matter how friendly the tone is now, at some point there will be consequences for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan when the canal starts operating.”Taliban officials, however, insist the canal will not cause significant harm. Project manager Sayed Zabihullah Miri was cited by AFP as saying that the Amu Darya has “an abundance of water, especially when it floods and glacial meltwater flows into it”.They argue the project is critical to boosting food security in a country where climate-driven crop failures and humanitarian crises remain widespread.Iran, Afghanistan’s western neighbour, is the only country with a formal water-sharing treaty, signed in 1973 over the Helmand river. But the accord has never been fully honoured. Tehran frequently accuses Kabul of restricting flows through upstream dams, especially during droughts.The Taliban maintain that water scarcity, worsened by climate change, leaves them unable to release more.A report by the Afghanistan Analysts Network noted that Afghan authorities also believe they have long been denied their fair share of Helmand waters due to poor management and political neglect.Meanwhile, disputes also simmer over the Harirud basin, which flows into Iran and Turkmenistan, where Afghanistan recently inaugurated the Pashdan dam. Analysts say reduced security risks after the war could accelerate such projects, reshaping regional water dynamics.To the east, Afghanistan shares the Kabul river basin with Pakistan, which eventually feeds into the Indus. Unlike Iran, no treaty exists between the two neighbours. While water disputes have not dominated their rocky bilateral relations, Kabul’s attempts to revive old river projects and build new ones could trigger friction.Yet, Afghanistan’s financial struggles and lack of technical expertise mean most large-scale projects will take years to complete. This delay may ease immediate diplomatic concerns, but for Afghans grappling with severe water shortages in the capital and beyond, the wait could deepen suffering.Afghanistan’s water disputes cannot be separated from the worsening climate emergency. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), nearly five million people were affected by floods, droughts, and other climate shocks in early 2025, with almost 400,000 displaced.“Crop failure, dry pastures and vanishing water sources are pushing rural communities to the edge,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in July.Villagers in the north were quoted by AFP as saying that they were pinning hopes on the Qosh Tepa canal to revive farming, though its completion is still more than a year away. In contrast, communities in western Herat have watched the Harirud river run dry, forcing families who were deported from Iran to return to barren land with little to farm.Meanwhile, extreme rainfall has added another layer of crisis. Warmer temperatures mean heavier downpours, often triggering devastating flash floods. In Maidan Wardak, a community leader said, “I’m around 54 years old, and we have never experienced problems like this before.”Taliban officials admit their efforts fall short. Energy and water minister Abdul Latif Mansoor recently conceded that while canal and dam projects are underway, “the measures we have taken so far are not enough”.Limited funding, international isolation and restrictive governance have left Afghanistan struggling to cope with climate shocks, even as it faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.For millions of Afghans, everything now comes down to water, too little in times of drought, too much during floods, as the Taliban’s push for control over rivers becomes a defining issue for the country and its neighbours alike.","Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.

A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses. More than 700,000 people from the Rohingya minority fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape persecution. About 70,000 more crossed the border last year after the Arakan Army effectively seized control of the territory.The Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar has been operating since 2018 under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council to document human rights abuses and violations in the country.It has already shared evidence with authorities pursuing cases involving the Rohingya at the International Criminal Court and the UN’s International Court of Justice.","U.N.-backed team releases annual report covering the 12 months to 30 June.

One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage from the blast’s pressure.Tensions have been high since last month’s five-day conflict over disputed ancient temples along the 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, which left at least 43 people dead and forced more than 300,000 residents from their homes. The fighting, which involved jets, artillery, rockets and infantry, ended on 29 July after mediation by US President Donald Trump.On Thursday, Thai and Cambodian defence officials met in Kuala Lumpur and agreed to extend the truce. However, Saturday’s incident has cast doubt over the ceasefire’s stability.Thailand’s foreign ministry accused Cambodia of laying new landmines in violation of the agreement and said it would file an official protest. However the country’s Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority denied the allegation, insisting no new mines had been planted.Acting PM Phumtham Wechayachai, who was in neighbouring Surin province at the time, has ordered the military to ensure the injured soldiers receive full treatment.","One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage.

Sri Lanka: Ex-minister from Rajapaksa family arrested for alleged corruption; first from once-powerful dynasty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sri-lanka-ex-minister-from-rajapaksa-family-arrested-for-alleged-corruption-first-from-once-powerful-dynasty/articleshow/123143702.cms,"Shasheendra Rajapaksa





Sri Lankan authorities on Wednesday arrested former minister Shasheendra Rajapaksa, a nephew of ex-presidents Gotabaya and Mahinda Rajapaksa, over corruption charges related to misusing state land and claiming undue compensation.The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) said Shasheendra coerced officials into granting him compensation for property damage, even though the asset in question was located on state-owned land. He is also accused of misusing government land, fraudulently claiming losses, and committing corruption during the aftermath of the 2022 mass protests which forced Gotabaya to resign.This marks the first arrest of a Rajapaksa family member since the leftist government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake took office in September 2024, pledging a crackdown on entrenched corruption.Shasheendra, son of former parliamentary speaker Chamal, the eldest Rajapaksa brother, was produced before a Colombo magistrate and remanded till August 19.The once-dominant Rajapaksa family faces mounting legal troubles. Shasheendra’s cousins Namal and Yoshitha (Mahinda’s sons) are battling money laundering charges. Basil Rajapaksa, another brother of Chamal, Mahinda and Gotabaya, and an ex-minister, is under investigation for financial misconduct.Sri Lanka is still recovering from its worst economic crisis in decades, which saw it default on $46 billion in external debt in 2022, triggering nationwide protests and a political upheaval.","Shasheendra Rajapaksa is a nephew of ex-presidents Gotabaya and Mahinda.

Afghanistan earthquake: Two tremors strike region within hours; no damage reported so far,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/afghanistan-earthquake-two-tremors-strike-region-within-hours-no-damage-reported-so-far/articleshow/123139919.cms,"Representative Image (ANI image)





An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS). The quake occurred at 2:24 pm IST, at a depth of 155 kilometers. The epicenter was located at latitude 36.51°N and longitude 70.70°E within the Afghan territory.This was the second quake recorded today, as seismic activity continues to affect the region. Earlier, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake struck at 12:19 pm IST. It occurred at a depth of 47 kilometers, with the epicenter located at latitude 36.54°N and longitude 71.52°E.This is the latest in a series of earthquakes to hit the region in recent days. On August 2, a stronger earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale struck Afghanistan at a depth of 87 kilometers. Prior to that, on July 29, a 4.8-magnitude earthquake was recorded at a shallow depth of just 10 kilometers.Shallow earthquakes are more dangerous than deep earthquakes. This is so because the seismic waves from shallow earthquakes have a shorter distance to travel to the surface, resulting in stronger ground shaking causing more damage to structures and greater casualties.According to the Red Cross, Afghanistan lies on several fault lines between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain region, making it one of the most earthquake-prone areas in the world.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), Afghanistan warn that frequent quakes continue to pose a serious threat to communities in the country, which are already vulnerable due to decades of conflict and underdevelopment.The organization also noted that the country is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.","An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday.

Bangladesh Interim Chief Yunus To Stay After Resignation Threat Amid Protests Over Rohingya Corridor

July Declaration unveiled:

Tight security and public celebration:





Bangladesh’s interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus on Tuesday announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026, ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. He made the declaration during his address to the nation via state television, BTV and radio to mark the first anniversary of the mass uprising that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ""On behalf of the interim government, I will write to the Chief Election Commissioner, requesting that the Election Commission organise a national election in February 2026, before the next Ramadan,"" Yunus said.The announcement marks a shift from his earlier indication that polls would be held in April. The revised timeline comes after consultations with major political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia which had called for earlier elections.""We will all begin mental preparation and institutional arrangements from tomorrow to complete all arrangements so that this year's election is memorable in the country's history in terms of joy and celebration, peace and order, voter turnout, and cordiality,"" he added.Yunus urged political parties to ensure that youth and women are not excluded from their manifestos or future governance plans. ""Remember, the youth who have changed Bangladesh have the power to change the world as well,"" he said.Earlier today, the interim government had also formally released the ""July Declaration"", a 26-point document outlining proposed reforms in governance, constitutional and political issues.Top leaders from political groups such as the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, and the newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP) were present during the official unveiling at the Bangladesh Parliament Complex, commemorating the uprising anniversary.The declaration sharply criticized the 1972 Constitution after its independence war against Pakistan in 1971, calling for reforms aligned with the will of the people.""Whereas, the post-independence Awami League government failed to materialise the people's aspirations because of the weaknesses in the procedures of drafting and in the structure of the constitution, along with its inappropriate application,"" the July Declaration said.It also condemned Sheikh Hasina’s administration, accusing it of turning Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state through alleged authoritarian rule and human rights violations.""Whereas, during the rule of Sheikh Hasina, under her very leadership, an extreme force that was anti-people, autocratic and against human rights turned Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state and thereby tarnished Bangladesh's international image,"" it added.The document calls for the 2024 uprising to be given official recognition and proposes that the July Declaration be included in a reformed constitution.Tens of thousands gathered at Manik Mia Avenue in Dhaka to mark the anniversary of Hasina’s ouster. The government declared the day a national holiday. Security was heightened across the capital, with police checkpoints and patrols in sensitive areas.Sheikh Hasina, who had been in power for 15 years, fled to India in August last year following mass protests. Her party, the Awami League, has since been banned by the interim administration, and its registration has been revoked by the Election Commission, effectively barring it from contesting in future polls unless the ban is lifted.Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch (HRW) raised concerns over the interim government's progress on human rights.""The hope of the thousands who braved lethal violence a year ago when they opposed Sheikh Hasina's abusive rule to build a rights-respecting democracy remains unfulfilled,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at HRW.She warned that the interim leadership is struggling to balance security reform with pressures from hardliners and rival political factions.As the nation reflects on the events of the past year, Bangladesh remains on high alert. The month of August also marks the anniversary of the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s founding figure and Hasina’s father.","Bangladesh's interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026.

A newly formed political party led by students who played a key role in the anti-government protests that led to the ouster of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina held a rally in the country's capital Dhaka on Sunday, pledging to build a new Bangladesh amid ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the next national election, reported news agency AP.The National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters. Party leader Nahid Islam announced a 24-point agenda and called for the creation of a new constitution to replace the one adopted in 1972.“Exactly one year ago, at this Shaheed Minar (memorial), we vowed to free this country from the hands of dictatorship. By responding to that call, we together defeated the fascist rule and regained control of our country,” Islam said.“Let us all unite and transform this historic 24-point agenda into reality to build a new Bangladesh, a Bangladesh that fulfills the dreams of all citizens, as we move toward the formation of our second republic,” he added, as quoted by the agency.The party did not provide specific details on the proposed constitution but said its goal was to reflect the aspirations of a new generation of Bangladeshis.Separately, the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) also held a large rally in Dhaka.BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, who has been in exile in London since 2008, addressed the crowd virtually and urged supporters to mobilise young voters ahead of the upcoming polls, according to AP.Rahman said, “We must reclaim our democratic rights and engage the youth in shaping Bangladesh’s future.”The rallies took place two days before the interim government, led by Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is set to mark the first anniversary of Sheikh Hasina’s departure from power.Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, following weeks of mass protests and political unrest that resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. Yunus assumed office on August 8.The demonstrations come amid criticism of the interim government’s handling of law and order, with opposition parties accusing it of failing to contain mob violence and uphold human rights.With Hasina’s Awami League banned and the political future still unclear, the rallies highlighted the growing activity among both new and established political forces ahead of the next election.","National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Electric vehicles account for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal.

Prince William & Kate Middleton's ‘Forever Home’ Dream Leaves Neighbours Homeless





Princess Anne turned 75 on August 15. To mark the day, the Prince and Princess of Wales posted a short birthday wish and shared her newly released portrait of the Princess Royal. Their message read, “Wishing Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal a very Happy 75th Birthday!”The image is part of a set released for the milestone. Shot at Gatcombe Park by John Swannell, the portrait keeps the tone formal and restrained—very Anne. Swannell has photographed her across multiple milestone birthdays, a continuity that suits the Princess Royal’s preference for understatement.There was also an earlier portrait released the week before: a two-shot of Anne with Sir Tim Laurence , taken at Windsor Castle by Chris Jackson ahead of July’s French state banquet. That image drew attention to a sleeker, pulled-back hairstyle, a look Anne also wore at the banquet with her longtime Festoon Tiara.The post from William and Kate landed during the family’s summer break, but the message stayed classic: a clear portrait, a brief line, and no long caption. It matches Anne’s public style and allows the picture to do the talking.As ever, the focus around her birthday was service. Anne is widely cited as one of the monarchy’s hardest-working royals, and official birthday coverage emphasized her decades of engagements and patronages.Family figured in the week’s imagery, too. The Windsor channels highlighted Anne and Sir Tim’s quiet partnership, as well as archival moments from her life—reminders of a career defined by duty, sport and charity more than spectacle.Why does a single post matter? It shows how the Wales household and the Princess Royal present milestones now: warm but minimal, with the visuals carrying the sentiment. For Anne, the emphasis stays on the work rather than the social-media flourish.As the summer break continues, the family is expected to spend time together in Scotland, with no indication of a large public event for the occasion. For the Princess Royal, a steady calendar and a modest celebration remain the norm—and the Waleses’ short message matched that mood.The takeaway: a milestone birthday, a clean portrait, and a brief wish from nephew and niece-in-law—small gestures that say plenty about how Princess Anne works, and how the royal family marks personal events today.","Princess Anne turned 75 on August 15.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he is willing to meet US President Donald Trump and would be “more than happy to meet” him, even as he warned that Trump’s words could “inadvertently radicalize people” and that he is “not a force for good.”The Labour politician dismissed Trump’s recent personal attacks, made during the US President’s visit to Scotland, in which Trump called Khan “a nasty person” who had “done a terrible job.” Khan described such comments as “water off a duck’s back”.However, speaking at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, he admitted that the exchanges sometimes made him feel “nine years old again” and like he was “in the school playground,” as reported by the Independent.During the event, Khan had criticised Trump’s views on women, black people, LGBTQ+ individuals, Muslims and Mexicans.“Somebody who has views like he does about black people, about women, about gays, about Muslims, about Mexicans, thinks I’m nasty. Really. He is the leader of the free world, arguably the most powerful man in the world, and really.”Khan highlighted that since Trump began his second term in January, record numbers of Americans have applied for British citizenship and moved to London.“So I think Americans have got good taste by and large,” he said.He hoped that Trump would visit London during his upcoming state visit to the UK, emphasizing that the city’s diversity is a “strength, not a weakness.” Speaking about diversity, he added, “I think it makes us stronger not weaker, richer not poorer.""The London mayor warned that President Trump’s words can push extreme views into the mainstream and become potentially dangerous. He may unintentionally radicalize people, prompting harmful actions.Khan also highlighted that minorities in London could face discrimination because of the Trump’s statements. He accused US President of “using London and our diversity as a political football, as a proxy for a culture war.”Despite his criticisms, Khan said he would be “more than happy to meet President Trump”.The Labour politician said, “I suspect President Trump may have formed a view of Muslims because of the actions of a small minority of really bad people who are terrorists and use Islam in a perverted way.“What I would want President Trump to know is that is a very small fraction of Muslims across the globe. So if there was an opportunity to meet President Trump, I would be more than happy to do so.”","London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he is willing to meet US President Donald Trump.

LONDON: A multi-million pound conservation programme in England helped save 150 struggling species but ""time is running out"" to halt the decline, the head of Natural England, which led the initiative, said Wednesday.The public body, responsible for protecting and enhancing England's natural environment, invested a £13 million ($17.6 million) grant in efforts to support animal and plant species such as water vole, oystercatcher, lady's slipper orchid, the hazel dormouse and Atlantic salmon.""From the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall to Cumbria and Northumberland, 63 different projects involving 78 partners have transformed landscapes and supported the recovery of 150 species, many of which were on the brink of national extinction, through research, captive breeding, habitat creation, and conservation translocations,"" the body said in a statement released Wednesday.More than 15,000 individual animals and plants were translocated to expand species territories under the projects, which ran from August 2023 to March 2025.Notable successes include the reintroduction of black grouse to the North Yorkshire Moors, northern England, and the return of the large marsh grasshopper to the Norfolk Broads in east England after an 85-year absence.Despite the achievements, the chair of Natural England Tony Juniper warned more needed to be done.""A rising number of nature recovery projects, both large and small, are making a huge difference up and down the country,"" he said in the press release.""We know we can turn round species decline and improve ecosystems with the right targeted actions, the drive and the funding.

LONDON: Court of Appeal judges here have refused to increase the seven-year sentence given to a 15-year-old boy for killing much-loved 80-year-old British Indian grandfather Bhim Kohli, saying the sentence he was handed down was correct.On Wednesday, Lady Justice Macur, Justice Cutts and Justice Murray dismissed the application by the solicitor-general for permission to appeal against the boy’s sentence on the basis it was unduly lenient.The judges also dismissed an application for permission to appeal the sentence by the boy’s lawyer, Balraj Bhatia KC, who claimed it was “manifestly excessive”.Lucy Rigby KC had referred the case to the Court of Appeal in July. The boy was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter in April and sentenced in June.Kohli, an active and fit man who was held in high regard by the local community, was killed on Sept 1, 2024 while walking his dog in a Leicestershire park. The boy, then aged 14, put on a balaclava, knocked him to the ground, then hit him round the head with his slider shoe as he was on his knees trying to get up as a girl he was with, then aged 12, laughed and filmed the attack on her mobile.The boy attacked Kohli a second time near the park exit, punching and kicking him, breaking three ribs. He died later in hospital.The sentencing was enhanced due to aggravating factors which included the boy calling Kohli a “Paki”. Kohli was born in Punjab, India.Bhatia argued that calling Kohli a “Paki” was at the lower end of the scale of racism and the addition to the sentence was excessive. The court heard the boy’s sentence was half what an adult would get.Lady Justice Macur said: “We understand that not only his family but the public too were shocked at the lenient sentence of 7 years. However , the sentencing of children and young people for serious offences is complex. Many are not fully developed and may not understand the pain they cause to victims. The court must bear in mind the principle is to prevent offending and the welfare of the child. We do not find the sentence unduly lenient. ”She rejected the argument that adding six months to the sentence for racial aggravating factors was excessive and praised Kohli’s “sunny disposition” and “enjoyment of life” to his family who were in court.","Court of Appeal judges refuse to increase the seven-year sentence given to a 15-year-old boy for killing much-loved British Indian grandfather Bhim Kohli.

"UK asks people to 'delete' old emails to save water, drought situation 'nationally significant'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-asks-people-to-delete-old-emails-to-save-water-drought-situation-nationally-significant/articleshow/123266577.cms,"UK asks people to delete old emails to save water.

List of UK cities in drought



UK government's 7 tips on how to save water at home



Install a rain butt to collect rainwater to use in the garden Fix a leaking toilet -- leaky loos can water 200-400 litres a day. Use water from the kitchen to water your plants. Avoid water in your lawn-- brown grass will grow back healthy. Turn off the taps when brushing teeth or shaving. Take shorter showers. Delete old emails and pictures as data centers require vast amounts of water to cool their systems.





The UK government has asked its people to delete old emails to play their part in not wasting water as the current drought situation has been defined as a ""nationally significant incident"". Old emails, photos stored in data clouds require vast data centers and they consume large amounts of water to keep cool.The advice was issued as Britain endures its fourth heatwave of the summer. Five areas of England are currently officially in drought, with six more in 'prolonged dry weather'.""The current situation is nationally significant, and we are calling on everyone to play their part and help reduce the pressure on our water environment,"" Helen Wakeham, the Environment Agency's director of water, said.""We are grateful to the public for following the restrictions, where in place, to conserve water in these dry conditions.""Simple, everyday choices – such as turning off a tap or deleting old emails – also really helps the collective effort to reduce demand and help preserve the health of our rivers and wildlife.""Drought has been declared in Yorkshire, Cumbria and Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Cheshire, East Midlands, and the West Midlands. Areas categorised as having had ""prolonged dry weather"" (the phase before drought) are: Northeast, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire, East Anglia, Thames, Wessex, Solent and South Downs.Hosepipe bans are still in place for all Yorkshire Water customers along with some customers of Thames Water, South East Water and Southern Water.","The UK government has asked its people to delete old emails to play their part in not wasting water.

"Mia Tindall cheers on mum Zara at Hartpury, and her love of horses is clear",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/mia-tindall-cheers-on-mum-zara-at-hartpury-and-her-love-of-horses-is-clear/articleshow/123263060.cms,"Credit: AL123/Splash News & Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images

Zara Tindall spent the weekend competing at the NAF Five Star International Hartpury Horse Trials in Gloucestershire. Beside the warm-up ring, her 11-year-old daughter Mia watched closely, smiled for photos, and reached up to stroke one of Zara’s horses. The small moments told their own story. Mia looks at home around the stables.Zara rode two familiar partners at Hartpury. She brought Showtime, known in the yard as “Cracker,” and Class Affair, nicknamed “Socks.” Between rounds, Mia stayed close, chatting with her mum and keeping an eye on the action. It was a simple family scene at a busy event.The outing fits a long family pattern. Zara is an Olympian who has spent most of her life around eventing. Her mother, Princess Anne, was the first royal to compete at the Olympics. Her late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, was a lifelong horsewoman. Seeing Mia comfortable in that world feels natural, and it hints at a next chapter for the Tindalls’ eldest child.Crowd shots from Hartpury showed Mia following each phase and cheering from the ropes. She watched showjumping from close enough to see take-off strides and leaned forward during cross-country updates.Nothing about it felt forced. It looked like a child enjoying her mum’s sport.The event itself is a regular stop for Zara. It draws strong fields across levels and gives riders a good mid-season test. This year she balanced competition with being present for her daughter, and the cameras picked up that easy rhythm. A rider’s focus can be intense on show days. Zara still made space for quick smiles with Mia before heading back to the horsebox.There was also a small stable-side detail that fans loved. Mia reached up to pat Showtime and grinned as the horse flicked an ear toward her. Little gestures like that say more than any speech about where a child’s interests might lead. No one is mapping out her future, but comfort around horses often starts with moments like this.Zara has said before that all three of her children have been on a pony. That early exposure shows. Mia moved around the yard with confidence, giving the horses space when needed and stepping back when grooms asked. It is the kind of quiet horsemanship children pick up by being around good yards.Mother and daughter also offered a simple picture of support. When Zara finished a round, Mia was there. When the next phase approached, Mia made way so the team could work. For families who live the show circuit, that balance is familiar. It is how many young riders begin, watching first, riding later.The photos from Hartpury will add to Mia’s growing gallery of equestrian days out. For now, it is enough to see interest and joy. If she chooses to ride more in public, she will have a mother who understands the sport at the highest level and a family who know how to blend normal life with busy weekends on the road.Hartpury offered a gentle reminder of what this family values. Horses, routine, and time together. One weekend, two good horses, and a child who could not stop watching. That was the story from the rails, and it was easy to read.","Zara Tindall spent the weekend competing at the NAF Five Star International Hartpury Horse Trials in Gloucestershire.

Meme revived: Van in UK town displays altered image of JD Vance – watch video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/meme-revived-van-in-uk-town-displays-altered-image-of-jd-vance-watch-video/articleshow/123260848.cms,"(Source: Reuters/X)





Residents of the Oxfordshire town of Charlbury were met with an unusual sight this week when a van bearing an altered image of US vice president JD Vance drove through its streets.The picture showed Vance bald in a style widely used in internet memes and was displayed prominently on the vehicle.The stunt was organised by the British political campaign group ‘Everyone Hates Elon’ and took place near where Vance was reportedly holidaying with his family, reports news agency Reuters.The meme has been circulating online for months, gaining extra attention after Vance’s remarks during a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.While the image is generally treated as humorous online, it has been linked to a recent controversy involving a Norwegian tourist.In June, 21-year-old Mads Mikkelsen claimed he was denied entry to the United States at Newark Liberty International Airport after immigration officers discovered the bald Vance meme on his phone. He said he was detained, questioned about drug trafficking and extremism, and pressured to unlock his phone under threat of fines or imprisonment.US customs and border protection later issued a statement denying that the meme played any role in Mikkelsen’s refusal of entry.They said the real reason was his admitted past drug use, dismissing suggestions of political motives.Mikkelsen alleged the experience was humiliating, involving strip-searches, fingerprinting, and errors in his travel records, including his Norwegian passport being incorrectly marked as Spanish.Vance has acknowledged the memes himself, telling The Blaze that he finds them funny.","A van bearing an altered image of US vice president JD Vance drove through Charlbury, Oxfordshire.

Princess Anne is celebrating her 75th birthday with a fresh look and her signature sparkle. A new portrait released ahead of the milestone shows the Princess Royal standing alongside her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence. The photograph was taken before the French state banquet at Windsor Castle in July.The first thing people will notice is her hair. Anne has worn a similar bouffant style for about five decades. In this portrait she switches to a smooth chignon. It is elegant, neat, and suits the formal setting. The change is rare for her, which is why the photo drew quick attention.Tiara is the second talking point in this portrait. Anne chose the Festoon Tiara, a long-time favorite in her rotation. She received it as a gift in 1973 after christening a ship for the Worldwide Shipping Group. The design sits low and balanced, which works well with the new hair. Together they create a cleaner frame around her face.The portrait also doubles as a quiet nod to partnership. Sir Tim stands with her, as he often does at major state events. The two married in 1992 and keep a low profile. Their presence together in the birthday image sets a warm tone as family plans take shape for the coming weeks.There is context behind the timing. The palace shared the photo one week before her August 15 birthday to start the celebrations. It was shot by royal photographer Chris Jackson. He captured it at Windsor before the banquet held for the French state visit from July 8 to 10. The result is formal but relaxed, a look that fits Anne’s usual style.Fashion notes aside, the image also lands after a busy and challenging year. Anne remains one of the most active working royals by engagement count. Last year she briefly stepped back after a horse-related incident near her home. She returned to duties and later said the experience was a reminder that each day is a bonus. The new portrait, bright and composed, underlines that message without a single word.Reactions so far focus on two themes. Many like seeing a small style reset that still feels like Anne. Others appreciate the continuity of the Festoon Tiara, a piece linked to her early twenties and worn across decades. It is a simple mix of new and old. That balance is what people expect from her.As the birthday week begins, more pictures and appearances are likely. For now, one frame does the job. New hair. A classic tiara. Her husband at her side. It is a quiet portrait that still says a lot about how Anne works, dresses, and shows up for the role she has held for most of her life.","Princess Anne is celebrating her 75th birthday with a fresh look and her signature sparkle.

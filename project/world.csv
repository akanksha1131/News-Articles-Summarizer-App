California declares emergency to combat rising bird flu infection in dairy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-declares-emergency-to-combat-rising-bird-flu-infection-in-dairy/articleshow/116455758.cms,"A state of emergency was declared in US's California on Wednesday to combat bird flu after the virus has spread to more than a quarter of all state's dairies in the last month and infected 34 state residents.“This proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak,” Newsom said in a statement.The virus has swept across the nation's largest dairy-production state. The state's agriculture department has found the virus in 645 dairies,about half of them in the past 30 days alone.Meanwhile, federal health officials confirmed the first known severe illness caused by the virus.A person in Louisiana is hospitalized in critical condition with severe respiratory symptoms caused by a bird flu infection, state health officials said. The person, who is over 65 and has underlying medical problems, had been in contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock.Since March, more than 60 bird flu infections in people have been reported in the US, but previous illnesses have been mild and most have been detected among farmworkers exposed to sick poultry or dairy cows.Flu experts said the trajectory of the virus in people remains unclear, but they urged people who have contact with sick or dead birds to take precautions, including wearing respiratory and eye protection and gloves when handling poultry.“We may see more cases of severe disease in the U.S. since cases seem to be growing more frequent,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.","A person in Louisiana is hospitalized in critical condition with severe respiratory symptoms caused by a bird flu infection, state health officials said.

'Don’t say rape': Stephanopoulos reportedly ignored producer’s repeated warnings — Leading to $16 million settlement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dont-say-rape-stephanopoulos-reportedly-ignored-producers-repeated-warnings-leading-to-16-million-settlement/articleshow/116455324.cms,"Despite these clear instructions, Stephanopoulos proceeded to make the controversial statement, which ultimately led to the defamation lawsuit filed by Trump against ABC News and the anchor.

The legal fallout and quick settlement

Stephanopoulos' apology and ABC's internal strain

Double-down on ‘rape’

ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos ignored repeated warnings from his producer not to use the word “rape” during a segment discussing Donald Trump—leading to a $16 million defamation settlement, sources have revealed as reported by the New York Post.The incident occurred in March during an interview with Republican lawmaker Nancy Mace on This Week , where Stephanopoulos referred to Trump as ""liable for rape"" in connection with a civil lawsuit won by journalist E Jean Carroll. Sources close to the situation say Stephanopoulos was specifically cautioned not to use the term, with one producer allegedly repeating the warning multiple times before the segment.“‘This Week’ producer said ‘don’t use the word rape’ before the segment started,” an insider said as quoted by the Post. “The EP [executive producer] said it so many times.” A second source confirmed the warning, showing a text message sent to the team that read, ""Don’t say rape.""Despite these clear instructions, Stephanopoulos proceeded to make the controversial statement, which ultimately led to the defamation lawsuit filed by Trump against ABC News and the anchor.The consequences of Stephanopoulos’ decision to ignore the producer’s warnings were severe. Disney, ABC’s parent company, settled the lawsuit last week for $16 million—$15 million of which was directed to a presidential foundation and $1 million to Trump’s attorney fees. The settlement came after a Florida judge rejected a request to delay the case, ordering Stephanopoulos and Trump to sit for depositions just days before Christmas. The judge also demanded the release of Stephanopoulos' communications, including text messages and emails, which could have been damaging for ABC.Legal experts say that Disney’s decision to settle quickly was likely influenced by the potential damage caused by Stephanopoulos' defiance. “If he ignored the producer's warning, it would make it harder for Disney to defend itself in court,” one legal expert said.As part of the settlement, Stephanopoulos was forced to publicly apologize—a decision that left him “apoplectic” and “humiliated,” sources told The Post. Inside ABC News, staff have been calling the anchor “Furious George” in reference to his frustration with the forced apology.“Everyone seems to be asking that question except ABC brass,” a source within the network said, questioning how Stephanopoulos can continue to cover Trump moving forward.The controversy intensified when Stephanopoulos reasserted his use of the word “rape” just days after the lawsuit was filed. Appearing on CBS’ The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, he doubled down on his claim that the word was appropriate, based on comments made by the judge in the New York case.“I’m not going to be cowed out of doing my job because of the threat,” Stephanopoulos said during the appearance.Trump has denied all wrongdoing in relation to Carroll’s allegations, but a New York court had already found him liable for sexual abuse related to an incident in 1996 and later defamation regarding Carroll’s claims.As the dust settles on the legal battle, ABC News and its parent company Disney are left to deal with the fallout from one word—and the heavy cost of ignoring a producer’s warning.","ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos ignored repeated warnings from his producer not to use the word ""rape"" during a segment discussing Donald Trump.

' – How US military responds to drone intrusions over bases",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/drone-update-zap-it-put-it-in-a-bag-how-us-military-responds-to-drone-intrusions-over-bases/articleshow/116454830.cms,"US government has stressed that there is no evidence that the drones pose any threat, saying they may be manned aircraft including lawfully-operated small planes or helicopters.

The military’s approach: ""Zap it and put it in a bag""

What makes drones a threat?

Tools and strategies to combat the threat

The bigger picture

A mysterious surge of drone sightings over US military installations has exposed a glaring vulnerability in national defense , with Pentagon officials scrambling to address the growing threat. Recent incursions reveal how foreign adversaries may be exploiting gaps in the military’s authority to neutralize drones outside base perimeters.Infiltrations have become so common that some defense officials advocate for decisive action. ""Zap it, put it in a bag, and exploit it for clues,"" one senior official bluntly suggested, highlighting the need for immediate, hands-on responses to unidentified drones, reported US Today.The Air Force has discreetly employed these tactics, with spokesperson Ann Stefanek confirming drones have been ""taken down"" in recent years. However, operational secrecy limits the details shared with the public.The Pentagon's dilemma stems from jurisdictional limits. While military forces can intercept drones posing threats directly over bases, their authority ends once the aircraft exits restricted airspace, often leaving local law enforcement to handle the situation. In remote areas, this handoff can mean delays—giving adversaries time to gather critical intelligence.Drones can surveil military operations and infrastructure with precision far superior to satellites. Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. David Deptula stressed their potential danger. ""If you get up close to an F-22 fighter jet, you can detect shapes and construction techniques invisible to satellites,"" he explained.Incidents of drones hovering over bases like Langley Air Force Base in Virginia and the Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey suggest adversaries are targeting sensitive assets. Other incursions at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico have disrupted military exercises, while Navy facilities have faced similar surveillance attempts.To combat the drone incursions , the military has deployed advanced counter-drone equipment, including the Dronebuster, a handheld device that jams drone signals. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently approved a classified strategy focused on detecting, tracking, and neutralizing drones.Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon Press Secretary, noted that while bases like Picatinny Arsenal and Naval Weapons Station Earle have received upgraded defenses, the broader challenge remains. ""We don't collect intelligence on American citizens,"" Ryder emphasized, underscoring the legal constraints on US soil.This surge in drone activity has drawn comparisons to the 2023 Chinese spy balloon incident, where a surveillance balloon traversed sensitive sites before being shot down. As lawmakers call for expanded counter-drone legislation, the Pentagon warns of the risks drones pose to military readiness and national security.""Drones are more than just nuisances—they’re surveillance tools with potentially lethal intent,"" Deptula warned. The military’s ""zap it and bag it"" approach may be a step forward, but gaps in authority and jurisdiction leave questions about how well the US is prepared for future drone threats.","A mysterious surge of drone sightings over US military installations has exposed a glaring vulnerability in national defense.

Next Steps



A tragic school shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, on Monday claimed the lives of a teacher and a student, leaving two other students critically injured and sparking renewed debates on school safety and gun violence . Police identified 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow , a student at the private Christian academy, as the shooter. Rupnow, who also went by the name Samantha, was found incapacitated when officers arrived just minutes after the 10:57 a.m. 911 call. She was later pronounced dead at a hospital from what authorities suspect was a self-inflicted gunshot wound, though the medical examiner has not confirmed the official cause of death.The violence also resulted in non-life-threatening injuries to three additional students and another teacher, adding to the devastating toll on the tight-knit school community of approximately 420 students. Authorities are actively investigating Rupnow’s background, searching her home, and reviewing her digital footprint for clues to a motive.Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers called the event “heartbreaking,” while President Joe Biden described the shooting as “shocking and unconscionable,” renewing calls for action against the country’s epidemic of school gun violence. With the school days away from its Christmas break, the tragedy has left a community shattered and grappling with unanswered questions.At a December 16 news conference, police identified 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow as the shooter responsible for the fatal attack at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin.Posts and comments from social media accounts linked to Rupnow and her father, Jeff Rupnow, provide a glimpse into her life leading up to the shooting.Jeff Rupnow’s Facebook account includes photos of Natalie as a baby, a smiling child, and participating in activities such as karate competitions, reflecting a seemingly normal upbringing.A notable post from August shows Natalie at a shooting range, wearing protective gear and handling a firearm. When a commenter asked, “Is that kiddo?”, Jeff responded enthusiastically:The NBSC likely refers to the North Bristol Sportsman’s Club, a shooting range in Wisconsin.Natalie Rupnow’s personal social media profiles have been deactivated or set to private. Before their removal, an image from her X (formerly Twitter) account depicted someone wearing combat boots and making the “OK” hand gesture — a symbol often debated for its varied interpretations.Reports of a manifesto allegedly written by Rupnow have been circulating online, but authorities have not confirmed its existence or authenticity. Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes addressed these claims directly:“A document about this shooting is circulating on social media, but we have not verified its authenticity.”Rupnow’s social media presence, including posts of firearm use and controversial imagery, raises questions about:Authorities are actively examining Rupnow’s digital footprint, family background, and social relationships as part of their investigation. With her accounts now offline, investigators will rely on archived activity, communications, and input from family and friends to uncover potential motivations. Further developments are expected in the coming days.","Police identified 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow as the shooter responsible for the fatal attack at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin.

Trump's fresh 51st state nudge as Justin Trudeau faces trouble: 'Many Canadians want...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-fresh-51st-state-nudge-as-justin-trudeau-faces-trouble-many-canadians-want-/articleshow/116441147.cms,"Amid crisis in Canada, Trump reiterates that many Canadians want Canada to be US's 51st state.

'Trump is serious about making Canada 51st state'

Will Canada get a new PM before next year's election?

Donald Trump gave another nudge to the 51st state row at night as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces fresh trouble in his country following deputy PM and finance minister Chrysia Freeland's resignation. In his night post, Trump said many Canadians want Canada to become the 51st state as he questioned why the United States should subsidize Canada so much. No one can answer why we subsidize Canada to the tune of over $100,000,000 a year? Makes no sense! Many Canadians want Canada to become the 51st State. They would save massively on taxes and military protection. I think it is a great idea. 51st State!!!The 51st state narrative stemmed from the Mar-a-Lago meeting between Trudeau and Trump.Trudeau flew to Florida to meet Trump even before he took over as the President because Trump threatened Canada and Mexico with a 25 per cent tariff -- unless these two neighbors stop sending drugs and illegal immigrants to the US, Trump said. At the meeting which went well, according to both Trump and Trudeau, Trudeau told Trump that Canada's economy will collapse if Trump imposes the tariff. To this, Trump apparently joked and said that in that case Canada could become the 51st state of the United States and Trudeau would become the Governor of this 51st state.While it was a dinner table joke supposed to stay at Mar-a-Lago, it did not as it was widely reported and Trump too publicized it.MAGA supporters cheered after Freeland resigned as it was another blow to the Trudeau government and they credited Trump for delivering the blow as Donald Trump's tariff threat triggered the meltdown in the Trudeau government.After Freeland's resignation, calls for Trudeau's resignation are only growing louder as his resignation, even his allies think, is the only way now as the election will be held in October next year. Freeland cited disagreement with Trudeau as the reason for her exit.Trudeau is reflecting on complaints about his leadership, a close ally said without commenting on the possibility of a resignation. Dominic LeBlanc was named the new finance minister after Freeland's resignation. Trudeau spoke about the turmoil in the leadership at a party event and said, ""We really are a big family. Now like most families, sometimes we have fights around the holidays, but of course, like most families, we find our way through it.""If Trudeau resigns, Freeland could also join the Liberal leadership race to become the prime minister.","Donald Trump reiterates that many Canadians want Canada to be US's 51st state.

Chaos on Royal Caribbean cruise; Man, possibly intoxicated, attacks crew member

A passenger aboard a Royal Caribbean cruise ship died after an altercation with crew members and fellow passengers. Michael Virgil , 35, was on the Navigator of the Seas , sailing from San Pedro, Los Angeles to Ensenada, Baja California, when the incident occurred less than an hour after departure.Virgil allegedly assaulted two crew members, kicking one in the face and punching another, according to a Los Angeles news station, FOX 11. He also reportedly threatened other passengers.A passenger, Christifer Mikhail, recounted the incident, stating, “The gentleman that was drunk said that he was going to kill us. He started chasing us down the hallway.” Mikhail captured video of Virgil attempting to kick open a closet door where a crew member had sought refuge.Virgil attempted to force the door open multiple times, as shown in a video of the incident. He kicked the door with steel-toed boots while shouting profanities, before taking off his shirt in the ship's hallway. He reportedly went on a racial rant, according to a FOX 11 report.“I was kind of scared,” Mikhail said, recounting the incident. “I’m stuck in this hallway. He could have flicked me and thrown me like 30 feet because the guy he punched kinda flew a couple feet back,” he added.Ship security personnel restrained Virgil using zip ties, handcuffs, and either bear or pepper spray, according to Mikhail and his video. Virgil's family told FOX 11 that he was then injected with a sedative and died within an hour.Virgil was traveling with his 7-year-old autistic son and his fiancé, according to a New York Post report.The FBI is investigating the altercation and death. An autopsy is pending to determine the cause of death.Virgil’s family said his behavior was unusual. “He didn’t deserve to die over it,” a relative said, as quoted by New York Post. Royal Caribbean issued a statement to FOX 11: “We are saddened by the passing of one of our guests. We offered support to the family and are working with authorities on their investigation.”","Michael Virgil, 35, was on the Navigator of the Seas sailing from San Pedro, Los Angeles to Ensenada, Baja California.

Wisconsin School Shooting: Why gender debate overshadowed tragedy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wisconsin-school-shooting-why-gender-debate-overshadowed-tragedy/articleshow/116405491.cms,"“She, He, or They”: Chief Barnes’ Comments Ignite Outrage



Social Media Divides Over Barnes’ Neutral Stance



Supporters Defend Chief Barnes’ Approach



The Real Tragedy: Gun Violence and Its Victims



A Broader Divide: Identity Politics vs. Action



Moving Forward: Tragedy Amid Polarization



A devastating shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, left two dead and six injured, shocking the nation. In the aftermath of the violence, an unexpected controversy erupted—not about the shooter’s actions, but over their gender identity.The shooter, identified as 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow , who was also known as Samantha, opened fire in a study hall before taking their own life. During a press conference shortly after the tragedy, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes addressed questions about the shooter’s gender, sparking widespread debate on social media.When asked directly whether Rupnow was transgender, Chief Barnes replied: ""I don’t know whether the shooter was transgender or not. I don’t think that whatever happened today has anything to do with how she or he or they may have wanted to identify. And I wish people would leave their personal biases out of this.""He added: ""Whether or not she was, he was, or they were transgender is something that may come out later. But right now, eight hours after a mass shooting in a Madison school, it is of no consequence.""While Barnes’ comments appeared aimed at steering attention away from identity and toward the tragedy itself, they instead triggered fierce criticism. Many accused him of evading the question and prioritizing political correctness.Social media quickly erupted with outrage. Critics argued that Barnes’ choice to use multiple pronouns muddled the conversation.“Even in the middle of a tragedy, they’re prioritizing political correctness over facts. This is what’s wrong with society today,” one user wrote. “Why dodge the question? Understanding the shooter’s identity could help explain their motives,” another added.“The woke brigade strikes again. It’s a mass shooting, and the police chief sounds like he’s leading a sensitivity workshop,” mocked one commenter. Some users speculated that the hesitation to clarify Rupnow’s gender identity reflected a broader agenda. “They always delay when the shooter might be transgender,” one commenter claimed, citing other shootings that faced similar scrutiny.Amid the backlash, others defended Barnes, arguing that his comments had been taken out of context or constrained by legal protocols for handling minors. “He’s just following the law. You can’t release details about minors unless they’re being charged as adults,” one user explained. “Barnes didn’t say all those pronouns to confuse anyone. He meant it doesn’t matter right now, and critics are twisting his words,” another countered. Defenders also argued that focusing on gender identity detracted from the more pressing issue: the lives lost and the need for meaningful action on gun violence .As debates about pronouns intensified, the tragic reality of the shooting risked being overshadowed. The attack claimed the lives of a teacher and a student, leaving six others injured. Chaos unfolded as students sheltered in place, with a second grader reportedly placing the 911 call that brought first responders to the scene.President Joe Biden addressed the nation following the tragedy, renewing calls for stricter gun laws: ""It is unacceptable that we are unable to protect our children from the scourge of gun violence. We cannot continue to accept this as normal.""The gender identity controversy has once again exposed the deep political and cultural divides in the United States. For some, the debate symbolizes an erosion of clarity and trust.“Why do they try so hard to confuse people? It immediately makes me question their transparency,” one frustrated user remarked.Others pushed back, arguing that identity discussions served as a distraction: “The outrage over pronouns is misplaced. Children and teachers were shot—why are we talking about anything else?”The Wisconsin shooting highlights how even moments of profound grief can become entangled in divisive debates. While families mourn, the focus has shifted from addressing the root causes of gun violence to cultural conflicts over identity and language. The challenge remains: how can communities and leaders focus on solutions to prevent mass violence while avoiding polarizing debates that distract from meaningful action? As the investigation continues, Chief Barnes’ response serves as a reminder of the ongoing tension between clarity, sensitivity, and public expectations in the face of tragedy.",Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes' response to questions about the shooter's gender sparked widespread debate on social media.

Wisconsin shooting by Natalie ‘Samantha’ Rupnow joins rare category: Female mass shooters in US are ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wisconsin-shooting-by-natalie-samantha-rupnow-joins-rare-category-female-mass-shooters-in-us-just-four-in-25-years/articleshow/116453761.cms,"Fatal Wisconsin school shooting by Natalie ‘Samantha’ Rupnow sheds light on rare female mass shooters in US

The deadly shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, on Tuesday has drawn attention not only because of the tragedy it caused but also due to the rare nature of female mass shooters . Fifteen-year-old Natalie “Samantha” Rupnow opened fire at the school, killing a substitute teacher and a student before turning the gun on herself. The attack left five others injured, two of whom remain in critical condition.Rupnow’s actions are part of an alarming but rare trend. According to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), between 2000 and 2019, only 3.7% of active shooter incidents were committed by women. Similarly, a Justice Department report on mass shootings, defined as incidents with four or more victims, shows that women were responsible for just 2.3% of such attacks from 1966 to 2019.In fact, in the last 25 years, only four out of 200 mass shootings involved female perpetrators, according to the Violence Prevention Project. The rarity of female mass shooters becomes even starker when examining school shootings. Since 1999, only nine female students have committed such acts, an analysis by the Washington Post revealed.While female mass shooters are few, their motivations and behavior are often distinct from their male counterparts. Experts suggest that women tend to be less driven by personal grievances and more likely to engage in ideologically motivated attacks or collaborate in teams, reported the New York Post. However, in Rupnow’s case, authorities have found troubling signs of obsession with previous school shooters, including the Columbine tragedy.Rupnow’s social media activity and images posted on her X account showed her idolizing notorious figures like Eric Harris of Columbine and even referencing other violent incidents, including the Parkland and Jokela school shootings. Such influences have led experts to speculate that female perpetrators, while rare, may be inspired by male-dominated narratives of school violence.Jillian Peterson, founder of the Violence Prevention Project, commented on the role of copycat behavior in school shootings. ""Many school shooters study Columbine,"" Peterson told NPR. ""It’s not surprising to see patterns of influence from past incidents.""As the investigation continues, the case of Natalie Rupnow serves as a stark reminder of how rare but profoundly impactful female mass shooters can be. The tragedy challenges prevailing assumptions about the gender of those who engage in such violence, offering a critical opportunity to further study and prevent future incidents.","Wisconsin school shooting sheds light on rare female mass shooters in US.

'This bill should not pass': Elon Musk slams US govt over stopgap funding bill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/this-bill-should-not-pass-elon-musk-slams-us-govt-over-stopgap-funding-bill/articleshow/116451178.cms,"Elon Musk has expressed strong opposition regarding a stopgap government funding bill, asserting lawmakers to reject it and warning of political consequences for those who support it.The billionaire, who has close ties with President-elect Donald Trump, posted on social media X on Wednesday to voice his disagreement.“This bill should not pass,” Musk wrote on X and adding, “Any member of the House or Senate who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in two years!”He also encouraged his 200 million followers to contact their elected representatives, claiming lawmakers were trying to push the bill through without much attention.In a separate tweet, Musk further insisted that no bills should be passed until Trump officially takes office on January 20.The criticism comes at a critical moment, with Congress facing a Friday deadline to pass a spending bill or risk a government shutdown. Speaker Mike Johnson, who has been working hard to get the bill through, revealed he had spoken to Musk about his concerns.Though Trump has not publicly commented on the bill, two of his top advisers told ABC News that the former president is privately opposed to it. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Mitt Romney has urged Trump to make his position clear. “We can’t vote no on the CR and then keep the government open,” he said, referencing the bill in question.During an interview on Fox & Friends, Speaker Johnson addressed Musk’s criticism and said that he had been in touch with Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who both lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).Johnson further acknowledged the tight situation with a slim Republican majority in the House, alongside a Democratic-controlled Senate and White House. However, he also stressed that passing this bill was crucial to clearing the way for Trump’s America First agenda when the new Congress begins in January.The proposed bill includes $100 billion in disaster relief for recent hurricanes and another $10 billion to support farmers. Johnson defended the additional spending, arguing that it was necessary to help Americans impacted by natural disasters, as per the ABC News.""It was intended to be, and it was, until recent days, a very simple, very clean [continuing resolution], stopgap funding measure to get us into next year when we have unified government,"" Johnson said. ""We had these massive hurricanes in the late fall, Helene and Milton, and other disasters. We have to make sure that the Americans that were devastated by these hurricanes get the relief they need.""Texas Representative Chip Roy expressed his frustration, saying, “We’re fundamentally unserious about spending. If you can’t shrink the government, you can’t live free.” Musk also mocked the size of the bill, adding to the criticism.As the deadline approaches, Johnson remains determined to get the measure passed. He views it as a temporary fix to prevent a shutdown while ensuring disaster relief, saying, “We’ll get to March, where we can start making bigger changes.”","The billionaire, who has close ties with President-elect Donald Trump, posted on social media X on Wednesday to voice his disagreement.

World Bank goals

The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions within the time limit. The required conditions included revising the purchase power agreement in relation to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , according to The Express Tribune.The Washington-based international lender also declared that it would not be sanctioning any new budget supporting loans to the country during the current fiscal year which has sent a shock to the Pakistani economy as the country has almost exhausted its loan quota.""No budget support is planned for the current fiscal year, which ends in June 2025,"" the World Bank spokesperson stated.For this fiscal year, the IMF has identified a $2.5 billion external financing gap that needs to be addressed through new loans.The World Bank has canceled a loan of $500 to $600 million meant for Pakistan under the Affordable and Clean Energy Program (PACE-II), government sources revealed. Initially set at $500 million, the loan amount was later raised to $600 million to help address Pakistan's external financing gap, quoted news agency ANI.The PACE program was approved by the World Bank in June 2021, with the first tranche of USD 400 million already released. The second installment depended on meeting several conditions, such as holding talks with all Independent Power Producers (IPPs), especially the Chinese power plants built under CPEC. It was discovered that no progress had been made in renegotiating agreements with CPEC-related power plants as China has consistently refused to revisit these deals or restructure the energy debt, which amounts to approximately $16 billion.To reduce electricity costs, the government is renegotiating energy agreements with power plants set up under the 1994 and 2002 policies. The Chinese-owned power plants, along with several government-run plants, including four LNG-based and two nuclear plants, fall under the 2015 energy policy. Though the government has tried negotiating over 22 energy contracts yet, no significant reductions have been made in electricity prices which linger from 65 Pakistani Rupees (PKR) to 70 PKR.A spokesperson for the World Bank confirmed that ""slower-than-expected progress led to a shift in strategy in our support for reform"" in Pakistan's energy sector. The spokesperson further elaborated that the lender has been supporting power sector reforms through the PACE initiative.Even though slower progress led the World Bank to revise its lending strategy, the World Bank has continued its support by directly financing low-cost hydropower projects, including an additional $1 billion for the Dasu Hydropower project.Furthermore, the Bank has also continued working with all stakeholders to expedite the implementation of the Electricity Distribution Efficiency Improvement Project, aimed at improving efficiency in the power distribution sector. It has also offered technical assistance to promote private sector involvement in power distribution companies (DISCOs).For the ongoing fiscal year, Pakistan anticipated $2 billion in loans from the World Bank.However, by the end of the July-October period, only $349 million, 18 per cent of the planned amount, had been disbursed.Under the PACE-II program, Pakistan was expected to tackle inefficiencies in power distribution companies and reduce the growth of circular debt. However, the government has been unable to achieve either of these objectives. The government had approved a roadmap under PACE-I to encourage private sector involvement in the distribution sector, but it remained far from implementation.The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) recently reported that inefficiencies in power distribution companies led to losses of PKR 660 billion in the last fiscal year. During the same period, circular debt surged to PKR 2.393 trillion, far exceeding the targets set in agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.The successful implementation of this roadmap was essential for evaluating the progress of the power sector reform program, but it was not carried out.",The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions.

Among the detainees, the army initiated military trials against 103 accused on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military. Though Khan was released after three days, he was rearrested two months later in another corruption case and has been in jail since. There have been widespread reports that the military also plans to prosecute him under the same charges. He, however, has already been indicted by an anti-terrorism court over charges linked to the May 9 riots.The seven-member SC constitution bench was formed as a result of a controversial amendment to the constitution in Oct this year.“The final judgment of 85 persons who are under custody and facing trial before the military courts be announced and remissions admissible to the said persons be granted, and persons who can be released after remissions they be released forthwith, and persons who have to yet undergo the sentence awarded to them, their custody be handed over to the concerned jail authorities,” Friday’s court order read.The Pakistan Army Act of 1952 had established military courts, which function under a separate legal system, primarily for trial of military personnel or enemies of the state.The decision to use military courts for civilians was taken by Imran’sadversary, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during his first term in office, and was backed by the powerful military establishment.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in May 9 riots.

Respiratory illnesses soar in Pakistan as dust pollution and poverty worsen health crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/respiratory-illnesses-soar-in-pakistan-as-dust-pollution-and-poverty-worsen-health-crisis/articleshow/116262633.cms,"KARACHI: As winter sets in, there has been a noticeable rise in Pakistcitizens respiratory illnesses over the past few weeks.Experts suggest that this year's case numbers are considerably higher compared to previous years. They attribute the increase to deteriorating air quality, particularly due to severe dust pollution affecting nearly all city roads, compounded by the significant loss of green spaces as reported by Dawn.Experts also connected the rise in respiratory illnesses to the increasing poverty levels, driven by an unprecedented surge in the prices of essential food and medicine, which has significantly heightened people's susceptibility to illness and disability.Dr. Javaid Ahmed Khan, a senior professor and consultant pulmonologist at Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), explained to Dawn, ""While respiratory disease cases typically rise with the onset of winter, due to colder and drier air trapping more pollutants, this year the numbers have nearly doubled. This applies to both inpatients and outpatients.""According to the Dawn report, Dr. Khan attributed the rise in respiratory diseases to heavy dust pollution, stating, ""I believe air quality has deteriorated significantly. There is extensive roadwork throughout the city, trees are being cut down, and people continue to burn waste on the streets. There is no regulation of vehicles emitting toxic fumes.""He further explained that poor air quality heightens the risk of bronchitis by exposing individuals to pollutants such as dust, fumes, traffic emissions, and chemicals. This pollution weakens the immune system, making people more susceptible to lung infections and other illnesses.""Any type of pollution impacts the immune system, a fact supported by numerous studies. People living in polluted environments are more prone to pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections, allergic rhinitis, and even tuberculosis.""Dr. Khan explained that irritants, including particulate matter 2.5, damage the respiratory system's immune defences, which normally protect against various germs.When the immune system is compromised, the body becomes highly susceptible to infections and diseases, including cancer. He pointed out that the average diameter of human hair is about 70 micrometres, while particulate matter 2.5 consists of fine particles that are 2.5 micrometres or smaller. Additionally, Dr. Khan noted that research has linked poor air quality to a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, as these tiny particles enter the bloodstream and can block arteries.Supporting Dr. Khan's view, Dr. Abdul Ghafoor Shoro, a senior general physician practicing in Keamari, reported a 50 per cent increase in respiratory illnesses, including asthma, bronchitis, flu, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia in recent weeks.He stated, ""From Malir, Quaidabad, and Korangi to Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Mauripur, Keamari, Orangi, and Saddar, heavy dust pollution is widespread due to roadwork and construction activities. There's no way for the public to escape the pollution.""Dr. Sajjad Siddiqui, a senior general physician, emphasised that the rise in diseases is also linked to people's declining purchasing power. ""The public is living under extreme hardship, forced to drink contaminated water in areas lacking gas, with people relying on costly cylinders to cook just enough food to survive. When they fall ill, they can't afford the necessary medicines,"" he lamented.Dr. Liaquat Ali Halo, Additional Medical Superintendent at Dr. Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, reported a 25 to 30 per cent increase in respiratory illnesses, particularly among children, at the hospital's chest department.""We are seeing children with pneumonia and adults with COPD and asthma. Often, COPD patients are individuals who work in polluted environments or are smokers.""Experts recommend that people wear high-quality face masks or use cloth coverings (or helmets for those riding bikes) when outdoors, although these measures cannot fully protect against toxic air.

Bin Laden, Tehran and the Taliban



'Murdered my dreams'



PARACHINAR: Once again, Ali Ghulam receives mourners at his home -- his brother and nephew killed 40 years apart in the same sectarian conflict that was reignited this year in northwest Pakistan, claiming 200 lives since July alone.Thousands of residents are stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, as the government struggles to end clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stemming from decades-old tensions over farmland.""Our generations yearn for peace,"" 72-year-old Ghulam told AFP at his home in Parachinar, the main town and a Shiite bastion of the restive district.The latest flare-up of violence has ""reopened wounds"" he said, recalling how his brother was killed in an attack in 1987 that also wounded another three of his brothers.Kurram, known as the ""Parrot's Beak"" for its protrusion into neighbouring Afghanistan, is bounded by dizzyingly high mountains, the northern flank of which includes the Tora Bora caves where Al Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden once hid.Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for various militant groups, with militants and weapons able to flow largely unchecked in and out of Afghanistan.""I have never experienced peace in my life and have no hope my coming generations will live free of fear,"" Ghulam said.Tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan.But they can be particularly protracted and violent in the mountainous tribal northwest, where communities live by traditional codes of honour and revenge.The latest round of violence in Kurram erupted in May and intensified in July, when gunmen opened fire on a council of elders attempting to settle the latest round of disagreements over land.Various truces announced since then have held for only weeks or days at a time.More than 300 shops and over 200 homes in Sunni areas have been destroyed, often by fire, and hundreds of families have fled.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country with Shiites making up 10 to 15 percent of the population, or at least 25 million people.Members of the two sects have periodically clashed in Kurram, where Shiites are particularly vulnerable as they must pass through Sunni-majority neighbourhoods to access essential services.Kurram's location on the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan put it at the heart of the religious and political upheavals of the last five decades.In 1979, Shiites led a revolution in Iran and later that year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, prompting Sunni hardliners there to rise up against them.Pakistan's military ruler Zia-ul-Haq aligned with them, funnelling thousands of Sunni militants into Afghanistan through Kurram.""It became a hub for arms supply to Afghanistan, including landmines, mortar shells, and weapons of all kinds. Every household in Kurram had a stockpile of weapons,"" Malik Attaullah Khan, a local tribal elder told AFP.Khan, who signed a 2007 agreement aimed at bringing peace to Kurram, criticised the government for failing to ""fulfil in its responsibilities"" in enforcing land settlements.The ethnic Pashtun heartland was merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, but the Pakistani state maintains limited control in the merged districts.In rural areas of Pakistan, villages often bypass the formal justice system and men-only ""jirgas"" or councils made up of respected village elders resolve disputes, sometimes in the form of fines or land reallocation.Ghulam's nephew was killed along with at least 42 others last month, when Sunni gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Shiites being escorted by the police to their homes.In retaliation, a market in a Sunni-dominated area was set on fire.Syed Ghani Shah told AFP his cousin was burned to death inside his shop.""When we buried him, he was so unrecognisable that we couldn't even let his parents see his face,"" Shah said.""Can we ever make peace after all this? Never, if we ever get the chance, we will surely avenge our blood,"" he warned.Authorities have enforced curfews and road closures to reduce the chances of violence breaking out, providing escorts through high-risk areas and using helicopters to deliver supplies.But Akbar Khan, a representative of Pakistan's independent Human Rights Commission told AFP that the state needs to do more to resolve the issue.""In the past, jirgas were successful because they had the full support of the state. Now, the authorities don't even provide the expenses needed to hold a jirga,"" he said.Fatima Ahmed's husband was killed last month while travelling to Islamabad to arrange her admission to medical college.""I don't want to live a life without him. I've lost my will to exist,"" the 21-year-old told AFP.""They haven't just martyred my husband -- they've also murdered my dreams with him,"" she said, bursting into tears.",Violence in northwest Pakistan has killed 200 people since July. Clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stem from decades-old tensions over farmland. Residents stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district. Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for militant groups.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116233302,imgsize-616661,width-400,resizemode-4/116233302.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world in Oct, revealed data shared by Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index on Monday.Since Mid-July, internet users in Pakistan have reported frequent slowdowns and persistent connectivity challenges in the country, causing widespread disruptions to browsing and media sharing.The global index placed Pakistan at 100 out of 111 countries in mobile internet speeds, and 141 out of 158 countries in broadband speeds.The country’s regular internet interruptions were accompanied by reports of restricted access to virtual private networks (VPNs), which many Pakistanis use to access X and other restricted websites.According to the World Population Review, which analysed data from Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index and Cable, Pakistan’s average download speed was 7.85 MBPS, with a median mobile download speed of 19.59 MBPS and a median broadband download speed of 15.52 MBPS.Internet service providers and the business community blamed the slump in services on the govt’s installation of a Chinese-built national internet firewall, a combination of hardware and software used by authorities to control and monitor internet traffic, acting as a digital gatekeeper that decides what data to allow or block.The national firewall, also being installed on servers of major internet providers, has the capability to detect and slow digital communication between individual users.Last month, Pakistan home ministry had sought a ban on unregulated use of VPNs, citing their use by terrorists to “facilitate violent activities” and to “access pornographic and blasphemous content”.“VPNs are increasingly being exploited by terrorists to facilitate violent activities and financial transactions in Pakistan,” the ministry said in a letter to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).","Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world.

"Pakistan's ISI pushes drug addicts as terror couriers in Indian jails, say officials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-isi-pushes-drug-addicts-as-terror-couriers-in-indian-jails-say-officials/articleshow/116116037.cms,"During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India to utilise them to deliver critical messages to hardcore terrorists incarcerated in the country's prisons. Officials said that more than 10 such cases have been reported since July this year in which Pakistani nationals have entered India from their country and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Many of them have been sent to prisons in Jammu, Punjab and Rajasthan.The officials said security agencies suspect these individuals are Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) couriers tasked with relaying important communication to the jailed terrorists wherever possible.Interrogation of these individuals typically shows that they have been trained in resistance techniques to withstand questioning by security personnel.The behaviour displayed by those apprehended has raised suspicions among officials, who suggest that their superficial details and evasive responses indicate a potentially larger agenda behind their infiltration, possibly stemming from the fear of repercussions from their handlers.They explained that the use of mobile phones and the internet leaves behind electronic footprints that could expose the plans of both state and non-state actors operating across the border. As a result, the ISI has adopted this new modus operandi.The infiltration strategy reportedly includes women and minors, who may also serve as couriers. In a notable incident in July, a minor from Pakistan's Attock was intercepted in Punjab.During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said.The ISI's infiltration tactics have been linked to drug smuggling operations. In one case from Bijnour village in Rajasthan, a Pakistani national posing as mentally disturbed finally spilled the beans during intense questioning that he had been hired by two drug lords in Pakistan -- Sarfaraz Johiya and Nawaz -- to facilitate narcotics trafficking into India and gather information on the deployment of Border Security Force (BSF) troops.In another recent incident, a Pakistani youth named Mohammed Asad from Lahore drove to the zero line on his motorcycle and seemingly awaited arrest by the BSF. During interrogation, he claimed to have had a family dispute over his girlfriend.The officials noted that Asad, who was subsequently moved to prison, may have been acting as a courier. Security agencies have requested additional custody for extended interrogation.In October, a 31-year-old man who identified himself as Shahid Imran entered India through the Jammu sector, claiming that he wanted to visit a Kali temple to get married.The officials explained that such infiltrators are generally booked under the Foreigners Act and Passports Act, for which the punishment ranges from two years to eight years in prison and following this, they are deported.They said that in the late-1990s and early-2000s, ISI exploited the Samjhauta Express, the rail link between India and Pakistan, for covert courier operations, employing individuals known as ""sawari operators"".This service continued until February 2019, when the train service was halted.The ""sawari operators"" played a crucial role in smuggling drugs and transporting funds intended to finance terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, as well as Punjab.However, following a significant crackdown by authorities, these operations were effectively curtailed, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of numerous individuals involved in such activities.Recent developments suggest that the ISI's current method of sending couriers mirrors these past tactics.The officials said that the infiltration strategies being employed now are reminiscent of the past, as the agency seeks new ways to bypass law enforcement and deliver crucial communication and resources across the border.","Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries.

Bangladesh reduces ULFA leader's death sentence in weapons smuggling case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-reduces-ulfa-leaders-death-sentence-in-weapons-smuggling-case/articleshow/116442037.cms,"Representative image/Agencies

NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh high court on Wednesday reduced the death sentence of ULFA leader Paresh Baruah to life imprisonment in a 2004 case involving the attempted smuggling of weapons to the separatist United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA).The court also acquitted a former junior minister and five others. Baruah, reportedly residing in China, had been sentenced to death in absentia in 2014. His name appears on India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) ""most wanted"" list.In 2011, ULFA split into two factions. The pro-talk group, led by Arabinda Rajkhowa, chose to return to Assam from ""abroad"" and engage in peace negotiations. In contrast, the other faction, ULFA (Independent), led by commander Paresh Baruah, rejected the idea of negotiations.The case dates back to April 1, 2004, when authorities in Chattogram (then called Chittagong) seized ten truckloads of weapons from the premises of the Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Limited (CUFL) jetty. The consignment was reportedly intended to be transported through Bangladesh to ULFA hideouts across the border in India.The seized weapons included over 27,000 grenades, 150 rocket launchers, 1,100 submachine guns, 11.41 million bullets, and over 11 lakh rounds of ammunition.The high court bench of Justice Mostafa Zaman Islam and Justice Nasrin Akhtar commuted Baruah's death sentence to life imprisonment. The bench also acquitted Bangladesh's former state minister for home affairs Lutfuzzaman Babar and six others, who had earlier received capital punishment.The acquitted individuals include former DGFI (a defence intelligence agency of Bangladesh) director-general retired major general Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury, former managing director of Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Limited (CUFL) Mohsin Talukder, its general manager Enamul Hoque, former industries ministry additional secretary Nurul Amin, and Jamaat-e-Islami leader Motiur Rahman Nizami.The weapons were reportedly intended for ULFA and were being moved through a jetty managed by CUFL, a state-run fertilizer plant. Among those previously sentenced to death was Abdur Rahim, a former DGFI director and retired brigadier general, who passed away in prison before his appeal could be heard. Nizami, also a former minister, was executed several years ago for crimes against humanity committed during Bangladesh’s 1971 Liberation War.Babar’s lawyer, Shishir Manir, argued that Babar had been falsely implicated in the case for political reasons, and the prosecution failed to present credible evidence or reliable witnesses. Babar was also sentenced in a separate case involving a 2004 grenade attack targeting Sheikh Hasina, who was then the opposition leader. However, a high court bench acquitted him in that case earlier this month.The arms haul case remained dormant for years during the BNP-led government, where Jamaat-e-Islami was a coalition partner. Reports suggested that police officers involved in the seizure faced harassment, and efforts were made to suppress the investigation. The military-backed interim government in 2008 ordered a re-investigation amid these allegations. The extended probe revealed that officials from the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) and the National Security Intelligence (NSI) oversaw the arms shipment. Chinese firm NORINCO was identified as the manufacturer of the weapons, though investigators could not trace the ship that transported the consignment to Bangladesh.In 2014, a special tribunal in Chattogram convicted 14 people, including Baruah, Babar, and Nizami, sentencing them to death. The court ruled that the consignment was part of an elaborate plan to arm ULFA militants.",Bangladesh high court reduces death sentence of ULFA leader Paresh Baruah to life imprisonment.

Sri Lanka wins agreement with IMF for tax relief: President Dissanayake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sri-lanka-wins-agreement-with-imf-for-tax-relief-president-dissanayake/articleshow/116436701.cms,"COLOMBO: President Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Wednesday announced that Sri Lanka has achieved flexibility with the IMF on its rigid state revenue tax regime, something that was part of his election promise. Also, import of private cars -- banned from 2020 -- would be allowed from February 2025, Dissanayake, who is also the Minister of Finance, told the parliament.Speaking about the agreements reached with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during its third review of the USD 2.9 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF), the president said his government has been able to raise the tax threshold.""We have been able to raise the tax threshold of pay as you earn (PAYE tax) so that those who have bigger incomes pay more while those who earn pay less,"" Dissanayake said, adding there would be other VAT exemptions and withholding tax on interest incomes for the retired.""An income of Rs 1,50,000 per month will be tax free,"" Dissanayake said referring to the current free amount upto only Rs 1,00,000.Fresh from his return from an official visit to India, Dissanayake said the ban on vehicle imports would be gradually lifted.""From December 14, we have allowed the importation of the first category - vehicles for passenger transport and cars for special purposes.""From February 2025 all imports of private cars would be allowed.Sri Lanka had stopped vehicle imports from 2020 during the Covid19 outbreak due to the dwindling foreign reserves.With the economic recovery through the IMF bail out since 2023, the IMF had allowed vehicle imports by preventing any adverse impact on the need to build forex reserves.He said all such proposals would be incorporated in the 2025 budget to be presented in mid-February.There will be concessions to improve the small and medium scale industries for whom there will be debt restructuring relief based on a cap of the loan amounts.Dissanayake's government has just concluded its third review of the IMF bail out and is awaiting the fourth tranche of the nearly USD 3 billion facility.Sri Lanka had on November 26 announced that it has ratified the agreement for debt restructuring for USD 14.2 billion, compulsory to maintain debt sustainability by the IMF through an exchange of new bonds for the existing bonds.A week prior to it, the National People's Power (NPP) government got the IMF approval for a staff-level agreement to secure the fourth tranche of the nearly USD 3 billion bailout package, something that President Dissanayake backed despite his pre-presidential election rhetoric to renegotiate with the global lender to water down tough conditions.The NPP was highly critical of the cost recovery based utility tariffs and high taxes, which came conditional to the bail out.The debt restructuring agreement was reached in the last week of the then President Ranil Wickremesinghe's regime in September, days before the presidential polls.He highlighted that the exchange would provide substantial debt relief, free resources for development and ensure long-term fiscal stability.Sri Lanka had plunged into an economic crisis when the island nation declared sovereign default in mid-April of 2022, its first since gaining independence from Britain in 1948. Almost civil-war-like conditions and months of public protests led to the fleeing of the then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa.Wickremesinghe took over and the negotiations with the IMF began soon after. His government then clinched the bailout a year later in March 2023.As of July 2024, Sri Lanka's external debt stood at a total of USD 37 billion, which includes USD 10.6 billion in bilateral credit and USD 11.7 billion in multilateral credit. The commercial debt was USD 14.7 billion, of which USD 12.5 billion is in sovereign bonds.","Sri Lanka has achieved flexibility with the IMF on its rigid state revenue tax regime.

"Bangladesh high court commutes ULFA leader's death sentence, acquits ex-minister in attempted weapon smuggling case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-high-court-commutes-ulfa-leaders-death-sentence-acquits-ex-minister-in-attempted-weapon-smuggling-case/articleshow/116432879.cms,"DHAKA: A Bangladeshi High Court on Wednesday commuted the death sentence of ULFA leader Paresh Barua to life imprisonment and acquitted a former junior minister and five others in a 2004 case of attempted smuggling of weapons to the separatist outfit in northeast India. A total of 10 truckloads of weapons were seized in April 2004 despite alleged efforts of certain ""influential quarters"" for its safe passage to United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) hideouts in northeastern India through Chattogram, which was then spelled as 'Chittagong'.The seized weapons included over 27,000 grenades, 150 rocket launchers, over 11 lakh ammunition, 1,100 sub machine guns and 11.41 million bullets.The two-member High Court bench commuted the punishment of ULFA leader Paresh Barua, who was sentenced to death after a trial in absentia --- now assumed to be living in China --- and sentenced him to life imprisonment, said a government attorney at the bench.The High Court bench comprising Justice Mostafa Zaman Islam and Justice Nasrin Akhtar acquitted former state minister for home Lutfuzzaman Babar and six others, who were handed down capital punishment following the death reference hearing, he added.The five others to escape the gallows are former director general of forces Intelligence (DGFI) retired major general Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury, former managing director of a state-run fertilizer plant (CUFL) Mohsin Talukder, its general manager Enamul Hoque, former additional secretary of industries ministry Nurul Amin and Jamaat-e-Islami leader Motiur Rahman Nizami.The plant site was said to have been used for trans-shipment of weapons for ULFA.Former chief of Bangladesh 's National Security Intelligence ex-brigadier general Abdur Rahim, a former DGFI director as well, was also sentenced to death but he died a normal death in prison as the appeal and death hearing process was underway.Nizami, a former minister in the past Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-Jamaat alliance government, however, was hanged several years ago on charges of crimes against humanity during Bangladesh's 1971 Liberation War siding with the Pakistani troops while his party was opposed to the country's independence.Babar's lawyer Shishir Manir earlier told the bench that his client had been falsely implicated in the case for political reasons and the prosecution could not produce any credible evidence or trustworthy witness in support of the charges brought against him.The former junior minister was also sentenced over a 2004 grenade attack on the now deposed prime minister and the then opposition leader Sheikh Hasina and her top party leaders when 24 people were killed and hundreds wounded but another High Court bench acquitted him after death reference hearing on December 1.Earlier on January 30, 2014, a special tribunal in the northeastern port city of Chattogram handed down the death penalty to 14 people, including two former ministers of the past BNP government, two ex-army generals and a top ULFA leader in the arms haul case.The trial or lower court verdict had come nearly a decade after the accidental seizure of 10 truck loads of smuggled-in weapons destined to the ULFA hideouts in northeastern India through Bangladesh territory.The two politicians to get the capital punishment were Babar and Nizami, the former Jamaat ameer and then industries minister in the same cabinet, while ULFA's fugitive military wing chief Barua was one of the convicts to be awarded the death penalty.But the case was shelved for years during the past BNP-led four-party government with Jamaat being the key-ally while police officers who seized the weapons were allegedly exposed to professional harassment.The subsequent military-backed interim regime in 2008 ordered the re-investigation amid allegations that there was a deliberate attempt on the part of the then administration to suppress facts to weaken the case.The supplementary chargesheet said the weapons were brought for ULFA under the supervision of some DGFI and NSI officials while the consignment was unloaded at a government jetty in Chittagong to be reloaded in trucks destined for northeastern frontiers.Officials familiar with the investigation said their extended probe found Chinese firm NORINCO to have produced the weapons but they could not identify the ship that carried the illegal consignment to Bangladesh territory.","A Bangladeshi High Court on Wednesday commuted the death sentence of ULFA leader Paresh Barua to life imprisonment.

Bangladesh HC gives legal validity to Yunus govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-hc-gives-legal-validity-to-yunus-govt/articleshow/116414228.cms,"Bangladesh HC restores caretaker govt system & referendum provision

DHAKA: The Bangladesh HC scrapped on Tuesday a section of 15th Amendment Act of the Constitution, which had abolished the non-party caretaker govt system, even as it clarified that current Yunus-led interim govt does not fall in this category, reports Ahsan Tasnim. The HC also reinstated the provision for holding referendums on constitutional amendments.Giving Yunus's interim govt legal validity, the HC said it is ""totally different"" as it was formed by the president after he sought the opinion of the appellate division of the Supreme Court.The Bangladesh high court scrapped on Tuesday a section of the 15th Amendment Act of the constitution, which had abolished the non-party caretaker govt system, even as it clarified that the current Yunus-led interim govt does not fall in this category.Also, in a significant step, the court revived the provision of holding referendums in case of bringing any amendment to the constitution.Giving Yunus's interim govt legal validity, the HC said it is ""totally different"" as it was formed by the president after he sought the opinion of the appellate division of the Supreme Court under Article 106 of Bangladesh's constitution. Article 106 says: ""If at any time it appears to the President that a question of law has arisen, or is likely to arise, which is of such a nature and of such public importance that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of the Supreme Court upon it, he may refer the question to the appellate division for consideration and the division may, after such hearing as it thinks fit, report its opinion thereon to the President.""The HC ruled that abolishing the non-party caretaker govt system was unconstitutional and void as it undermined democracy, free and fair elections, and judicial independence - fundamental pillars of the constitution's basic structure. The court remarked that restoration of the caretaker govt system will pave the way for holding elections under a non-partisan govt.Tuesday's verdict scrapped the parts of the 15th Amendment Act, which scrapped the 13th amendment that had introduced the non-party caretaker govt system in 1996, and brought significant changes to the charter. The court, however, did not interfere with the provisions of the 15th Amendment Act that deal with state principles, including secularism, socialism, state region, nationalism, Father of the Nation, and number of reserved seats for women in parliament, saying that future govts will take decisions on these issues.BNP said the restoration of the caretaker govt system fulfilled people's expectations. The party alleged Hasina had scrapped the system to serve her party's interests, paving the way for ""one-party rule"".","Bangladesh HC scrapped section of 15th Amendment Act of the Constitution.

NEW DELHI: Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Monday assured Prime Minister Narendra Modi that Sri Lanka would not permit its territory to be ""used in any way, in a manner that is detrimental to the interest of India.Following discussions at Hyderabad House in New Delhi, Dissanayake emphasised his commitment to strengthening Indo-Sri Lankan relations, saying, ""the cooperation with India will certainly flourish and I want to reassure our continued support for India.""""I have also given an assurance to the Prime Minister of India that we will not allow our land to be used in any way in a manner that is detrimental to the interest of India. The cooperation with India will certainly flourish and I want to reassure our continued support for India,"" he assured.On his inaugural foreign visit since taking office in September, the Sri Lankan president expressed pleasure at choosing Delhi for his first state visit. The three-day tour marked a significant diplomatic engagement between the nations.""After becoming the President of Sri Lanka, this is my first foreign visit. I am so happy that I was able to come to Delhi on my first State visit. I want to thank India for the invitation extended to me and also for the warm hospitality that was extended to the whole delegation, including myself,"" he said.Dissanayake expressed gratitude for India's hospitality and the invitations from PM Modi and President Murmu. He highlighted how the visit strengthened bilateral cooperation between the two nations.""I want to thank PM Modi and President Murmu. This visit paved the way for the cooperation between the two countries to be developed further,"" he added.He acknowledged India's crucial support during Sri Lanka's recent economic crisis, saying, “we faced an unprecedented economic crisis some 2 years ago and India supported us immensely to come out of that quagmire. It has also helped us immensely after that, especially in the debt-free structuring process.""The Sri Lankan President highlighted India's commitment to his country, noting PM Modi's assurances regarding full support and protection of Sri Lanka's territorial integrity and sovereignty.“I know that Sri Lanka secures a very significant place in the foreign policy of India. PM Modi assured us full support and he also assured us that he will always protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Sri Lanka,” he added.The assurance from Sri Lankan president came at a crucial point as China is intensifying its presence in the Indian Ocean region, particularly targeting Indian interests.China's control over Hambantota Port, acquired through Sri Lanka's debt default, has enabled Beijing to station vessels like the Yuan Wang 5, a 25,000-tonne satellite and missile tracking ship. This development concerns India due to Sri Lanka's geographical proximity.Despite India's initial objections in August 2022, Sri Lanka eventually permitted Chinese vessels to dock for 'replenishment' at Hambantota.Meanwhile, Chinese surveillance vessels keep on patrolling the Indian Ocean region and using the Hambantota port.China secured a 99-year lease on Hambantota port after Sri Lanka struggled with loan repayments. The $1.7 billion project, with phase one completed in 2010, required annual payments of $100 million, which Colombo failed to meet.","Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Monday assured Prime Minister Narendra Modi that Sri Lanka would not permit its territory to be ""used in any way, in a manner that is detrimental to the interest of India"" The assurance came at a crucial point as China is intensifying its presence in the Indian Ocean region.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116373305,imgsize-1196617,width-400,resizemode-4/116373305.jpg"

US extends $1 billion in military support to Ukraine ahead of Trump inauguration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-extends-1-billion-in-military-support-to-ukraine-ahead-of-trump-inauguration/articleshow/116093429.cms,"The United States will provide nearly USD 1 billion in long-term weapons support to Ukraine , defence secretary Lloyd Austin announced on Saturday.The Biden administration is expediting the spending of remaining congressionally approved funds to support Kyiv before President-elect Donald Trump assumes office. The new package includes drones and HIMARS munitions , funded through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative for future military capabilities.A separate USD 725 million military aid package, announced on Monday, comprises counter-drone systems and HIMARS munitions from Pentagon stockpiles for immediate battlefield deployment. Since Russia's February 2022 invasion, US military aid to Ukraine has exceeded USD 62 billion.Austin acknowledged the upcoming transition, stating ""The baton will soon be passed"".

And the Contact Group has helped ensure that Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself—and to forge a future force to deter more Russian aggression,"" he said.""And I've convened the Contact Group 24 times now. Its other members have committed more than $57 billion in direct security assistance to Ukraine.

'Assad has left Damascus'



Hezbollah withdraws forces from Damascus outskirts, Homs



Intense gunfire sounds in Damascus



'Assad is gone, Homs is free'



'This is not our fight'



Doha diplomacy

Syrian rebel forces have reached Damascus as the capital city's defence forces collapsed and intense gunfire sounds were heard as reported by multiple residents of the city. This comes after the rebels captured Homs and Aleppo posing a threat to the 24-year-old rule of President Bashar Assad.“Militarily, Damascus has fallen,” a source familiar with the rebels told CNN.The recent advances by opposition factions, including a significant push by a group with roots in al-Qaida, are among the largest in years.This group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which is designated as a terrorist organization by both the US and the United Nations, has made substantial progress in its efforts to overthrow Assad's government. The insurgents have faced minimal resistance from the Syrian army during their offensive.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad boarded a plane and left Damascus for an undisclosed location on Sunday, according to two senior army officers.However, this comes only a day after his office said that the president Bashar al-Assad was still carrying out his duties from Damascus, rejecting reports that he had fled as rebels moved closer to the capital.Hezbollah has withdrawn its forces from the outskirts of Damascus and the Homs region, according to a source close to the Lebanese group.The group ""has instructed its fighters in recent hours to withdraw from the Homs area, with some heading to Latakia (in Syria) and others to the Hermel area in Lebanon"", AFP reported quoting a source, and noted that ""Hezbollah fighters have also vacated their positions around Damascus.""Intense gunfire was heard in the center of Damascus on Sunday, as rebels advanced towards the Syrian capital, according to two residents living near the city's heart, Reuters reported.The source of the shooting remained unclear. Meanwhile, Syrian rebels claimed full control of the strategic city of Homs after just one day of fighting.Syrian rebels announced they had taken full control of the crucial city of Homs early on Sunday after just one day of fighting, further threatening President Bashar al-Assad’s 24-year rule as insurgents advanced on the capital, Damascus.As the army withdrew, thousands of Homs residents filled the streets, celebrating with chants of ""Assad is gone, Homs is free"" and ""Long live Syria, down with Bashar al-Assad.""Rebels fired into the air in triumph, while youths tore down posters of the Syrian president, marking a dramatic week-long collapse of Assad's territorial control.US President-elect Donald Trump said that the US had nothing to do with the conflict in Syria as the latter ""was not a friend.""""Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!,"" Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.Trump said that Russia, distracted by its war in Ukraine, ""seems incapable of stopping this literal march through Syria, a country they have protected for years."" He suggested that if Russia were forced out of Syria, it ""may actually be the best thing that can happen to them"" because ""there was never much of a benefit in Syria for Russia.""The foreign ministers of Iran, Russia, and Turkey, meeting in Qatar, called for an end to the ongoing hostilities. Turkey, a key supporter of the rebels, participated in the discussions.“Assad didn’t seize this opportunity to start engaging and restoring his relationship with his people,” Qatar's top diplomat, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said, AP reported.He expressed surprise at the rapid advance of the rebels, warning that there is a serious threat to Syria's ""territorial integrity."" He cautioned that without urgent action to initiate a political process, the war could ""damage and destroy what remains"" of the country.","Syrian rebel forces have reached Damascus as the capital city's defence forces collapsed and intense gunfire sounds were heard.

Brian Thompson murder case: NYPD divers search lake for murder weapon as manhunt enters fourth day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/brian-thompson-murder-case-nypd-divers-search-lake-for-murder-weapon-as-manhunt-enters-fourth-day/articleshow/116092591.cms,"'Net is tightening'



Police probing whether special gun used to kill Thompson



Suspect uses false identity



In the UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson murder case , after finding the suspect's bag, the NYPD divers searched Central Park's Lake on Saturday for the weapon used, whilst the manhunt enters its fourth day.The search was concentrated near the park's boathouse and Bethesda Fountain. Investigators still seek two crucial pieces of evidence: the suspect's electric bicycle and the murder weapon.Authorities discovered a backpack in the park on Friday evening, which is undergoing forensic analysis in Queens. Officials confirmed the backpack contained no firearm but included a Tommy Hilfiger jacket, CNN reported.The NYPD is receiving assistance from federal investigators to analyse evidence, including the backpack, photographs, video footage, ammunition, and DNA samples. They believe the suspect has left the city.The FBI has announced a $50,000 reward for information leading to arrest and conviction, whilst the NYPD offers an additional $10,000 reward.Officials believe the suspect, who arrived in New York via Greyhound from Atlanta last month, has departed the city by interstate bus. NYPD detectives have travelled to Atlanta to advance the investigation, with support from local police.Mayor Eric Adams highlighted the backpack discovery as a positive development, stating they would identify and apprehend the suspect.“The net is tightening,” Mayor Adams told reporters at a Police Athletic League holiday party in Harlem on Saturday.Mayor Adams declined to say whether investigators already had the suspect’s name when asked at a Harlem event.“We don’t want to release that now,” Adams said. “If we do, we are basically giving a tip to the person we are seeking and we do not want to give him an upper hand at all. Let him continue to believe he can hide behind the mask. We revealed his face. We’re going to reveal who he is and we’re going to bring him to justice.”Investigators are scrutinising surveillance images of an unmasked individual released on Thursday. Commissioner Jessica Tisch reported substantial evidence collection, including fingerprints and extensive CCTV footage of the suspect's movements.Chief Detective Joseph Kenny indicated they're investigating whether a specialised weapon was used. Border authorities on both Canadian and Mexican frontiers have been alerted.Cops are probing whether the weapon used was a “veterinary” gun commonly used to euthanize animals, an NYPD official said, New York Post reported.The murder weapon used in the assassination of Thompson “appears to be a larger handgun” similar to the style of a veterinary gun , NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said.“It’s a weapon commonly used on farms and ranches. If an animal has to get put down, the animal can be shot without causing a loud noise,” Kenny explained Friday, but the lead proved a dead end, sources told The Post.The weapon is believed to be a modernized version of a World War-II style gun called a Welrod, sources said. Modern versions of the firearm are known as VP-9 or Station 6.The suspect reportedly used false identification to book accommodation at an Upper West Side hostel after arriving on November 24. Evidence includes hostel photographs, a disposable phone, and a water bottle from the crime scene.Ammunition recovered bore the words ""delay,"" ""deny"" and ""depose,"" potentially linking to insurance industry criticism. UnitedHealth Group has implemented enhanced security measures for staff following the incident.","Police probing whether special gun used to kill UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was euthanized.

'Vandals set ablaze idols': Iskcon Namhatta centre burnt down in Bangladesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/vandals-set-ablaze-idols-iskcon-namhatta-centre-burnt-down-in-bangladesh/articleshow/116072158.cms,"(File photo)

The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon) alleged on Saturday that its centre in Dhaka district, Bangladesh, was set on fire in a targeted attack early in the day. Iskcon Kolkata vice president Radharamn Das told PTI that the attack targeted members of the community and the Vaishnavite order, with ""vandals set ablaze idols inside the temple at the Namhatta property."""" Iskcon Namhatta Centre burned down in Bangladesh. The deities of Sri Sri Laxmi Narayan and all items inside the temple were burned down completely The centre is located in Dhaka. Early morning today, between 2-3 AM, miscreants set fire to the Shri Shri Radha Krishna Temple and the Shri Shri Mahabhagya Lakshmi Narayan Temple, which fall under the Hare Krishna Namhatta Sangha , located in Dhour village, under the jurisdiction of Turag Police Station, Dhaka district,"" Das said in a post on X.He alleged that the perpetrators lifted the tin roof at the back of the temple and used petrol or octane to initiate the fire.“Despite our repeated appeals to the interim government in Bangladesh, little is being done by the police and administration to address these targeted attacks,” he added.While pointing out the broader safety concerns for Hindus in the South Asian nation, Das said, ""Iskcon India has expressed concern about the safety of Hindus in Bangladesh and urged its monks and followers from Bangladesh not to wear 'tilaks' and practice their faith discreetly. The targeted attacks continue.""Das also raised alarm over the safety of Hindu community leader Chinmoy Krishna Das, who has been denied bail and remains in custody amid escalating violence.Since the formation of the interim government and the dislodging of the Awami League in August, Iskcon properties have reportedly been under attack at multiple locations across Bangladesh.Meanwhile, Radharaman Das told news agency ANI that, ""The head of the interim government of Bangladesh held a meeting with the heads of religious minorities. We were hoping that the situation would change after the meeting but what we are seeing is something entirely different... I am regularly receiving threatening videos of ultimatums being given to ban Iskcon in the country, otherwise, they will go on killing Iskcon devotees.""Condemning the incident, West Bengal BJP president and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar took to X, saying, “Strongly condemn the horrific arson attack on the Iskcon Namhatta Centre in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which destroyed the deities of Sri Sri Laxmi Narayan and sacred temple items. This is an unforgivable act of hatred against a place of worship.” Majumdar called for immediate action to bring the perpetrators to justice and ensure the safety of religious minorities in Bangladesh.Meanwhile, external affairs minister Jaishankar earlier had said that Indian government takes attacks on minorities in Bangladesh seriously and has conveyed its concerns to Dhaka.“The government has seen several reports of incidents of violence against Hindus and other minorities, their homes and business establishments, and of attacks on temples/ religious places, including in the month of August 2024, across Bangladesh,” he said adding that the ""government has taken a serious note of these incidents and shared its concerns with the Government of Bangladesh.”","Iskcon's centre in Dhaka district, Bangladesh, was set on fire in a targeted attack.

US Tiktok Ban: TikTok faces looming ban in US as appeals court upholds divestment law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tiktok-faces-looming-ban-in-us-as-appeals-court-upholds-divestment-law/articleshow/116054242.cms,"TikTok faces looming ban in US as appeals court upholds divestment law (Picture credit: AP)

Contested future for TikTok

Political dynamics

Implications for tech landscape

A US federal appeals court has upheld a law requiring ByteDance, the China-based parent company of TikTok, to divest its US operations by January 19, 2025, or face a nationwide ban on the app.The decision, delivered on Friday, intensifies the platform's legal and operational challenges while escalating tensions between the United States and China.The ruling by a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia was described as a significant victory for the Justice Department, which has long argued that TikTok poses a national security threat.The court stated that the divestment law passed with bipartisan support, was designed to protect US national security interests against potential threats from China's influence over the app.TikTok, which boasts 170 million users in the United States, is expected to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.The company argues that the divestment law infringes on First Amendment rights and constitutes censorship. ""The Supreme Court has a strong track record of defending Americans' free speech, and we are confident they will uphold this principle in our case,"" TikTok said in a statement.The law prohibits app stores and internet hosting services from offering TikTok after the deadline unless ByteDance sells its US operations.While ByteDance has denied allegations of sharing data with the Chinese government, US officials have raised concerns over data security and potential manipulation of information on the platform.The decision leaves the ultimate enforcement of the ban in the hands of President Joe Biden, who could grant a 90-day extension if significant progress is made toward a sale, and President-elect Donald Trump, who will take office the day after the January 19 deadline.Trump, who attempted to ban TikTok in 2020, has since reversed his stance, expressing opposition to a ban during his recent presidential campaign.The ruling is already drawing criticism from free speech advocates. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) called the decision ""flawed and dangerous,"" arguing it sets a troubling precedent for censorship.If enforced, the ban could significantly reshape the social media landscape, benefiting rivals such as Meta and Alphabet's YouTube. Meta's shares surged following the ruling, reflecting investor optimism about reduced competition in the online advertising space.Despite the uncertainty, TikTok has continued to expand its US operations, including reporting $100 million in Black Friday sales through its e-commerce venture.However, analysts warn that a ban could disrupt content creators and businesses dependent on the platform while deepening the rift in US-China relations.As the deadline looms, all eyes are on the Supreme Court and the incoming administration to determine TikTok's fate in the United States.","Appeals court upholds law requiring ByteDance to sell US operations by January 19, 2025.

""He's a grown, young man. I am very proud of him, his knowledge and even in politics -- giving advice to his father. He brought in so many young people of his generation... because nowadays the young generation doesn't sit in front of the TV anymore; they are all on the tablets, on their phones. It's incredible how Barron brought in success as he knew exactly who his father needed to contact and to talk to,"" Melania said. Barron's behind-the-scene role in the election was much discussed as Donald Trump used to ask his team to check with Barron whenever they had any podcast request.Melania also reacted to Barron's childhood video which recently went viral as social media users marvelled at how Barron grew up so quickly between his father's previous term and this term. Melania said she feels that video was taken only a few months ago.On the incoming Trump administration, Melania said the atmosphere this time, the people around Donald Trump this time are different. ""I hope the country will be united. I am always against violence. I think nothing is accomplished by violence,"" Melania said on how the rhetoric has changed from the time of the assassination attempt on him to now as he is now readying to enter the White House for the second time.In a funny reaction to Trump's dance, Melania said it is a very special and unique dance that people are now enjoying and copying but she made sure to mention that she does not dance like that. And she never did Trump dance, nor taught him any of the moves, Melania said. ""He's coming alone on his own,"" Melania said.As Barron Trump has been away from New York since his father's re-election, he has not been able to normally interact with his fellow students.

UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty responded to the social media celebration following the murder of Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, and called it absolutely inappropriate, aggressive and highly disrespectful. UnitedHealth Group is the mother company and UnitedHealthcare is the health benefits business of UnitedHealth Group.50-year-old Brian Thompson was killed by a masked man in front of an NYC hotel. The killer has not yet been nabbed but according to NYPD investigators, the killer might be a disgruntled former staff or customer. Social media users, including doctors, journalists celebrated the murder of Thompson and started calling the murderer a 'hero' as they recounted their experience of being denied the insurance payout by the company that endangered many lives.In his address to the company staff, which was an internal video, Witty said, ""You’ve seen a lot of media interest in this situation with a huge amount of misinformation and frankly offensive communication...People are writing things we simply don’t recognize...""""I'd like to give you little bit of advice around the media…My strong advice and request to everybody is just don't engage with the media. If you're approached, I would recommend not responding and, if necessary, simply refer them to our own media organization.”UnitedHealthcate's website removed Brian Thompson's photo and bio from the site. Many other healthcare companies followed the same and pre-emptively removed photos and bios of their top leaders as Thimpson's death terrified executives of health insurance companies.The brazen murder and the unabashed celebration of it on social media caught everyone by surprise as it reflected the public rage against the healthcare industry. According to experts, the killer might not be a professional hitman as his firing did not look professional; but it was not an act of momentary rage. Investigators said it was a premeditated murder as the killer was well aware of Brian Thompson's movement. The shell casings of the bullets that he fired had three words engraved on them: deny, defend and depose -- a tactic health insurance companies deploy to reject insurance claims.","50-year-old Brian Thompson was killed by a masked man in front of an NYC hotel.

These iconic shoes, integral to Dorothy's enchanting adventure, were stolen nearly 20 years ago but were eventually recovered.The auction attracted significant attention, with over 800 participants monitoring the sale online. According to AP, Heritage auctions, which facilitated the sale, had originally appraised the slippers at $3 million or above, but enthusiastic bidding rapidly drove the price to $28 million in just a matter of minutes. When including buyer's premiums, the total cost for the anonymous purchaser amounts to $32.5 million.The ruby slippers were taken in 2005 from the Judy Garland museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota when a man named Terry Jon Martin broke in and shattered the glass case to steal them.

Interest in The Wizard of Oz has surged recently, fueled by the release of Wicked, a new film exploring the backstory of the Wicked Witch.","A pair of ruby slippers famously worn by Judy Garland in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz has sold for $28 million.

CEO's shooting lays bare US' health cover woes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ceos-shooting-lays-bare-us-health-cover-woes/articleshow/116090453.cms,"Representative image

NEW YORK: For years, patients in the US healthcare system have grown frustrated with a bureaucracy they don't understand - doctors are included in an insurer's network one year but not the next. Getting someone on the phone to help can be next to impossible. Coverage of care and prescriptions is often unceremoniously denied.This week's fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has unleashed a wave of public feeling - exasperation, anger, resentment, helplessness - from Americans sharing personal stories of interactions with insurance companies, often seen as faceless corporate giants.In particular, the words written on ammunition found at the hooting scene - ""delay,"" ""deny"" and ""depose,"" echoing a phrase used to describe how insurers dodge claim payouts - amplified voices that have long been critical of the industry. ""All of a sudden, I am fired up again,"" said Tim Anderson, describing how his wife, Mary, had to deal with UnitedHealthcare coverage denials before she died from Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in 2022. Anderson said they couldn't get coverage for machines to help his wife breathe or talk - toward the end, she communicated by blinking when he showed her pictures. The family had to rely on donations from a local ALS group. ""The business model for insurance is don't pay,"" said Anderson, 67, of Centerville, Ohio.""When Mary could still talk, she said to me to keep fighting this,"" he added. ""It needs to be exposed.""For Anderson and others, Thompson's death and the message left at the scene have created an opportunity to vent their frustrations. Conversations at dinner tables, office water coolers, social gatherings and on social media have pivoted to the topic, as police efforts to find the gunman keep the case in the news.University of Pennsylvania researcher Michael Anne Kyle said she's not surprised by the growth of conversation around insurers. ""People are often struggling with this by themselves, and when you see someone else talk about it, that may prompt you to join the conversation,"" she said.Kyle studies how patients access care and said she's seen frustration with the system build for years. Costs are rising, and insurers are using more controls such as prior authorisations and doctor networks to manage them. Patients are often stuck in the middle of disputes between doctors and insurers. ""Patients are already spending a lot of money on healthcare, and then they're still facing problems with the service.""Insurers often note that most of the money they bring in goes back out the door to pay claims, and that they try to corral soaring costs and the overuse of some care.","Patients in the US healthcare system have grown frustrated with a bureaucracy they don't understand.

NEW DELHI: The US responded to BJP's claims that the State Department and ""deep state"" were working to destabilise India by targeting PM Narendra Modi and industrialist Gautam Adani , saying it's ""disappointing that the ruling party in India would make these kinds of accusations"".BJP had alleged that the US deep state worked with investigative journalism platform OCCRP (Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project) and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi to target India's interests. The allegations followed a report by a French newspaper that claimed to expose ""hidden links"" between OCCRP and the US government and the media organisation's funding by billionaire philanthropist George Soros. Congress leaders have protested the allegations in Parliament.OCCRP has also dismissed the accusations. ""A free and independent press is an essential component of any democracy, enabling informed and constructive debate and holding those in power accountable,"" a US embassy spokesperson said here Saturday.US govt works with independent organisations on programming that supports ""professional development and capacity-building training for journalists"" but this does not influence their editorial policy or direction, the spokesperson said, adding that US has long been a champion of media freedom around the world.B JP referred to a French media report and said it revealed that OCCRP is funded by the US State Department’s USAID, along with other “deep state figures” like George Soros and the Rockefeller Foundation. OCCRP refuted the report calling it “simply wrong”.In its response, it said, “OCCRP has no limits on its journalism and no donor influences our reporting. The story, co-written by a disgruntled former member of our network, was unable to cite a single instance of inaccuracy or influence in our work and relied instead on insinuation and implication.”","BJP had alleged that the US deep state worked with investigative journalism platform OCCRP (Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project) and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi to target India's interests.

What is Deny Defend Depose?

A video of a man claiming to be the winner of UnitedHealthcare CEO killer lookalike competition is viral as NYPD is looking for the killer four days after Brian Thompson was killed in New York in front of a hotel. The murder of 50-year-old Brian Thompson unleashed a rage never seen before as people celebrated the death and now there apparently was a competition of UnitedHealthcare CEO killer lookalike. It is not yet known who organized the competition or whether there was really a competition but the person who claimed to be the winner said if there is any cash prize for winning the competition, he would give it for Palestine.In the video, several people were seen in similar hoodie jackets which the killer was seen in photos NYPD released from surveillance footage.The alleged winner also said this is the first annual lookalike competition suggesting that there would be similar competition every year.Though a section of social media users was celebrating the murder and feted the killer as a hero, the lookalike competition came across as ""little too far"" for many. ""This is weird,"" a comment on the viral video said.""This is actually terrible and evil,"" another said. ""This depraved,"" one wrote.The participants in the apparent competition also came with posters that said: Deny Defend Depose -- the three words the casings of the bullets had engraved on them.""Who's the organizer for this?"" one of the participants was asked.""The FBI,"" quipped one.Several social media posts across all platforms including X, Bluesky and even LinkedIn, attacked the practices of the health insurance companies to rob people of their money and deny the payout during an emergency -- thereby justifying the murder of Brian Thompson. UnitedHealthcare is a health insurance company and does not have a good reputation among its customers as many people are sharing their stories on social media now.After the NYPD released a grinning photo of the killer -- sourced from surveillance footage -- the internet went berserk discovering the man's similarities to movie stars like Timothee Chalamet and Jake Gyllenhaal.Deny, defend, depose are the three words engraved on the casings of the bullet that the killer fired at Brian Thompson. They are similar to the tactics that insurance companies adopt to deny payment. The three words echoed the title of a 2010 book written by Jay Feinman ""Delay, Deny, Defend"". This book is also about the insurance woes -- how insurance companies delay payment of justified claims, then deny the payment altogether and then degend the action by forcing claimants to entre litigation.",A video of a man claiming to be the winner of UnitedHealthcare CEO killer lookalike competition is viral.

President Emmanuel Macron hosted trilateral discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Donald Trump, where they addressed global concerns that Trump described as a ""little crazy"". The meeting, held at the Élysée Palace, focused on global affairs which Trump described as “a little crazy right now.”At the French presidential palace, Trump received full military honours despite not being in office yet. Macron and Trump exchanged warm greetings with multiple handshakes.""It seems like the world is going a little crazy right now and we will be talking about that,"" Trump remarked before their discussion, as reported by AFP.This marked Zelensky’s first in-person meeting with Trump since the US election, occurring before they attended Notre Dame cathedral's reopening ceremony. This meeting held particular significance for Zelensky, considering apprehensions in Kyiv about Trump's stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Meanwhile,the Paris visit provided Macron an opportunity to understand the potential direction of Trump's second presidency, commencing in January.This was Trump's first international engagement following his electoral victory. His delegation included key advisors Susie Wiles, Steve Witkoff, and Massad Boulos, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk expected to attend the Notre Dame ceremony.Despite previous tensions, Trump highlighted his positive relationship with the French leader, stating, ""We had a great relationship as everyone knows. We accomplished a lot.""On the other hand, Macron expressed gratitude for Trump's attendance at the Notre Dame reopening, recalling Trump's supportive response to the 2019 cathedral fire during his presidency.Their initial relationship in 2017 began positively, despite political differences, though it later deteriorated over disagreements regarding climate change, trade and defence matters.The discussions encompassed the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, alongside trade relations. Trump had earlier expressed views against US involvement in Syria, where rebels report advancing towards Damascus.Zelensky joined the meeting later, describing it as ""good and productive"" on social media, expressing hopes for a just conclusion to the conflict. Macron subsequently emphasised continuing joint peace and security efforts.The 35-minute meeting included only the three leaders, according to Zelensky's spokesman Sergiy Nykyforov.","President Emmanuel Macron hosted trilateral discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Donald Trump.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries.

Growing threat from Baloch separatists

Sectarian violence fuels instability

Border tensions and counterterrorism efforts

What lies ahead

Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month, according to a report by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). The number of fatalities also surged by 69%, climbing from 100 in October to 169, with 225 others injured.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned group, carried out 12 attacks in November, including three high-impact incidents that resulted in 45 deaths. These figures surpassed the fatalities caused by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), indicating a shift in the BLA's operational strategy. Experts suggest this escalation requires a reassessment of counterterrorism tactics.The majority of these attacks in Balochistan targeted security forces and civilians. Notable incidents included an assault on the Quetta railway station, an attack on a police van in Mastung, and a strike on a security check-post in Kalat, which collectively accounted for 91% of the province’s fatalities.Sectarian violence added another layer to the country's security challenges, particularly in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Seven incidents, including two terror attacks and five sectarian clashes, claimed 115 lives and left 137 injured. The violence was triggered by an attack on passenger buses on November 21, which spiraled into broader sectarian unrest.KP remained the most affected province, with 41 terrorist attacks leading to 114 deaths and 95 injuries. The TTP, Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, and other local factions were linked to most of these incidents.The report also highlighted six incidents of border violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, resulting in 25 terrorist deaths and 11 injuries. This underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges posed by cross-border insurgents.Security forces conducted 19 counterterrorism operations in November, killing 53 terrorists. Most of these operations were concentrated in KP and Balochistan, the epicenters of recent violence.The PIPS report paints a grim picture of Pakistan's security landscape, with 98 conflict-related incidents causing 338 deaths and 411 injuries in November alone. Experts suggest that the evolving nature of terror threats, including the increasing lethality of BLA operations and persistent sectarian tensions, requires urgent and innovative policy responses.As Pakistan grapples with these challenges, the question remains: can the state adapt quickly enough to address the multifaceted threats destabilizing the country?","Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month.

ISLAMABAD: A Pakistan anti-terrorism court indicted on Thursday former prime minister Imran Khan along with dozens of other Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) politicians on charges of inciting supporters to attack the country’s military installations on May 9, 2023.Following Khan’s arrest on May 9 last year, his supporters had attacked and torched several military buildings and offices to protest against what they describe as the illegal detention of their leader.

Following the indictment, the court fixed Dec 10 as the date for recording prosecution’s evidence.Khan has been facing anti-terrorism charges in connection with the violence, which is viewed as the most serious challenge to the military’s dominance in Pakistan’s history.

PESHAWAR: The death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surged to 130, with at least six people killed and eight injured on Sunday, as clashes in the volatile Kurram district continued for the eleventh consecutive day.The clashes between Alizai and Bagan tribes in the district started on November 22, after an attack on a convoy of passenger vans near Parachinar in which 47 people were killed a day earlier. Several passengers who had sustained grave injuries succumbed later, raising the toll in the convoy killing to 57.Police said the situation remained tense, and violence persists despite a recent ceasefire agreement between the Sunni and Shia groups.The six new deaths reported on Sunday brought the death toll to 130, while the total number of injured rose to 186 after eight fresh injuries were reported.The 10-day truce brokered last week has been rendered ineffective by intermittent violence, which shows no signs of abating.A high-powered delegation, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry and IGP Akhtar Hayat Gandapur, had also negotiated a ceasefire last weekend, but violence resumed shortly afterwards.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi earlier planned to dispatch members of the grandpeace jirga (council of tribal leaders) from Kohat division to Kurram for engaging with leaders from both warring factions to negotiate peace.Addressing a gathering of political leaders and tribal elders in Kohat on Sunday, he called for strict action with public cooperation to make the region weapon-free through joint operations.He said he was ready to go to Kurram and stay there for as many days as the jirga suggested to ensure peace in the region.""No other country or province will resolve our issues. We must take responsibility for improving the situation ourselves,"" he said.Kundi announced an All-Parties Conference (APC) for peace and the province's rights and invited Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur to join it.The governor stressed the role of religious scholars in promoting peace, urging them to focus on unity.Several other leaders addressed the gathering, putting aside their ideological differences on other issues.The continued violence forced the closure of the main Peshawar-Parachinar Road for travel, and commuting at the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border has also been suspended.The closure of the main arteries has created a scarcity of oil, food commodities and medicines in the region.The Kurram region is also experiencing a communication blackout, with mobile and internet services suspended and educational institutions closed.Police and other security forces personnel had been deployed in various parts of Lower Kurram, said Deputy Commissioner Javed Ullah Mehsud, adding that all-out efforts will be made for a truce in other areas today as well.""We are hopeful for progress on a ceasefire and reopening of transport routes,"" he stated.Previous efforts to mediate peace, including a seven-day truce brokered by provincial officials in November have failed to hold.","Death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surges to 130.

Iskcon in Kolkata has alleged that its centre in Dhaka Upazila was burned down by arsonists in the early hours of Saturday, igniting fresh anxiety among minorities in Bangladesh. However, ANI reported that the Mahabhagya Lakshminarayan Mandir had been attacked late Friday night, and that the Iskcon temple opposite it was undamaged. The attack comes ahead of the scheduled foreign secretary-level talks in Dhaka on Dec 9.PTI, meanwhile, said Iskcon Bangladesh described the temple set on fire as a ""family temple"" belonging to an Iskcon devotee while Iskcon Kolkata said the ""Iskcon Namhatta Centre"" had been targeted. TOI has not been able to independently verify the claims.Iskcon vice-president Radharaman Das claimed in Kolkata that petrol was splashed at their centre in Dhaka district's ward 52 before it was torched between 2am and 3am on Saturday. ""The idols and all items inside were burned down in Radha Krishna Temple and Mahabhagya Lakshmi Narayan Temple in Hare Krishna Namhatta Sangha..."" Das claimed.ANI quoted Mahabhagya Lakshminarayan Mandir supervisor Babul Ghosh as saying a complaint has been filed against unidentified miscreants for burning down his “ancestral temple”. Ghosh said the attackers poured petrol on the idols while he was not present in the house and ran away on hearing his footsteps. He alleged that the attackers had some “bigger plans”.Clarifying the name of his temple, Ghosh said the Iskcon temple is right opposite his ancestral temple. “The name of our temple is Shri Mahabhagya Lakshminarayan Mandir. This is one the ancient temples. Iskcon temple is in front of this; and hasn’t been damaged,” he added. Iskcon’s Das, meanwhile, urged devotees and monks in Bangladesh to avoid wearing traditional saffron robes or tilaks in public for their own safety. According to him, this is the fourth instance of an attack on a temple in Bangladesh.While monks have not been attacked, Das said there have been attacks on congregations. “We were hopeful that things would change for the better after the interim govt held a meeting with Hindu Buddhist Christian Council. The government entering into a confidence-building dialogue was a good initiative. But this fresh arson has escalated tension,” Das said.Condemnation poured in from various quarters. VHP spokesperson Vinod Bansal alleged that Islamic extremists were targeting Iskcon and accused global organisations of silence over the plight of Hindus in Bangladesh. In solidarity, Civil Society of Delhi mobilised over 200 organisations, including Iskcon, to protest “the unprecedented atrocities” against minorities in Bangladesh. The protest, set for Sunday to coincide with International Human Rights Day, includes a march to the Bangladesh embassy and submission of memoranda to global bodies like UN and Amnesty International.","Iskcon in Kolkata has alleged that its centre in Dhaka Upazila was burned down by arsonists in the early hours of Saturday.

Texas high school student brutally attacked while adults stood by- Video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-high-school-student-brutally-attacked-while-adults-stood-by-video/articleshow/119737318.cms,"A shocking video surfaced online showing a Texas junior high school student being brutally beaten by another pupil, while adults stood by with little urgency to stop the violence.The attack took place at Harwood junior high school in Bedford, Texas, the school confirmed in a letter to parents, as reported by WFAA.Footage of the assault showed the aggressor straddling the victim’s chest, punching him in the head relentlessly, as the boy struggled to escape. The victim attempted to get up at one point, only to be tackled back down onto the concrete floor.As the attack unfolded, the boy looked around desperately for help, but instead, fellow students cheered, recording the incident on their phones, making whooping noises while he continued to endure blows to his face and the back of his head.Teachers failed to intervene effectively. Two adult men could be seen in the video approaching the fight slowly, one of them still holding a thermos, before gently pulling the attacker away without restraining him. Moments later, as the assailant stood up, he stomped on the victim’s head, knocking him unconscious.Despite the severity of the attack, no one rushed to assist the unconscious student for at least 20 seconds. Instead, onlookers continue watching, and no adults are immediately visible.It is still unclear how badly the student was injured or if he required medical treatment.In a letter to parents, the principal of Harwood Junior High confirmed the incident occurred on school grounds and stated that a full investigation was underway.“However, I want to emphasize that fighting is a severely inappropriate behavior, and this type of incident is completely unacceptable,” the principal wrote, according to WFAA.“The incident is being taken very seriously, including investigation of the complete sequence of events using video and interviews, surrounding context, actions of additional students and staff, and district processes related to student fights,” the letter added, quoted by the New York Post.The Bedford police department also investigated the incident and referred the case to the Tarrant county juvenile justice system, according to a statement posted on Facebook.","Shocking video shows a Texas junior high school student being brutally beaten by another pupil, while adults stand by with little urgency to stop the violence.

Syria’s transitional government takes office marking crucial shift after Assad’s removal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/syrias-transitional-government-takes-office-marking-crucial-shift-after-assads-removal/articleshow/119736325.cms,"AP photo

Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa announces new transitional Syrian government in Damascus

Syria’s new government was sworn in on Saturday, marking a major step in the country’s transition following the removal of Bashar al-Assad in December.The 23-member cabinet includes a mix of religious and ethnic backgrounds and is expected to lead Syria through its five-year transitional period.Unlike previous governments, this one does not have a prime minister. Instead, a secretary general will oversee its functions, as outlined in the temporary constitution signed by interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa earlier this month.While most ministers are new faces, the foreign and defence ministers retained their positions. One notable absence in the government is representation from the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) or the autonomous administration in northeast Syria. However, al-Sharaa and SDF commander Mazloum Abdi recently signed a ceasefire agreement and a deal to merge the US-backed force into the Syrian army.Stability remains the new government’s biggest challenge. Earlier this month, revenge killings in the coastal Alawite region left over 1,000 people dead. The Assad family, which ruled for decades, belongs to the Alawite minority, while most of the new leaders are from the Sunni majority.Economic troubles are also a priority. Sanctions imposed on Assad’s government over a decade ago remain in place, and the UN reports that 90% of Syrians live below the poverty line. The new government hopes that its diverse composition will help persuade Western nations to ease sanctions.Security remains a concern as well. Just hours before the government was announced, the US State Department warned of potential terrorist attacks targeting embassies and public buildings during the Eid al-Fitr holiday. The warning cited the possibility of individual attackers, armed gunmen, or explosives.","The 23-member cabinet includes a mix of religious and ethnic backgrounds.

Trump weighs Mike Waltz’s fate after Yemen war plan leak in Signal chat scandal: 'Should I fire him?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-weighs-mike-waltzs-fate-after-yemen-war-plan-leak-in-signal-chat-scandal-should-i-fire-him/articleshow/119736533.cms,"Trump's national security advisor Mike Waltz (File Image)

It seems that US President Donald Trump 's national security advisor Mike Waltz's job is in danger after the Yemen war plan leak on a Signal group chat scandal.""Should I fire him?"" he inquired of his staff and associates, as controversy mounted over Waltz's accidental inclusion of a journalist in communications about an impending Yemen military operation , New York Times reported.Publicly, Trump maintained support for Waltz while criticising the media. Following Jeffrey Goldberg 's article in The Atlantic about his inclusion in the chat, Trump described Waltz as a ""good man"" who needed no apology.Privately, Trump sought counsel from various individuals within and outside his administration regarding appropriate action.He expressed dissatisfaction with media coverage to his allies but was reluctant to appear influenced by press pressure. He also indicated hesitation about dismissing senior officials early in his second term.For Trump, the primary concern appeared not to be Waltz's careless discussion of military plans on a commercial application, but rather his possible connection to Goldberg, a Washington journalist Trump strongly dislikes. The president expressed particular concern about Goldberg's contact details being in Waltz's phone.On Wednesday evening, Trump consulted with Vice President JD Vance, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, personnel chief Sergio Gor, Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and others regarding Waltz's position.Following a Thursday Oval Office meeting with Waltz, Trump indicated by Friday morning his inclination to retain him, according to three individuals familiar with the president's thoughts.Prior to the Signal incident, Waltz faced criticism for his hawkish stance, particularly regarding Iran, contrasting with the president's preference for negotiation.The Goldberg connection provided additional ammunition for Waltz's critics.Several Trump allies questioned whether Waltz, who previously served in George W Bush's administration, aligned with the president's foreign policy objectives. Sources indicate tensions between Waltz and both Vance and Wiles regarding Iran policy.Despite the controversy, defence secretary Pete Hegseth appears secure in his position, maintaining Trump's support despite sharing Yemen strike details in the Signal thread.","US President Donald Trump's national security advisor Mike Waltz's job is in danger after the Yemen war plan leak on a Signal group chat scandal.

US airstrikes in Somalia kill several Islamic State members,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-airstrikes-in-somalia-kill-several-islamic-state-members/articleshow/119735509.cms,"Representational AI image

The US Africa Command (Africom) said on Saturday it conducted an airstrike in the Puntland region of Somalia, killing several members of the Islamic State (IS). The operation was carried out in coordination with the Somali government and targeted multiple ISIS-Somalia positions.The airstrike occurred southeast of Bosasso, a key port city in Puntland, a semi-autonomous region in northeastern Somalia. While the number of casualties was not specified, Africom said initial assessments showed multiple IS operatives were killed, and no civilians were harmed.This strike is part of a more extensive counter-terrorism operation in Somalia. Two days earlier, the US military had conducted a similar attack, and in February, Puntland authorities reported US strikes had eliminated key IS figures.Although IS has a presence in Somalia, it remains smaller than Al-Shabaab, the Al-Qaeda-linked militant group that controls large parts of the country. However, IS has been gaining influence in Puntland, which has become a key base for its operations in the region.","The US Africa Command (Africom) said on Saturday it conducted an airstrike in the Puntland region of Somalia, killing several members of the Islamic State (IS) The operation was carried out in coordination with the Somali government and targeted multiple ISIS-Somalia positions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119735636,imgsize-40698,width-400,resizemode-4/119735636.jpg"

The powerful tremor, which hit near Mandalay at midday, reduced buildings to rubble, caused a dam to burst, and left roads cracked and impassable.At least 144 people have been killed, with hundreds more injured, as emergency crews struggle to reach those trapped in some of the hardest-hit areas in Myanmar. The quake, followed by a strong 6.4-magnitude aftershock, sent shockwaves as far as neighbouring Thailand, where terrified residents fled high-rises swaying under the violent tremors.Also read: Myanmar Earthquake Live Updates The footage, widely circulated on social media, shows the moment the towering crane detached from the building as tremors shook the structure. Witnesses could be heard screaming as the crane plummeted, sending debris cascading onto the streets below. The collapse added to the widespread devastation, with reports of multiple buildings being reduced to rubble in Mandalay and the capital Naypyidaw. A monastery and a 90-year-old bridge were also destroyed, while a dam burst, flooding low-lying areas.Myanmar’s military leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, confirmed in a televised address that the death toll is expected to rise as rescue teams struggle to reach affected areas. The country’s already dire humanitarian situation has been exacerbated by damaged roads and power outages, making relief efforts even more challenging.Across the border in Thailand, tremors were felt as far as Bangkok, where a 33-storey building under construction collapsed. At least three workers were killed, and dozens remain missing under the rubble. Dramatic scenes unfolded as onlookers fled in panic, with sirens wailing across the city. The elevated transit system and subway were shut down, while emergency teams worked to locate survivors. A government official described the scene as ""catastrophic,"" warning that further aftershocks could worsen the damage.The earthquake, one of the strongest in the region in recent years, has left thousands homeless and in urgent need of aid. The Red Cross has appealed for emergency assistance, citing a desperate need for food, shelter, and medical supplies. Videos from Mandalay and Yangon show residents pulling survivors from collapsed structures, while others search for missing loved ones. With communications severely disrupted, authorities fear the true scale of the disaster has yet to emerge.Myanmar’s government has declared a state of emergency in six regions, though its ongoing civil conflict complicates efforts to provide aid.

Over 100 pro-king protesters arrested for vandalism: What’s fueling Nepal’s unrest?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/over-100-pro-king-protesters-arrested-for-vandalism-whats-fueling-nepals-unrest/articleshow/119694922.cms,"Why are Nepalis protesting?



What turned the protests violent?



NEW DELHI: At least 100 protesters were detained after pro-monarchist agitation turned violent following clashes with security personnel in Nepal's Kathmandu.The unrest left two people dead, including a journalist, and over 30 others injured, prompting authorities to impose a curfew and call in the army.The curfew was lifted on Friday and has been lifted from 7 am on Saturday, according to a notice issued by the Kathmandu District Administration Office.The pro-monarchist agitators were demanding the reinstatement of the monarchy and a Hindu kingdom, which was abolished in 2008 as part of a peace deal that ended a decade-long civil war in which more than 16,000 people were killed.Nepalis blame corruption, economic struggles, and instability for their frustration, leading to renewed calls for the return of the monarchy.The monarchists have been demanding the restoration of the monarchy since the former king appealed for support in a video message telecast on Democracy Day (February 19).The pro-monarchy activists also held a rally on March 9 in support of the former king, who landed at the Tribhuvan International Airport from Pokhara after visiting religious places in different parts of the country.The government also decided to take all necessary steps to curb possible demonstrations and protests by pro-monarchy and pro-Hindu parties, a minister told the Post.The Nepal cabinet meeting on Friday condemned the killings and discussed the ""evolving security situation"" following protests in the Tinkune area near Koteshwar, Kathmandu.""It has become crystal clear that Gyanendra Shah (the last reigning king of Nepal) is behind all these acts. Gyanendra Shah's intent is culpable. It is time for the government to take strict action,"" said former PM of Nepal Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda.'""An investigation should be conducted to bring the criminals to justice, and Gyanendra Shah cannot be spared—given absolute freedom, it is unacceptable for the Nepali citizens, and the government should be serious about this issue,"" he added.According to authorities, the demonstration turned violent after Durga Prasai, the convenor of the agitation, broke the security barricade, riding a bulletproof vehicle, and headed towards Baneshwor, where the Parliament building is located.Those arrested included the general secretary of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, Dhawal Shumsher Rana, and a central member of the party, Rabindra Mishra, among others.Prasai, the key person behind the violent demonstration, is at large, Superintendent of Police of Kathmandu District Police Range Apil Bohara said.According to the police, 53 police personnel, 22 Armed Police Force personnel, and 35 protestors were injured in Friday's incident.During the violent demonstration, 14 buildings were set on fire and nine were vandalized. Nine government vehicles were torched, and six private vehicles were vandalized.Protesters also attacked the Kantipur Television building and Annapurna Media House in the Tinkune area.","Pro-monarchist agitation turned violent following clashes with security personnel in Kathmandu.

Brooklyn tragedy: Mother and two daughters killed in car crash by driver with suspended license,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/brooklyn-tragedy-mother-and-two-daughters-killed-in-car-crash-by-driver-with-suspended-license/articleshow/119733564.cms,"A mother and her two young daughters were killed in Brooklyn on Saturday when a driver with a suspended licence crashed into an Uber before ploughing into the family. The three were walking home from synagogue when the tragedy struck.The woman’s four-year-old son was also struck and remains in critical condition, fighting for his life, authorities confirmed. Overall, nine people were injured in the devastating crash.The tragedy unfolded just after 1 pm on Ocean Parkway, near Quentin Road, in the Orthodox Jewish neighbourhood of Gravesend. Police said a Toyota Camry Uber and an Audi collided, sending the Audi hurtling into a crosswalk, where it struck the family.“The bang I heard, it was like an earthquake,” a witness told the New York Post. “It went on for a good 30 seconds. It felt like the world stopped for that second.”The Audi, driven by 32-year-old Miriam Yarimi, fatally hit the 35-year-old mother and her daughters, aged eight and six, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.“This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn’t have been on the road,” Tisch stated at a press conference at the scene.The woman’s husband, who was at home with their infant at the time, was later informed of the heartbreaking loss.“My neighbor had to go to the husband and tell him that his wife and two children passed away,” a local resident said.Shocking images from the aftermath showed children’s shoes scattered on the pavement, while paramedics desperately worked on the injured. A first responder was seen on his knees, visibly distraught and in tears.Three passengers inside the Uber, an adult and two children, were also taken to Kings County Hospital in stable condition. Both Yarimi and the 62-year-old Uber driver were transported to Coney Island Hospital, where they were expected to undergo tests for drink-driving.So far, no charges have been filed against Yarimi, who is a mother of one and wigmaker. She also previously won $2 million from the NYPD in a lawsuit alleging she was raped by a police officer when she was a minor, the New York Post reported.New York city mayor Eric Adams described the crash as a tragedy of “Shakespearean proportions.”“A mother going for a simple stroll on a sunny day was struck and killed,” he said at an unrelated event. “I cannot imagine the pain of the family.”","A mother and her two young daughters were killed in Brooklyn on Saturday when a driver with a suspended licence crashed into an Uber before ploughing into the family.

Many international students in US told to self-deport due to ‘activism’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/many-international-students-in-us-told-to-self-deport-due-to-activism/articleshow/119728279.cms,"Students told their SEVIS record terminated

Hundreds of international students in the US are getting an email from the state department asking them to self-deport owing to alleged campus activism. Immigration attorneys contacted by TOI affirmed this development and added that a few Indian students may also be at the receiving end of such emails — even for something as innocuous as sharing a social media post.This crackdown is based on social media reviews being conducted by DOS (which include reviews by consulate officials). Thus, even new student applications, be it for an F (academic study visa), M (vocational study visa) or J (exchange visa) will also come under such social media scrutiny.Applicants found ‘guilty’ will be denied the opportunity to study in the US.During the academic year 2023-24, the US attracted nearly 11 lakh international students of whom over 3.3 lakh were Indian students, says an Open Doors report.Axios has earlier reported that secretary of state Marco Rubio has launched an AI-fuelled ‘catch and revoke’ effort to cancel the visas of foreign nationals (including international students) who ‘appear’ to support Hamas or other designated terror groups. Following this, more than 300 foreign students have had their student visas revoked.The email sent to students reads: “On behalf of the US Department of State, the Bureau of Consular Affairs Visa Office hereby informs you that additional information became available after your visa was issued. As a result, your F-1 visa with expiration date XXXXX was revoked in accordance with Section 221(i) of the US Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended.”“The Bureau of Consular Affairs Visa Office has alerted the Dept of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which manages the Student Exchange Visitor Program and is responsible for removal. They may notify your designated school official about the revocation of your F-1 visa.”These students are being asked in the email to self-deport using the CBP Home App. Else, consequences follow such as forced deportation and ineligibility for a US visa in the future. It may be recalled that Ranjani Srinivasan, an Indian doctoral student at Columbia University, had self-deported using this app, after her visa was revoked over alleged campus activism.Immigration attorneys point out that the email requires the international students who self-deport to physically present their passport to the US consulate where the visa was issued, so that it can be physically cancelled. The student can no longer use this visa, but needs to apply for another visa for travel to the US in the future. “A determination on your eligibility for a visa will be made at that time,” adds the email – and the general view is that obtaining a US visa in the future will be challenging under the tenure of the Trump administration.The flurry of self-deportation emails that are being sent to students appear to stem from a March 25 internal directive dispatched by Rubio directing mandatory social media reviews of existing international students already in the US and new applicants, state immigration attorneys.Such students are also being informed by their international student service office that their SEVIS record has been terminated. SEVIS is the web-based information system that the US department of homeland security uses to track and monitor international students during their duration of study. “Students with a terminated SEVIS record must depart the US immediately; there is no grace period following a SEVIS termination. We advise you to depart the US as soon as possible,” states this intimation.In the backdrop of the emails sent to students, Jath Shao, founder of an immigration law firm, told TOI, “F-1 and J-1 students are usually admitted ‘D/S’, meaning for the duration of their status. There’s a slight distinction between overstay and unlawful presence. Historically, someone admitted D/S has not accrued unlawful presence for the purpose of three-or 10-year bars (for re-entry) unless US Citizenship and Immigration Services makes a formal finding that they are unlawfully present. This is important because if you are formally unlawfully present for more than 180 days or 365 days, it can trigger the three- or 10-year bar, respectively. However, with overstay, it’s more in a grey area –– where the consular officer has more discretion whether to hold that overstay or status violation against the person.”“USCIS’s page, updated on Jan 25, now states that non-immigrants admitted for the duration of status generally begin accruing unlawful presence the day after their status ends, if they remain in US.”Immigration attorneys say that students should seek legal counsel to reinstate their SEVIS or defend themselves if removal proceedings are brought against them.",Hundreds of international students in the US are getting an email from the state department asking them to self-deport owing to alleged campus activism.

New US travel rules for Canada

Canadian airlines have started eliminating seats for the United States even in April, the peak tourism time between the two countries, the New York Times reported, stating that the aviation industry is telling under the heat between the US-Canada trade war. The United States also has a set of new rules for Canadians travelling to the country, plus Canada is boycotting US things as President Donald Trump wants Canada to become its 51st state.

In a recent report, it also found that the number of car trips across the border in February fell to 1.2 million from about 1.5 million in February 2024, the report added.US airlines are also reducing the frequency of routes to Canada because of the big drop in Canadian traffic into the US. United Airlines canceled a new daily route between Toronto and Los Angeles that it had planned to begin in May and said it would also reduce the frequency of other existing routes to Canada.Starting from April 11, Canadians who will be in the US for more than 30 days will have to register with the authorities.

An American woman recently released from Taliban custody in Afghanistan expressed gratitude to US President Donald Trump for helping secure her freedom. Faye Hall , who was detained in February, appeared in a video shared by Trump on Truth Social on Saturday, where she thanked him for her safe return home.""Thank you for bringing me home,"" Hall said in the video, smiling and appearing to be in good health. She also spoke about the plight of Afghan women in Taliban jails, saying, ""All the women in the Afghan jail, they always ask me, 'When is Trump coming?' They truly treat you like their savior. They're waiting for you to come and set them free.""Hall, along with British couple Peter and Barbie Reynolds and their Afghan translator, was arrested on February 1 while traveling to Bamiyan province. The Taliban have not publicly disclosed the reasons for their detention, though reports suggest Hall was accused of unauthorised drone use.Former US envoy to Kabul Zalmay Khalilzad confirmed that Hall was in the care of the Qatari delegation in Kabul before her release. ""American citizen Faye Hall, just released by the Taliban, is now in the care of our friends, the Qataris in Kabul, and will soon be on her way home,"" Khalilzad wrote on X. According to sources, she was released on Thursday following a court order, with logistical support from Qatar .Hall's release follows a series of US citizen detentions and negotiations with the Taliban. Earlier this year, the militant group freed American George Glezmann after more than two years in captivity, in a deal brokered by Qatar. In January, two other US citizens, Ryan Corbett and William McKenty, were freed in exchange for an Afghan fighter convicted of narco-terrorism in the US.At least one American, Mahmood Habibi, remains detained in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the British couple detained with Hall is still in Taliban custody. Their daughter has expressed concerns about her father's health and urged authorities to facilitate their release. The Reynolds, who have lived in Afghanistan since 1970, ran educational programs in the country and chose to stay even after the Taliban took over in 2021.The Taliban government remains unrecognised by the international community, though countries such as Russia, China, Turkey, and Qatar maintain diplomatic channels. Since Trump's re-election, the Taliban have expressed hopes for a ""new chapter"" in their relationship with Washington.In response to Hall's message, Trump posted, ""Thank you Faye — So honored with your words!""","Faye Hall, who was detained in February, appeared in a video shared by Trump on Saturday.

Despite Donald Trump and the White House playing down the controversy over the Yemen war plan leak on a Signal group chat, the search to find a scapegoat is on and Vice President JD Vance wanted NSA Mike Waltz to be fired. Politico reported that there was a private meeting attended by Trump, the vice president, chief of staff Susie Wile and top personnel official Sergio Gorand all of them suggested that Mike Waltz should bear the brunt as he added Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg.According to insiders, Trump too agreed that it was Waltz who made a mess but he decided not to fire him for this reason. “They don’t want to give the press a scalp,” one insider told Politico. Trump said Waltz learned his lesson and the issue has been swept under the carpet.The Atlantic published a bombshell report by editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg claiming that Goldberg had been inadvertently added to a Signal group chat named ""Houthi PC Small Group"" by National Security Adviser Michael Waltz. The chat included high-ranking Trump administration officials, such as Vance, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and others, totaling nearly 20 participants. The group was actively discussing plans for US airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen, executed over the weekend of March 15-16.The White House and Pete Hegseth reiterated that no war plan was discussed in the group. Following this, the Atlantic released the full transcript of the Signal chat.A spokesman for Waltz, Brian Hughes, pushed back on suggestions that Waltz’s future remains in doubt, arguing that “the chattering of unnamed sources should be treated with the skepticism of gossip from people lacking the integrity to attach their names.” “Mike Waltz serves at the pleasure of President Trump and the president has voiced his support for Mike,” Hughes said to Politico. “The entire National Security leadership team has led a successful and effective counter terrorism mission and that is what media and Democrats are trying to obscure.”",Vice President JD Vance wanted NSA Mike Waltz to be fired for Signa chatgate.

Woman slams judges blocking Trump's deportation flights after daughter's alleged murder by illegal immigrant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/woman-slams-judges-blocking-trumps-deportation-flights-after-daughters-alleged-murder-by-illegal-immigrant/articleshow/119724598.cms,"File photo of US President Donald Trump (Pic credit: AP)

A grieving mother whose daughter was allegedly raped and murdered by an illegal immigrant has criticised judges who have blocked US President Donald Trump's deportation flights, accusing them and their Democratic supporters of prioritising criminals over victims.Patty Morin , 64, lost her daughter, Rachel Morin , a 37-year-old mother of five, in August 2023. Rachel was found dead near a scenic trail in Maryland, and an illegal immigrant from El Salvador, 23-year-old Victor Martinez Hernandez , has been charged with her murder. His trial is set to begin with jury selection on Tuesday.Speaking to The Post, Morin expressed strong support for Trump's efforts to continue deportation flights and criticised judicial decisions that have temporarily halted them. ""It's good because I really believe that the judges are overstepping their boundaries,"" she said. ""I think that the liberal media is playing that up again, hoping the American citizens don't know or understand our laws.""Trump recently invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport members of Tren de Aragua, a notorious Venezuelan prison gang linked to violent crimes across the US. However, a federal district judge in Washington, DC, James Boasberg, issued a temporary restraining order blocking further deportations earlier this month. On Wednesday, the DC district court of appeals upheld the injunction, prompting the Trump administration to appeal to the Supreme Court on Friday.House Republicans have announced plans for hearings on Boasberg's ruling next week, fueling a political battle that has seen Trump call for the judge's impeachment. This has drawn criticism from Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts, who called such a response ""not appropriate.""Morin directed her frustration at former President Joe Biden and his administration's border policies, arguing that they have endangered American lives. ""They put every American citizen in harm's way, every American citizen, and especially the most vulnerable, which are women and children,"" she said.She also condemned Democratic efforts to block the deportation flights, calling them a political maneuver designed to create chaos. ""I think this is just a weak attempt by Democrats and liberals to stir up chaos and fear — which is the only thing they really know how to do,"" she said. ""It really saddens me that all these politicians choose to harbor people that have committed federal crimes.""Morin, who has previously appeared with Trump on the campaign trail as one of the so-called Angel Moms—parents who lost children due to crimes committed by illegal immigrants—emphasised the need for clear and strict enforcement of immigration laws. ""The law should be black and white. Either you break the law, or you uphold the law. There's no gray area.""Trump was first elected on a platform promising mass deportations, a policy that has gained traction even among some of his critics. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 60% of respondents supported increasing deportations of illegal immigrants.According to Trump insiders, his legal battle over deportation flights presents a challenge for Democrats, forcing them to either support his policies or risk appearing to defend foreign criminals. ""On the one hand, this is a complex legal question,"" a Trump campaign source said. ""On the other hand, it is blindingly obvious what the right course of action is — and Americans know that.""","Patty Morin, 64, lost her daughter, Rachel Morin, a 37-year-old mother of five, in August 2023.

IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme | Dawn News English

Pakistan's citizens may have to pay additional taxation as a new carbon levy is anticipated following a USD 1.3 billion agreement with the IMF for climate change initiatives PTI reported citing official sources.Alongside this, the IMF agreed to release approximately USD 1 billion as the second tranche of the previously agreed USD 7 billion loan.""The IMF team has reached a SLA with the Pakistani authorities on the first review of the 37-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), and a new 28-month arrangement under the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) with total access over the 28 months of around USD 1.3 billion,"" the Fund said in a statement.The total IMF loan now amounts to USD 8.3 billion with this RSF arrangement. Upon approval from the IMF's Executive Board, Pakistan would receive immediate access to approximately USD 2 billion to strengthen its balance of payment position.The new agreement requires additional commitments from the tax-burdened population, including a new carbon levy, increased water rates, and liberalisation of the automobile sector. Dawn newspaper reports that a reduction in power rates is expected, funded by reallocating the existing petroleum levy.Senior officials familiar with the SLA and MEFP indicated that the prime minister would announce an approximate Rs 7 per unit reduction in average electricity rates, effective from April 1, 2025.The implementation of new measures - carbon levy, water pricing and automobile sector reforms - will commence from July 1, 2025. Fiscal consolidation will continue through reduced energy subsidies and controlled development spending.Officials confirmed that whilst the government sought GST reduction on electricity, the IMF instead permitted the use of increased petroleum levy to offset power tariffs. A Rs 10 per litre increase in petroleum levy would provide approximately Rs 1.80 per unit relief.The government has agreed to implement a carbon levy of Rs 3-5 per litre or equivalent on all hydrocarbons, including petroleum products and coal, with gradual increases planned. The revenue will fund climate-related initiatives.Automobile sector trade tariffs will decrease from 10.5% to 6% by FY 2030, ending what both parties agreed was excessive protection. These measures require cabinet approval before implementation through the finance bill 2025-26.The authorities aim to achieve an FY25 underlying primary surplus of 1% of GDP minimum, maintaining consolidation in FY26. The focus remains on revenue mobilisation, spending efficiency and tax base expansion.Pakistan has committed to maintaining strict monetary policy to keep inflation within the SBP's 5-7% target range and preserve foreign exchange market functionality while building reserves.The RSF programme includes strengthening public investment processes, improving water resource management, enhancing disaster financing coordination, addressing climate-related risks, and promoting environmental-friendly transportation to reduce pollution impacts.",IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme.

The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of Balochistan police has arrested four suspects who allegedly facilitated the terrorist group involved in hijacking the Jaffar Express and taking over 400 passengers hostage in Pakistan's Bolan district on March 11, according to a media report. Terrorists belonging to the banned separatist outfit Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) hijacked the Jaffar Express carrying 440 passengers. Twenty-six hostages, including 18 security personnel, lost their lives in the attack. The Army eliminated all 33 terrorists the next day and rescued 354 hostages.Since then, multiple attacks have taken place across Balochistan.Sources in CTD, while confirming the arrests, said that a joint team comprising senior officials from various law enforcement agencies is investigating the attack on the Jaffar Express, reported the Dawn newspaper.""These four suspects have been taken into custody for interrogation,"" the sou-rces said, adding that ef--forts to identify the attackers are also ongoing.The remains of the militants killed in the attack have been sent to the Forensic Science Agency.The sources said arms and communication devi-ces used by the attackers were seized and sent for forensic analysis.

Rajab Butt: Pakistani YouTuber slapped with blasphemy charges over perfume launch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-youtuber-slapped-with-blasphemy-charges-over-perfume-launch/articleshow/119484680.cms,"Pakistani YouTuber slapped with blasphemy charges over perfume launch (Picture credit: X)

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

QUETTA: The Balochistan government , under the leadership of chief minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti , has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities , as reported by ARY News.In a high-level meeting chaired by CM Bugti, which was attended by the IG Balochistan and the chief secretary, the government announced that it would target individuals involved in anti-state propaganda and activism.According to ARY News, CM Bugti instructed all commissioners and district officers to act swiftly against any government employees suspected of promoting anti-state narratives or participating in activities that challenge the state's authority. The government's move appears to be a direct attempt to suppress activism and dissent within the province, especially among those critical of the state's policies. Bugti also confirmed that individuals involved in such actions would be placed under strict surveillance by being added to the Fourth Schedule for closer monitoring.ARY News also reported that CM Bugti directed all heads of educational institutions in the province to ensure the national flag is hoisted and the national anthem is recited regularly. Educational leaders who fail to enforce these directives are being told to resign, which signals a heightened crackdown on any form of resistance within these spaces.This renewed focus on stifling activism in Balochistan reflects the government's broader strategy to assert control over the region, including monitoring and potentially silencing any opposition to its policies.This comes amidst the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. Activists in the Balochistan region have frequently organised protests and campaigns, calling attention to the region's marginalisation.In response, governments have implemented harsh crackdowns, often leading to the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. These actions have sparked widespread criticism from international human rights organisations, highlighting concerns over the suppression of political expression and the stifling of peaceful advocacy for regional rights.","The Balochistan government has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities.

The Biden administration has rejected these allegations.Wilson acknowledged disagreeing with Khan's perspectives but added that such disputes require democratic resolution, stating, ""But political differences should be dealt with at the ballot box,"" he added.The bill requires the US government to identify those involved in political persecution in Pakistan within 180 days and impose penalties, including visa bans and entry restrictions.It specifically accuses General Asim Munir of ""knowingly engaging in the wrongful persecution and imprisonment of political opponents"" and calls for similar action against others.The bill allows for the removal of sanctions if Pakistan ends military rule, restores civilian democracy, and frees all detained political leaders.","Reps.

Who is Mahrang Baloch?



Growing Baloch resistance



Challenging the narrative



Balochistan, a region rife with conflict, has become a powder keg as Pakistan confronts a growing insurgency and resistance movement, most recently illustrated with the hijacking of a train by the Balochistan Liberation Army.The shock attack resulted in around 60 deaths and brought to fore the boiling deep-seated tensions between the Baloch people and the Pakistani state.Following the attack, senior Pakistan ministers and army leaders held a special meeting to address the country's worsening security crisis.The Pakistan 'establishment', referring to the army, also turned its eyes towards more legitimate forms of protest.Pakistan police recently detained Mahrang Baloch , a leading human rights advocate and symbol of Baloch aspirations, igniting further unrest.Pakistan views the Baloch movement with increasing alarm, fearing the rise of separatist sentiments and challenges to its authority in the region, particularly because of Balochistan's vast area and crucial borders with hostile countries like Iran and Taliban-led Afghanistan.The arrest of nearly 150 activists, including Mahrang Baloch -- recognised by Time Magazine as one of its 100 Next Emerging Leaders -- has sparked international condemnation and raised concerns about human rights abuses and the suppression of Baloch voices in Pakistan.Pakistani authorities arrested Mahrang on Saturday under charges of terrorism, sedition, and murder after a protest in Balochistan's capital, Quetta, resulted in the deaths of three protesters.Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.Her sister, Iqra Baloch, condemned her arrest, stating on social media that her visit to Hudda Jail was reminiscent of when she saw her father behind bars 18 years ago. “Back then, Mahrang was by our side. Today, she is not,” she wrote.Mahrang has been a key figure in protests against enforced disappearances. Her father, Abdul Gaffar Langove, a nationalist leader, was forcibly disappeared in 2009, and his body was found three years later in Lasbela district, according to BBC.Since then, she took the decision to fight against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Now, the 32-year-old is continuing activism despite odds thrown at her, which include death threats, travel bans, detention etc.In December 2023, she helped organise a major march to Islamabad calling for action against enforced disappearances, which was met with police crackdowns.Mahrang's family has also alleged that authorities have denied them permission to meet her in jail or deliver food.Support for the Baloch resistance, both violent and non-violent, has been growing, especially among the youth.Many have been radicalised by ongoing human rights abuses in Balochistan, where an anti-insurgency crackdown — dubbed Pakistan's ""secret dirty war"" — has led to thousands of enforced disappearances and killings over two decades.Voice for Baloch Missing Persons reports that since 2009, around 1,500 missing individuals have been found dead, often brutally tortured, while 6,000 remain missing.Human rights groups say extrajudicial killings are rising, but the military denies involvement.Faith in political solutions has also eroded after allegations of military interference in the 2018 and 2024 elections, which sidelined popular Baloch nationalist leaders.Pakistan has been battling a separatist insurgency in Balochistan for years, with militant groups targeting security forces and foreign nationals.Authorities have often pointed towards the terror activities of the BLA to justify brutal crackdown, arrests and torture of Baloch residents.A major part of the Maharang's movement, however, is based on peaceful advocacy, which observers say presents a challenge to the state's narrative.The province, which is also the poorest, accounts for the lion's share of Pakistan’s total landmass but only 6% of its population, has been a site of insurgency and heavy military presence for decades.Activists claim that Islamabad suppresses political voices while exploiting the region's natural resources.Human rights groups argue that her arrest is part of a broader crackdown on Baloch activists. Protests, often led by women, continue in various parts of Balochistan demanding her release.The Pakistani government has not yet responded to calls for transparency regarding the charges against her.The arrest of Mahrang Baloch has scaled-up scrutiny of Pakistan’s policies in Balochistan, with rights groups calling for an independent investigation into the recent protests and the treatment of activists in the region.","Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.

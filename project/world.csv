Thousands of Robert F Kennedy documents declassified under Trump executive order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/thousands-of-rfk-documents-declassified-under-trump-executive-order/articleshow/120412753.cms,"Donald Trump

The Trump administration released approximately 10,000 pages of previously classified documents relating to the 1968 assassination of Senator Robert F Kennedy, opening the door for renewed public scrutiny of the decades-old case. The files, published on the US National Archives website on Friday, mark a significant step in President Donald Trump's push for transparency around some of America's most controversial political killings.The move follows an executive order signed by Trump in January calling for the declassification of records concerning the assassinations of RFK, President John F. Kennedy, and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The National Archives confirmed that the documents would continue to be released on a rolling basis in partnership with various federal agencies.The document collection, as per CBS News' report, encompasses various materials related to the RFK assassination case. These include Sirhan's personal handwritten notes, statements from witnesses, photographic evidence from both the crime scene and autopsy, FBI documentation tracking Sirhan's movements prior to the incident, public letters sent to government officials regarding the assassination, and recorded conversations with Sirhan's relatives.Senator Kennedy, a Democratic presidential hopeful at the time, was fatally shot on June 5, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles after winning California’s Democratic primary. Sirhan Sirhan was convicted of his murder and is currently serving a life sentence. However, RFK’s son, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has long raised doubts about Sirhan’s guilt and welcomed the document release.“Lifting the veil on the RFK papers is a necessary step toward restoring trust in American government,” Kennedy Jr. said in a statement, thanking both Trump and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard for their efforts.Gabbard, who led the interagency declassification process, said, “Nearly 60 years after the tragic assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, the American people will, for the first time, have the opportunity to review the federal government’s investigation thanks to the leadership of President Trump.”While many of the files had been transferred to the National Archives decades ago, they had remained inaccessible to the public until now. The newly released material includes FBI and Justice Department memos, photographs of evidence, news clippings, and handwritten notes. Some records had to be re-scanned in colour due to legibility issues in earlier black-and-white versions.Although it's unclear whether these files contain any explosive revelations, their release coincides with broader efforts by the Trump administration to declassify records tied to historic political events. Trump had previously authorised the release of documents related to President John F. Kennedy’s 1963 assassination and promised more disclosures on Dr. King’s killing.","10,000 pages of previously classified documents relating to the 1968 assassination of Senator Robert F Kennedy have been released.

Why was White House press briefing interrupted during Dr Oz’s swearing-in; Trump was mid-Iran remarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-the-white-house-press-briefing-was-interrupted-during-dr-ozs-swearing-in-trump-was-mid-iran-remarks/articleshow/120422199.cms,"President Trump swears in Dr. Oz, discusses Iran & migrants | LiveNOW from FOX





A White House press briefing held after Dr Mehmet Oz’s swearing-in as administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) was abruptly cut short on Friday following a medical emergency involving a child.The incident occurred in the Oval Office shortly after Dr Oz, a former heart surgeon and television personality, formally took the oath of office. While President Donald Trump was answering questions about Iran’s nuclear programme, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt urgently intervened. “Press out! Everybody get out, right now!” she told reporters, prompting confusion in the room.Moments before the interruption, Donald Trump had been addressing Iran’s nuclear ambitions: “I’m for stopping Iran very simply from having a nuclear weapon. They can’t have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific,” he said, adding that during his administration, Iran was “broke” and unable to fund groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. He blamed President Biden for reversing sanctions: “Biden came in. He took all the sanctions off. China wasn’t allowed to buy... I said if you buy one barrel of oil from Iran, you can’t do business in the United States.”The president continued, warning, “With Iran, they can’t have a nuclear weapon, and if they have a nuclear weapon, you’ll all be very unhappy.”He also briefly mentioned ongoing US-China communications, describing them as “really very good,” just seconds before the medical emergency brought the press event to an end.The disruption was caused by a young girl—later confirmed to be a member of Dr Oz’s family—who suddenly collapsed. Dr Oz quickly moved to assist her. Though she managed to stand, she appeared disoriented and was helped out of the room. Officials later confirmed that she was fine, but did not release her identity.The ceremony had just concluded minutes earlier, with Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr administering the oath while Trump looked on. The president praised Oz for his “big commitment,” reaffirming his administration's position: “no cuts” to Medicare and Medicaid .Dr Oz, 64, now leads CMS, the federal agency responsible for overseeing health coverage for nearly half of the US population, including programmes like Medicare, Medicaid, and plans under the Affordable Care Act. His appointment comes amid growing concerns over potential Medicaid cuts as Congress debates budget priorities.The unexpected turn of events briefly overshadowed the significance of the moment, but the White House later assured the public that the child had recovered. The briefing did not resume following the disruption.","A White House press briefing held after Dr Mehmet Oz’s swearing-in was abruptly cut short on Friday following a medical emergency involving a child.

Canadians will head to the polls on April 28 to choose the country’s next government. The vote will determine whether the Liberal Party, now led by Prime Minister Mark Carney , holds onto power or if the Conservatives, under Pierre Poilievre, will return to office after nearly a decade in opposition.Here’s your complete guide to how the election works, who’s voting, and what happens next.Every Canadian citizen aged 18 or older on election day is eligible to vote, including prisoners and Canadians living abroad. The only exception is the chief electoral officer, who is barred from voting during their 10-year term. Additionally, in keeping with tradition, the governor general—the King’s representative in Canada—does not vote to preserve the neutrality of the role.Voters will choose one Member of Parliament (MP) to represent their local riding in the House of Commons. There will be 343 seats up for grabs—five more than in the last election, reflecting population growth.Canada uses a “first past the post” system: the candidate with the most votes in each riding wins the seat, even if they don’t receive a majority.This election is solely for federal Parliament—no referendums or votes for other offices will be held.Canadians do not directly elect the prime minister. The party that wins the most seats—whether a majority or a plurality—typically forms the government.Its leader becomes prime minister, subject to the governor general’s formal invitation.Currently, Mark Carney, who recently succeeded Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader, is running in his first election, seeking to represent a middle-class Ottawa suburb.Three major parties are fielding candidates nationwide:The NDP has never formed a federal government, and polls suggest its current support is at a 25-year low. The Bloc Québécois is also contesting seats, but only in Quebec.Liberal leader Mark Carney highlighted his economic crisis management experience, promising strong leadership against Trump but gave limited policy details.Conservative Pierre Poilievre pushed tough-on-crime measures, vowed to defund English CBC while preserving French services, and called for rapid pipeline approvals to reduce US reliance.NDP’s Jagmeet Singh emphasized social justice and affordability, while Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet opposed new pipelines and championed Quebec’s independence.Canada spans six time zones, but polling hours are staggered so most close by 9.30 pm ET. British Columbia is the last to finish, closing at 10 pm ET.Ballots are paper-based and counted by hand at each polling station, with no machines involved. Elections Canada publishes results online in real time as they are reported from each riding.Special ballots from mail voters, the military, prisoners, and overseas Canadians are counted after election day, following verification.While Canada rarely forms European-style coalitions, minority governments are common. These usually rely on informal deals with other parties to pass legislation. If they lose a confidence vote—often tied to a budget—they can be brought down, triggering another election.For example, in 1979, a minority Progressive Conservative government collapsed after just 66 days.In the last Parliament, the NDP supported the Liberals in exchange for certain policy concessions but did not join the government.Most voters will have received a Voter Information Card in the mail, listing their polling place and options for advance voting, which runs for four days starting Friday. But the card isn’t essential—voters can still cast a ballot with appropriate ID.Voters away from home can apply for a mail-in ballot until Tuesday, April 22. These ballots must arrive at Elections Canada in Ottawa by 6 pm ET on April 28 to be counted.This federal election comes at a pivotal moment in Canadian politics, shaped by Justin Trudeau’s surprise exit after nearly a decade in power. His departure has triggered a wave of uncertainty and transition within the Liberal Party, now helmed by Mark Carney, a political newcomer but a seasoned economist.Beyond party rivalries, this election will shape Canada’s course on critical issues such as immigration, climate policy, economic resilience, and global diplomacy. One of the major foreign policy challenges will be managing relations with the US under Donald Trump, who has made provocative remarks about turning Canada into the “51st US state” and ignited tariff disputes.The outcome will also impact Canada’s strained ties with India, which have been tense since Canada accused Indian agents of involvement in the killing of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India has strongly denied any role in the incident, calling the allegations baseless and politically motivated.","Canadians will head to the polls on April 28 to choose the country’s next government.

Senator Chris Van Hollen on Friday accused El Salvador ’s President Nayib Bukele of staging a deceptive media stunt during his meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia — a man the US government wrongfully deported under the Trump administration — by planting margarita glasses on the table to falsely suggest a casual, celebratory encounter.Speaking to reporters at Dulles International Airport on Friday after returning from a visit to El Salvador, the Maryland Democrat said the Salvadoran government attempted to downplay the seriousness of Abrego Garcia’s detention at the notorious CECOT prison by orchestrating misleading visuals. “They wanted to create this appearance that life was just lovely for Kilmar, which of course is a big, fat lie,” Van Hollen said.Van Hollen and Abrego Garcia, who had not spoken to anyone outside prison since his deportation , met Thursday night at a hotel. Initially, only water was on the table. But Van Hollen said two additional glasses were later placed by a Salvadoran official — one seemingly a margarita with a salted rim and the other a similar-looking drink.“Let me just be very clear: Neither of us touched the drinks that were in front of us,” Van Hollen said. “Nobody drank any margaritas or sugar water or whatever it is.”The senator pointed out that the stunt appeared designed to suggest Abrego Garcia — who had spent time in one of Latin America’s harshest prisons — was relaxed and well-treated, despite evidence to the contrary. He even noted that the initial proposal was to hold the meeting beside a hotel pool, adding, “This is a guy who’s been in CECOT, this is a guy who’s been detained.”Van Hollen turned what might have been dismissed as a social media rumour into a pointed critique of Bukele’s administration and its public relations tactics, suggesting it was an attempt to mask systemic abuses and whitewash the state’s treatment of detainees.Also read: What Donald Trump said in first reaction on deported Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia linked to MS-13 “If you want to play a little Sherlock Holmes, I’ll tell you how you can,” he said, referring to the untouched rims of the glasses. “You would see a gap. There’s no gap.”The US government has acknowledged that Abrego Garcia’s deportation was a mistake. Van Hollen said the purpose of the meeting was to assess Abrego Garcia’s health and condition. The former detainee told him he had recently been moved out of CECOT and was doing well — a rare glimpse into the fate of deportees caught at the intersection of US immigration policy and Central American politics.",Senator Chris Van Hollen accused El Salvador ’s President Nayib Bukele of staging a deceptive media stunt during his meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

What is covid 'lab-leak' theory according to trump’s new website?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-covid-lab-leak-theory-according-to-trumps-new-website/articleshow/120421230.cms,"Unnatural Virus Characteristics: The virus allegedly has biological characteristics that are not typically found in nature, raising suspicions about its origins.

Single Introduction: Data shows that all Covid-19 cases trace back to a single introduction into humans, contrasting with past pandemics where multiple spillover events occurred.

Proximity to Wuhan Lab: The Wuhan Institute of Virology, which has conducted gain-of-function research (enhancing viruses for research), is located near the outbreak’s epicenter. The site points out that the lab has had issues with biosafety protocols, further raising concerns about a potential lab leak.

(enhancing viruses for research), is located near the outbreak’s epicenter. The site points out that the lab has had issues with biosafety protocols, further raising concerns about a potential lab leak. Sick Researchers: Several WIV researchers showed symptoms similar to Covid-19 in late 2019, months before the virus was linked to a wet market in Wuhan, adding to suspicions that the virus was released from the lab.

Absence of Natural Evidence: The website asserts that if there were evidence supporting a natural origin for Covid-19, it would have emerged by now. The lack of such evidence, according to the site, further strengthens the lab-leak theory.

In a significant shift in narrative, the White House’s newly revamped Covid-19 website has placed the controversial lab-leak theory at the forefront of its discussion on the origins of the virus. Previously a platform for public health information on vaccines and testing, the site now prominently features the claim that Covid-19 likely originated from a lab accident, specifically from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China.This marks a departure from the widely accepted narrative that the virus emerged naturally from an animal-to-human spillover, an idea that has been supported by much of the scientific community.One of the main components of the website is its criticism of the publication “The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2,” a study often cited to discredit the lab-leak theory. The White House claims that Dr. Anthony Fauci , former President Joe Biden’s top medical advisor, pushed this narrative in order to promote the idea that Covid-19 had a natural origin. The publication, the site argues, was used by public health officials and the media to silence the lab-leak theory in favour of a more widely accepted natural origin.The website outlines five key points that support the lab-leak theory:Additionally, the website criticizes EcoHealth Alliance , which was involved in funding research at WIV. The organization allegedly used U.S. taxpayer money for dangerous gain-of-function research, with accusations that it violated the terms of its National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant. The U.S. Department of Justice has since opened an investigation into EcoHealth’s pandemic-era activities.The revamped site also takes aim at public health measures such as mask mandates and social distancing, suggesting that these were arbitrary and lacked scientific backing. The site implies that these policies caused unnecessary harm to the economy and public well-being.Perhaps most controversially, the website accuses the Biden administration of obstructing investigations into the lab-leak theory, allegedly suppressing evidence and stifling dissenting views on the pandemic’s origins. The White House claims that the administration colluded with social media platforms to censor alternative health narratives, including those questioning the natural origin of the virus.As the debate over the virus’s origins intensifies, experts caution that the renewed focus on the lab-leak theory could undermine ongoing efforts to manage and mitigate Covid-19’s impact. While the theory remains a contentious issue, the White House’s decision to highlight it on the official website signals a significant shift in how the origins of the pandemic are being discussed at the highest levels of government.","The White House’s newly revamped Covid-19 website has placed the controversial lab-leak theory at the forefront of its discussion on the origins of the virus.

Texas stabbing tragedy: Murdered teen's house swatted with fake shooting report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-stabbing-tragedy-murdered-teens-house-swatted-with-fake-shooting-report/articleshow/120417471.cms,"Austin Metcalf's (left) family was swatted by a fake shooting call on Thursday.

The family of Austin Metcalf allegedly killed by Karmelo Anthony at a track meet earlier this month was targeted by a sick prank as cops rushed to the Metcalfs' home acting on a fake shooting report . This took place hours after Metcalf's father was booted out if a press conference that Anthony's family held to clear the air about some misconception after their son walked out of prison on bond. The two families stay in the same area but did not know each other and neither did the teens know each other. Karmelo claimed he stabbed Austin Metcalf in self-defense as Metcalf put his hands on him first.Since the tragedy, the families have been indirectly attacking each other and that escalated after Anthony was released on a bond. According to the court rule, Anthony is not supposed to contact the Metcalf family and hence they made it a point to remove Metcalf's father from their press conference.Police in Frisco, Texas, described the incident as “swatting,” a prank in which someone reports a fake crime to get cops to swarm the victims’ home, according to WFAA.At the press conference, Anthony's mother Kala Hayes said that her family is under attack. “Whatever you think that happened between Karmelo and the Metcalf boys, my three younger children, my husband and I didn’t do anything to deserve to be threatened, harassed and lied about,” she said fighting back tears.The stabbing has taken a racial overtone as the Anthonys are black. They managed to raise a huge amount of money through donations for Anthony's legal fund. But they apparently did not use that money for Anthony's release and moved to a new house and bought a new car.“Three years ago, my family moved to North Texas, searching for a better life,” she said. “Like so many other families, we wanted to give our children the future we did not have. My husband works hard every single day to provide for us, to make sure we [are] in the best financial position possible. As a stay-at-home mom, I made it my life’s mission to ensure our children are loved, nurtured, and supported every step of the way. In the wake of this tragic incident, our family has been under attack.”“The lies and false accusations that have been said about us, especially over the past week, [have] been overwhelming,” she said. “The lies and their amplification put my family in danger, as well as everyone in our community, everyone involved in the investigation, from the police, the attorneys, and the court staff.”",The family of Austin Metcalf allegedly killed by Karmelo Anthony at a track meet earlier this month was targeted by a sick prank as cops rushed to their home acting on a fake shooting report.

'Now sipping margaritas with senator': Fresh images of deported US resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia amid legal row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/now-sipping-margaritas-with-senator-fresh-images-of-deported-us-resident-kilmar-abrego-garcia-amid-legal-row/articleshow/120397168.cms,"Fresh images of deported Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia emerged Thursday after El Salvador President Nayib Bukele posted photos of him sipping margaritas with US Senator Chris Van Hollen , sparking a new wave of controversy around the 29-year-old’s detention.Bukele in a post on X said, “Now that he’s been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador’s custody. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture’, now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!🍹”The meeting comes months after Abrego Garcia was deported in March by the Trump administration despite an active immigration court order blocking his removal. His lawyers have since been fighting for his return to the United States, accusing the administration of violating due process and international law.Sen. Van Hollen, who travelled to El Salvador this week to push for Abrego Garcia’s release, said he met the detainee on Thursday and called his wife to “pass along his message of love.” Earlier that day, Van Hollen said he was denied access to the high-security CECOT prison, where he believes Abrego Garcia had been held.“They stopped us because they are under orders not to allow us to proceed,” the senator said, describing how soldiers turned his vehicle away just kilometres from the facility.The Trump administration acknowledged the deportation as a “mistake” and the US Supreme Court has urged officials to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return. However, El Salvador’s Vice President Félix Ulloa reportedly told Van Hollen that their government has no intention of sending him back.Meanwhile, human rights groups have accused President Bukele’s administration of mistreating detainees in the country’s sprawling gang prison system. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national and former Maryland resident, has not been charged with any crime in the US , though Trump officials have claimed he has ties to the MS-13 gang — allegations his lawyers say remain unsubstantiated.“This is about due process and the rule of law,” Van Hollen said. “We won’t give up until Kilmar has his due process rights respected.”The senator’s visit has deepened partisan tensions back home. While Democrats argue the deportation exemplifies the Trump administration’s disregard for court orders, Republicans have rallied around the crackdown. GOP lawmakers, including Rep. Riley Moore of West Virginia and Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, have toured the CECOT prison in support of Trump's immigration policy. Moore wrote on social media that the facility “houses the country’s most brutal criminals,” while Smith praised Trump for its expansion to include “illegal immigrants who broke into our country and committed violent acts against Americans.”More Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, are reportedly planning similar visits. Since March, El Salvador has received over 200 deportees from the US , many accused of gang affiliations, and detained them in the controversial maximum-security prison outside San Salvador.Court documents show the US government has repeatedly declined to disclose its plans for Abrego Garcia’s repatriation, further fuelling legal battles and international scrutiny over the case.","El Salvador President Nayib Bukele posted photos of Kilmar Abrego Garcia sipping margaritas with US Senator Chris Van Hollen.

Poll What should be the top priority in global conflict resolution? Strategic resource agreements Ceasefire and peace talks

US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Friday warned that Washington could walk away from its push to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine within days, unless progress becomes visible soon.Speaking in Paris after high-level discussions with European and Ukrainian leaders, Rubio said the Trump administration was assessing whether the effort remains viable.“We're not going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end,” Rubio said. “So we need to determine very quickly now, and I'm talking about a matter of days whether or not this is doable in the next few weeks. If it is, we're in. If it's not, then we have other priorities to focus on as well”, he added.The comments came following meetings hosted by France, the first since US President Donald Trump’s inauguration where top American, European and Ukrainian officials convened to discuss ending the war.According to news agency AP, French officials expect a follow-up meeting in London early next week, which Rubio said he may attend.Despite acknowledging “constructive” talks and an emerging outline for a peace framework, Rubio stressed urgency. “We need to figure out here now within a matter of days whether this is doable in the short term, because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on,” he told reporters at Le Bourget airport.Efforts by Rubio and Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff have included multiple rounds of negotiation in Saudi Arabia and at least three meetings between Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin However, Russia has so far refused a comprehensive ceasefire proposed by Trump and supported by Ukraine, demanding Kyiv halt military mobilisation and Western arms supplies, conditions rejected by Ukraine.Trump, who had pledged during his campaign to end the war within 24 hours of taking office, later said a deal could come by April or May. But talks have dragged amid escalating disagreements, including a public spat in February between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House.Trump added fuel to the tension Thursday by saying, “I don't hold Zelenskyy responsible but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started”. He added, “I'm not blaming him, but what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job, OK? I am not a big fan.”Zelenskyy, earlier in the week, invited Trump to visit Ukraine to witness the war's destruction firsthand, an invitation that Trump dismissed with threats directed at CBS, which aired the Ukrainian president’s interview.Meanwhile, both sides have moved closer to a controversial minerals agreement.According to The New York Times, a memorandum of understanding was signed Thursday between Kyiv and Washington, paving the way for a future deal on Ukraine’s strategic resources.","US secretary of state Marco Rubio warned that Washington could walk away from its push to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine within days.

Chicago shooting in Lincoln Park leaves man dead; 2 seen fleeing scene

Kevin Patel, a 28-year-old man, was shot and killed in Chicago’s Lincoln Park neighbourhood on Wednesday night.According to the Chicago police department, the shooting happened around 9:20 pm in the 800-block of West Lill Avenue. Officers responded to reports of gunfire and found Patel lying on the sidewalk with a gunshot wound to the chest. He was rushed to Illinois Masonic Medical Center, where he later died. The Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office later confirmed his identity.Garrett Moores, a neighbour who rushed to Patel's side, described the desperate attempt to save his life. “I grabbed towels and ran down,” he said. Guided by a 911 operator, Moores and another neighbour tried chest compressions and worked to keep Patel conscious. “You almost build a personal connection in those moments. It was devastating,” Moores added, reported ABC 7 Chicago.The incident happened just yards away from 43rd Ward Alderman Timmy Knudsen’s office. He addressed the violence in a statement, calling it a reminder of the ongoing fight against citywide crime. He said he has asked for increased patrols and more support from City Hall, especially with summer approaching.Witnesses reported seeing a man and a woman running from the area shortly before police arrived. No arrests have been made, and Area Three detectives are continuing the investigation.","Kevin Patel, a 28-year-old man, was shot and killed in Chicago’s Lincoln Park neighbourhood on Wednesday night.

"White House revamps Covid-19 website to promote ‘lab-leak’ theory, targets Fauci and Biden",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-revamps-covid-19-website-to-promote-lab-leak-theory-targets-fauci-and-biden/articleshow/120420902.cms,"The website lists five key points, suggesting that Covid-19's origins were not natural.



The White House on Friday launched a revamped version of its Covid-19 website, placing the controversial lab-leak theory at the centre of its narrative on the pandemic’s origins. The update marks a sharp shift in tone, accusing former president Joe Biden and his top medical advisor, Dr Anthony Fauci , of suppressing debate over the virus's origin and mishandling pandemic responses.The new page on Covid.gov, which previously served as a public resource for vaccines and testing, now features a prominent image of President Donald Trump and a banner declaring: “LAB LEAK, The True Origins of Covid-19.”""This website shows the true origins of Covid-19 and how Democrats and the media discredited alternative health treatments and the lab-leak theory,"" the White House said in a statement.The site outlines five key arguments to support the lab-leak claim, citing Wuhan’s proximity to China’s top SARS research lab, claims of inadequate biosafety protocols, and assertions that early infections stemmed from a single introduction into humans—suggesting a controlled environment rather than natural spillover.""The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2 publication, which was used repeatedly by public health officials and the media to discredit the lab-leak theory, was promoted by Dr. Fauci to push the preferred narrative that Covid-19 originated naturally,"" the site alleges.It also accuses Biden-era public health officials of censoring dissent and engaging in a “multi-year campaign of delay, confusion and non-responsiveness.”The move comes weeks after the CIA updated its assessment, stating it was now “more likely” that the virus leaked from a Chinese lab—reversing its earlier position that there was insufficient evidence to determine Covid-19’s origin. The FBI and the Department of Energy had previously expressed similar views, although confidence levels vary.China has repeatedly rejected the lab-leak theory, calling it “extremely unlikely,” and urged the United States to stop politicising the issue of origin tracing.The updated site also criticises early pandemic measures such as mask mandates and social distancing, and features an animated map of Wuhan. A section titled “Covid-19 misinformation” accuses the previous administration of colluding with social media platforms to suppress alternative views and promote only official guidance.Jamie Metzl, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said: “I welcome all efforts to dig deeper. But it would be a terrible shame if such efforts distracted from essential work to help prevent further infections and treat people suffering from Covid-19 and long Covid,” speaking to NPR.The rollout of the site comes amid sweeping restructuring efforts at US health agencies under Trump’s administration, with around 10,000 job cuts reportedly planned. Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known for his vaccine scepticism, has said the shake-up is part of a wider push to prioritise chronic disease prevention.Covid-19 and related illnesses have claimed more than one million lives in the US, with millions more affected worldwide.1. The virus possesses a biological characteristic that is not found in nature.2. According to the data, all cases of Covid-19 stem from a single introduction into humans, which is contrary to previous pandemics, where there were multiple spillover events.3. Wuhan is home to China’s foremost SARS research lab, which has a history of conducting gain-of-function research (gene altering and organism supercharging) without adequate biosafety.4. The researchers at Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) were sick with Covid-like symptoms in the fall of 2019, months before Covid-19 was discovered at the wet market.5. The website asserts that if there were evidence supporting a natural origin for Covid-19, it would have emerged by now. The lack of such evidence, according to the site, further strengthens the lab-leak theory.","Covid-19 and related illnesses have claimed more than one million lives in the US, with millions more affected worldwide.

What Donald Trump said in first reaction on deported Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia linked to MS-13,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-donald-trump-said-in-first-reaction-on-deported-maryland-man-linked-to-ms-13-kilmar-abrego-garcia/articleshow/120420017.cms,"US President Donald Trump on Friday defended the controversial deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia , a Maryland resident sent to El Salvador last month despite a court order protecting him from removal.Sharing a photo of a tattooed hand allegedly belonging to Abrego Garcia, Trump said, “This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such ‘a fine and innocent person.’ They said he is not a member of MS-13, even though he’s got MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles... I must be allowed to do my job. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”Trump's remarks came amid renewed political controversy following the release of fresh images of Abrego Garcia, who appeared relaxed and smiling while sipping margaritas with Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen in El Salvador.The images were posted on X by El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, who mocked earlier claims that Abrego Garcia was being tortured, saying: “Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture’, now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen.”Meanwhile, Donald Trump intensified his criticism of the Biden administration and said, ""Sleepy Joe Biden, THE WORST PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES, has allowed millions and millions of Criminals, many of them murderers, drug dealers, and people released from prisons and mental institutions from all around the world, to enter our Country through it’s very dangerous and ill conceived Open Border. Sorry, but it’s my job to get these killers and thugs out of here. THAT’S WHAT I GOT ELECTED TO DO. MAGA!""Abrego Garcia, 29, was deported on March 15 despite an active US immigration court order blocking his removal. His lawyers claim the deportation violated both due process and international law. The US Supreme Court has upheld a lower court's ruling demanding efforts to return him, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted Wednesday that “Abrego Garcia will never live in the United States of America,” alleging MS-13 ties and domestic violence accusations.His wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, has denied those claims, stating the restraining order cited by Leavitt was filed “out of caution” and later resolved through counselling. “This is about due process and the rule of law,” Van Hollen said after meeting Abrego Garcia on Thursday. “We won’t give up until Kilmar has his due process rights respected.”Senator Van Hollen’s visit to El Salvador was partly blocked by Salvadoran officials, who refused him access to the high-security CECOT prison where Abrego Garcia was reportedly held. El Salvador’s Vice President Félix Ulloa also rejected a request to release the detainee, saying his government has no plans to return him.Democrats argue the case illustrates the Trump administration’s disregard for legal norms, with Rep. Robert Garcia calling it “a constitutional crisis.” A Democratic delegation, including Sen. Cory Booker and Rep. Maxwell Frost, is planning a visit to El Salvador to assess Abrego Garcia’s status.Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers have praised the deportation. Reps. Riley Moore and Jason Smith visited the CECOT prison, supporting Trump’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants. The administration has also invoked past crimes by Salvadoran nationals in the US to justify its policy, including the 2023 murder of Rachel Morin.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29, was deported on March 15 despite an active US immigration court order blocking his removal.

Judge orders Tufts student Rumeysa Ozturk detained in Louisiana must be returned by May 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-orders-tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk-detained-in-louisiana-must-be-returned-by-may-1/articleshow/120418549.cms,"Rumeysa Ozturk (AP Photo)

A Turkish student Rumeysa Ozturk from Tufts University , detained in a Louisiana immigration facility, must be transported back to New England by May 1 for a hearing to assess the legality of her detention following her co-authorship of an opinion piece in the student newspaper, as ordered by a federal judge on Friday.In Burlington, Vermont, U.S. District Judge William Sessions scheduled a bail hearing for May 9 and a merit hearing for May 22. Whilst Ozturk's legal team sought immediate release or transfer to Vermont, the justice department contended that jurisdiction belonged to a Louisiana immigration court.The judge stated in his ruling that the proceedings would continue with Ozturk physically present, acknowledging the seriousness of her habeas claims and committing to an expeditious review process.The case emerged after the 30-year-old doctoral candidate was apprehended by masked immigration officials on March 25 whilst walking in a Boston suburb. She was subsequently transported through New Hampshire and Vermont before being flown to Basile, Louisiana. On Wednesday, an immigration judge refused bond, citing concerns about danger and flight risk.Ozturk's situation reflects a broader pattern involving university-affiliated individuals whose U.S. visas were cancelled or entry denied following allegations of Palestinian support or protest participation. A similar case involves Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, whom authorities seek to deport based on national security concerns.Initially, Ozturk's legal representatives filed in Massachusetts, hampered by uncertainty about her location and communication restrictions. Ozturk reported making several unsuccessful attempts to contact legal counsel.The controversy stems from an opinion piece Ozturk co-authored with three other students in ""The Tufts Daily"", criticising the university's handling of student activists' demands regarding Palestinian issues and Israeli-linked investments.Her legal team argues that the detention violates constitutional rights, including freedom of speech and due process. While Judge Sessions acknowledged the plausibility of these constitutional claims, he determined they were insufficient for immediate release.A Department of Homeland Security representative claimed last month that investigations revealed Ozturk's involvement with Hamas, a designated terrorist organisation, though no supporting evidence was provided.","Rumeysa Ozturk must be transported back to New England by May 1 for a hearing to assess the legality of her detention.

Who is Natasha Chand? Her past police cases includes shoplifting



A woman has gone viral for hurling the N word nine times in a 12-second viral video -- sitting inside a car in what looked like a parking lot spot. While the California Police opened a hate crime probe into the incident without revealing the name of the woman, social media users believe she is Natasha Chand , a 34-year-old Indo-Fijian. DailyMail also reported that she was born in Fiji but has Indian heritage, according to her social media.Jazlyn Garcia and her sister were at the receiving end of Natasha's abuses. The viral video and the abuses I only half of what all Natasha said, the two women confirmed to the police. They only started capturing when she used the N word.""Get out of my face you f**king n****r,"" Natasha screamed.Garcia is 'black/Mexican', according to a friend who put the video online. Pinole Police Sergeant Justin Rogers said the altercation began when Garcia and her twin sister came out of the diner. The pair confronted her and the argument soon escalated into a screaming match with insults and challenges to single combat coming from both sides.""They were basically like, ""what's up, yeah you're trying to fight"" and she said when people where they're from in the Bay Area look at you like that then it means that they wanna start something,"" Rogers told DailyMail.com.Natasha Chand used to work at BMO bank in Pinole, California, the Daily Mail reported. Chand was previously arrested on February 4 in a separate case after allegedly robbing an Ulta Beauty store in nearby Concord, California, four times. She faces felony grand theft and second-degree burglary charges and three counts of misdemeanor shoplifting. Chand faced court in Martinez, California, on Sunday morning for a felony readiness conference - just hours before the racist abuse.","A woman has gone viral for hurling the N word nine times in a 12-second viral video -- sitting inside a car in what looked like a parking lot spot.

Amid controversy over the Donald Trump administration's unwillingness to bring him back from El Salvador, the White House X account Friday did the unimaginable.It picked an NYT report of Maryland senator Chris Van Hollen meeting Garcia in El Salvador, outside the prison, and proof-checked it.

Donald Trump mocked him and said he looked like a fool begging for attention for 'fake news media'.But the White House official handle's meddling in the issue, and that too targeting NYT, came across as a low-blow to many who wondered whether it was White House adviser Stephen Miller behind those worlds.""The official White House Twitter account is such an embarrassment.

The American Immigration Lawyers Association has revealed a study claiming that 50 per cent of the reported cases of US students whose visas got revoked are Indian. The association examined 327 reports of visa revocations by the Donald Trump administration and found out India leads the list followed by China with 14 per cent of Chinese students being at the receiving end of Trump's crackdown on visas.The study found out that a total of 50 per cent of visa revocations impacted those who were on Optional Practical Training (OPT), which means they had graduated and were employed in the United States.While the Trump administration has been reiterating that the visa crackdowns are not without any reason and most plausible reason is involvement in political unrest, the report claimed that of the total cases, only two students reported any history of engaging in political protests. “While 86% reported some level of interaction with the police, 33% had their case dismissed, were never charged, or were never prosecuted,” said the lawyers’ association. Two of the students who had reported interaction with the police are complainants in domestic violence cases. Some of the others had speeding tickets and parking-related violations.“Based on these reports, it is clear that transparency, oversight and accountability are needed to prevent further arbitrary visa revocations and SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System) record terminations,” said the association. “Finally, there should be a way for students to appeal SEVIS terminations that are inaccurate without facing a gap in their employment or requiring the university to be involved, given the sheer number of those impacted.”The report stated that, according to a verified source, ICE has terminated 4,736 SEVIS records since January 20, 2025, the majority on F-1 status.Only 14 per cent of students reported receiving notice from ICE and they were all on OPT.

Judge Arun Subramanian and Diddy case so far



US district judge Arun Subramanian has set a precedent for handling the lawsuits against Sean Diddy with utmost strictness never allowing the pop mogul, accused of sexual exploitation among many other charges, to walk out of jail on bond. On Friday, the judge rules against Comb's request to push back the start of his federal trial by two months after its scheduled May 5 date.Combs' attorneys made the original request in a motion filed April 16 in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, according to court documents.Combs was arrested in September 2024 on charges of sex trafficking racketeering. He pleaded not guilty to the charges. Prosecutors with the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office say Combs used his business empire to sexually abuse women between 2004 and 2024. Combs’ lawyers say the sexual activity described by prosecutors was consensual.In a court filing on Wednesday, Combs’ lawyer Marc Agnifilo asked Subramanian to delay the trial because he needed more time to prepare his defense to new charges brought on April 4. Agnifilo also said the defense needed more time to review emails it wants an alleged victim to turn over.In October 2024, Subramanian was assigned to preside over Combs’ case following the recusal of Judge Andrew L Carter Jr, who had indicated he might reallocate the case due to scheduling conflicts. The reassignment provided Combs’ legal team with a fresh opportunity to pursue bail, but that did not happen as Subramanian denied Comb's third and fourth bail citing ""compelling evidence"" of Combs’ propensity for violence and a “serious risk of witness tampering.”On October 10, 2024, Subramanian set the trial date for May 5, 2025, establishing a clear timeline for the proceedings. He later outlined a pretrial schedule, with jury questionnaires starting April 28, 2025, jury selection on May 5, and opening statements on May 12","US district judge Arun Subramanian has set a precedent for handling the lawsuits against Sean Diddy with utmost strictness.

Ahmadiyya minority beaten to death by anti-blasphemy group in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/ahmadiyya-minority-beaten-to-death-by-anti-blasphemy-group-in-pakistan/articleshow/120412129.cms,"A member of Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya community was beaten to death on Friday after a mob of radical surrounded an Ahmadi place of worship in Karachi’s Saddar neighbourhood.The crowd, having many from the anti blasphemy political groupTehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), forced their way through narrow streets chanting anti-Ahmadi slogans before surrounding the colonial-era worship site. Tensions quickly escalated when the group accused the minority community of violating Pakistan’s controversial anti-Ahmadi laws.“One member of the community was killed after the mob identified him as an Ahmadi,” said Muhammad Safdar, a senior police official in Karachi.“They attacked him with sticks and bricks.”Police said members of several religious parties were part of the mob. To protect others from further violence, officers took around 25 Ahmadis into custody and moved them away in a police-escorted van after negotiating with the crowd, which had swelled to around 600 people.The Ahmadiyya community, considered heretical by Pakistan’s state and many religious groups, has long faced systemic discrimination. Ahmadis, who have a population of almost 10 million worldwide, consider themselves Muslims and have faith identical to mainstream Islam in almost every manner. Though they regard themselves as Muslim, a 1974 constitutional amendment declared them non-Muslim, and a 1984 ordinance criminalised many of their religious practices.Friday’s killing is the latest in a long history of persecution. According to community records, six Ahmadis have been killed in 2024 so far, with over 280 killed since 1984. Thousands more have faced criminal charges, including hundreds under Pakistan’s harsh blasphemy laws.Abdul Qadir Ashrafi, a 52-year-old businessman who took part in the protest, said the group’s intention was to pressure police to act against the Ahmadis.“We requested that the place be sealed and that those conducting the Friday prayers be arrested, with criminal proceedings initiated against them,” he told AFP.The human rights commission of Pakistan condemned the attack, saying it was ""appalled by the orchestrated attack by a far-right religious party on a colonial-era Ahmadi place of worship.""“This failure of law and order is a stark reminder of the continued complicity of the state in the systematic persecution of a beleaguered community,” the commission posted on social media platform X.Mob violence has become an all-too-common response to accusations of blasphemy in Pakistan, often with deadly consequences. In a similar incident last year, dozens of churches were torched in the city of Jaranwala after a Christian man was falsely accused of blasphemy.","A member of Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya community was beaten to death on Friday after a mob of radical surrounded an Ahmadi place of worship in Karachi.

Baloch separatists kill 8 Pakistanis in Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/baloch-separatists-kill-8-pakistanis-in-iran/articleshow/120262403.cms,"ISLAMABAD:

Eight Pakistani car mechanics were shot dead in Iran late Saturday, sparking outrage and deepening fears that the country was becoming a hub for anti-Pakistan militants after Afghanistan.Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack in Sistan-Baluchestan province, escalating tensions between the neighbouring countries as Pakistan demanded swift action. The eight workers hailed from Punjab -- Pakistan’s most populous province -- and were killed at a workshop in Mehrestan district, near Afghanistan’s border, Pakistani authorities said.BNA framed the killings as retaliation against perceived Punjabi dominance in Balochistan’s economic and political spheres. “We will not allow outsiders to exploit our land and resources,” BNA said in an online statement, echoing long-standing Baloch grievances over resource exploitation and marginalisation. The outfit has aligned itself with the broader Baloch insurgency led by groups like Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif called the attack “barbaric”. “We demand the perpetrators be brought to justice swiftly,” he said, urging Tehran to act. Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to help the victims’ families and repatriate the bodies. Foreign minister Ishaq Dar issued a similar condemnation. “This attack challenges our sovereignty. We cannot allow our citizens to be targeted abroad,” Dar said.Iran’s response was measured but conspicuously vague. Ambassador Reza Amiri Moghadam condemned the killings as “inhumane and cowardly”, calling terrorism a “chronic plight” that demands regional cooperation. Yet, Tehran offered no concrete assurances of cracking down on groups like BNA, prompting scepticism in Islamabad.Thousands of Pakistanis, particularly from economically deprived areas, travel to Iran on a regular basis to take up informal jobs in sectors such as vehicle repairs, construction, and agriculture.In Jan 2024, nine Pakistani labourers were killed and three critically injured in a similar attack in Saravancity, also located in Iran’s southeastern border region. Like in the latest killings, the victims in that case worked in an automobile repair shop. These murders occurred at a time when Pakistan and Iran were attempting to repair diplomatic relations after tit-for-tat missile and drone attacks.","Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack.

Poll Do you believe that Pakistan is adequately prepared for earthquakes? No Yes

A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.Tremors were felt across many parts of the Valley, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or property damage. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometres, with coordinates of 33.63 degrees North latitude and 72.46 degrees East longitude.According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the recent earthquake struck at a shallow depth of 10km, increasing the likelihood of aftershocks.Shallow earthquakes are typically more dangerous than deeper ones because the seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface, causing stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and higher casualties.Pakistan, located on the boundary of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, is one of the most seismically active countries. The nation frequently experiences destructive earthquakes due to its position on major fault lines. Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and Gilgit-Baltistan lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir are on the north-western edge of the Indian plate.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's aggressive push for international investment in its mines and minerals sector has ignited a firestorm of dissent in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) regions.The Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum 2025 , held in Islamabad on April 8-9, was billed as a golden opportunity to unlock ""trillions of dollars"" of the country's mineral wealth. The event drew over 300 delegates from nations like the US, Saudi Arabia and China. The forum has deepened the divide between the centre and provinces. Locals in accuse Islamabad of tightening its grip on their wealth for the benefit of foreign powers and the central elite.Addressing the forum, PM Shehbaz Sharif said: ""If we harness these vast reserves, Pakistan can bid farewell to global lenders."" His words, however, ring hollow in Balochistan, where Reko Dik copper-gold mine has become a lightning rod for dissent.The province has endured decades of neglect while its resources are siphoned off to benefit the elite. KP's gemstones have long been a source of pride, yet locals say they see little of the profits.""The mountains bleed wealth, but our children starve,"" said a tribal elder. In Gilgit-Baltistan, where gold, uranium and gems abound, protests were held over leases to Chinese firms. Leaders in PoK, known for ruby and sapphire deposits, have long demanded autonomy over resources.

Poll Should the Pakistani military have a role in politics? No, it undermines democracy. Yes, they provide stability.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political landscape remains a battleground of competing forces, with the military, former prime minister Imran Khan, and the current govt under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif locked in a tense struggle.The interplay of US foreign policy and the Pakistani diaspora’s growing voice adds further complexity to a nation grappling with economic woes, security threats and democratic erosion.Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars. Convicted on corruption and state secret charges, the cricketer-turned-politician retains a fervent base, accusing the military and Sharif’s govt of colluding with the US to orchestrate his downfall.Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) alleges widespread rigging in the Feb 2024 elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secure power through a fragile coalition. PTI supporters, galvanised by Khan’s claims, have staged protests, clashing with the security forces and deepening the political divide.The military, longtime kingmaker in Pakistani politics, appears to have shifted allegiance. Once Khan’s backer in his 2018 rise, the army soured on him after policy disputes and his public criticisms of General Asim Munir, the current army chief.Analysts suggest the military now props up Sharif’s govt, a dynamic evident in legislative moves like the 2023 Pakistan Army Act amendment, which stifled dissent and empowered the armed forces. This hybrid regime – blending electoral democracy with military influence – has drawn scrutiny for undermining constitutional norms, yet the generals show no sign of relinquishing their grip.However, Shehbaz Sharif, re-elected in March 2024 as PM, faces a legitimacy crisis. His coalition, including the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and other smaller factions, struggles to address surging militant attacks, crumbling infrastructure, and an economy reliant on IMF bailouts.Sharif vows to mend ties with Washington but his govt’s dependence on military support raises questions about its autonomy. Khan’s call for an election audit, echoed in a letter to the IMF, threatens to derail these efforts as Pakistan awaits a critical loan installment.The US role remains contentious. Khan’s unproven claims of a Washington-led conspiracy resonate with a populace wary of foreign interference, a sentiment rooted in decades of strained relations. The Biden administration, while engaging Sharif’s govt, has maintained robust military ties with Pakistan, prioritising counter-terrorism over democratic concerns. This ambivalence has fuelled Khan’s narrative, even as US officials dismiss his allegations.Meanwhile, the Pakistani diaspora, particularly in the US, has emerged as a vocal force. Pro-democracy activists, many aligned with PTI, have lobbied Congress, securing bipartisan support for resolutions condemning elections irregularities and Khan’s detention. Over 100 lawmakers have urged his release, while some advocate sanctions against military leaders like Munir. This diaspora-driven pressure marks a shift, challenging the traditional US-Pakistan security nexus.As Pakistan teeters between chaos and stability, the military’s shadow looms large, Khan’s defiance endures, and Sharif’s govt navigates a treacherous path. With the US and Pakistani diaspora adding external weight, the nation’s democratic future hangs in the balance.","Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars.

Poll Do you support the call for a long march by Sardar Akhtar Mengal? No, I do not support it. Yes, I support it.

ISLAMABAD: A tense standoff unfolded across Balochistan on Monday as a shutter-down strike and widespread road blockades sparked by nationalist leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal ’s call for a “long march” from Lakpass to Quetta paralysed the Pakistani province.The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists, including women leaders of Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC), amid escalating clashes with authorities.Shops businesses and schools remained closed in cities like Quetta, Kalat, Mastung Khuzdar, and Gwadar. Mengal’s supporters blocked key highways, including the Quetta-Karachi national highway.The provincial govt’s deployment of containers, trenches, and police checkpoints at Lakpass, roughly 30 km from Quetta, stalled the march, forcing demonstrators onto rugged mountain routes.Reports of police using teargas and shelling BNP-M workers have intensified the unrest.Mengal, addressing a sit-in at Lakpass, accused the state of oppression and vowed to press forward. “The state may crush us, but we won’t bow,” he declared, signalling plans to escalate the march into province-wide resistance. The protest began March 28 in Wadh, Mengal’s hometown, following the arrest of BYC leaders, including Mahrang Baloch, during a crackdown on their Quetta sit-in. A suicide bombing near the rally on March 29 left Mengal unharmed but underscored the volatile stakes.Balochistan’s govt, led by chief minister Sarfraz Bugti, has taken a hard line. His spokesperson, Shahid Rind, warned Mengal of arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Act if the march entered Quetta’s Red Zone.Negotiations have faltered, with Mengal dismissing the provincial govt’s delegations as powerless to meet demands. BYC, however, rallied behind Mengal, urging highway blockades and strikes to amplify pressure.Analysts see it as a critical juncture for Balochistan, where grievances over state repression, enforced disappearances and resource exploitation fuel dissent. The shutter-down has disrupted public life, with Quetta’s land links to 12 districts severed for over a week. With cellular networks down and security tightened, the province braces for what Mengal’s supporters call a defining fight.","The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists.

Ice stupas

Harvest seasons multiply

HUSSAINABAD: At the foot of Pakistan's impossibly high mountains whitened by frost all year round, farmers grappling with a lack of water have created their own ice towers.Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan, a remote region home to K2, the world's second-highest peak.Farmers in the Skardu valley, at an altitude of up to 2,600 metres (8,200 feet) in the shadow of the Karakoram mountain range, searched online for help in how to irrigate their apple and apricot orchards.""We discovered artificial glaciers on YouTube,"" Ghulam Haider Hashmi told AFP.They watched the videos of Sonam Wangchuk , an environmental activist and engineer in the Indian region of Ladakh, less than 200 kilometres away across a heavily patrolled border, who developed the technique about 10 years ago.Water is piped from streams into the village, and sprayed into the air during the freezing winter temperatures.""The water must be propelled so that it freezes in the air when temperatures drop below zero, creating ice towers,"" said Zakir Hussain Zakir, a professor at the University of Baltistan.The ice forms in the shape of cones that resemble Buddhist stupas, and act as a storage system -- steadily melting throughout spring when temperatures rise.Gilgit-Baltistan has 13,000 glaciers -- more than any other country on Earth outside the polar regions.Their beauty has made the region one of the country's top tourist destinations -- towering peaks loom over the Old Silk Road, still visible from a highway transporting tourists between cherry orchards, glaciers and ice-blue lakes.Sher Muhammad, a specialist in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan mountain range that stretches from Afghanistan to Myanmar, however said most of the region's water supply comes from snow melt in spring, with a fraction from annual glacial melt in summers.""From late October until early April, we were receiving heavy snowfall. But in the past few years, it's quite dry,"" Muhammad, a researcher at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), told AFP.The first ""ice stupas"" in Gilgit-Baltistan were created in 2018.Now, more than 20 villages make them every winter, and ""more than 16,000 residents have access to water without having to build reservoirs or tanks"", said Rashid-ud-Din, provincial head of GLOF-2, a UN-Pakistan plan to adapt to the effects of climate change.Farmer Muhammad Raza told AFP that eight stupas were built in his village of Hussainabad this winter, trapping approximately 20 million litres of water in the ice.""We no longer have water shortages during planting,"" he said, since the open-air reservoirs appeared on the slopes of the valley.""Before, we had to wait for the glaciers to melt in June to get water, but the stupas saved our fields,"" said Ali Kazim, also a farmer in the valley.Before the stupas, ""we planted our crops in May"", said 26-year-old Bashir Ahmed who grows potatoes, wheat and barley in nearby Pari village which has also adopted the method.And ""we only had one growing season, whereas now we can plant two or three times"" a year.Temperatures in Pakistan rose twice as fast between 1981 and 2005 compared to the global average, putting the country on the front line of climate change impacts, including water scarcity.Its 240 million inhabitants live in a territory that is 80 percent arid or semi-arid and depends on rivers and streams originating in neighbouring countries for more than three-quarters of its water.Glaciers are melting rapidly in Pakistan and across the world, with a few exceptions including the Karakoram mountain range, increasing the risk of flooding and reducing water supply over the long term.""Faced with climate change, there are neither rich nor poor, neither urban nor rural; the whole world has become vulnerable,"" said 24-year-old Yasir Parvi.""In our village, with the ice stupas, we decided to take a chance.""","Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan. More than 20 villages make the ice stupas every winter, which provides 16,000 residents access to water. Water is piped from streams into the village and sprayed into the air during the freezing winter temperatures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120037712,imgsize-1455365,width-400,resizemode-4/article-15.jpg"

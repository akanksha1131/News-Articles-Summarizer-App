Set to take place on 14 December, the contest originally offered a “Toronto Manz” prize pack, featuring a bottle of Hennessy, Backwoods cigars, and other themed goodies. However, it received an unexpected and thrilling boost when Drake himself stepped in.In a message to the bakery, the Canadian rapper announced, “I’m adding 10 bands to the look alike contest. As the main prize.” The bakery’s response was a mix of shock and delight. “Just give me a min to stop hyperventilating this moment,” they replied. “I can't believe this is ur account and u know about this omg I love you.”The bakery later shared its excitement with followers on Instagram, writing, “I can barely type and a whole shock went through my body. But yes this is true and real & I hope the Drake doppelgängers ready.”The trend of celebrity lookalike contests has been gathering steam globally.In early December, a Rocky and Adrian look-alike contest was organised during Philadelphia’s RockyFest on Friday. The event, held at the University of Pennsylvania’s 1923 Ice Rink, aimed to recreate the first date between Rocky and Adrian from the 1976 film Rocky. Although the boxer doesn’t actually skate in the scene, he shuffles alongside Adrian as she struggles to stay upright.The contest’s winners, New York City firefighters Jason and Roxanne Carrion, received a prize that included a dinner at South Philadelphia’s Victor Café, a hotel stay, and a $250 gift certificate for a Rocky-themed shop.Roxanne described the event as her “dream date”, while Jason expressed their shared passion for the film, calling themselves the biggest Rocky fans. The five-day festival marks nearly 50 years of Rocky’s enduring appeal, celebrated with murals, movie marathons, and tours.In October, New York’s Washington Square Park hosted a Timothée Chalamet contest, where the actor himself made a surprise appearance, posing with participants dressed as his characters from Wonka and Dune. Though the event was disrupted by police due to its scale, it captured widespread attention.In November, Dublin witnessed a Paul Mescal lookalike competition, which the Normal People star endorsed on TikTok, drawing crowds of “big strong boys” in short shorts to Smithfield Square. London, too, saw a gathering of shaggy-haired Harry Styles lookalikes in Soho Square earlier this year.With the added incentive of $10,000, the bakery's contest is sure to attract a host of creative participants eager to channel Drake’s unmistakable aesthetic.","Toronto-based bakery Casuals Cakery is holding a Drake lookalike contest.

OpenAI Whistleblower Suchir Balaji’s final post on AI and Copyright goes viral after sudden death – He saw it coming?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/openai-whistleblower-suchir-balajis-final-post-goes-viral-after-sudden-death-what-did-he-predict/articleshow/116305476.cms,"Balaji’s warnings carry weight, not only because of his insider knowledge as someone who helped shape ChatGPT but also because of the broader implications he foresaw.

The untimely death of former OpenAI researcher Suchir Balaji has thrust a chilling October social media post back into the spotlight. The 26-year-old, found deceased in his San Francisco apartment, had become an unlikely whistleblower in the AI world, warning of ethical complications in the industry he helped build.Balaji’s story is not one of a disgruntled tech employee, but rather that of a key architect behind one of the most revolutionary technologies of our time — ChatGPT .Having spent four years at OpenAI, Balaji was instrumental in gathering and organizing data that powered the AI giant’s groundbreaking chatbot. But as the AI boom exploded, so did Balaji’s concerns, and his shift from tech innovator to outspoken critic was swift and startling.When ChatGPT was launched in late 2022, Balaji’s perspective began to shift dramatically. Initially, he believed that OpenAI and other tech companies had the right to use vast amounts of web data for AI development. However, as the scale of the company’s operations grew, so did his unease about the ethical implications, especially concerning copyright law .His final post on X (formerly Twitter) directly addressed his growing skepticism about "" fair use "" as a legal defense for generative AI products, something that he feared could have significant consequences for the future of content creators.In the tweet, Balaji shared his participation in a New York Times story about fair use and generative AI, explaining his position: ""Fair use seems like a pretty implausible defense for a lot of generative AI products, for the basic reason that they can create substitutes that compete with the data they’re trained on."" Balaji, who initially lacked knowledge in copyright law, had become deeply interested in the topic as he observed numerous lawsuits filed against AI companies. His growing concern led him to write a detailed blog post outlining his reasons for skepticism, urging machine learning researchers to delve into the complexities of copyright laws.""I was at OpenAI for nearly 4 years and worked on ChatGPT for the last 1.5 of them,"" Balaji wrote. ""I initially didn’t know much about copyright, fair use, etc. but became curious after seeing all the lawsuits filed against GenAI companies."" In his post, he stressed that the issue of fair use in generative AI was much larger than any single company or product, urging a broader conversation on the topic within the AI community.Balaji’s warnings carry weight, not only because of his insider knowledge as someone who helped shape ChatGPT but also because of the broader implications he foresaw. As AI technologies like ChatGPT evolve, they can replicate and even replace original content, raising concerns about how such advancements could impact the livelihoods of creators and the creative industries as a whole. Balaji emphasized that researchers and developers needed to better understand the laws surrounding AI and intellectual property—something that, tragically, seems even more crucial now in light of his passing.His tweet and blog post, while originally niche discussions within the tech world, have now taken on new significance following his death. The viral spread of Balaji’s final words has reignited debates about AI ethics , copyright, and the future of creativity in an increasingly AI-driven world.","The death of Suchir Balaji has thrust a chilling October social media post back into the spotlight.

A holiday full of tradition

Prince William faces busy Christmas ahead

This Christmas, Sandringham Estate is set to be anything but silent, as Prince William shares his plans for a lively holiday celebration with a hefty guest list of 45 people. Speaking to soldiers and their families during a recent visit in England, the Prince of Wales couldn’t hide his excitement, saying, “We’ll be in Norfolk, at Sandringham. It won’t be quiet, it will be noisy.”The festive gathering will take place at the historic Sandringham Estate, the royal family’s private country home in Norfolk, which has hosted royal Christmases since 1988.While the full guest list remains under wraps, it’s confirmed that Princess Catherine and their three children—Prince George (11), Princess Charlotte (9), and Prince Louis (6) — will be in attendance, ensuring the holiday will be filled with youthful energy.However, there’s one notable absence this year: Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and their children will not be joining the royal festivities at Sandringham. This marks the continuation of a family divide, as the Sussexes have not participated in the royal Christmas celebrations since 2018, the year of their wedding.Royal Christmas celebrations are never just about numbers; they’re about time-honored traditions that bring the family together. One of the most beloved customs is the exchange of Christmas Eve gifts, which, according to True Royalty TV co-founder Nick Bullen, are typically humorous and lighthearted. ""The presents they give to each other are normally quite silly. If you've got all the greatest jewelry in the world, all the greatest works of art in the world, all the greatest clothes in the world, what do you give each other on Christmas? It tends to be small joke presents,"" he explained.Christmas Day itself is filled with carefully planned activities, starting with gift-opening for the children before attending a service at the 16th-century St. Mary Magdalene church, located on the estate. Former royal chef Darren McGrady gives us a taste of what’s to come in the kitchen, revealing that the royal Christmas feast is a multi-course affair. Expect traditional Christmas lunch featuring turkey, various stuffings, roast potatoes, and Brussels sprouts, followed by an afternoon tea with chocolate Yule log and mince pies, and concluding with an even grander dinner buffet, highlighted by a beautifully decorated York ham.Despite the exciting festivities, Prince William admitted to feeling far from prepared for the upcoming Christmas chaos. ""I’m in no way ready for Christmas,"" he confessed during his visit with the 1st Battalion Mercian Regiment. Between taking walks with the family dogs at Sandringham and the packed schedule of royal duties, it’s clear the Prince has a full plate this holiday season.","Prince William revealed plans for a festive Christmas at Sandringham Estate.

Mark Zuckerberg has private meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, announced a $1 million donation to US President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration fund.The donation follows a recent meeting between Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Trump at Mar-a-Lago. During that meeting last month, the two men exchanged pleasantries and Zuckerberg congratulated Trump on winning the presidency.Stephen Miller, who is set to become Trump’s deputy chief of staff in his second term, said that Zuckerberg, like other business leaders, supports Trump’s economic plans, news agency AP reported. Zuckerberg has been working to improve his company’s image among conservatives after past tensions with Trump.Inauguration funds cover the costs of events and activities associated with a new president taking office. Some view these contributions as efforts to gain favour with the incoming administration.Trump was removed from Facebook after the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack but was reinstated in early 2023. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse any candidate but expressed more favorable views of Trump. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg praised Trump’s response to the July 13 assassination attempt as ""one of the most badass things I've ever seen in my life"".Despite this, Trump continued to criticize Zuckerberg during his campaign. In July, Trump posted on Truth Social, saying, “Zuckerbucks, be careful!” while threatening to take action against election fraud.Corporate donations are a common source of funding for presidential inaugurations, except in 2009 when then-President-elect Barack Obama declined corporate contributions. He later accepted such donations for his second inauguration in 2013.Facebook had not donated to either Biden’s 2021 inauguration or Trump’s 2017 inauguration. In contrast, Google contributed $285,000 to both events, according to Federal Election Commission records. Microsoft donated $1 million to Obama’s 2013 inauguration but gave $500,000 each to Trump’s 2017 event and Biden’s 2021 event.

How Donald Trump sent his son's 'ex-fiancée' Kimberly Guilfoyle to Greece as Bettina Anderson sparks love triangle gossip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-donald-trump-sent-his-sons-ex-fiance-kimberly-guilfoyle-to-greece-as-bettina-anderson-sparks-love-triangle-gossip/articleshow/116203694.cms,"Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle

US President-elect Donald Trump made a flurry of job announcements on Wednesday, including the selection of Kimberly Guilfoyle as ambassador to Greece . However, the timing of this appointment was anything but ordinary, coming amid a storm of tabloid gossip surrounding his son Donald Trump Jr 's relationship status.Guilfoyle, who had been dating Trump Jr since 2018 and got engaged to him in 2020, found herself in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. The day earlier, British tabloid The Daily Mail published photos of Trump Jr with socialite Bettina Anderson , igniting rumors that he had moved on with a new love interest.The outlet described the images as ""incontrovertible proof"" that Trump Jr had ""moved on"" with the ""stunning 'it girl.'""And so, as his son’s rumored new romance heated up, Donald Trump reportedly sent his son’s 'ex-fiancée' to Greece. The timing of Guilfoyle’s appointment as ambassador could hardly be more dramatic, adding layers to the gossip surrounding the love triangle.Despite the swirling rumors, Guilfoyle’s appointment was met with a glowing endorsement from Trump, who called her ""a close friend and ally"" with “extensive experience and leadership.” However, his Truth Social post made no mention of her relationship with his son, nor did it address the tabloid storm brewing around her and Trump Jr’s alleged breakup.The whispers about the love triangle have been brewing for months.As per the report by NYT, in July, Anderson raised eyebrows at the Republican National Convention , where she sat conspicuously close to Trump Jr and Guilfoyle, clad in a striking red dress. And just last September, reports surfaced of Trump Jr and Anderson sharing a kiss during brunch — adding fuel to the speculation, especially since Anderson was once friends with Trump Jr’s ex-wife, Vanessa Trump.Further intrigue followed when Guilfoyle was notably absent from a postelection family photo, which featured Vanessa, her five children with Trump Jr, and even Elon Musk. The missing fiancée fueled chatter about the couple’s relationship status.Meanwhile, Anderson stirred the pot this week with an Instagram post showcasing a lavish bouquet and a note reading, ""Many have said that you're aging out but I think you're perfect."" Her caption? ""Tough but fair."" Observers were quick to spot Trump Jr's Instagram handle tagged in the post.Anderson, who hails from a prominent Palm Beach family and leads a conservation nonprofit, poked fun at her public image, describing herself online as a “typical stay-at-home mom” who “doesn’t do household chores … or have a husband … or have kids,” reported NYT.When asked about the love triangle rumors , a spokesperson for President-elect Trump dismissed them as “very sexist,” emphasizing that Guilfoyle’s selection was based on her qualifications.Guilfoyle herself shared her excitement about the role, saying she looks forward to “delivering on the Trump agenda, supporting our Greek allies, and ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity.”Trump Jr also chimed in, saying he was “so proud of Kimberly” and confident she would “be an amazing leader.” Whether he’ll join her in Greece remains unanswered, leaving the tabloids to speculate further.For now, all eyes are on Guilfoyle as she steps onto the global stage, carrying both her new diplomatic role and the weight of swirling headlines.","Kimberly Guilfoyle was named ambassador to Greece on Wednesday.

What is the Luigi Mangione '286 Conspiracy Theory'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-luigi-mangione-286-conspiracy-theory/articleshow/116176938.cms,"The Case: The Murder of Brian Thompson



Details of the Crime



Mangione’s Arrest



Key Connections to the Number 286







Timeline of Events



The ""286 conspiracy theory"" centers on the alleged connections between Luigi Mangione—a suspect in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson—and the number 286. Internet sleuths have identified several supposed links between this number and various aspects of Mangione’s life, actions, and the murder, fueling speculation about deeper meanings or intentions.On December 7, 2024, Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was fatally shot outside a Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Surveillance footage captured a masked gunman fleeing the scene, described by witnesses as wearing dark clothing and carrying a concealed weapon. The attack occurred at approximately 9:15 PM as Thompson exited a private dinner event. The gunman fired multiple shots, striking Thompson in the chest and abdomen. Despite immediate emergency response, Thompson was pronounced dead upon arrival at a nearby hospital.Thompson was a significant figure in the corporate healthcare industry, known for leading cost-cutting measures and streamlining insurance policies. While these efforts were celebrated by some in the corporate world, they also attracted criticism from activists and patients who felt neglected by the healthcare system.The weapon used in the murder was a ghost gun, an untraceable firearm assembled from unregulated parts. This type of weapon, favored by those seeking to avoid detection, was later discovered among Mangione’s possessions. Witness accounts and surveillance footage showed the suspect fleeing north on foot in a calculated manner, leading authorities to believe the crime was premeditated. Investigators connected Mangione to the murder using ballistic evidence, digital footprints, and his documented animosity toward the corporate healthcare sector.Two days after the murder, on December 9, 2024, Mangione was arrested at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He was found in possession of a ghost gun similar to the one used in the murder, a three-page handwritten manifesto detailing his grievances against corporate America, and forged identification documents. Investigators determined that Mangione had fled Manhattan immediately after the crime, using cash and burner phones to evade capture.The number 286 has emerged as a recurring element in the investigation, with internet sleuths drawing various connections. One notable link is the Pokémon Breloom, which holds the Pokédex number 286. This Pokémon featured prominently in Mangione’s X (formerly Twitter) account banner, leading some to speculate that it was chosen intentionally.Some have tied the number to Proverbs 28:6, a Bible verse stating, “Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than a rich man who is crooked in his ways.” This verse has been interpreted as reflective of Mangione’s disdain for corporate greed and figures like Thompson. Furthermore, in healthcare billing, denial code 286 refers to claims denied due to failure to meet appeal deadlines—a symbolic connection given Mangione’s documented criticism of the healthcare system.On December 7, 2024, Brian Thompson was fatally shot outside the Hilton hotel in Manhattan. Surveillance footage captured the gunman fleeing the scene. The following day, police identified Mangione as a person of interest based on digital evidence and previous anti-corporate statements. On December 9, Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where he was charged with weapons possession and forgery. Authorities began preparing murder charges based on ballistic evidence and Mangione’s manifesto. On December 10, Mangione appeared in court, and prosecutors revealed his potential motivations and ties to the healthcare industry.The Luigi Mangione ""286 conspiracy theory"" hinges on the idea that a single number ties together various elements of a murder case, reflecting either deliberate symbolism or an unusual string of coincidences. While the significance of 286 remains speculative, the case has captivated public interest, demonstrating how patterns—real or imagined—can influence the narratives of high-profile investigations.","The ""286 conspiracy theory"" centers on the alleged connections between Luigi Mangione and the number 286.

The concert was streamed on YouTube and featured the singer, Parastoo Ahmadi , bare-shouldered in a black dress, performing with a three-man band.The concert appears to have been filmed in Iran at a traditional caravanserai. Iranian law requires women to cover their hair in public and prohibits them from singing solo publicly. Ahmadi had previously gained a following on Instagram, posting videos and audio clips of herself singing without a headscarf, often in support of the 2022-2023 protests.A message preceding the concert on YouTube stated: ""I am Parastoo, the girl who cannot remain silent and refuses to stop singing for the country she loves."" She encouraged viewers to ""listen to my voice in this imaginary concert and dream of a free and beautiful nation"".The Iranian judiciary, without naming Ahmadi, stated that legal action was taken against “a group led by a female singer” who performed “music without observing legal and religious standards.”US-based activist Masih Alinejad called the concert “historic,” stating that “her voice is a weapon against tyranny, her courage a song of defiance.” Commentator Karim Sadjadpour described the concert as an “act of extraordinary courage” and “another crack in the foundations of Iran's rotting theocracy.”This event comes before a new law, expected Friday, which rights groups say will increase penalties for women violating the dress code.","Iranian singer Parastoo Ahmadi performs online concert without hijab, faces prosecution.

However, in October Bezos said The Post would not endorse any candidate, effectively blocking its endorsement of Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, according to NPR.This led to thousands of readers canceling their subscriptions and sparking protests among journalists associated with the newspaper.

WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden is closely monitoring the situation in Bangladesh and the US will hold the country's interim government accountable for ensuring the protection of religious and ethnic minorities, the White House has said.

Radar operator's cryptic report

Conspiracy theories take flight

What is Project Blue Beam?

Abolishing traditional religions to create a single world religion.

Replacing national identities with a unified global identity.

Breaking down traditional family structures to foster collective allegiance to a global authority.

Using “miraculous” events, including simulated extraterrestrial encounters, to manipulate the masses.

Silence from authorities

Trump weighs in

New Jersey has recently become ground zero for a wave of unexplained drone sightings, sparking curiosity and a fair share of wild speculation. The buzz started quietly, but when an anonymous Reddit user—claiming to be an experienced radar operator with ties to a major US agency—linked the mysterious drones to secretive military operations, the story took a thrilling, and rather unsettling, turn.The Reddit post, which quickly went viral, was a detailed report from someone identifying as a 25-year veteran radar operator for a large agency. The anonymous user dropped a bombshell: the drones were part of a covert operation led by the US Space Force. The post described military drills that included ""full lockout"" scenarios—where military control temporarily overrides civilian communications and radar. According to the user, these drills are scheduled to continue intermittently until Christmas Eve.But that’s not all. The report also claims that unannounced satellite launches have been occurring since October, raising eyebrows about the secrecy surrounding these activities. Some suggested that a secret ""big show"" could be planned for the public in the coming weeks. Add to that the eerie rumor of a CNN crew filming a mysterious, unreleased article after allegedly being spotted near one of the satellite launches, and the situation grows even more bizarre.As if the story weren’t strange enough, the online conspiracy theorists jumped in. One user linked the sightings to Project Blue Beam, an infamous theory dating back to the 1990s. According to proponents, this project allegedly involves governments using advanced holographic technology to simulate a celestial event or even an alien invasion—creating a perfect pretext for a one-world government.“Look for videos of drones transforming from balls of light to planes,” one commenter warned, suggesting that the drones could be part of a covert plan to simulate something much larger. Speculation about the government orchestrating such an event swirled, with some hinting that a new world order might be on the horizon.Project Blue Beam was first proposed by conspiracy theorist Serge Monast in the 1990s, alleging that a global conspiracy was aiming to control humanity through staged ""miracles"" and celestial phenomena. The theory outlines four goals:Though widely dismissed by critics as unsubstantiated paranoia, Project Blue Beam continues to be a focal point for those suspicious of government secrecy and military activities.So far, the federal government and military agencies have remained tight-lipped about the recent drone sightings and alleged training exercises. Neither the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) nor any military branch has issued an official statement, leaving room for the conspiracy theories to flourish unchecked.US President-elect Donald Trump has also weighed in on the mystery. Taking to his Truth Social account, Trump voiced his concerns over the drones, calling for swift government action: ""Mystery drone sightings all over the country. Can this really be happening without our government’s knowledge? I don’t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!! DJT.""The President-elect's comments have only added fuel to the fire, escalating the already-heightened public interest in the situation. Are these drones part of a routine military exercise, or is something bigger—something far more extraordinary—at play?",New Jersey has recently become ground zero for a wave of unexplained drone sightings.

Dozens of reported drone sightings in the skies above New Jersey have alarmed lawmakers and local officials and left them searching for answers. Gov. Phil Murphy said there were nearly 50 reported sightings in a single night over the weekend. And since mid-Nov, drones have been reported in at least 10 counties in New Jersey and in parts of New York City.Eleven drones have been spotted near Picatinny Arsenal, an army facility, since Nov 13, said its public affairs specialist Timothy Rider. He said the ""increased activity"" was not the result of military operations related to the base.John Kirby, spokesperson for National Security Council, said Thursday that federal authorities had not been able to corroborate any of the reported sightings. ""To the contrary, upon review of available imagery, it appears many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully,"" Kirby said.Still, Kirby said the spate of reports and public concern underscored the importance of systems to detect and deter drones. Such tools should be made available to local law enforcement officials, he said.FBI and department of homeland security will continue to investigate the reported sightings, he said, stressing that they did not appear to pose a threat to public safety.Even as officials assured the public they had nothing to fear, New Jersey residents have described the rash of sightings as unsettling. Social media forums dedicated to the ""mystery"" have accumulated thousands of posts. One Facebook group has more than 25,000 members who share videos and swap theories.Robert Wheeler, assistant director of FBI's Critical Incident Response Group, said in testimony to Congress Tuesday that the bureau was ""actively investigating"" the sightings.In Ocean County, New Jersey, the local sheriff's office has been using its own drones to investigate night time sightings, hoping to determine where the objects land and what precisely they are. They have had little luck so far.""We're not getting good characteristics of the drone,"" said Sgt. Kevin Fennessy, who leads the office's drone unit. ""We had one the other night that, as we're watching it, it just shuts the lights off and it's gone in pure darkness."" From what he has seen so far, Fennessy thinks the objects are perhaps double the size of the drones in his fleet, flying at top speeds that are about 20mph faster. Ocean County is near the flight path for airplanes landing at Kennedy Airport in New York, but Fennessy believes the objects are indeed drones, since they do not appear on flight tracking software.Luis Figueiredo, a detective and drone specialist with the police department in New Jersey, said the descriptions of the sightings suggested that the drones were much larger and faster - and ""a lot more sophisticated"" - than those widely available to the public.But Joshua Tan, a professor of physics and astronomy at LaGuardia Community College, explained that while some sightings could be drones, others might be the consequence of confirmation bias: After hearing reports, people might become newly attentive to objects in the night sky.","Dozens of reported drone sightings in the skies above New Jersey have alarmed lawmakers and local officials.

US military airlifts American freed from Syrian prison to Jordan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-military-airlifts-american-freed-from-syrian-prison-to-jordan/articleshow/116302335.cms,"File photo: Travis Timmerman (Picture credit: Reuters)

The US military has transported Travis Timmerman , a 29-year-old American who was recently freed from a Syrian prison to safety in Jordan, US officials informed on Friday.Timmerman was released earlier this week during the dramatic fall of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, marking the end of his seven-month captivity.Timmerman was handed over to US troops at the Tanf garrison , a key military base near Syria’s borders with Iraq and Jordan, before being flown to Jordan on a military helicopter. US officials have confirmed that he is now with State Department representatives.According to US sources quoted by AP, Timmerman was freed from the notorious Palestine Branch detention facility after Syrian rebels stormed the prison, breaking down his cell door with a hammer. His release came alongside other detainees, including women and children, following the rebels’ takeover of Damascus and Assad’s flight to Russia.The White House stated it had no prior knowledge of Timmerman’s presence in Syria.

'Toy type': Drone crash in New Jersey backyard fuels mystery over recent sightings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/toy-type-drone-crash-in-new-jersey-backyard-fuels-mystery-over-recent-sightings/articleshow/116301680.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

A hobby drone crashed into a Pequannock Township homeowner’s backyard in Morris County, New Jersey, on Thursday night, sparking heightened concerns in a state already rattled by unexplained aerial phenomena .The Pequannock Police Department confirmed that the device, which fell around 8:45 pm, was “a hobby or toy type of drone” and not a military-grade or commercial craft, as reported by the New York Post.This incident adds to a wave of drone-related anxiety, partly fuelled by recent reports of large drones hovering near the highly secure Picatinny Arsenal.The facility, which develops military weaponry, has seen multiple sightings, raising concerns about potential espionage by foreign adversaries.Mayor Ryan Herd of Pequannock Township visited the crash site, emphasising his worries about unauthorised drones invading private property.Speaking to the New York Post, Herd stated, “Drones are flying over our houses, which is our private property. My family is here.” He urged residents to refrain from chasing or attempting to down drones, warning of potential catastrophic accidents.Adding to the tension, another report surfaced later that evening about a drone allegedly hitting a powerline in Randolph Township. However, the Morris County Sheriff’s Office confirmed the report was unfounded.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recently imposed temporary drone flight restrictions over key locations in New Jersey, including Picatinny Arsenal and the Bedminster golf course owned by President-elect Donald Trump.These measures followed reports of unusual drone activity in the region.New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy addressed the growing concerns earlier this week, describing the aircraft as “very sophisticated.” He assured residents the devices posed no immediate public threat but encouraged federal authorities to investigate. Murphy warned against shooting drones out of the sky but supported efforts to capture them for study.White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby revealed that federal investigators have been unable to confirm any of the over 3,000 reports of car-sized drones patrolling the skies.Meanwhile, Pentagon officials stated they do not believe these drones are linked to foreign entities.","A hobby drone crashed into a homeowner's backyard in Morris County, New Jersey, on Thursday night.

Pak SC conditionally allows army to announce military trial verdicts of pro-Imran protesters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-sc-conditionally-allows-army-to-announce-military-trial-verdicts-of-pro-imran-protesters/articleshow/116298908.cms,"Supreme Court of Pakistan

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in last year’s May 9 riots when protesters linked to the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) had stormed govt and military installations.A seven-member SC constitution bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin, specified that the military court verdicts would be subject to its final decision on appeals against its Oct 23, 2023 ruling barring the army from trying PTI protesters, saying military trials of civilians were unconstitutional.Local and international human rights organisations have expressed concern about the military trials, claiming that they do not adhere to the same evidentiary and due process norms as civilian courtsHundreds of PTI workers were arrested after they purportedly stormed military and govt buildings, and even torched a top commander’s house, following the former PM’s brief arrest by paramilitary soldiers on May 9, 2023 in a graft case. Among the detainees, the army initiated military trials against 103 accused on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military. Though Khan was released after three days, he was rearrested two months later in another corruption case and has been in jail since. There have been widespread reports that the military also plans to prosecute him under the same charges. He, however, has already been indicted by an anti-terrorism court over charges linked to the May 9 riots.The seven-member SC constitution bench was formed as a result of a controversial amendment to the constitution in Oct this year.“The final judgment of 85 persons who are under custody and facing trial before the military courts be announced and remissions admissible to the said persons be granted, and persons who can be released after remissions they be released forthwith, and persons who have to yet undergo the sentence awarded to them, their custody be handed over to the concerned jail authorities,” Friday’s court order read.The Pakistan Army Act of 1952 had established military courts, which function under a separate legal system, primarily for trial of military personnel or enemies of the state.The decision to use military courts for civilians was taken by Imran’sadversary, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during his first term in office, and was backed by the powerful military establishment.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in May 9 riots.

Respiratory illnesses soar in Pakistan as dust pollution and poverty worsen health crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/respiratory-illnesses-soar-in-pakistan-as-dust-pollution-and-poverty-worsen-health-crisis/articleshow/116262633.cms,"KARACHI: As winter sets in, there has been a noticeable rise in Pakistcitizens respiratory illnesses over the past few weeks.Experts suggest that this year's case numbers are considerably higher compared to previous years. They attribute the increase to deteriorating air quality, particularly due to severe dust pollution affecting nearly all city roads, compounded by the significant loss of green spaces as reported by Dawn.Experts also connected the rise in respiratory illnesses to the increasing poverty levels, driven by an unprecedented surge in the prices of essential food and medicine, which has significantly heightened people's susceptibility to illness and disability.Dr. Javaid Ahmed Khan, a senior professor and consultant pulmonologist at Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), explained to Dawn, ""While respiratory disease cases typically rise with the onset of winter, due to colder and drier air trapping more pollutants, this year the numbers have nearly doubled. This applies to both inpatients and outpatients.""According to the Dawn report, Dr. Khan attributed the rise in respiratory diseases to heavy dust pollution, stating, ""I believe air quality has deteriorated significantly. There is extensive roadwork throughout the city, trees are being cut down, and people continue to burn waste on the streets. There is no regulation of vehicles emitting toxic fumes.""He further explained that poor air quality heightens the risk of bronchitis by exposing individuals to pollutants such as dust, fumes, traffic emissions, and chemicals. This pollution weakens the immune system, making people more susceptible to lung infections and other illnesses.""Any type of pollution impacts the immune system, a fact supported by numerous studies. People living in polluted environments are more prone to pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections, allergic rhinitis, and even tuberculosis.""Dr. Khan explained that irritants, including particulate matter 2.5, damage the respiratory system's immune defences, which normally protect against various germs.When the immune system is compromised, the body becomes highly susceptible to infections and diseases, including cancer. He pointed out that the average diameter of human hair is about 70 micrometres, while particulate matter 2.5 consists of fine particles that are 2.5 micrometres or smaller. Additionally, Dr. Khan noted that research has linked poor air quality to a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, as these tiny particles enter the bloodstream and can block arteries.Supporting Dr. Khan's view, Dr. Abdul Ghafoor Shoro, a senior general physician practicing in Keamari, reported a 50 per cent increase in respiratory illnesses, including asthma, bronchitis, flu, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia in recent weeks.He stated, ""From Malir, Quaidabad, and Korangi to Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Mauripur, Keamari, Orangi, and Saddar, heavy dust pollution is widespread due to roadwork and construction activities. There's no way for the public to escape the pollution.""Dr. Sajjad Siddiqui, a senior general physician, emphasised that the rise in diseases is also linked to people's declining purchasing power. ""The public is living under extreme hardship, forced to drink contaminated water in areas lacking gas, with people relying on costly cylinders to cook just enough food to survive. When they fall ill, they can't afford the necessary medicines,"" he lamented.Dr. Liaquat Ali Halo, Additional Medical Superintendent at Dr. Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, reported a 25 to 30 per cent increase in respiratory illnesses, particularly among children, at the hospital's chest department.""We are seeing children with pneumonia and adults with COPD and asthma. Often, COPD patients are individuals who work in polluted environments or are smokers.""Experts recommend that people wear high-quality face masks or use cloth coverings (or helmets for those riding bikes) when outdoors, although these measures cannot fully protect against toxic air. ""Indoor air quality is just as crucial,"" emphasised Dr. Halo.""It's important to ensure proper ventilation in homes, even during winter. People should avoid burning mosquito coils and incense, as there are increasing concerns about their harmful health effects."" He also noted that using gas stoves in poorly ventilated kitchens can further degrade air quality.","There has been a noticeable rise in Pakistcitizens respiratory illnesses over the past few weeks.

Bin Laden, Tehran and the Taliban



'Murdered my dreams'



PARACHINAR: Once again, Ali Ghulam receives mourners at his home -- his brother and nephew killed 40 years apart in the same sectarian conflict that was reignited this year in northwest Pakistan, claiming 200 lives since July alone.Thousands of residents are stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, as the government struggles to end clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stemming from decades-old tensions over farmland.""Our generations yearn for peace,"" 72-year-old Ghulam told AFP at his home in Parachinar, the main town and a Shiite bastion of the restive district.The latest flare-up of violence has ""reopened wounds"" he said, recalling how his brother was killed in an attack in 1987 that also wounded another three of his brothers.Kurram, known as the ""Parrot's Beak"" for its protrusion into neighbouring Afghanistan, is bounded by dizzyingly high mountains, the northern flank of which includes the Tora Bora caves where Al Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden once hid.Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for various militant groups, with militants and weapons able to flow largely unchecked in and out of Afghanistan.""I have never experienced peace in my life and have no hope my coming generations will live free of fear,"" Ghulam said.Tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan.But they can be particularly protracted and violent in the mountainous tribal northwest, where communities live by traditional codes of honour and revenge.The latest round of violence in Kurram erupted in May and intensified in July, when gunmen opened fire on a council of elders attempting to settle the latest round of disagreements over land.Various truces announced since then have held for only weeks or days at a time.More than 300 shops and over 200 homes in Sunni areas have been destroyed, often by fire, and hundreds of families have fled.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country with Shiites making up 10 to 15 percent of the population, or at least 25 million people.Members of the two sects have periodically clashed in Kurram, where Shiites are particularly vulnerable as they must pass through Sunni-majority neighbourhoods to access essential services.Kurram's location on the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan put it at the heart of the religious and political upheavals of the last five decades.In 1979, Shiites led a revolution in Iran and later that year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, prompting Sunni hardliners there to rise up against them.Pakistan's military ruler Zia-ul-Haq aligned with them, funnelling thousands of Sunni militants into Afghanistan through Kurram.""It became a hub for arms supply to Afghanistan, including landmines, mortar shells, and weapons of all kinds. Every household in Kurram had a stockpile of weapons,"" Malik Attaullah Khan, a local tribal elder told AFP.Khan, who signed a 2007 agreement aimed at bringing peace to Kurram, criticised the government for failing to ""fulfil in its responsibilities"" in enforcing land settlements.The ethnic Pashtun heartland was merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, but the Pakistani state maintains limited control in the merged districts.In rural areas of Pakistan, villages often bypass the formal justice system and men-only ""jirgas"" or councils made up of respected village elders resolve disputes, sometimes in the form of fines or land reallocation.Ghulam's nephew was killed along with at least 42 others last month, when Sunni gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Shiites being escorted by the police to their homes.In retaliation, a market in a Sunni-dominated area was set on fire.Syed Ghani Shah told AFP his cousin was burned to death inside his shop.""When we buried him, he was so unrecognisable that we couldn't even let his parents see his face,"" Shah said.""Can we ever make peace after all this? Never, if we ever get the chance, we will surely avenge our blood,"" he warned.Authorities have enforced curfews and road closures to reduce the chances of violence breaking out, providing escorts through high-risk areas and using helicopters to deliver supplies.But Akbar Khan, a representative of Pakistan's independent Human Rights Commission told AFP that the state needs to do more to resolve the issue.""In the past, jirgas were successful because they had the full support of the state. Now, the authorities don't even provide the expenses needed to hold a jirga,"" he said.Fatima Ahmed's husband was killed last month while travelling to Islamabad to arrange her admission to medical college.""I don't want to live a life without him. I've lost my will to exist,"" the 21-year-old told AFP.""They haven't just martyred my husband -- they've also murdered my dreams with him,"" she said, bursting into tears.",Violence in northwest Pakistan has killed 200 people since July. Clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stem from decades-old tensions over farmland. Residents stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district. Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for militant groups.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116233302,imgsize-616661,width-400,resizemode-4/116233302.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world in Oct, revealed data shared by Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index on Monday.Since Mid-July, internet users in Pakistan have reported frequent slowdowns and persistent connectivity challenges in the country, causing widespread disruptions to browsing and media sharing.The global index placed Pakistan at 100 out of 111 countries in mobile internet speeds, and 141 out of 158 countries in broadband speeds.The country’s regular internet interruptions were accompanied by reports of restricted access to virtual private networks (VPNs), which many Pakistanis use to access X and other restricted websites.According to the World Population Review, which analysed data from Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index and Cable, Pakistan’s average download speed was 7.85 MBPS, with a median mobile download speed of 19.59 MBPS and a median broadband download speed of 15.52 MBPS.Internet service providers and the business community blamed the slump in services on the govt’s installation of a Chinese-built national internet firewall, a combination of hardware and software used by authorities to control and monitor internet traffic, acting as a digital gatekeeper that decides what data to allow or block.The national firewall, also being installed on servers of major internet providers, has the capability to detect and slow digital communication between individual users.Last month, Pakistan home ministry had sought a ban on unregulated use of VPNs, citing their use by terrorists to “facilitate violent activities” and to “access pornographic and blasphemous content”.“VPNs are increasingly being exploited by terrorists to facilitate violent activities and financial transactions in Pakistan,” the ministry said in a letter to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).","Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world.

"Pakistan's ISI pushes drug addicts as terror couriers in Indian jails, say officials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-isi-pushes-drug-addicts-as-terror-couriers-in-indian-jails-say-officials/articleshow/116116037.cms,"During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India to utilise them to deliver critical messages to hardcore terrorists incarcerated in the country's prisons. Officials said that more than 10 such cases have been reported since July this year in which Pakistani nationals have entered India from their country and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Many of them have been sent to prisons in Jammu, Punjab and Rajasthan.The officials said security agencies suspect these individuals are Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) couriers tasked with relaying important communication to the jailed terrorists wherever possible.Interrogation of these individuals typically shows that they have been trained in resistance techniques to withstand questioning by security personnel.The behaviour displayed by those apprehended has raised suspicions among officials, who suggest that their superficial details and evasive responses indicate a potentially larger agenda behind their infiltration, possibly stemming from the fear of repercussions from their handlers.They explained that the use of mobile phones and the internet leaves behind electronic footprints that could expose the plans of both state and non-state actors operating across the border. As a result, the ISI has adopted this new modus operandi.The infiltration strategy reportedly includes women and minors, who may also serve as couriers. In a notable incident in July, a minor from Pakistan's Attock was intercepted in Punjab.During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said.The ISI's infiltration tactics have been linked to drug smuggling operations. In one case from Bijnour village in Rajasthan, a Pakistani national posing as mentally disturbed finally spilled the beans during intense questioning that he had been hired by two drug lords in Pakistan -- Sarfaraz Johiya and Nawaz -- to facilitate narcotics trafficking into India and gather information on the deployment of Border Security Force (BSF) troops.In another recent incident, a Pakistani youth named Mohammed Asad from Lahore drove to the zero line on his motorcycle and seemingly awaited arrest by the BSF. During interrogation, he claimed to have had a family dispute over his girlfriend.The officials noted that Asad, who was subsequently moved to prison, may have been acting as a courier. Security agencies have requested additional custody for extended interrogation.In October, a 31-year-old man who identified himself as Shahid Imran entered India through the Jammu sector, claiming that he wanted to visit a Kali temple to get married.The officials explained that such infiltrators are generally booked under the Foreigners Act and Passports Act, for which the punishment ranges from two years to eight years in prison and following this, they are deported.They said that in the late-1990s and early-2000s, ISI exploited the Samjhauta Express, the rail link between India and Pakistan, for covert courier operations, employing individuals known as ""sawari operators"".This service continued until February 2019, when the train service was halted.The ""sawari operators"" played a crucial role in smuggling drugs and transporting funds intended to finance terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, as well as Punjab.However, following a significant crackdown by authorities, these operations were effectively curtailed, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of numerous individuals involved in such activities.Recent developments suggest that the ISI's current method of sending couriers mirrors these past tactics.The officials said that the infiltration strategies being employed now are reminiscent of the past, as the agency seeks new ways to bypass law enforcement and deliver crucial communication and resources across the border.","Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries.

Growing threat from Baloch separatists

Sectarian violence fuels instability

Border tensions and counterterrorism efforts

What lies ahead

Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month, according to a report by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). The number of fatalities also surged by 69%, climbing from 100 in October to 169, with 225 others injured.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned group, carried out 12 attacks in November, including three high-impact incidents that resulted in 45 deaths. These figures surpassed the fatalities caused by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), indicating a shift in the BLA's operational strategy. Experts suggest this escalation requires a reassessment of counterterrorism tactics.The majority of these attacks in Balochistan targeted security forces and civilians. Notable incidents included an assault on the Quetta railway station, an attack on a police van in Mastung, and a strike on a security check-post in Kalat, which collectively accounted for 91% of the province’s fatalities.Sectarian violence added another layer to the country's security challenges, particularly in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Seven incidents, including two terror attacks and five sectarian clashes, claimed 115 lives and left 137 injured. The violence was triggered by an attack on passenger buses on November 21, which spiraled into broader sectarian unrest.KP remained the most affected province, with 41 terrorist attacks leading to 114 deaths and 95 injuries. The TTP, Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, and other local factions were linked to most of these incidents.The report also highlighted six incidents of border violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, resulting in 25 terrorist deaths and 11 injuries. This underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges posed by cross-border insurgents.Security forces conducted 19 counterterrorism operations in November, killing 53 terrorists. Most of these operations were concentrated in KP and Balochistan, the epicenters of recent violence.The PIPS report paints a grim picture of Pakistan's security landscape, with 98 conflict-related incidents causing 338 deaths and 411 injuries in November alone. Experts suggest that the evolving nature of terror threats, including the increasing lethality of BLA operations and persistent sectarian tensions, requires urgent and innovative policy responses.As Pakistan grapples with these challenges, the question remains: can the state adapt quickly enough to address the multifaceted threats destabilizing the country?","Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month.

DHAKA: In yet another sign of its intent to move Bangladesh closer to Islamabad, the interim government is reported to have removed the requirement for Pakistani citizens to obtain security clearance before applying for a visa. This significant decision was communicated, local media reports said, by the Security Services Division (SSD) of the ministry of home affairs to the foreign affairs ministry. The government, however, refrained from commenting on the decision.Since 2019, Pakistani citizens have been required to secure a ""no objection"" certificate from SSD before being granted a Bangladeshi visa. This measure was introduced as part of broader security protocols amid ongoing political and diplomatic tensions.The waiver of the clearance requirement is being interpreted by many as a sign of improving Pakistan-Bangladesh relations under the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt.

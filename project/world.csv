'Maximum punishment'

Command centre set up to monitor security

Sheikh Hasina and Awami League under fire

Bangladesh’s security forces have arrested 1,308 people under "" Operation Devil Hunt ,"" an overnight crackdown launched on Saturday to curb violence and vandalism across the country.The interim government, led by chief adviser Muhammad Yunus , has vowed to continue the operation until ""all devils"" are rooted out.The operation began after student activists were injured during an attack on the residence of an Awami League leader on the outskirts of Dhaka. Joint forces comprising the army, police, and specialised units arrested 274 people in metropolitan cities and other regions in the first 24 hours according to major media outlets like the Daily Star.""The operation will target those who are desperate to destabilise the country... it will continue until all devils are rooted out,"" retired home affairs adviser lieutenant general Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said.On Friday, chief adviser Yunus urged for strict law and order and demanded an end to attacks on the properties of the deposed premier’s family and leaders of what he called the ""fascist"" Awami League.Bangladesh has faced unrest for four days, with violence breaking out on Friday night in Gazipur’s Dakshinkhan area. Mobs attacked the home of former liberation war affairs minister Mozammel Haque, injuring at least 14 people. The attackers targeted symbols of deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League but faced counter-attacks.Authorities arrested 81 Awami League activists in Gazipur, where the violence first broke out. Meanwhile, the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement claimed their members were trying to prevent looting at Haque’s house when miscreants attacked them.That evening, unidentified attackers shot a student outside the deputy commissioner's office. In response, the student movement held a day-long protest in Gazipur, condemning the violence.Home affairs adviser Jahangir Alam Chowdhury assured that those behind the attacks on students in Gazipur would face justice.""Many of those responsible have already been arrested. Those who haven't will be caught soon, and we will ensure they receive the maximum punishment,"" he said.Meanwhile, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia ’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has urged the interim government to curb ""mob culture"" and restore order.Chief adviser’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam confirmed on Sunday that a command centre was set up to manage security.""We hope that following the establishment of the centre, the law and order situation will improve and a quick response can be carried out to any threat,"" Alam said.The command centre includes members of law enforcement agencies and representatives of the armed forces.Since Sheikh Hasina’s government was toppled in August last year after a student-led uprising, many Awami League leaders have gone into hiding, and several have been arrested. Hasina herself fled to India.The ousted leader and her colleagues face multiple charges, including crimes against humanity, for their brutal crackdown on protesters in July.Protests against Hasina grew after her live online address last Wednesday. Mobs vandalised homes and businesses of her supporters and set fire to the historic 32 Dhanmondi residence of Bangladesh’s founding leader, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.","Bangladesh’s security forces have arrested 1,308 people under "" Operation Devil Hunt,"" an overnight crackdown launched on Saturday.

Donald Trump gets a cheer as first US president to attend Super Bowl; Taylor Swift gets booed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-gets-a-cheer-as-first-us-president-to-attend-super-bowl-taylor-swift-gets-booed/articleshow/118101974.cms,"Donald Trump (left), Taylor Swift

Taylor Swift gets booed

Donald Trump became the first sitting US president to attend a Super Bowl, traveling from Florida to New Orleans onboard Air Force on Sunday to watch the Kansas City Chiefs play the Philadelphia Eagles at the Caesars Superdome.During his flight to New Orleans, Trump signed a proclamation declaring February 9 ""the first ever Gulf of America Day "" as Air Force One flew over the body of water that he renamed by proclamation from the Gulf of Mexico.Before the game, Trump met with participants in the honorary coin toss, including relatives of victims of a New Year's Day attack in New Orleans, local police officers, and emergency personnel.Trump was met with cheers and a mix of boos as he arrived at the Superdome for the game.Trump, who has a long history with American football, played the sport in high school and owned the New Jersey Generals in the now-defunct United States Football League (USFL) in the 1980s. He later sued the NFL in an attempt to force a merger with the USFL.During his first term as president, Trump criticized NFL players who kneeled during the national anthem to protest racial injustice. At a 2017 rally in Alabama, he said, ""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, you'd say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He's fired.'""Trump watched the Super Bowl from a suite with several Republican lawmakers, including Senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott and House Speaker Mike Johnson. He saluted during the national anthem. Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes ' family visited Trump in the suite.In an interview aired during the Fox News pregame show, Trump predicted a Kansas City victory. ""I guess you have to say that when a quarterback wins as much as he's won, I have to go with Kansas City,"" he said. ""He's a great, great quarterback.""The NFL recently removed ""End Racism"" slogans from the end zones, a decision some have linked to Trump's recent order canceling federal diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. However, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league's diversity policies are not affected by the administration's stance. The league replaced the message with ""Choose Love"" for the Super Bowl, referencing recent tragedies, including the New Year's Day attack in New Orleans.Trump has longstanding ties to sports beyond football. He is an avid golfer, owns multiple courses, and has hosted tournaments. On the same day as the Super Bowl, he played golf with Tiger Woods in Florida. He has also attended boxing and UFC events. Some NFL team owners have donated to Trump's campaigns, and he has maintained friendships with former players like Herschel Walker and Doug Flutie.Last week, Trump signed an order affecting transgender participation in women's sports by restricting federal funding for schools that do not comply. In a statement before the Super Bowl, he said the Chiefs and Eagles ""represent the hopes and dreams of our Nation's young athletes as we restore safety and fairness in sports and equal opportunities among their teams.""Taylor Swift attended the Super Bowl again to watch Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs play the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday.Unlike last year, her reception was different. While she was loudly cheered upon arriving at the game in Las Vegas, this time she was booed by a largely pro-Eagles crowd when shown on the video boards inside the Superdome during a first-quarter break.Seated next to rapper Ice Spice, Swift reacted with a side-eye and a slight nose wrinkle upon realizing the booing was aimed at her.",Donald Trump is the first sitting US president to attend a Super Bowl.

US President Donald Trump officially renamed the Gulf of Mexico as the ""Gulf of America"" on Sunday and declared February 9 as "" Gulf of America Day"" through an executive order.The move, part of executive order 14172 titled ""Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness ,"" directs the US secretary of the interior to formalise the name change within 30 days.According to the White House, Trump's executive order specifies that the renamed Gulf includes the ""US Continental Shelf area bounded on the northeast, north, and northwest by the State of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, extending to the seaward boundary with Mexico and Cuba.""""I took this action in part because, as stated in that order, ‘the area formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico has long been an integral asset to our once burgeoning Nation and has remained an indelible part of America,’"" Trump stated in his proclamation, as per the White House.As he travelled aboard Air Force One from Palm Beach, Florida, to New Orleans for Super Bowl LIX, the president flew over the Gulf and emphasised the significance of the renaming.""As my administration restores American pride in the history of American greatness, it is fitting and appropriate for our great Nation to come together and commemorate this momentous occasion and the renaming of the Gulf of America,"" Trump said, per Fox5 DC.Under the order, the US Coast Guard has already begun using the name ""Gulf of America,"" and secretary of the interior Doug Burgum has 30 days to complete the official transition. Trump’s proclamation also calls for public officials and citizens to observe Gulf of America Day with ""appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.""The body of water now known as the Gulf of America was historically referred to as the ""Mexican Bay"" (Seno Mexicano) until the early 19th century. The current name, ""Gulf of Mexico,"" originated from Spanish explorers who named the region based on Mexico's extensive coastline, according to historical records.The renaming comes at a time of heightened tensions between the Trump administration and Mexico. Trump recently threatened 25% tariffs on Mexican imports, later pausing the move after Mexico agreed to deploy 10,000 National Guard troops to the border.","US President Donald Trump officially renamed the Gulf of Mexico as the ""Gulf of America"" on Sunday.

‘Canada as the 51st state?’: Trump says he is ‘serious’ about the idea in Super Bowl interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/canada-as-the-51st-state-trump-says-he-is-serious-about-the-idea-in-super-bowl-interview/articleshow/118101430.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

Canada’s response

Trump doubles down

US President Donald Trump has doubled down on his stance that Canada should become the 51st state, declaring he is “serious” about the idea in an interview aired during the Super Bowl pre-show on Sunday.""I think Canada would be much better off being the 51st state because we lose $200 billion a year with Canada. And I'm not going to let that happen,"" Trump said, adding, ""Why are we paying $200 billion a year, essentially a subsidy to Canada?""However, according to the news agency AP, the US does not subsidise Canada. The trade deficit with the resource-rich nation stood at $72 billion in 2023, largely due to American imports of Canadian energy.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had recently acknowledged Trump’s remarks as a genuine concern, rather than political rhetoric. ""Mr. Trump has it in mind that the easiest way to do it is absorbing our country, and it is a real thing,"" Trudeau reportedly told business leaders, according to CBC.He suggested that Trump’s interest is tied to Canada's critical mineral resources, which are essential for electric vehicles, semiconductors, and clean energy.Trump has made multiple public references to annexing Canada, once referring to Trudeau as “Governor Trudeau” on Truth Social. His administration has also threatened 25% tariffs on all Canadian exports, excluding energy, which would be taxed at 10%. However, a 30-day pause on these tariffs was agreed upon after Canada pledged to enhance border security.To counter the pressure, Canada has launched a $1.3 billion CAD ($900 million USD) border security plan, including drones, helicopters, and a joint task force with the US. It also appointed a ""fentanyl czar"" to address American concerns over drug trafficking.François-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s industry minister, had emphasised the deep interdependence between the two economies. “This is about a confident Canada,” he said.Meanwhile, an Ipsos poll found that 80% of Canadians oppose becoming part of the US, as per BBC.With the tariff reprieve nearing its end, Trudeau warned of potential economic retaliation. “We need to be ready to respond robustly,” he said. Business leaders are also pushing for market diversification to reduce economic reliance on the US.During the interview, Trump also defended Elon Musk’s department of government efficiency (DOGE), stating Musk has been “terrific” in his mission to dismantle government agencies and cut federal workforce inefficiencies. He further hinted that the department of education and military spending could be targeted next.""We're going to find billions, hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse,"" Trump claimed.Trump also used the interview to announce upcoming tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, including from Canada and Mexico and previewed a plan for reciprocal tariffs.While en route to the Super Bowl, Trump signed a proclamation renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the ""Gulf of America.""","US President Donald Trump has doubled down on his stance that Canada should become the 51st state.

Top Trump administration officials are openly challenging the judiciary’s role as a check on executive power as President Donald Trump’s agenda faces increasing legal hurdles.Over the weekend, Vice President JD Vance and Tesla owner Elon Musk , who heads the administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, criticised a federal judge’s decision that blocked Musk’s team from accessing Treasury Department records.As per AP, the ruling led to an intense pushback from Trump allies, with some questioning the legitimacy of judicial oversight itself.Vance, in a post on X, wrote, “If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal. If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that’s also illegal. Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.”Musk, in an overnight post, called for the judge’s impeachment, describing him as “a corrupt judge protecting corruption.”Musk’s team had been investigating government spending but was temporarily barred from accessing a Treasury system containing the personal financial data of millions of Americans.According to the New York Times, Vance has previously argued that presidents should defy court orders that interfere with their constitutional authorityMeanwhile, deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller framed the judiciary’s interventions as “an assault on the very idea of democracy itself.” As per Fox News, he claimed that an “unelected shadow force” within the government was obstructing Trump’s efforts to reform federal agencies.The legal challenges come as judges have temporarily halted several of Trump’s key initiatives, including his executive order to end birthright citizenship and his efforts to dismantle government agencies. A hearing on the Treasury case is set for February 14, with Democrats warning of a constitutional crisis .“This is a red alert moment,” Senator Chris Murphy said on ABC’s ‘This Week’. “Our democracy is at risk”, said Chris.",Top Trump administration officials are openly challenging the judiciary's role as a check on executive power.

French sex offender Dominique Pelicot, sentenced to 20 years in prison for drugging and raping his wife, may have also sexually assaulted his own daughter, Caroline Darian , according to a report by The Sydney Morning Herald.Darian, who for 43 years believed her father to be a loving family man, told 60 Minutes that she now suspects she was also a victim. ""I know that I was drugged and probably, even worse,"" she said.Pelicot, 72, was convicted last December for years of drugging his wife, Gisele Pelicot, and allowing other men to assault her unconscious body while he filmed the abuse. Investigators uncovered 20,000 photos and videos, involving more than 70 men, but only 50 could be identified, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.Darian, who has publicly supported her mother in waiving her anonymity, described the ordeal as ""a really difficult legacy."" She said the revelation about her father shattered her perception of him. ""How can you imagine that your father can be one of the worst sexual criminals in France or even across the world?"" she said.Authorities began investigating Pelicot after he was caught upskirting women at a supermarket. A forensic psychiatrist who interviewed him, Dr Laurent Layet, told police that something about his behaviour seemed off. ""I told the police that, for me, there was something that just didn't gel between what he says and what he did,"" Layet said.Police then searched Pelicot’s devices and found extensive evidence of his crimes. ""I think that Dominique Pelicot is one of the biggest sexual criminals that I have ever come across,"" Layet said, as quoted by The Sydney Morning Herald.Darian, who had long been worried about her mother’s declining health, realised in hindsight that it was linked to the drugs Pelicot was administering. ""I cried. I was so angry because I knew that she had some health issues, and I understood right away that it was linked to all of these drugs,"" she said.The investigation took a darker turn when officers found images of Darian herself in Pelicot’s files. ""I'm almost naked ... there's no way someone can enter my bedroom for taking those pictures if I'm not drugged,"" she said, adding that she strongly believes her father raped her.Beyond his crimes against his wife, Pelicot is now being investigated for two cold cases. In 1999, a real estate agent known as Marion was attacked in a Paris apartment, with DNA from the crime scene later matching Pelicot’s. However, he has not been charged due to France’s statute of limitations.Marion’s lawyer, Florence Rault, said the case could be reopened if linked to another unsolved crime. She pointed to a similar 1991 case in which a woman named Sophie Narme was raped and murdered. ""For me both cases were exactly the same,"" Rault said.Darian, who continues to follow the investigation, said she hopes Pelicot faces further charges. ""I'm thinking about all of his invisible victims,"" she said.She is now working to raise awareness about chemical submission—the use of drugs to render victims unconscious before assaulting them. ""It can happen in your personal sphere, at home,"" she warned. ""Where you should be safe, and where you can't even imagine that it can happen.""","Dominique Pelicot, 72, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for drugging and raping his wife.

Donald Trumpo Harry Meghan: Did Donald Trump confirm Harry-Meghan divorce rumors? Here's what happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-donald-trump-confirm-harry-meghan-divorce-rumors-heres-what-happened/articleshow/118075531.cms,"President Trump said he would not deport Harry because he already has enough problems because of his wife Meghan Markle.

Donald Trump always hated Meghan Markle; his old video with Joe Morgan viral



Why could Harry be deported? What is the visa case?



President Donald Trump unwittingly dropped a major hint about the marital problems of Harry and Meghan Markle as he, in an interview with the New York Post, said he has no interest in pursuing the visa case against Harry. ""I'll leave him alone. He's got enough problems with his wife. She's terrible,"" Donald Trump said without naming Meghan Markle.A lot has been discussed about Harry and Meghan's marriage problems with insiders claiming that they are on the verge of a divorce. Vanity Fair did a cover story about the ex-royals in which they claimed that Meghan Markle was approached to write a ""post-divorce"" book though there was no such scenario on the horizon. Then there were speculations that they were separating their professional lives -- with Meghan Markle focussing on her shows and entrepreneurial works and Harry remaining busy with his philanthropic works. But Harry and Meghan made several joint appearances since then -- they visited relief centers in Los Angeles to help the fire victims; they appeared together to launch the Invictus Games in Vancouver Saturday.In 2022, Donald Trump spoke about Harry and Meghan on the Piers Morgan show and said he was never a fan of Meghan Markle.""I'm not a fan of Meghan, I'm not a fan, and I wasn't right from the beginning. I think poor Harry is being led around by his nose.,"" Trump said in the old interview.""Do you think it's going to end?"" Piers Morgan asked. ""I do, I've been a very good predictor, as you know, I've predicted almost everything, it'll end, and it'll end bad,"" the former president replied. ""I wonder if Harry's going to go back on his hands and knees and say please. You know, I think Harry's been led down a path.""""I would, the only thing I disagree with the Queen on, probably one of the only things ever, is that I think she should have said, 'If that's your choice fine, but you no longer have titles and frankly don't come around,'"" Trump said. ""He has been so disrespectful to the country and I think he's an embarrassment.""After stepping down as royals, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle settled in the US, in Montecito. After Harry's memoir Spare was published, he was accused of lying in his visa form as in his book, he admitted to taking marijuana, cocaine, and psychedelic drugs. Every US visa applicant has to give information about their drug history. Either Harry lied about drugs in the form or he was given preferential treatment, the lawsuit claimed demanding Harry's visa records. But the judge ruled in favor of Harry that his visa records would remain private. Donald Trump could have pursued the case and Harry-Meghan reportedly expected that but Trump said he would leave Harry alone.","President Trump said he would not deport Harry because he already has enough problems because of his wife Meghan Markle.

Netanyahu calls Trump’s plan ‘revolutionary’

Arab nations reject Trump’s plan

US President Donald Trump reiterated his plan on Sunday for the United States to take control of Gaza, describing the war-torn enclave as a ""big real estate site"" and suggesting that Arab nations would absorb displaced Palestinians.""I'm committed to buying and owning Gaza,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to the Super Bowl, as per AP.""As far as us rebuilding it, we may give it to other states in the Middle East to build sections of it. Other people may do it through our auspices. But we're committed to owning it, taking it, and making sure that Hamas doesn't move back. There's nothing to move back into. The place is a demolition site. The remainder will be demolished"", Trump said.US President added that Palestinians would not want to return to Gaza if given an alternative. ""They don't want to return to Gaza. If we could give them a home in a safer area - the only reason they're talking about returning to Gaza is they don't have an alternative. When they have an alternative, they don't want to return to Gaza,"" he said.“I think that it’s a big mistake to allow people, the Palestinians, or the people living in Gaza, to go back yet another time, and we don’t want Hamas going back. And think of it as a big real estate site and the United States is going to own it and we’ll slowly, very slowly, we’re in no rush, develop it. We’re going to bring stability to the Middle East soon,” Trump told reporters.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who recently met with Trump, called the proposal a ""revolutionary, creative vision,"" saying it could reshape the future of the region. ""For a whole year, we’ve been told that in the 'day after,' we need the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) in Gaza, the Palestinian Authority,"" Netanyahu told his cabinet, per CNN.""President Trump came with a completely different vision, much better for the state of Israel"", he added.However, Trump's remarks have drawn strong regional backlash. Hamas official Izzat Al-Rishq dismissed the idea, saying, ""Gaza is not a property that can be bought and sold, and it is an integral part of our occupied Palestinian land.""Saudi Arabia had condemned Netanyahu’s suggestion that Palestinians could be resettled elsewhere, calling it a distraction from Israel’s actions in Gaza.

It was a prime opportunity to respond to Trump's economic threat. Instead, Ishiba took a different tack - becoming the latest foreign leader to fawn over, rather than flout, the US president.""I was so excited to see such a celebrity on television,"" Ishiba said, prompting Trump to turn to him and smile from ear to ear. ""On television he is frightening, and he has a very strong personality, but when I met with him, actually, he was very sincere and very powerful, and with strong will for the US.""Days before, PM Netanyahu called Trump ""the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House"".

During the first Trump term, President Emmanuel Macron of France gushed over him. Poland offered to rename a US military base Fort Trump. Netanyahu proposed that an Israeli settlement in the Golan Heights be renamed Trump Heights. PM Justin Trudeau of Canada invitedTrump's daughter Ivanka to take part in a meeting of female business leaders. But by 2018, Trump had imposed tariffs on Canada and called Trudeau ""dishonest & weak"". Trump and Macron's bromance morphed into a feud over the direction of Nato.

Policemen at the checkpost offered stiff resistance in an encounter which lasted two hours, following which the terrorists fled,” the provincial police said in a statement.Pakistan has experienced an escalation in militancy in KP, adjacent to Afghanistan, following the collapse of a tenuous truce between TTP and the state in Nov 2022.Pakistani authorities have linked the surge in militant violence to cross-border incursions from Afghanistan, alleging that the Kabul administration is facilitating TTP fighters, a claim Afghan authorities refute. Most of these assaults have been directed at security and law-enforcement personnel, although civilians and govt officials have also been impacted.In KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district last week, four soldiers were killed by gunfire and an improvised explosive device (IED) unleashed by terrorists.In Balochistan, another restive province in Pakistan’s south, 18 soldiers were killed in an attack by terrorists earlier this month.Islamabad think-tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) has described 2024 as the most lethal year for security forces in a decade, with a minimum of 685 military and police fatalities resulting from 444 terror attacks.Alongside such attacks, militants have stepped up targeted killings and kidnappings of officials in KP and Balochistan.","Nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

ISLAMABAD : The UN refugees and migration agencies on Wednesday expressed their concern over Pakistan 's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting relocation to the United States and elsewhere.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR , and the international organization for migration in a statement said they were seeking clarification from Pakistan, which said last week it would deport the refugees back to Afghanistan unless their cases were processed quickly by the countries that had agreed to take them in.About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the US under a program that helps people at risk because of their work with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. They were among tens of thousands of Afghans who fled to neighboring Pakistan after their country fell to the Taliban in 2021.However, they were left in limbo after President Donald Trump paused US refugee programs last month.""A UNHCR-issued non-return advisory has been in place since 2021, calling for a suspension of forced returns of Afghan nationals from any country regardless of their status,"" the joint UNHCR-IOM statement said.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif last week gave the green light to evict Afghans without papers from the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi before March 31, in preparation for deportation if they were not relocated to their host countries.UNHCR and IOM said they are especially concerned for Afghan nationals who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians and others.It said since January 1, 2025, an uptick in arrests of Afghan nationals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi has caused significant distress, with reports of Afghan nationals of various documentation statuses being rounded up.The Trump administration also announced the US refugee admissions program would be suspended from January 27 for at least three months. It has shocked Afghans who were hoping to travel to the United States soon.Afghans in Pakistan have been virtually living in hiding since 2023 when a crackdown began on foreigners who are in the country without proper documentation. An estimated 800,000 Afghans have either gone back voluntarily or been deported since despite criticism from UN agencies, rights groups and the Taliban.Besides thousands of Afghans who are living in Pakistan and awaiting travel to host countries, there are around 1.45 million Afghan nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees in Pakistan as well but their stay has been extended until June.In the statement, UNHCR and IOM urged ""Pakistan to implement any relocation measures with due consideration for human rights standards, including due process, and the legal status of proof of registration (POR) and afghan citizen card (ACC) holders, who have resided in Pakistan for an extended period of time"".""Pakistan has a proud tradition of hosting refugees, saving millions of lives. This generosity is greatly appreciated,"" UNHCR representative in Pakistan Philippa Candler said.""IOM is committed to work with the government of Pakistan and UNHCR to develop a mechanism to register, manage and screen Afghan nationals in Pakistan,"" said IOM chief of mission, Mio Sato.She said ""This will open the door to tailored solutions including international protection to those in need and pathways for Afghan nationals, with long-standing socioeconomic and family ties in the country.""","UN refugees and migration agencies express concern over Pakistan's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees. Pakistan said last week it would deport the refugees back to Afghanistan unless their cases were processed quickly. About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the US under a program that helps people at risk.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117956430,imgsize-1187200,width-400,resizemode-4/117956430.jpg"

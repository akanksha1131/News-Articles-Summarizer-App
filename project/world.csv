Trump Undergoes Mystery Health Checkup At Walter Reed Amid Growing Speculations





Donald Trump was declared in “exceptional health” following a medical evaluation, according to a memo released by the White House on Friday, with his “cardiac age” reportedly 14 years younger than his chronological age.""Trump remains in exceptional health, exhibiting strong cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, and physical performance,"" Trump's physician Sean Barbabella said in a memo.Trump also underwent preventive health screenings and received immunizations, including his annual flu shot and updated Covid-19 booster, ahead of upcoming international travel.""His cardiac age - a validated measure of cardiovascular vitality via ECG - was found be approximately 14 years younger than his chronological age,"" the memo read.Trump, 79, became the oldest person to be inaugurated as US president in January and ranks as the second oldest to hold the office in American history.Trump visited Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, on Friday morning for a routine annual checkup, as well as a meeting and remarks with military personnel. The visit came six months after he underwent a comprehensive physical examination.A White House memo released after Trump’s April exam noted that he is 6 feet 3 inches (190 cm) tall, weighs 224 pounds (102 kg), and has well-controlled high cholesterol. The memo highlighted both his overall health and his golf performance, as cited by Reuters.Since his April exam, Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition often seen in older adults that can lead to leg swelling.Trump’s health has come under scrutiny a year after former President Joe Biden ended his 2024 reelection bid amid questions about his fitness for office. During last year’s campaign, Trump contrasted himself with Biden, presenting himself as younger and in better physical condition.Trump’s former physician, Harold Bornstein, recalled that during the 2015 presidential campaign, Trump dictated a statement, attributed to Bornstein, describing his health as “astonishingly excellent.”Bornstein also said that during a 2019 visit to Walter Reed, Trump asked staff to sign nondisclosure agreements for the appointment, which was later revealed to be a colonoscopy, according to NBC News.","Donald Trump was declared in ""exceptional health"" following a medical evaluation, according to a memo released by the White House on Friday.

'It seems we have been prey to criminal actor': Did Nobel Peace Prize leak?

Norwegian officials are investigating suspicious online betting on the Polymarket gambling site that suggests a rare leak from the secretive committee responsible for awarding the Nobel Peace Prize Online bets for Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado spiked shortly after midnight on Thursday, Norwegian time, according to information on the site. Kristian Berg Harpviken, head of the Nobel Institute, told Bloomberg: “It seems we have been prey to a criminal actor who wants to earn money on our information.”Hours later, Machado was awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her democratic activism in the authoritarian nation, marking the first time a Venezuelan has received the coveted honour, Guardian reported.She was informed of her win at 10.50 Norwegian time by Harpviken. However, two Norwegian newspapers, Aftenposten and Finansavisen, later discovered unusual movement in the online betting markets ahead of the announcement. Until Thursday, Yulia Navalnaya, the economist and widow of former Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, led the odds against all other prospective winners on Polymarket.The site has become a popular place in recent years to wager on political events, with the vast majority of bets focused on American politics.Many of the more niche wagers rely on rumours and speculation, skewing the odds that determine a payout.Shortly after midnight Norwegian time, Machado’s odds were 3.75%, trailing both Navalnaya and Donald Trump.Less than two hours later, however, they surged to 72.8%, suggesting a surge of bets on her victory. In one case, a user won more than Rs 5.4 lakh placing a bet on Machado: another winner used a profile which was created the same day the bet was placed, according to Finansavisen.Jørgen Watne Frydnes, head of the Nobel committee, told Aftenposten the group “tends to be very good at keeping secrets”, citing a highly secretive process over the last half-century. Harpviken told Aftenposten it was “too early to be certain” if the winner had been leaked, but said he expected an investigation to be launched.","Online bets for Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado spiked shortly after midnight on Thursday, Norwegian time.

Qatar will build an Air Force facility at US' Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, defense secretary Pete Hegseth announced on Friday.Hegseth made the announcement at the Pentagon alongside Qatari Defense Minister Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, noting that the agreement will allow Qatari pilots to train alongside US personnel.Hegseth said he is ""proud that today we're signing a letter of acceptance to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force Facility at the Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho.""""The location will host a contingent of Qatari F-15's and pilots to enhance our combined training, increase lethality, interoperability, it's just another example of our partnership,"" he said, as cited by CBS News.""And I hope you know, your excellency, that you can count on us.""While the US does not host any foreign military bases, several allied forces maintain training presences within the country.

However, to be clear, Qatar will not have their own base in the United States-nor anything like a base.We control the existing base, like we do with all partners,"" Hegseth later said through a post on X, clarifying that Qatar is not going to have its own military base in the US.The announcement drew strong criticism from Trump ally and right-wing influencer Laura Loomer, who called the plan “an abomination” and accused Qatar of ties to Islamic terrorist organizations.“No foreign country should have a military base on US soil. Especially Islamic countries,” Loomer said through a post on social media.The announcement follows President Donald Trump’s recent executive order pledging to use all measures, including military force, to defend Qatar, home to the largest US military base in the Middle East.Qatar also played a “substantial” role in the Israel-Hamas peace agreement, Hegseth noted Friday, a point echoed by other senior administration officials.Trump’s decision to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from Qatar for use as a presidential plane has sparked debate over ethical and national security implications.

US government shutdown day 10: White House begins mass federal layoffs; Trump labels job cuts as ‘democrat-oriented’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-government-shutdown-day-10-white-house-begins-mass-federal-layoffs-trump-labels-job-cuts-as-democrat-oriented/articleshow/124468334.cms,"Donald Trump (AP)

US Government Shutdown Enters Second Week: Why It Happened & Who It Impacts





The White House budget office announced Friday that mass layoffs of federal employees have begun, as US President Donald Trump’s administration increases pressure on Democrats amid a government shutdown entering its 10th day.Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought confirmed on X that “RIFs have begun,” referring to reduction-in-force plans to shrink the federal workforce. In a related court filing, the office said more than 4,000 employees would be terminated, though it added that the funding situation remains “fluid and rapidly evolving.”Trump on Friday blamed Democrats for the layoffs, saying many would lose their jobs and hinting the cuts would target “Democrat-oriented areas.”“They started this thing,” Trump told reporters during an Oval Office event, describing the job cuts as “democrat-oriented.”“It’ll be a lot, and we’ll announce the numbers over the next couple of days,” Trump said. “But it’ll be a lot of people.”“These are people that the Democrats wanted, that, in many cases, were not appropriate,” Trump said of federal employees, adding, “many of them will be fired.”Job cuts were underway across several agencies, including the Treasury Department, the Department of Health and Human Services, the IRS, and the departments of Education, Commerce, and Homeland Security’s cybersecurity division, officials said.The full scale of the layoffs remains unclear, though about 300,000 federal civilian workers were already expected to depart this year as part of Trump’s broader downsizing initiative, as cited by Reuters.Trump has also ordered a freeze on at least $28 billion in infrastructure funding for New York, California, and Illinois, states with large Democratic constituencies and vocal critics of his administration.According to a Justice Department court filing, more than 4,200 federal employees across seven agencies have received layoff notices, including over 1,400 at the Treasury Department and at least 1,100 at the Department of Health and Human Services.The Education Department confirmed on Friday that it was among the agencies hit by new layoffs. A labor union said nearly all staff below the director level at the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education were being dismissed, while fewer than 10 employees were cut from the Office of Communications and Outreach.Layoff notices were also issued at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), part of the Department of Homeland Security, which said the move was aimed at “getting CISA back on mission.” CISA has previously drawn Trump’s criticism for challenging misinformation about the 2020 election and the Covid-19 pandemic, as reported by AP.Earlier this week, Trump hinted that layoffs could arrive in “four or five days.”“If this keeps going on, it’ll be substantial, and a lot of those jobs will never come back,” he said on Tuesday.","White House budget office says mass layoffs of federal employees have begun.

A powerful earthquake measuring 7.6 magnitude struck the Mindanao region of the Philippines on Friday, triggering tsunami warnings for nearby coastal areas, according to the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC).The earthquake occurred at a depth of 58 kilometers beneath the surface and has left two people dead.EMSC had initially reported the earthquake's magnitude as 7.2 before revising it upward to 7.6.The US Tsunami Warning System had issued an alert, warning that dangerous tsunami waves could potentially affect coastal areas within 300 kilometers of the earthquake's epicenter.Indonesia also issued a tsunami warning for northern Sulawesi and Papua regions after a strong earthquake hit the southern Philippines, Indonesia's geophysics agency said.The agency's modelling suggested there was a risk of tsunami waves as high as 50 cm hitting Indonesia's shorelines, it said in a statement.The warning has now been lifted.The Philippines is still grappling with the aftermath of a 6.9 magnitude earthquake that struck on September 30, claiming 74 lives and forcing thousands to evacuate in Cebu province, particularly affecting Bogo city and surrounding areas.The Philippines' location on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of seismic faults around the ocean, makes it particularly vulnerable to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.The country faces approximately 20 typhoons and storms annually, requiring extensive disaster response efforts from both government agencies and volunteer organizations.These natural disasters have established the Philippines as one of the world's most disaster-prone nations, demanding constant preparedness and response mechanisms.","The earthquake occurred at a depth of 58 kilometers beneath the surface and has left two people dead.

'Democracy Under Siege': Ex-US Official Slams Trump's 'Enemy Within' Barb, Crackdown On Dissent

Who is Letitia James?







New York Attorney General Letitia James, who was indicted on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution, said that she is a ""fearless"" person.Calling the charges of bank fraud ""baseless,"" James referred to a civil fraud lawsuit she successfully filed against President Donald Trump and his company for alleged fraudulent business practices, which resulted in a fine of approximately $465 million being overturned by an appeals court in August.The statement also mentioned the resignation of US Attorney Erik Siebert, who departed his position after President Trump criticised him for not bringing charges against James and former FBI Director James Comey. Comey was indicted last month following the appointment of US Attorney Lindsey Halligan, Axios reported.James said, ""This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system. He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State Attorney General."" She continued, ""These charges are baseless, and the president's own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost. The president's actions are a grave violation of our Constitutional order and have drawn sharp criticism from members of both parties.Regarding Siebert, James said, ""His decision to fire a United States Attorney who refused to bring charges against me—and replace them with someone who is blindly loyal not to the law, but to the president—is antithetical to the bedrock principles of our country."" She added, ""This is the time for leaders on both sides of the aisle to speak out against this blatant perversion of our system of justice.""The Attorney General concluded, ""I stand strongly behind my office's litigation against the Trump Organization. We conducted a two-year investigation based on the facts and evidence—not politics. Judges have upheld the trial court's finding that Donald Trump, his company, and his two sons are liable for fraud.""""I am a proud woman of faith, and I know that faith and fear cannot share the same space. And so today I am not fearful, I am fearless, and as my faith teaches me, no weapon formed against me shall prosper. We will fight these baseless charges aggressively, and my office will continue to fiercely protect New Yorkers and their rights. And I will continue to do my job.""In response, Halligan stated, ""No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust. The facts and the law in this case are clear.""Letitia “Tish” James is the 67th Attorney General for the state of New York. Elected in 2018, she became the first woman of colour to hold statewide office in New York and the first woman to be elected Attorney General. James brings decades of experience and a strong record of achievements to her role as a powerful and effective attorney.Prior to her current position, she was the public advocate for the City of New York. Elected in 2013, she became the first woman of colour to hold citywide office. During her tenure, her office passed more legislation than all previous public advocates combined, including a groundbreaking law that banned questions about salary history from the employment process to address the pervasive gender wage gap.Before serving as public advocate, James represented the 35th Council District in Brooklyn in the New York City Council for ten years. As a council member, she passed the Safe Housing Act, legislation that required landlords to improve living conditions for tenants in New York City’s worst buildings.Prior to her election to the City Council, James was head of the Brooklyn Regional Office of the New York State Attorney General’s Office. James began her career as a public defender at the Legal Aid Society. A proud Brooklynite, she is a graduate of Lehman College and Howard University School of Law.","New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Russia would not worry if the United States decides not to extend the New START treaty, which limits nuclear warheads and expires next year.The New START treaty, signed in 2010 between the United States and Russia, limits each side to 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads and 700 delivery systems, including missiles and bombers. It also allows mutual inspections and data exchanges to ensure compliance and maintain transparency in nuclear arms control.Putin said that it would be a “shame” if nothing remained of the long-standing arms control framework between the two powers, reports new agency Reuters.Speaking to reporters at a summit in Tajikistan, Putin said that an arms race was already underway and confirmed that Russia was continuing to develop and test new-generation nuclear weapons. “Will these few months be enough to make a decision on an extension? I think it will be enough if there is goodwill to extend these agreements. And if the Americans decide they don't need it, that's not a big deal for us,” he said.The Russian leader noted that Moscow was ready to voluntarily keep the limits defined under the New START treaty if Washington agreed to do the same. The START agreement is due to expire in February.The United States has yet to formally respond to Russia’s offer.“We're ready to negotiate if it's acceptable and useful for the Americans. If not, then no, but that would be a shame, because then there would be nothing left in terms of deterrence in the area of strategic offensive weapons,” Putin said.Without naming, Putin also warned that other countries might be preparing to carry out nuclear tests. “So some countries are thinking about it; as far as I know, they're even preparing, and that's why I said that if they do it, we'll do the same,” he said, adding that extending the treaty “for at least a year is a good idea.”",Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Russia would not worry if the United States decides not to extend the New START treaty.

Firings of federal workers begin as White House seeks to pressure Democrats in government shutdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/firings-of-federal-workers-begin-as-white-house-seeks-to-pressure-democrats-in-government-shutdown/articleshow/124466425.cms,".

‘NONSENSE!’: Johnson REJECTS Jeffries’ ‘DESPERATE’ Government Shutdown Debate Offer





WASHINGTON: The White House budget office said Friday that mass firings of federal workers have started in an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers in the ongoing government shutdown.Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said on the social media site X that the ""RIFs have begun,"" referring to reduction-in-force plans aimed at reducing the size of the federal government.A spokesperson for the budget office said the reductions are ""substantial"" but did not offer more immediate details.The Education Department is among the agencies hit by new layoffs , a department spokesperson said Friday without providing more details. The department had about 4,100 employees when Trump took office in January, but its workforce was nearly halved amid mass layoffs in the Republican administration's first months. At the start of the shutdown, it had about 2,500 employees.Federal health workers were also being fired Friday, though a US Department of Health and Human Services spokesman did not say how many or which agencies were being hit hardest. And an official for the American Federation of Government Employees, who is suing the Trump administration over the firings, said in a legal filing Friday that the Treasury Department is set to issue layoff notices to 1,300 employees.Notices of firings have also taken place at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which leads federal efforts to reduce risk to the nation's cyber and physical infrastructure, according to a person familiar with the actions who spoke anonymously because they were not authorised to discuss them.The White House previewed that it would pursue the aggressive layoff tactic shortly before the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, telling all federal agencies to submit their reduction-in-force plans to the budget office for its review. It said reduction-in-force plans could apply to federal programs whose funding would lapse in a government shutdown, are otherwise not funded and are ""not consistent with the President's priorities. ""This goes far beyond what usually happens in a government shutdown, which is that federal workers are furloughed but restored to their jobs once the shutdown ends.Democrats have tried to call the administration's bluff, arguing the firings could be illegal, and seemed bolstered by the fact that the White House had yet to carry out the firings.But President Donald Trump said earlier this week that he would soon have more information about how many federal jobs would be eliminated.""I'll be able to tell you that in four or five days if this keeps going on,"" he said Tuesday in the Oval Office as he met with Canada's prime minister, Mark Carney. ""If this keeps going on, it'll be substantial, and a lot of those jobs will never come back.""The AFGE, a labor union for federal employees, asked a federal judge Friday for a restraining order to halt the firings, calling the action an abuse of power designed to punish workers and pressure Congress.""It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,"" said the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, Everett Kelley, in a statement.Meanwhile, the halls of the Capitol were quiet on Friday, the 10th day of the shutdown, with both the House and the Senate out of Washington and both sides digging in for a protracted shutdown fight. Senate Republicans have tried repeatedly to cajole Democratic holdouts to vote for a stopgap bill to reopen the government, but Democrats have refused as they hold out for a firm commitment to extend health care benefits.Some Republicans on Capitol Hill have suggested that Vought's threats of mass layoffs have been unhelpful to bipartisan talks on the funding standoff.The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, said in a statement that the ""shutdown does not give Trump or Vought new, special powers"" to lay off workers.""This is nothing new, and no one should be intimidated by these crooks,"" she added.The top Senate Democrat, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, said the blame for the layoffs rested with Trump.""Let's be blunt: nobody's forcing Trump and Vought to do this,"" Schumer said. ""They don't have to do it; they want to. They're callously choosing to hurt people-the workers who protect our country, inspect our food, respond when disasters strike. This is deliberate chaos.""Still, there was no sign that the top Democratic and Republican Senate leaders were even talking about a way to solve the impasse. Instead, Senate Majority Leader John Thune continued to try to peel away centrist Democrats who may be willing to cross party lines as the shutdown pain dragged on.""It's time for them to get a backbone,"" Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said during a news conference.The Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan organisation that tracks federal service, says that more than 200,000 civil servants have left since the start of this administration in January due to earlier firings, retirements and deferred resignation offers.""These unnecessary and misguided reductions in force will further hollow out our federal government, rob it of critical expertise and hobble its capacity to effectively serve the public,"" said the organisation's president and CEO, Max Stier.","The Education Department is among the agencies hit by new layoffs, a department spokesperson says. The AFGE, a labor union for federal employees, asked a federal judge Friday for a restraining order to halt the firings. President Donald Trump said earlier this week that he would soon have more information about how many federal jobs would be eliminated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124466451,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-60.jpg"

First Lady Melania Trump Friday made a rare announcement in which she said she opened a private channel of communication with Russian President Vladimir Putin since she wrote him a letter in August on the impact of the war on kids in Ukraine. Following months of private discussion between Russian officials and Melania's office, Russia allowed eight Ukrainian children to reunite with their parents.Melania announced that these eight children were all returned to their families over the last 24 hours with a commitment that the two sides will continue to work toward reunifying additional children displaced as part of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.“This remains an ongoing effort,” Melania Trump said in a brief speech at the White House. “Plans are already underway to reunify more children in the immediate future. I hope peace will come soon. It can begin with our children.”In August, Melania received praise for writing a letter to Putin that Trump delivered to him. Melania, in the letter, urged Putin to consider the impact of the war on Ukrainian children.Putin responded to Melania Trump in writing, the first lady said Friday, offering details about the Ukrainian children in Russia and offering to talk directly about the issue.“Since then, President Putin and I have had an open channel of communication regarding the welfare of these children,” Melania Trump said. “We have agreed to cooperate with each other for the benefit of all people involved in this war.”“My ongoing mission is twofold: To optimize a transparent free-flow exchange of health-related information surrounding all children who have (fallen) victim to this war,” Melania said, “and to facilitate the regular reunification of children with their families until each individual returns home.”",Melania Trump announced she opened a channel of talk with Putin and the efforts led by her office secured the release of eight Ukrainian children. “Plans are already underway to reunify more children in the immediate future.

LAHORE: Violent clashes erupted Friday between police and Islamists in Pakistan 's eastern city of Lahore after security forces tried to stop thousands of demonstrators from leaving for the capital, Islamabad, where they planned to stage a pro-Palestinian rally outside the US Embassy, officials said.The clashes in the capital of Punjab province began Thursday but intensified Friday after police baton-charged the demonstrators and fired tear gas to disperse them at multiple locations. Protesters hurled stones at officers in response.In a statement, the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan party, or TLP, claimed that two of its supporters had been killed and 50 others injured since Thursday. There was no immediate comment from the Punjab provincial government, which is headed by Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, the niece of the prime minister.The protest comes after Hamas and Israel agreed to a ceasefire plan brokered by US President Donald Trump.Speaking to thousands of worshippers in Lahore at Friday prayers, TLP chief Saad Rizvi announced the march, saying, ""We will now march from Lahore to the US Embassy"" in Islamabad.He said: ""I will walk at the head of the long march. Arrest is not a problem, bullets are not a problem, shells are not a problem - martyrdom is our destiny.""Police officers were swinging batons and firing tear gas to disperse demonstrators near the main TLP office, according to witnesses, who said residents also faced severe difficulties because of the tear gas.The violence has disrupted daily life in parts of Lahore, as residents struggled to reach home because of road closures and continued clashes.On Friday, authorities shut schools, colleges and universities in Lahore, a city of more than 14 million people.The government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has suspended mobile internet service in Islamabad and nearby Rawalpindi as part of measures aimed at preventing demonstrators from reaching the national capital.Authorities have also placed shipping containers along the main motorway, the main highways and roads leading to Islamabad to block protesters.Lahore is about 350 kilometers (210 miles) from Islamabad.The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad issued a security alert ahead of the march, warning of possible disruptions and urging American citizens to exercise caution.""Large crowds and traffic congestion are expected, along with a precautionary security presence, an increased number of checkpoints, and associated disruptions to local mobile and internet networks in the region,"" the embassy said, adding that the duration of the protests is unknown.It advised U.S. citizens to avoid large gatherings, remain aware of their surroundings and keep a low profile.Deputy Interior Minister Talal Chaudhry said Thursday that the TLP had not submitted a request for permission to hold the rally. The group denied the claim, saying it had applied for permission for a peaceful march to express solidarity with Palestinians.The TLP, known for staging disruptive and sometimes violent protests, has drawn criticism online. But many users have accused the government of overreacting by blocking roads even before the demonstrators began their march.""Why are these demonstrators coming to Islamabad for the rally when the peace process has already started in Palestine?"" asked Mohammad Ashfaq, 35, as he turned back from a road block in Islamabad.He said he tried using longer routes to reach the city, but police had also blocked those roads with shipping containers.

Opposition leader María Corina Machado of Venezuela has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize , beating a crowded field of nominees that included US President Donald Trump , whose campaign for the honour had drawn international attention. The Nobel Committee said it was honouring Machado “for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy. ”The decision dealt a personal blow to Trump, who had publicly lobbied for the award, calling himself the “president of peace” and repeatedly claiming to have “ended six or seven wars.” But it is also a diplomatic setback for Pakistan , one of the countries that had formally nominated Trump for the prize, portraying him as a “champion of peace.”Pakistan had gone all in on Trump this year. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and Field Marshall Asim Munir made a visit to the White House in August, where they met Trump in a rare Oval Office engagement. Islamabad hailed the meeting as a breakthrough moment in US-Pakistan ties, saying the two sides had discussed cooperation on counter-terrorism, regional security, and new economic ventures. This was Munir’s third trip to the oval office just this year alone.Sharif, speaking later at the United Nations, described Trump as “a champion of peace” and said nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize was “the least we could do.” Pakistan’s nomination cited Trump’s claimed role in “de-escalating” tensions between India and Pakistan, a claim New Delhi has consistently rejected.In recent months, the Trump administration has pushed to deepen economic ties with Islamabad even as trade talks with India remain stalled. The US government announced its intent to collaborate with Pakistan on critical minerals and hydrocarbons, while Trump himself unveiled a plan to help Pakistan develop its “massive oil reserves.”On his Truth Social platform, Trump said, “We have finalised a deal with Pakistan, where both countries will collaborate on developing Pakistan’s extensive oil reserves… Perhaps, in the future, they might sell oil to India!”The boast turned out to be wildly optimistic. According to energy data, Pakistan has just 0.02% of the world’s crude oil reserves, less than a tenth of India’s production. Yet Islamabad’s enthusiasm for Trump reflected both economic desperation and the hope of finding a patron in Washington amid regional isolation.For Islamabad, Trump’s loss is more than symbolic. Pakistan’s government had staked diplomatic capital on its public embrace of the US president, even as India-Pakistan tensions simmered. By nominating Trump and describing him as a “friend of peace,” Sharif’s administration had hoped to reset relations with Washington, a move seen as a pivot away from Beijing.Instead, Pakistan now faces embarrassment on two fronts: Trump’s failure to win the Nobel Prize and the exposure of Islamabad’s overreach. The White House never released an official readout of the Trump–Sharif–Munir meeting, and Washington’s silence contrasted sharply with Islamabad’s exuberant press releases and photos of a smiling Trump flashing his signature thumbs-up.The loss also weakens Pakistan’s argument that Trump’s mediation ended the brief but intense India–Pakistan conflict earlier this year, a claim denied by India’s military, which maintains that the ceasefire was negotiated directly between the two countries’ commanders.For now, the Nobel Peace Prize has gone to a woman fighting for democracy in Venezuela. But for Donald Trump and his unlikely backers in Islamabad the snub serves as a reminder that peace cannot be won through press releases or self-congratulation. It must be earned.For Trump, the Nobel campaign was intensely personal. Over the past year, he has repeatedly told reporters that he “should have gotten [the prize] four or five times” and that “everyone says” he deserves it. He even reminded UN delegates in September that his “peace record” was unmatched, claiming to have ended wars between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan, and “even Thailand and Cambodia.”But this relentless self-promotion likely backfired. Members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee have long avoided appearing to reward leaders who lobby openly for recognition. “We base our decision only on the work and the will of Alfred Nobel,” Committee Chair Jørgen Watne Frydnes said, adding that lobbying or political pressure had “no bearing” on their choice.Moreover, Trump’s record remains divisive. While he claims credit for brokering ceasefires, critics point out that many conflicts he boasts of ending were never formally resolved, and others, such as the war in Ukraine, continue to rage. His domestic policies including mass deportations, expanded war powers, and withdrawal from global climate pacts have also undercut his image as a peacemaker.As one expert told the Associated Press, the Nobel Committee prefers to honour the “durability of peace and the quiet work of institutions”, not the “rhetoric of power.”","María Corina Machado of Venezuela has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize.

Hamas-style Ambush Stuns Pak: 12 Soldiers FALL Into Pakistani Taliban Trap, Drones Captured | Watch





A deadly ambush by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters near the Afghan border in the early hours of Wednesday claimed the lives of at least 11 Pakistani soldiers, including two senior officers - Maj Tayyab Rahat and Lt Col Junaid Arif.The attack was reported from the Kurram district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province. TTP fighters launched heavy gunfire at a military post, catching Pak military personnel by surprise. The TTP also suffered casualties in the fierce gunbattle, which lasted for a few hours, though the exact number remains unclear, sources said.The latest attack comes amid rising tensions, with the TTP retaliating against the Pakistani military's support for terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), which have gained ground in KPK of late. The ideological divide between the groups - the TTP adheres to Deobandi ideology and is anti-Pakistan, whereas groups like LeT follow the Ahle Hadith ideology and are pro-Pakistan -- is only fuelling the violence.Despite Pakistan's long-standing support for the Taliban, a militant group trained in Deobandi madrasas and instrumental in the fight against Russian and American forces, as well as local ethnic groups like the Tajiks, the TTP has defied Islamabad's expectations by asserting its autonomy.This independence poses a potential challenge for Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, particularly in its plans to establish a new base for LeT in KPK, a region considered a Taliban stronghold.The TTP has turned vocal against Pak government's directly facilitating the relocation of terror groups from POK to Khyber regions. The situation turned tense when Pakistani military launched a ""clean-up drive"" in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to neutralise TTP cadres in Lower Dir district, a move aimed at smoothening LeT operations. The drive, launched in June, has not only resulted in the death of over two dozen TTP operatives but also allowed the LeT to start constructing its new terror centre within a month of the operation.","The attack was reported from the Kurram district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province.

After suffering major losses at home -- Muridke terror camp - during Operation Sindoor , Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) has reportedly formed a covert alliance with Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), the South Asian wing of ISIS, allegedly engineered and funded by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).Reports indicate the alliance aims to target Baloch people, with possible expansion to Jammu and Kashmir.A circulated video on social media shows LeT commander Rana Muhammad Ishfaq training with ISKP’s Shafiq Mengal at an undisclosed location in Balochistan.A recently surfaced photograph shows ISKP’s coordinator in Balochistan, Mir Shafiq Mengal, handing a pistol to Rana Muhammad Ashfaq, a senior LeT commander -- a symbolic gesture signalling formal coordination between the two groups under ISI patronage.Mir Shafiq Mengal has helped establish ISKP bases in Mastung and Khuzdar and reportedly led death squads against separatists. LeT’s longstanding presence in Quetta has facilitated the growing closeness between the groups.Meanwhile, this covert alliance between the two terror groups could raise serious concerns for India, as it is reportedly aimed at expanding operations in the Kashmir region, raising major security concerns.Intelligence sources say the goal is evident: to crush the Baloch insurgency, strengthen Pakistan’s control over Afghanistan’s unstable border regions, and restart terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir while maintaining plausible deniability.Observers note a worrying shift in ISKP’s propaganda magazine 'Yalgaar', which signals an expressed intent to extend operations into the Kashmir Valley, apparently coordinated and supported by Pakistan’s deep state.Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) has a long history of terror attacks on Indian soil, including 26/11 Mumbai attacks.Arun Gupta, director of VIF and former deputy NSA, said, “Pakistan is a master in proxy wars, using terrorist groups to fight insurgencies, but unintended consequences are inevitable. India must remain vigilant.”This alliance comes after India’s strong counterterror actions under Operation Sindoor, which the PM Modi-led government says is ongoing but currently paused. India had destroyed LeT’s den and headquarters in Muridke in mainland Pakistan.After the Muridke camp was destroyed by the IAF, reports have emerged that LeT is shifting to a safer location near the Afghanistan border, with Pakistan aiding its reconstruction.","Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) has reportedly formed a covert alliance with Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) ISKP is the South Asian wing of ISIS, allegedly engineered and funded by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) The alliance aims to target Baloch people, with possible expansion to Jammu and Kashmir.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124380304,imgsize-946149,width-400,resizemode-4/ians-photo.jpg"

Poll Do you think social media is effective in delivering emergency alerts during disasters? Yes, very effective No, not reliable





A powerful offshore earthquake , preliminarily measured at magnitude 7.6, struck off the southern Philippine province of Davao Oriental on Friday morning, killing two people.Social media has been flooded with videos showing the quake’s immediate impact. In one clip, chaos erupts at Tagum City Davao Hospital, with staff and patients rushing out of the building as tremors shake the structure.Another video shows an office or building interior where files and boxes topple from tables, tubelights sway dangerously, and lights flicker out. Employees are seen ducking under desks, trying to protect themselves from falling debris.On the streets, some residents are forced to get down on their hands and knees to maintain their balance as the ground shakes beneath them, highlighting the intensity of the tremor.Authorities have warned of possible aftershocks and a hazardous tsunami in nearby coastal areas, urging residents to follow evacuation protocols and stay tuned to official updates as the situation develops.The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said it was expecting damage and aftershocks from an earthquake centred at sea approximately 62 kilometres (38 miles) southeast of Manay town in Davao Oriental province.The quake was caused by movement along a fault at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres (6 miles). The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu said hazardous waves were possible within 300 kilometres (186 miles) of the epicentre.It said waves up to 3 metres (10 feet) above normal tides were possible on some Philippine coasts, and smaller waves were possible in Indonesia and Palau. Office of Civil Defense deputy administrator Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro IV warned that tsunami waves could hit six nearby coastal provinces from Davao Oriental up to two hours after the earthquake struck at 9.43 am He asked people to immediately move to higher ground or further inland away from coastal areas. “We urge these coastal communities to be on alert and immediately evacuate to higher grounds until further notice,” Alejandro said in a video news briefing.“Owners of boats in harbours and those in the coastal areas...should secure their boats and move away from the waterfronts,” he said. The Philippines is still recovering from a Sept. 30 earthquake with a magnitude of 6.9 that left at least 74 people dead and displaced thousands of people in the central province of Cebu, particularly Bogo city and outlying towns.One of the world’s most disaster-prone countries, the Philippines is often hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions because of its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an arc of seismic faults around the ocean.

""But immediately, one motor-powered paraglider flew right over the crowd"", dropping two bombs on the centre of the gathering.""Children were completely torn apart,"" she added.She said that once another motorized paraglider flying overhead had left the area, people rushed in to assist the wounded.Locals said that the damage from Monday’s bombings made it difficult to identify the victims.""As of this morning, we were still collecting body parts from the ground -- pieces of flesh, limbs, parts of bodies that were blown apart,"" the woman added.The junta has increasingly turned to paramotors due to a shortage of aircraft and helicopters, a situation compounded by international sanctions that have made it harder for the regime to acquire military equipment, as cited by the BBC.In a statement on Tuesday, Amnesty International described the junta's use of motorized paragliders to target communities as part of a “disturbing trend” in the region.Joe Freeman, Amnesty International's Myanmar researcher, said the attack “should serve as a gruesome wake-up call that civilians in Myanmar need urgent protection.”Myanmar has been engulfed in civil conflict since the military seized power in a 2021 coup, prompting pro-democracy forces to take up arms and align with ethnic armed groups against the junta.At the candlelight vigil, participants protested military conscription and the upcoming elections while calling for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners.The country is scheduled to hold general elections in December, the first since the 2021 coup. Critics, however, argue that the vote will not be free or fair, and is likely to enable the junta to maintain unchecked control.","At least 40 people were killed and around 80 others were injured in a paramotor attack on a festival and protest in central Myanmar on Monday.

From fields to fame: Majestic water buffaloes crowned in Chonburi; crowds applaud Thailand’s unique beauty contest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/from-fields-to-fame-majestic-water-buffaloes-crowned-in-chonburi-crowds-applaud-thailands-unique-beauty-contest/articleshow/124364600.cms,"(Photo credit: AP)





Five-year-old Tod made his debut at the annual water buffalo racing and beauty festival held in Chonburi on Monday. Chonburi is a city in the province of Thailand, about an hour's drive from Bangkok.Tod, the prized stud of food vendor and farmer Thawatchai Daeng-Ngam, was one of the stars of the event, stealing the show. His bright red ears stood out against his sleek black fur.Once considered humble draft animals vital to Thai agriculture, water buffaloes have now become prized show animals. The festival, held at the end of the 11th lunar month to mark the start of the harvest season, celebrates these animals that once ploughed fields and transported heavy loads. Today, many buffaloes are raised for competitions or sold for meat.The Chonburi festival featured a parade of buffaloes adorned with flower crowns, pulling traditional wooden carriages with wheels over 2 metres tall, and carrying owners and women dressed in traditional Thai attire. The event also included a 100-metre sprint race, with jockeys riding the buffaloes at full speed.Pitun Rassamee competed with his three-year-old albino buffalo, Lookaew, which had already won several local pageants. “Although buffaloes can still work in the field, they cannot compete with machines,” said Thawatchai, whose family owns 30 buffaloes, including Tod. “Buffaloes are still important to me. It’s like what they said: ‘People raise buffaloes, and buffaloes raise people.’ They’re like family members,” he added, according to news agency AP The shift from farm labourers to show animals has come with the mechanization of farming and a decline in buffalo populations. Competitions have sparked renewed interest and a growing industry, supported by the government. Since 2017, Thailand has observed Thai Buffalo Conservation Day, and local authorities provide breeding assistance to farmers.Raising a show buffalo can be intensive. On larger farms, animals are bathed daily and fed a special diet of corn, soybeans, bran, and vitamins. At the festival, caretakers splashed water over the larger, prize-winning animals, which are judged on horn size, hoof smoothness, and overall physique.“Each year, it has become bigger and bigger,” said Papada Srisophon, assistant to a village chief near a livestock centre. “Without this activity, they won’t know what to do with their buffaloes, and they won’t be motivated to keep their buffaloes,” she told AP.For many owners, the competitions are more than just sport or show, they reflect a lifelong bond with the animals.","Chonburi is a city in the province of Thailand, about an hour's drive from Bangkok.

Focus on trade and investment





NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi and his visiting counterpart Keir Starmer discussed initiatives to double down on likely gains from the India-UK landmark trade deal in a bilateral meeting, while also focusing on efforts to deepen their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and in areas like technology, defence co-production and security.Modi also raised the issue of anti-India activities by Khalistan separatists. While the PM himself did not bring up the issue in his media remarks after the meeting, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said later that the PM emphasised radicalism and violent extremism had no space in democratic societies and “in particular should not be allowed to use the freedoms or abuse the freedoms provided by democratic societies”. It is understood that the issue of extradition of Indian economic figities was also discussed.He also said that the PM underlined the need to move against them within the legal frameworks that are available to both sides.Modi, who announced an agreement for cooperation in military training under which IAF flying instructors will serve as trainers with the UK’s Royal Air Force, said India and the UK are natural partners as their relationship is built on the shared values of democracy, freedom, and the rule of law.“In today’s time of global uncertainty, our growing partnership stands as an important pillar of global stability and economic progress,” said Modi in a joint press statement with Starmer after their meeting.Defence, in fact, was a major focus area in the meeting with the leaders endorsing an Intent to finalize an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) on cooperation in developing maritime electric propulsion systems for Indian Naval platforms. Another agreement for supply of Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM) systems to support India’s air defence capabilities was also announced. According to a joint statement, this agreement, in the spirit of Atmanirbhar Bharat, will meet the current and future requirements of the Indian Ministry of Defence, and support a long-term collaboration on complex weapons between the two countries.Both leaders agreed to work closely in promoting reformed multilateralism, including reform of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), as Starmer reiterated UK’s long-standing support for India’s “legitimate aspirations for permanent membership in a reformed UNSC”.Modi and Starmer focused on ramping up cooperation in the Indo-Pacific too as they committed to, according to the joint statement, robust maritime security collaboration in the region, including establishment of the Regional Maritime Security Centre of Excellence (RMSCE) under the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI).Recalling the “historic” Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) that India concluded with the UK in July, Modi said this agreement will reduce import costs between the 2 countries, create new employment opportunities for youth, boost trade, and benefit both Indian and UK industries and consumers.He said there are immense possibilities in the technology partnership, including in critical and emerging technologies, between India and the UK. “We are working to connect the UK’s industrial expertise and R&D with India’s talent and scale. Last year, we launched the India–UK Technology Security Initiative. To connect the youth of both countries through an innovation bridge, we have taken several steps, including establishing the Connectivity and Innovation Centre and the Joint AI Research Centre,” he said.The leaders also announced the setting up of a UK – India Critical Minerals Processing and Downstream Collaboration Guild to build concrete partnerships which “strengthen and diversify critical mineral supply chains and deliver investment and growth in both nations”.“Our defense cooperation has also deepened. We are moving towards defense co-production and connecting the defense industries of both countries. Taking our defense collaboration a step further, we have signed an agreement for cooperation in military training, under which Flying Instructors from the Indian Air Force will serve as trainers with the UK’s Royal Air Force,” he said.Both leaders looked forward to an early ratification of the India–UK CETAThey welcomed the resetting of the Joint Economic and Trade Committee (JETCO) which will support the governance and utilisation of the CETAFocus on construction, infrastructure and clean energy, advanced manufacturing, defence, education, sport, culture, financial and professional business services to realise the benefits of FTABoth Prime Ministers reiterated their commitment to improving connectivity and enhancing cooperation in the aviation sector.","PM Narendra Modi and his visiting counterpart Keir Starmer discussed initiatives to double down on likely gains from the India-UK landmark trade deal.

MUMBAI: Foreign secretary Vikram Misri on Thursday said the issue of illegal immigration was discussed in talks between PM Narendra Modi and UK PM Keir Starmer in Mumbai.India had a clear position that it did not support illegal immigration, Misri said, adding that India was in favour of whatever cooperation was required. At the same time, he said, India was keen on legal mobility that benefited both countries and added they had already entered into a migration and mobility agreement, which was working well.On rising anti-immigration protests in UK, Misri said it was an issue UK authorities had to address and was part of their domestic dynamic. As for India, it was clear the country supported legal mobility and immigration. PM Modi expressed his sympathy for the attack at a synagogue in Manchester, Misri added.Misri said both PMs noted that this partnership between India and UK was being strengthened at a time where there is uncertainty in the world.

LONDON: An Indian-origin surgeon who worked in the NHS for 25 years has been struck off the UK medical register for making antisemitic comments on social media, including calling a Jewish man “circumcised vermin” and a “Jewish rodent”.Manoj Sen, who qualified as a doctor in 1983 with an MBBS from the Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata, (Calcutta Medical College), and moved to the UK in 1985, wrote on Facebook in response to Mr A, on October 10 2023, three days after the Nova festival massacre: “When dealing with circumcised vermin like you, not even the strongest measures will help,” adding that he was “regretful enough rats were not liquidated at Auschwitz”.In the same rant, Sen called Mr A a “Jewish c**t” and “Jewboy” and also wrote “Die Juden sind unsere Ungluck (The Jews are our misfortune)”. “Good thing he is no longer in a respectful place like India. He belongs in the flames of a crematorium,” he said of Mr A. At the time Sen was working as a surgeon at Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow.Mr A raised a complaint about Sen with the General Medical Council (GMC) and the police.Sen was arrested and issued a police caution.The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service concluded that Sen’s conduct amounted to serious misconduct and that immediate suspension and erasure from the medical register were the only appropriate sanction.The tribunal found his comments were antisemitic and seriously offensive, especially his reference to Auschwitz and a crematorium, which, the tribunal said, “went far beyond any acceptable or lawful expression of opinion”.“The language used suggested a deep hostility towards Jews as a group, rather than merely a personal attack on the complainant,” the tribunal said.The tribunal noted there was no written apology and “the degree of hostility expressed in his comments is fundamentally incompatible with the duty of a doctor to treat patients equally”, and that he had brought the medical profession into disrepute.On August 13 Sen told the GMC he did not wish to participate in the hearing and said “to go ahead and good luck.”In an email from Sen to the GMC in Feb 2024, he wrote: “In the heat of the moment I made wrongful and injudicious remarks — for which I have apologised in public on Facebook as well as privately to the police. Those remarks are entirely out of character.”",Indian-origin surgeon struck off the UK medical register for making antisemitic comments on social media.

Two Indian-origin brothers from east London have been sentenced after a mobile phone sent for repair uncovered disturbing videos of child sex abuse, leading to their conviction for multiple offences, reported BBC.Vruj Patel, 26, was jailed for over 22 years at Snaresbrook Crown Court on Tuesday, following his guilty plea to 17 charges including rape and assault of a child under 13, possession of indecent images, and voyeurism. His crimes also extended to sexual offences against a woman over 16.His brother, Kishnan Patel, also from Plaistow, was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment in June after pleading guilty to four counts related to making and possessing indecent images of children.The metropolitan police revealed that the investigation began when videos of child abuse were found on a mobile device belonging to Kishnan Patel, which had been submitted for repairs. Subsequent detective work identified Vruj Patel as the perpetrator in the footage, confirmed by visible features such as clothing and jewellery.Detective sergeant Rob Blant described Vruj Patel as a “cowardly, opportunistic offender who has preyed on vulnerable victims for his own sexual gratification,” as quoted by BBC.He added, “There are teams of dedicated, professional officers working across London who will leave no stone unturned to identify those who seek to commit offences against vulnerable people and bring offenders to justice.”Authorities believe some offences occurred as early as 2018, with voyeurism offences potentially continuing until recently. Police are appealing for any additional victims to come forward, expressing concern that there may be more children affected, possibly in the brothers’ home.Vruj Patel has been placed on the sex offenders’ register indefinitely, while Kishnan Patel will be subject to a 10-year sexual harm prevention order.Throughout the investigation and trial, the victim-survivors received specialist support from law enforcement agencies, the met police confirmed.","Vruj Patel, 26, was jailed for over 22 years at Snaresbrook Crown Court.

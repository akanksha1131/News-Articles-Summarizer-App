Mexico Migrants: 'Want asylum before Trump takes power': Migrants set out from Mexico hoping to reach pre-Don US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/want-asylum-before-trump-takes-power-migrants-set-out-from-mexico-hoping-to-reach-pre-donald-us/articleshow/115509581.cms,"Image credit: Reuters

Hundreds of migrants on Wednesday formed a caravan and began their journey on foot from the Mexican city of Tapachula, aiming to reach the US border before President-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged large-scale deportations, takes office in January.""My mentality is to get there, I want my (asylum) appointment before he (Trump) takes power,"" Colombian Yamel Enriquez told AFP, adding, ""If I don't get the appointment before, I will give myself over to whatever God wants.""The group of around 1,500 people set out in the early morning hours, embarking on a trek of approximately 2,600 kilometers.Migrant caravans have been forming since 2018, serving as a last hope for those unable to afford smugglers. Traveling alone or in small groups often leads to detention by authorities, who either send migrants back to southern Mexico or deport them to their home countries. In contrast, large caravans provide safety in numbers, making it difficult for immigration agents to detain the entire group, AP reported.Donald Trump, whose election was heavily influenced by concerns over illegal immigration, has vowed to declare a national emergency on border security and deploy the US military to carry out mass deportations of undocumented migrants.With an estimated 11 million people living in the United States illegally, Trump has further fueled fears by referring to the migration as an ""invasion,"" claiming that migrants pose a threat of violence to Americans.","Around 1,500 people set out in the early morning hours, embarking on a trek of approximately 2,600 kilometers.

Darius Paduch Former New York doctor sentenced to life imprisonment for sexually abusing patients,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-former-new-york-doctor-sentenced-to-life-imprisonment-for-sexually-abusing-patients/articleshow/115509568.cms,"Former New York doctor sentenced to life imprisonment for sexually abusing patients (Picture credit: X)

Darius Paduch, a former doctor in New York, US, was sentenced to life imprisonment on Wednesday after being found guilty of sexually abusing multiple patients, including minors, over more than a decade.As per the news agency AP, the abuse occurred at prestigious hospitals in Manhattan and Long Island, where Paduch exploited his position to prey on vulnerable individuals seeking medical care.Paduch, 57, was convicted in May on charges including inducing individuals and minors to engage in unlawful sexual activity. Eleven victims testified during the trial, and over 300 others have filed allegations and lawsuits against him.Evidence revealed Paduch’s perverse practices, such as assaulting patients during medical exams, using sex toys, and claiming his actions were medically necessary, reported the New York Post.Prosecutors highlighted that Paduch’s misconduct, which began in 2007, continued unabated until 2019. In one instance, he lured a victim to his boat, provided sedatives, and assaulted him. His crimes also included painful and unnecessary medical procedures, leading to further physical and emotional trauma for his victims.""Paduch’s abuse was perverse and pervasive, spanning over a decade and victimising patients both inside and outside hospital rooms,"" said US attorney Damian Williams.Victims’ lawyers hailed the sentencing as a critical step toward justice. Mallory Allen, representing 140 survivors, said, “While no sentence can undo the pain endured, this verdict provides closure and ensures accountability for his horrific acts.”Paduch’s attorney announced plans to appeal the decision, maintaining his client’s innocence. Meanwhile, civil lawsuits targeting institutions accused of enabling or ignoring Paduch’s actions are set to proceed.","Darius Paduch, a former doctor in New York, US, was sentenced to life imprisonment on Wednesday.

Florida man arrested for planning to bomb the New York Stock Exchange,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/florida-man-arrested-for-planning-to-bomb-the-new-york-stock-exchange/articleshow/115507984.cms,"A Florida man was arrested for allegedly plotting to bomb the New York Stock Exchange. He wanted to detonate a bomb during Thanksgiving week. The FBI found bomb-making materials in his storage unit. He had been researching explosives online since 2017. The man aimed to 'reset' the US government. He believed the US was ready for a revolution.

Harun Abdul-Malik Yener, a 30-year-old Florida man, was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly planning to bomb the New York Stock Exchange to ""reboot"" the US government. Charged with attempting to use an explosive device to destroy a building involved in interstate commerce, Yener now awaits trial while in federal custody.According to the FBI , Yener had been under investigation since February after a tip revealed he was storing bomb-making schematics in a storage unit.The FBI found sketches, timers, electronic circuit boards, and other materials potentially usable for constructing explosives. Evidence also indicated that Yener had been researching bomb-making techniques online since 2017.Court documents reveal Yener's intent to target the Stock Exchange in lower Manhattan during the week before Thanksgiving, a high-profile date that would, according to him, send a strong message. He reportedly told undercover FBI agents that detonating a bomb at this location would help ""reset"" the US government.In preparation, Yener had rewired two-way radios to function as remote triggers for explosive devices and discussed plans to wear a disguise while planting the bomb. He allegedly sought a device powerful enough to blow off the building's doors and cause significant destruction.Yener expressed anti-government sentiments, claiming the US was ""due for a revolution,"" as per an FBI affidavit.In conversations with undercover agents, he mentioned previous attempts to join right-wing militias and compared himself to Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks.The case, first reported by CourtWatch, explains the extent of Yener’s plans, with federal authorities describing his intentions as ""a significant domestic threat.""The suspect had his first court appearance on Wednesday in the Southern District of Florida, where he was assigned a public defender.While Yener’s motives remain partially unclear, federal officials have emphasised the seriousness of his plans. Calls to telephone numbers listed for Yener have gone unanswered, and his legal representation has yet to release a statement.","Harun Abdul-Malik Yener, a 30-year-old Florida man, was arrested on Wednesday.

Joe Scarborough CONFIRMS Trump concerned over Pete Hegseth; team looking for alternative,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/joe-scarborough-confirms-trump-concerned-over-pete-hegseth-team-looking-for-alternative/articleshow/115501423.cms,"Trump's team has been blinsided by the sexual offence allegation against Pete Hegseth though Hegseth's lawyer said it was a false case.



What is the sexual offence complaint against Pete Hegseth?

Amid reports that Donald Trump 's transition team is quietly looking for an alternative for Pete Hegseth , the defense secretary to-be, Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough confirmed on his show Wednesday that Trump indeed is concerned over the sexual offence allegation against Hegseth. Scarborough and his co-host, wife Mika Brzezinski went to Mar-a-Lago to patch things up with Trump and spoke over a number of issues which they revealed on their Wednesday show.Pete Hegseth is a military veteran and a former Fox News host who was infamous for his problematic opinions. But his record was otherwise clean. After his nomination, it emerged that he paid off a woman in 2017 who accused him of sexual assault. This is not like the allegation against Matt Haetz but the Trump team was caught off guard here and they believe they were not told everything by Hegseth.Joe Scarborough said he and Mika spoke to Donald Trump on the ""shocking"" cabinet picks.“On background—in our conversation, on background—there were a couple of things that surprised us. One of them was, when his name came up, there was, not a flinch, but a noticeable ‘We’ve got problems here,’” Scarborough said on the Wednesday edition of the MSNBC show. “Those weren’t the words, but I will just tell you, that was the takeaway.”“Obviously, everybody knows Gaetz is a problem. But I think there must be more there [with Hegseth], or I think they were just shocked, maybe they were blindsided,” Scarborough said speculating that the lack of vetting process for Hegseth led to more anxiety for Trump's team.Hegseth was accused of sexual assault in 2017 when he spoke at a Republican women's event in Monterey, California. But no charges were filed. Pete Hegseth's lawyer Timothy Parlatore clarified that the sexual encounter was consensual and the woman who made the police complaint was the aggressor. The lawyer said it was true the woman was paid because she blackmailed Hegseth into paying. The payment was made as part of a confidential settlement because Hegset at that time feared that he might lose his Fox News job.","Joe Scarborough said he and Mika spoke to Donald Trump on the ""shocking"" cabinet picks.

Tulsi Gabbard: The Hare Krishna offshoot that could jeopardize Tulsi Gabbard's nomination as Director of National Intelligence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-hare-krishna-offshoot-that-could-jeopardize-tulsi-gabbards-nomination-as-director-of-national-intelligence/articleshow/115489814.cms,"Who is Tulsi Gabbard?

Backlash and Political Ramifications



Former President Donald Trump and former National Security Advisor John Bolton.

Could Her Nomination Be Scuttled?



President-elect Donald Trump’s decision to nominate former Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard as Director of National Intelligence has reignited controversy surrounding her ties to a controversial religious sect, the Science of Identity Foundation (SIF). These connections, described as problematic and potentially cult-like, are now under intense scrutiny and could jeopardize her Senate confirmation .Tulsi Gabbard made history in 2013 when she became the first American Samoan and practicing Hindu elected to Congress, representing Hawaii’s 2nd Congressional District. Known for her unorthodox political positions, she often defied party norms during her tenure. Gabbard’s political career and personal life, including her marriage to cinematographer Abraham Williams, are reportedly interwoven with the influence of the Science of Identity Foundation—a group led by Chris Butler , who is revered by followers as a near-divine figure.The Science of Identity Foundation is a religious organization often described as an offshoot of the Hare Krishna movement, with a controversial history. Founded by Chris Butler, also known as Jagad Guru Siddhaswarupananda Paramahamsa, the group has thousands of followers in Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia. Butler’s teachings blend traditional Hindu philosophy with a rigid hierarchy of devotion to him as a spiritual leader.Former members and critics describe the group as cult-like, citing its authoritarian structure and allegations of intolerance toward LGBTQ individuals, women, and Muslims. Members reportedly view Butler as an extension of God, and questioning his authority is seen as a spiritual offense. Critics, including some former followers, accuse the group of fostering a climate of fear and control.The Science of Identity Foundation (SIF) gained renewed media attention around 2020 when some commentators highlighted Tulsi Gabbard's childhood association with the group. Gabbard, a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 United States presidential election (and now Trump's pick to be DNI), reportedly referred to Chris Butler, the leader of SIF, as her spiritual guide during her school years. Her father, Mike Gabbard, a Hawaii State Senator, has also been linked to SIF and is known for his opposition to same-sex marriage, framing spirituality as a tool against sexual practices SIF considers ""deviant."" Gabbard’s mother, Carol Gabbard, served as the organisation’s treasurer.Gabbard has openly referred to Butler as her spiritual guide or “guru.” Her ties to the organization reportedly date back to her upbringing, with her family deeply embedded in its structure. Gabbard’s aunt, Dr Caroline Sinavaiana Gabbard, has been outspoken about the group’s influence on her niece, calling her involvement with Butler troubling and accusing him of orchestrating her political ascent to increase his own influence.Critics allege that Butler played a significant role in Gabbard’s 2020 presidential campaign, which some saw as an effort to gain a foothold in national politics. Gabbard’s critics have raised concerns about how her affiliation with a fringe religious group might influence her decision-making in a high-level intelligence position.Tulsi Gabbard has since clarified that during her school years, she regarded Butler as ""essentially like a Vaishnava Hindu pastor."" As a teenager, she distanced herself from SIF, fully embracing Hinduism and aligning herself with the Vaishnava tradition, which centres on devotion to the Supreme Lord. Gabbard identifies as a Vaishnava Hindu and frequently participates in Hindu festivals, such as Diwali, alongside Hindu-American communities.The nomination of Gabbard to a critical intelligence role has drawn widespread criticism, with figures from both political parties questioning her qualifications and fitness for the job. Former National Security Advisor John Bolton labeled her the ""worst cabinet-level appointment in history,"" citing both her ties to the SIF and her controversial foreign policy positions, such as her perceived closeness to authoritarian figures like Vladimir Putin.The resurfacing of her connections to the SIF has compounded these criticisms. Some senators are reportedly uneasy about her ability to serve as Director of National Intelligence without bias or undue influence. A former intelligence official described the nomination as a “left turn and off the bridge,” reflecting the broader skepticism within the intelligence community.The Senate confirmation process will likely spotlight Gabbard’s ties to the SIF and her broader political allegiances. While her supporters argue that her religious beliefs should not disqualify her from public office, detractors point to the SIF’s controversial history and Butler’s influence as disqualifying factors. Allegations that Butler may have used Gabbard as a political proxy add another layer of concern, raising questions about whether her appointment could compromise U.S. intelligence operations.The controversy surrounding Gabbard underscores the challenges she faces in navigating the confirmation process. With both bipartisan opposition and public scrutiny mounting, her nomination hangs in the balance, with her ties to the Science of Identity Foundation at the center of the debate.","Tulsi Gabbard is the first American Samoan and practicing Hindu elected to Congress.

Gaetz paid for sex from Nestor's PayPal: Report



Donald Trump's attorney general pick Matt Gaetz is on the radar as he is one of the most controversial picks so far and many Republicans are hopeful that he won't become the AG as he won't get confirmed by the Senate. He was under investigation for having sex with a 17-year-old and paying for the sex. The House ethics committee report against him was to be published but he resigned from Congress after his nomination making himself outside the purview of the committee.Now it has emerged that 42-year-old Gaetz has an adopted son Nestor whom he did not hide from the world. He introduced his 'adopted son' Nestor to the world in 2020. Gaetz said Nestor was adopted from Cuba and he was only 12 when he arrived in the US from Cuba in 2014.The revelation came in 2020 when Gaetz had a fight with Democratic Rep Cedric Richmond at a House Judiciary Committee hearing about the need for police reform and raising children of color. In that fight, Richmond attacked Gaetz as having no experience in raising a child of color and as a riposte, Gatez introduced his adopted son to the world. ""Are you suggesting that you're certain that none of us have nonwhite children?"" Gaetz said. ""You're claiming you have more concern for my family than I do? Who in the hell do you think you are?"" Gaetz, who was 38 years old at that time, said during the debate.""For all those wondering, this is my son Nestor. We share no blood but he is my life. He came from Cuba (legally, of course) six years ago and lives with me in Florida. I am so proud of him and raising him has been the best, most rewarding thing I’ve done in my life,"" Matt posted.According to reports, Gaetz was dating Nestor's older sister at that time and then he adopted him as their mother died of breast cancer. But there were doubts about the claim as to whether Gaetz did not have any blood relation with Nestor, and whether Gaetz legally adopted him.Now Gaetz's adopted son came to the news as the lawyer, representing two women who claimed they were paid by Gaetz for sex, said that the women were paid from Nestor's PayPal. It was one of the payment modes, Florida attorney Joel Leppard said.Gaetz got married to Ginger Luckey in 2021 after the sexual offence probe opened against him and the couple has no children.",Matt Gaetz was under investigation for having sex with a 17-year-old and paying for the sex.

"Rene Magritte Paintings: Rene Magritte's surreal painting titled 'Empire of Light' breaks auction records, sells for ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/rene-magrittes-surreal-painting-titled-empire-of-light-breaks-auction-records-sells-for-/articleshow/115509911.cms,"What is surrealism?

René Magritte’s 'Empire of Light' smashed auction records on Tuesday, selling for over $121 million at Christie’s in New York. The 1954 masterpiece, initially valued at $95 million, surpassed the surrealist artist’s previous record of $79 million set in 2022.The painting, featuring a bright house under a blue daytime sky contrasted with a dark night, captivated collectors. Part of a series on light and shadow, it is one of Magritte's most iconic works.The piece belonged to the late Mica Ertegun, a Romanian-born interior designer and arts patron. Ertegun, who passed away in 2023, was a significant figure in the American cultural scene and the wife of Ahmet Ertegun, founder of Atlantic Records. The sale marked a highlight in the autumn auction season, with the buyer’s identity remaining undisclosed.This achievement places Magritte among an elite group of artists whose works have surpassed the $100 million mark at auction, alongside figures such as Picasso and Warhol. Marc Porter, chairman of Christie’s Americas, described the event as “a historic moment in our saleroom.”Surrealism, is a 20th-century art movement, aimed to unlock the unconscious mind by blending dreamlike imagery with reality. Originating in the 1920s, the movement was heavily influenced by Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic theories.

Barron is a US citizen and Trump's immigration policy won't impact him

Ending birthright citizenship has always been President-elect Donald Trump's plan -- ensnared in controversies as this arises from the Constitution's 14th Amendment. After he won the election, a claim went viral that his youngest son Barron Trump will also be not considered a US citizen under his policy as Melania Trump became a US citizen three months after Barron's birth.The 14th Amendment granted citizenship to all persons ""born or naturalized in the United States"" including formerly enslaved people and has been interpreted to apply whether or not parents were in the country legally.But the claim regarding Barron is fake as Barron's father Donald Trump was a lawful permanent resident when Barron was born and Donald Trump's executive order planned for the first day of his second term in office requires at least one parent to be an American citizen or lawful permanent resident for their children to become automatic US citizens.Melania came to the US in 1996 for modelling work. Melania and Donald Trump got married in 2005 and Barron Trump was born in March 2006. Melania became a citizen of the United States in July 2006. So it is true that Melania was not a US citizen when Barron was born.But Melania Trump was not an illegal resident either. She received an Einstein visa in 2001.Trump said his order on birthright citizenship would not be retroactive. It will impact only the children born after it takes effect. Also, if one parent is a green card holder, then the child becomes a US citizen.Barron Trump has remained under the limelight this election campaign because he made his debut in his father's campaign and also advised him on which podcasts to go to reach the maximum young audience. This was also the first time Barron voted.","Barron is a US citizen and Trump's immigration policy won't impact him.

'This is a battle that is just beginning'

Donald Trump's pick for defense secretary Pete Hegseth has gone viral for his tattoos, for his opinion on women in combat roles but the most outrageous and recent one is his old video as a Fox News host where he said he had not washed his hands in last 10 years because germs are not real. The video has gone viral amid outrage over Donald Trump's cabinet picks -- and Pete Hegseth is one of the outrageous picks.Pete Hegseth has three wives and seven children and has recently been accused of a sexual misconduct allegation -- though his lawyer said it was a consensual thing but Hegseth was coerced into paying the woman during the #MeToo movement. Given all this, Donald Trump's transition team is not happy with him and is secretly looking for options to replace him. They think Pete Hegseth was not honest with them. Matt Gaetz, Trump's pick for attorney general, is also embroiled in a sex offence case but it was widely known and now Trump is throwing his weight behind Gaetz. But Hegseth's case is different.“People are upset about the distraction. The general feeling is Pete hasn’t been honest,” a source told Vanity Fair.But his hand-washing video remains evergreen.On the Fox News panel, Pete Hegseth in 2019 admitted that he ate a day-old pizza which was not in a refrigerator. He said he didn't find anything odd about that. ""Really, I don't really wash my hands ever. I inoculate myself. Germs are not a real thing. I can't see them, therefore they're not real,"" Hegseth said evoking laughter. He later clarified that he was joking but he said he supported drinking from hosepipe and riding bikes without a helmet. Those posts on his X have been deleted.Pete Hegseth is aware of the uphill task in front of him as he will have to be cleared by the Senate to become the defense secretary. He attended a Republican prayer call Tuesday and said the battle is just beginning. The call was hosted by Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump. He brought his wife Jennifer to the call.","Pete Hegseth has three wives and seven children and has been accused of a sexual misconduct allegation.

It came a day after four people, including a tribal chief and a woman, were killed and as many injured when unknown armed men opened fire on a vehicle in Bannu.The latest attack, according to the army’s handout, triggered an exchange of fire in which six terrorists were gunned down and the attempt to enter the post effectively thwarted by troops, forcing the terrorists to detonate an explosives-laden vehicle at the post’s perimeter wall. “The suicide blast led to the collapse of a portion of the perimeter wall and damaged the adjoining infrastructure, as a result of which 12 soldiers lost their lives,” the statement added.There has been a sharp rise in the number of attacks targeting security forces, other law enforcement agencies, and security checkpoints, particularly in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Bannu has seen heightened militant violence of late, including the abductions of cops, attack on a prison, attack on a girls’ school, and shootouts that have left several security officials dead.On Monday, over half a dozen policemen were abducted from a checkpost in an adjacent North Waziristan tribal district. They were later recovered by police, with the help of tribal elders.Over the weekend at least eight security personnel were killed and three injured in fierce gun battles with militants in Tirah valley of Khyber tribal district, bordering Afghanistan.On Saturday, at least seven security officials were killed and 18 others wounded in Baluchistan’s Kalat region in a pre-dawn terrorist attack on a checkpost.

International organizations have also urged Pakistan to implement emergency measures to prevent the spread of the virus.Health authorities announced on November 14 that the case detected in Jaffarabad, Balochistan, marked the district's first confirmed polio infection, highlighting the continued spread of the virus across the country.Genetic sequencing of the virus sample, carried out by the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad, has traced the virus to a WPV1 strain that was previously identified in Pishin, Balochistan, in April. This connection highlights active transmission within the province, which remains the hardest-hit area, with 24 cases reported till now.Besides Afghanistan, Pakistan remains the only country where wild poliovirus transmission has yet to be eradicated. The continued spread of the virus is largely attributed to challenges such as insecurity, misinformation, and community resistance, all of which hinder vaccination efforts.Polio affects the nervous system, often resulting in paralysis or even death. Although there is no cure for the disease, health officials stress that vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent infection.","The latest case was identified by National Reference Lab in a 2 month old girl, from Tank district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

This indictment followed several breaches relating to the riots that took place on May 9, 2023.During a hearing at Kot Lakhpat Jail on Monday, Qureshi labeled these charges as baseless and politically motivated.

Extortions bleed Pak’s terror-stalked northwest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/extortions-bleed-paks-terror-stalked-northwest/articleshow/115454371.cms,"TOI

ISLAMABAD: Surging terror and extortions have endangered public safety in Pakistan ’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where militants in several districts run a parallel shadow administration.The southern districts of the province have almost become no-go areas even for law-enforcers. In the evening, militants are seen patrolling the streets and setting up checkpoints in Bannu, North and South Waziristan, Tank, Lakki Marwat, and Dera Ismail Khan regions.While these districts remain at mercy of militants from evening to morning, well-off people in other districts of the province frequently receive threatening WhatsApp texts and letters from Pakistani Taliban -- or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) -- with demands to pay or face attacks. The ones who refuse to pay ransom are often targeted with grenade attacks at their homes, shops and warehouses, apparently to show the group was serious about its threats.Faisal Khan, a lawyer in Umerzai area in Charsadda district, toldthat he had received a threatening WhatsApp text earlier this month from an Afghanistan number with a demand to pay $50,000 (Pak Rs 1.4cr).Khan claims that after reporting the threats to the police, he went to high-ranking officers to request protection and assistance. Most official discussions, he said, concluded with cautious assurances.“A family goes through pain for months after such a call. Even after approaching the cops, the victims are normally asked to install CCTV cameras, restrict movement and take care of security themselves,” Khan said. He also revealed that he was cautioned by “allies in the govt” that he “should not count” on them to keep him safe. “Either pay up or move your family to Islamabad or Lahore,” he said in reference to a private communication with some officials after he pressed for assistance.Last week, Khan said he had received a parcel carrying a shroud and other items required before burials. “This was followed by a threatening message to vacate my home within 30 minutes,” Khan said, adding he has refused to pay the extortioners.However, Shahzaib, another person in the same neighbourhood who had received a similar text on TTP’s letterhead last month, has paid after negotiating a deal through intermediaries. He eventually paid a reduced part of the $50,000 the militants initially demanded.“The key thing I learnt was that TTP is demanding extortion from everyone they think can pay. Most, if not all, wealthy individuals have already paid,” Shahzaib said.According to police, the main hurdle for law-enforcers in tracking down extortionists is the calls which they make from non-local lines, internet-generated resources, illegal gateways and Whatsapp numbers.Apart from various groups, the police said, criminal rings are also found involved in many such calls. In the last two years, police sources said at least 1,600 Afghan phone numbers and 387 illegal gateways were used for making extortion calls. These numbers and illegal gateways, according to the police, have been shared with higher authorities for follow-up action. “Despite the alarming increase in Taliban extortion demands, the issue has yet to attract national attention,” a senior police official said.","The southern districts of the province have almost become no-go areas even for law-enforcers.

Eight soldiers were killed and seven police officers abducted in separate incidents in northwest Pakistan on Tuesday, officials told news agency AFP. The Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for the assaults.The first attack occurred on Monday, where a clash between security forces and militants left ""eight soldiers"" and ""nine militants"" dead, according to an intelligence official who spoke anonymously.In a separate incident, seven police officers were abducted, a senior police official confirmed.These incidents follow a series of recent militant operations in Pakistan. Just last week, seven paramilitary soldiers were killed in an attack by Baloch separatists on a border post in Balochistan province . The same group, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), was responsible for a deadly railway station bombing earlier this year that killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers.Militant groups like the BLA and the Pakistani Taliban frequently target security forces and infrastructure, claiming to fight for autonomy or ideological goals. Their activities have disrupted economic projects, particularly those involving foreign investment, such as Chinese-backed ventures in Balochistan.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has condemned these attacks, vowing swift action against the perpetrators.","Pakistani Taliban claims responsibility for two attacks in northwest Pakistan.

Crisis in PoJK: Deforestation devastates environment and livelihoods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/crisis-in-pojk-deforestation-devastates-environment-and-livelihoods/articleshow/115412646.cms,"Representative Image

CHINARI: In Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), an alarming environmental crisis is rapidly unfolding. Once home to vast, lush forests, this region has seen its green cover decimated over the past several decades.The rapid deforestation, particularly in areas like Chinari, has only exacerbated the crisis. As the forests vanish, so does the natural filtration system that once regulated air quality and helped prevent erosion, leaving the land more vulnerable to environmental degradation.Arshad Rasheed, a local resident, shared a stark reminder of the dramatic change.""In this region, 75 per cent of the land was once covered by forests, but today that figure has dropped to around 10 per cent. Before 1947, the region's economy was heavily dependent on forest resources. After the region became part of PoJK, large-scale deforestation began, and the forest cover has been reduced from 75 per cent to just 10 per cent today"", he said.The consequences of this widespread deforestation are most severely felt by the local communities who once depended on the forests for their livelihoods.In Chinari, vast amounts of wood, remnants of the once-thriving forests, now lie rotting on the ground, untouched for decades.While the government has imposed a ban on cutting trees in an effort to preserve the remaining forest cover, this policy has inadvertently worsened the plight of local residents, many of whom are already struggling with poverty.Arshad explained the dilemma thus faced, noting, ""People living near the forests need fuel for cooking and heating, but the government has made no provision to address this need. While the ban on cutting trees was intended to protect the remaining forests, it ignores the fact that people depend on these resources for their daily survival. Today, locals are prohibited from cutting their own trees, yet their fuel needs are not being met by the government"".For the people of Chinari and other parts of PoJK, the issue is no longer just about conserving the environment. It has become a fight for survival in a landscape that has been stripped of the resources they once relied on.With the forests gone and no viable alternatives in place, their future looks increasingly uncertain, as they face both environmental collapse and a lack of basic resources.","In Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), an alarming environmental crisis is rapidly unfolding.

"Amid Net censorship, Pakistan offers regulated VPNs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/amid-net-censorship-pakistan-offers-regulated-vpns/articleshow/115392568.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Amid a ban on unregistered virtual private networks (VPNs) across Pakistan — allegedly aimed at preventing their use by militant groups for financial transactions and violent activities — Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has launched a registration process for companies and freelancers to use their VPNs.The nationwide ban, imposed on interior ministry’s direction on Friday, has been widely viewed by observers and critics as a joint attempt by the govt and military to silence dissenting voices.Media sources have also suggested that the slowdown in internet speeds across Pakistan is linked to the govt’s installation of a national firewall. The firewall was deployed as Pakistani military faced severe online criticism for its alleged role in keeping former PM Imran Khan behind bars, while his party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, continued to face a harsh crackdown. The military, which denies interference in politics, has recently begun using the term ""digital terrorists"" to describe online critics.VPN usage has surged in Pakistan as users seek access to X (formerly Twitter), a platform blocked since February, along with numerous other websites. Authorities also claim that VPN software is being used to bypass restrictions on pornographic content.PTA said it had streamlined the VPN registration process for organizations and freelancers. Entities such as software houses, call centres, banks, embassies, and freelancers can now register their VPNs online through the PTA’s official website. The registration process is divided into four distinct categories: companies, freelancers, call centres, and video conferencing.""To date, more than 20,000 companies and freelancers have successfully registered their VPNs through this efficient process,"" PTA said in a statement on Saturday.According to PTA, the registration process involves completing an online form and providing basic details, including the national identity card number, company registration details, and taxpayer status. Freelancers must also submit proof of their association with a project or company, such as a letter or email confirmation.Also, applicants will need to provide an IP address for VPN connectivity. A fixed IP address can be obtained through internet service providers.After interior ministry circulated its letter calling for the VPN ban, Council of Islamic Ideology, a constitutional advisory body tasked with ensuring laws align with Islamic principles, declared VPN usage to be ""un-Islamic"" in a statement issued the same day.“The government and the state have the authority, from an Islamic perspective, to prevent all actions that lead to wrongdoing or facilitate it,” council’s chairman, Raghib Hussain Naeemi, was quoted as saying. ""Therefore, measures to block or restrict access to immoral and offensive content, including the banning of VPNs, are in accordance with Shariah.”","Pakistan Telecommunication Authority has launched a registration process for companies and freelancers to use their VPNs.

According to police, her body was dismembered into dozens of pieces and dumped in a drain in Punjab province.The crime occurred last week in Daska, Sialkot district, which is approximately 100 km from Lahore.A murder case has been filed against the suspects, and four individuals have been arrested in connection with the crime. The arrested include the mother-in-law, Sughran Bibi; her daughter, Yasmin; her grandson, Hamza; and a distant relative, Navid.Senior police officer Omar Farooq informed reporters that the suspects have confessed to killing Zara and dismembering her body.Zara Qadir, a woman in her 20s, went missing last week, and later, police discovered her dismembered body in three sacks, which was identified as hers.Zara, who was the daughter of a police officer, had married Qadir Ahmad four years ago, and they had a three-year-old son. She went to Saudi Arabia after her marriage and returned to Pakistan only a few months ago.Farooq said, ""In her confessional statement, Sughran Bibi said that she suspected Zara of allegedly practicing 'witchcraft,' and besides, her son Qadir had started sending money directly to Zara's bank account instead of to his mother.""He added that the four suspects smothered the pregnant Zara with a pillow while she was asleep and then proceeded to burn her face. Then, they dismembered her body into dozens of pieces before dumping it in a drain in three sacks.""Based on Zara's father's statement, where he suspected Sughran after she claimed Zara had run away with her lover upon her disappearance, we interrogated Sughran, who confessed to her crime,"" Farooq said.He mentioned that Sughran was also Zara's paternal aunt.Farooq stated that this was a case of extreme jealousy, as the mother-in-law and her daughter not only killed Zara but also dismembered her body out of hatred.

The crisis has particularly affected Pakistan's Punjab province, where smog and hazardous air quality levels have created a public health emergency.Hospitals across Punjab have been overwhelmed, with Lahore recording the highest number of cases. Toxic smog forced over 75,000 people to seek medical help on a single day, further straining the healthcare system. Over the past month, Lahore alone reported 133,429 respiratory disease cases, including 5,577 asthma patients. Additionally, 5,455 of the 13,862 heart disease cases and 491 of the 5,141 stroke cases in the province were treated in Lahore. The crisis escalated in the past week, with 449,045 respiratory cases reported, along with 30,146 asthma cases, 2,225 heart disease patients, and 1,400 stroke victims.The government has taken several emergency measures, including closing schools, colleges, and parks, limiting market hours, and imposing bans on polluting vehicles and industrial activities. Despite these steps, air quality in cities like Lahore and Multan continues to deteriorate. Lahore’s Air Quality Index (AQI) consistently exceeds hazardous levels, often surpassing 1,000, while Multan recently recorded an alarming AQI of over 2,000.Residents are struggling to cope with the smog’s health impacts. For many, staying indoors offers little relief, and air purifiers remain unaffordable luxuries. Public and private schools have been ordered to close until November 24, with authorities also enforcing a three-day lockdown in Lahore and Multan to mitigate pollution. However, these measures have brought limited respite.Healthcare workers are stretched to their limits. Doctors report a significant increase in patients, particularly children and the elderly, suffering from breathing difficulties, coughing fits, and eye irritation. “This year, smog levels are much worse, and the number of affected patients is far greater,” said Dr Qurat ul Ain, a medical practitioner in Lahore. She advises residents to wear masks and avoid outdoor exposure.The smog’s primary causes include industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and seasonal agricultural stubble burning, exacerbated by stagnant weather conditions. Climate activist Alia Haider described the city as “stuck in its own poison” and criticised the lack of effective long-term solutions. As smog continues to blanket Pakistan’s major cities, millions remain at risk, awaiting meaningful action to address the worsening environmental crisis.","Over 1.91 million people with respiratory illnesses have been admitted to government hospitals in Pakistan over the past month.

unhappy over no talk on poll timeline by Yunus

DHAKA: The International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh), a domestic war crimes body, directed the prosecution on Monday to complete its investigation against ousted PM Sheikh Hasina and 13 others in a genocide case by December 17. They face charges of crimes against humanity related to the July-Aug uprising that resulted in hundreds of deaths.The three-member ICT, led by Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder, had issued an arrest warrant for Hasina on October 17 in connection with her alleged role in ""crimes against humanity"" and ""genocide"". Chief prosecutor Muhammad Tajul Islam stated that Hasina ""had superior command responsibility"" over numerous killings, acts of genocide, and crimes against humanity committed in the country over the past 16.5 years of her tenure.Authorities have been unable to execute the arrest warrant as Hasina ""fled the country"". Tajul said, ""We have pleaded for the issuance of an Interpol red notice against her. We have learned that she is in India, and our govt will request her repatriation in accordance with the bilateral agreement. The process is underway.""Bangladesh Nationalist Party expressed disappointment over interim govt chief adviser Muhammad Yunus 's address to the nation, saying he had failed to give a ""clear outline"" for upcoming elections.

Nile water sharing dispute: Trump offers to mediate Egypt-Ethiopia fallout; writes to Al-Sisi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nile-water-sharing-dispute-trump-offers-to-mediate-egypt-ethiopia-fallout-writes-to-al-sisi/articleshow/126599922.cms,"Donald Trump with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi (AP image)





US President Donald Trump on Friday offered to mediate the long-running dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia over the sharing of Nile River waters. He stated that Washington is ready to restart talks to find a lasting and fair solution.In a letter written to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and later posted on Trump’s Truth Social account, the US president said he was prepared to renew American mediation efforts amid rising tensions linked to Ethiopia’s Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD).The Nile dispute has intensified since Ethiopia inaugurated the GERD on September 9. Egypt, which lies downstream, has strongly opposed the project, arguing that it threatens its water security. Ethiopia, Africa’s second-most populous country with more than 120 million people, views the $5 billion dam as central to its economic development and electricity generation plans.In his letter, Trump also praised Sisi’s regional role.“I thank you for your leadership in successfully mediating a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. I recognize and admire your steady role in managing the many security and humanitarian challenges that have faced this region, and your own people, since October 7, 2023.This war has weighed heavily on Egyptians, not just their neighbors, in Israel and Gaza,” Trump wrote.Trump stressed that no single country should dominate the river’s resources, writing that the United States “affirms that no state in this region should unilaterally control the precious resources of the Nile, and disadvantage its neighbors in the process.”He added that US-led efforts could help secure predictable water flows during droughts while allowing Ethiopia to generate power from the dam.“I believe that with the right technical expertise, fair and transparent negotiations, and a strong United States role in monitoring and coordination between parties, we can achieve a lasting agreement for all Nile Basin Nations,” Trump said.Trump also warned against the risk of escalation, saying: “I very much hope that this truly understandable dispute over the GERD (DAM!) will not lead to major military conflict between Egypt and Ethiopia.”Egypt which is home to around 107 million people, depends on the Nile for nearly all of its fresh water, which is critical for households, agriculture and power generation at the Aswan High Dam, according to BBC.Ethiopia has confirmed it has completed filling the reservoir at the GERD, a massive hydroelectric project on the Blue Nile that officials say will help bring electricity to millions and boost economic growth.","US President Donald Trump offered to mediate the long-running dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia over the sharing of Nile River waters.

How Desmond Scott met Marissa Springer after Kristy Scott filed for divorce





Desmond Scott surprised many people this week, and his name is once again making headlines for a very personal reason. Just days after his estranged wife Kristy Scott filed for divorce, Desmond Scott was seen sharing a close moment with an unknown woman in Houston. At first, no one knew who she was, and that mystery quickly caught attention online.Now, that question has been answered. According to TMZ , the woman seen with Desmond Scott has been identified as Marissa Springer, a 24-year-old Houston model and business student. Sources say the two had just met that same night, and things moved quickly after a short conversation and a few drinks.This new detail comes at a sensitive time, as Kristy Scott had already filed divorce papers in Harris County, Texas, in December. The filing cited alleged infidelity, which Desmond Scott later addressed publicly. While the moment raised eyebrows, sources close to the situation say there was no hidden plan and no long-term connection involved.Sources familiar with the situation told TMZ that Desmond Scott met Marissa Springer for the very first time last Sunday night at Sante, a bar in Houston. The meeting happened through a mutual friend, and Marissa Springer reportedly had no idea about Desmond Scott’s online fame or recent personal troubles.More importantly, sources say Marissa Springer believed Desmond Scott was single at the time they met. There was no expectation of anything serious, and no discussion about his marriage or divorce during their first meeting.As the night went on, the two connected quickly. With drinks involved and a relaxed setting, the mood shifted faster than expected. Sources described it as a sudden spark rather than something planned. Even so, it remains unclear whether the moment will lead to any future contact between them.Earlier this month, TMZ reported that Kristy Scott officially filed for divorce in December, pointing to alleged infidelity in her court documents. After the news became public, Desmond Scott responded by admitting he made “choices” he said he was “not proud of.” His statement did not go into detail but acknowledged regret over his actions.For now, those close to the situation say this moment was brief and does not signal a new relationship. Still, the timing has kept Desmond Scott in the spotlight, as questions around his divorce and personal life continue to draw attention.Also Read: What Happened Between Kristy Scott And Desmond Scott As TikTok Couple Files Divorce Over Alleged Infidelity Claims","TikTok star Desmond Scott's mystery woman revealed as Houston model Marissa Springer.

Matthew “Mizkif” Rinaudo shares what led to the fight with Mitch Jones





Twitch streamer Mizkif and Mitch Jones were once close friends in the streaming world, but their friendship ended in a serious and painful way. On January 15, 2026, Mizkif finally spoke in detail about the night that led to their physical fight, sharing his side of the story for the first time in years. The Kick streamer explained how a meeting meant to fix problems slowly turned into a heated situation that he says went completely out of control.Mizkif said the incident happened in February 2024, when Mitch Jones came to his home to talk things out after months of public tension. At that time, Jones had accused Mizkif of harming him and causing long-term issues. Those claims stayed in the public eye, but Mizkif said he stayed quiet until now. While speaking on his stream, he laid out a clear timeline and explained why the argument became physical.He said his goal that night was simple. He wanted peace, calm talk, and an end to the drama. Instead, he says the meeting turned tense, emotional, and unsafe, leading to actions he regrets but felt forced into at the moment.Mizkif said Mitch Jones came to his house saying he wanted to fix their issues. At first, the talk was calm, but Mizkif claimed Jones was not in a clear state of mind and began blaming him for many personal problems.According to Mizkif, the mood changed even more after Jones started drinking alcohol at his home.Mizkif said Jones repeatedly told him that he had ruined his life and that everything would be better without him. Mizkif said he was confused and hurt by these words, especially because he believed he had tried to help Jones in the past.The situation became worse, Mizkif said, when a woman arrived at his house with drugs meant for Jones. Mizkif said this crossed a line and made him feel unsafe in his own home. He said he immediately asked Jones to leave.Later, Mizkif said he decided to drive Jones home to end the situation peacefully. During the drive, he claimed Jones became aggressive, touched him while he was driving, and told him to stop the car so they could fight. Mizkif said he warned Jones to stop, but when the behavior continued, he pulled over and hit him once to protect himself.Mizkif also said that hours later, Jones returned to his house while heavily intoxicated and began shouting at him and his friend Wake Wilder. He claimed Jones threatened harm before running away. Mizkif said that was the last time he saw him. Mitch Jones has not publicly responded to Mizkif’s statements as of now.Also Read: TikTok Star Desmond Scott Mystery Woman Revealed As Houston Model Marissa Springer Days After Kristy Scott Divorce Filing","Matthew “Mizkif” Rinaudo shares what led to the fight with Mitch Jones.

Jack Doherty court case takes new turn after cocaine mention at January 15 hearing





Jack Doherty is once again in the news, but this time, it is not because of a viral video or online stunt. The popular American YouTuber and streamer is facing serious legal trouble after an arrest in Florida that could change his career. In mid-November 2025, Miami Beach Police arrested Jack Doherty after an incident where he was filming content that allegedly blocked traffic on a busy road. Officers say the situation became unsafe, which led to his arrest on the spot.Following the arrest, police filed three charges against him. These included possession of a controlled substance, possession of 20 grams or less of marijuana, and resisting arrest without violence. Because one of the charges is a felony, Doherty was facing the risk of several years in prison if convicted. Now, new updates from his January 15, 2026 court hearing have raised even more questions, especially after the streamer did not attend the hearing himself.YouTuber Atozy, who is well known for covering streamer court cases, attended Jack Doherty’s hearing in person. After the hearing, Atozy shared an important detail that surprised many followers.According to Atozy, Jack Doherty did not appear in court. He explained this after speaking with an attorney present at the courthouse. Atozy quoted the attorney directly, saying:“Apparently, he was allowed by the judge to not show up or to waive his attendance because of his ‘celebrity status.’ That’s what the attorney I talked to said.”During the hearing, the judge only discussed two charges, not all three. One major update stood out. Earlier police reports said the controlled substance involved was amphetamine or Adderall. However, the judge stated that Doherty was allegedly in possession of cocaine instead.Atozy explained why this matters, saying:“This does technically make things a little bit worse for him because cocaine is a Schedule II compared to Adderall, which is a Schedule III.”This change is serious because cocaine is treated more strictly under the law. If confirmed, it could increase the risk of tougher punishment for the streamer. As of now, the trial is still ongoing, and the next court date has not been announced.Outside the courtroom drama, Jack Doherty’s name also appeared in headlines after a reported backstage fight involving his team and former UFC champion Andrei Arlovski at the Jake Paul vs Anthony Joshua event. No official charges were announced related to that incident.Also Read: Russian YouTuber Vitaly Zdorovetskiy Faces Possible Deportation To Russia After Philippines Arrest And Court Penalties","Jack Doherty was arrested in November 2025 for allegedly blocking traffic on a busy road.

Minority Under Fire Hindu Teacher Home Burnt In Bangladesh Sparks India Concern Ahead Of Polls





DHAKA: The house of a Hindu schoolteacher was set ablaze by a mob in Bangladesh's Sylhet district, as violence against minorities continues ahead of the Feb 12 parliamentary elections in the country. Birendra Kumar Dey and his family members, residents of Bahor village, had a narrow escape. Nobody was injured in the incident on Wednesday afternoon, officials said.Since the lynching of garment factory worker Dipu Chandra Das on Dec 18, eight from the minority Hindu community have died in incidents of atrocities, while properties - including houses and land - attacked, grabbed or set on fire. Rights groups have reported at least 51 incidents of violence against Hindus.Bahor villagers said members of the Dey family, including the elderly, were inside the house when it was set on fire. They escaped with the help of locals, villagers said, adding that Birendra was a popular teacher and people lovingly called him 'Jhunu Sir'.Meanwhile in the UK parliament, lawmaker Bob Blackman Thursday raised concerns over escalating violence against minorities, particularly Hindus, in Bangladesh. Calling the situation ""disastrous"", he said minorities are being murdered, their houses and temples set ablaze. He also said the polls in Bangladesh are being held amid grave democratic concerns.","The house of a Hindu schoolteacher was set ablaze by a mob in Bangladesh's Sylhet district.

"Beijing won its war for blue skies, but nearby villagers are paying the price",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/beijing-won-its-war-for-blue-skies-but-nearby-villagers-are-paying-the-price/articleshow/126598301.cms,"Across provinces near Beijing, govt has banned burning coal for residential heating to reduce pollution. At first, local govts eased the transition by heavily subsidising natural gas, which is cleaner but expensive. But this winter, officials cut the subsidies. Now, villagers are forced to sunbathe for warmth (NYT photo)







QUYANG: The temperature was 28, but Dong Tongzhou had turned off his heat at home and was standing in the village square wrapped in a tattered coat, trying to soak up the midday sun. He wasn't alone - other villagers sat on folding chairs and at a card table, as chickens strutted around and clucked.Dong, 68, used to warm his home by burning coal, he explained on an afternoon. Then govt banned that for environmental reasons, and offered natural gas as a replacement. But that could cost three times as much. To save money, Dong often sunbathed for warmth.Even so, Dong said he spent about 1,000 yuan, or about $143, each winter to heat his home in Quyang county, in northern China's Hebei province. On a monthly basis, that works out to over a third of his pension of 800 yuan as a retired farmer and former soldier. ""If it gets even more expensive, then I'll stop using it,"" Dong said.Across Hebei, which encircles China's capital, Beijing, villagers like Dong are confronting the full cost of the country's push for cleaner air. The central govt has banned burning coal for residential heating in much of the province since 2017, to reduce the choking air pollution that enveloped the capital every winter. At first, local govts eased the transition by subsidising natural gas, which is cleaner but more expensive.But this winter, subsidies have been cut.Reports of villagers huddling under multiple blankets or secretly burning firewood for warmth - firewood is banned, too - had circulated on Chinese social media. But China's gains in air quality have been a political priority for govt, and many of the reports were censored.While villagers ration their heat, Beijing officials are celebrating a victory. Last week, the city announced it had recorded only one day of heavy pollution in 2025, a 98% drop compared with 2013. Officials held up the improvement as proof of the success of Beijing's ""blue sky defence war."" Beyond the rising costs, poorer villagers often seem to end up paying more than city residents to heat their homes. The price of gas per cubic meter in Hebei is 10% to 20% higher than in Beijing or Tianjin, according to media reports.Over the long term, the answer is likely to lie less in natural gas and more in renewable energy. ""China is already the world's leading producer of solar and wind power, and as power becomes cheaper, electric devices like heat pumps can replace gas boilers and coal furnaces, cutting emissions and, eventually, costs,"" said Deborah Seligsohn, a professor at Villanova University.The Hebei villagers' plight was not proof that China's green transition had to come at the expense of ordinary people, she said. Rather, ""this is an issue with inconsistent policy: They had subsidies and they got rid of them,"" she said. But installing a heat pump requires a large upfront payment. ""Installation costs more than $2,800,"" Wang, a heat store employee, said, adding govt did not offer any subsidies. That was too expensive for many villagers, Wang said. After all, ""many won't even turn on their gas.""","Across provinces near Beijing, govt has banned burning coal for residential heating to reduce pollution.

Brussels Tightens Iran Sanctions As Eu Chief Von Der Leyen Vows Support For Protesters And Change

Iran linked to past plots and threats against Trump





Iranian state television aired footage on Sunday that included a threat directed at US President Donald Trump, following his recent warning of potential military action against Iran’s leadership.The footage showed a mourner at a ceremony for Iranian security personnel killed in recent unrest holding a placard with an image of Trump, referring to the assassination attempt he survived at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in 2024. Text in Farsi beneath the image read: ""This time it will not miss the target"".The incident represents Tehran’s most direct threat against Trump to date, coming after his repeated warnings that the United States would strike Iran if it continued its crackdown on anti-government protesters.Trump was the target of an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was shot in the ear by a gunman identified as Thomas Crooks.The footage was aired on the Islamic Republic of Iran News Network (IRINN), a state-controlled television channel. It was broadcast during a funeral ceremony in Tehran for more than 100 members of the security forces and others described by authorities as “martyrs” killed during recent demonstrations.At the ceremony, attendees held banners reading “Death to America!” while others carried photographs of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The semiofficial Tasnim news agency, which is widely regarded as being close to Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, reported that the funeral marked the first in a series of state ceremonies planned for security personnel in the coming days, as cited by The Independent.Rights groups outside Iran have said that more than 150 members of the security forces and government personnel have been killed during over two weeks of unrestIranian authorities have characterised the demonstrations as “riots” and accused protesters of carrying out “acts of terror”.Iran has previously been linked to assassination plots abroad, most often aimed at Iranian dissidents, with varying outcomes. Iranian officials have also repeatedly vowed to kill Trump following his order to assassinate General Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force, in January 2020.A video released in 2022 by Iranian state-linked media depicted a simulated assassination attempt on Trump at his Mar-a-Lago golf course ahead of the 2024 election.The video resurfaced after the arrest of Ryan Routh, who was detained while allegedly attempting to take aim at Trump at the same golf course, as cited by the New York Post.The US Justice Department has also said that in 2024 it disrupted an Iranian-directed plot to kill Trump, following the arrest of Farhad Shakeri, who court documents say was tasked by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps with carrying out the killing.The current protests broke out in Iran on December 28 after the collapse of the rial, amid economic pressure linked to international sanctions imposed in part over the country’s nuclear programme.Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi gave a different account in an interview with Fox News, saying the protests began peacefully and that authorities initially engaged with demonstrators. He said the unrest later turned violent after what he described as “terrorist elements led from outside” Iran became involved.","Iran has previously been linked to assassination plots abroad, most often aimed at Iranian dissidents, with varying outcomes.

Kuwait Airways is shaking up global air travel in 2026 with the announcement of five exciting new direct international routes, strengthening its connectivity between the Gulf, Europe and Asia. The carrier, already serving more than 60 destinations worldwide, is expanding its line-up to include dream leisure spots and strategic business hubs. This move signals both confidence in post-pandemic travel demand and an ambitious bid to make Kuwait a more significant global aviation hub.The new direct services were confirmed in a report by Kuwait Times and while exact start dates for some destinations will be announced closer to mid-2026, a standout launch is already capturing attention. Flights from Kuwait to Mykonos, Greece, are set to resume with a twice-weekly service beginning June 14, 2026. Mykonos is one of Europe’s most popular sun-soaked holiday islands, making it a major draw for both Gulf residents and visitors.Here’s a look at the destinations Kuwait Airways is adding in its 2026 expansion:While Mykonos already has a firm launch date, the exact flight schedules for Beijing, Maldives and Phuket are expected to be published closer to their respective take-off times later in 2026. Kuwait Airways’ new routes reflect a mix of leisure-centric and business-oriented strategy. Destinations like Mykonos, the Maldives and Phuket are perennial favourites among holidaymakers, especially travellers from the Middle East seeking sun, sea and sands without complex transfer logistics.Moscow and Beijing deepen Kuwait’s connectivity with major economic and political capitals, supporting trade, tourism and diplomatic ties.The expansion comes at a time when global aviation is rebounding from pandemic disruptions and airlines are increasingly eyeing direct connections to win back passengers who prefer nonstop travel over long haul journeys with layovers. This trend is also visible in other carriers in the region. For example, Etihad Airways expanded flight options to Europe and Asia in recent seasons, adding year-round and seasonal destinations to its Abu Dhabi network.Kuwait Airways’ network boost is part of a larger regional picture in which Gulf carriers are aggressively expanding routes to connect the Middle East with fast-growing markets in Europe and Asia. Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad and flydubai have similarly broadened their international reach in recent years, responding to robust demand from both leisure explorers and business travellers.For Kuwait, these new flights represent more than just tourism opportunities. They are strategic steps toward enhancing the country’s role as a global transit and tourism hub. With direct flights to top holiday destinations and major capitals alike, Kuwait Airways is positioning itself as a competitive choice for travellers throughout the Gulf and beyond.Kuwait Airways’ 2026 expansion marks a bold chapter in the airline’s global strategy, positioning the Gulf carrier as a key bridge between continents and cultures, with direct flights to sun-soaked beaches, island paradises and vital world capitals.","Kuwait Airways opens five new destinations for business and leisure travel in 2026.

Trump ‘STEALS’ Machado's Nobel Medal, Brands It Reward for ‘Work Done’; Move Seals New Caracas Plan?





US President Donald Trump on Thursday praised Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado for presenting him with her Nobel Peace Prize medal, an award she was conferred months ago.In a post after receiving the medal, Trump took to Truth Social, calling Machado a “wonderful woman.” “It was my great honor to meet María Corina Machado , of Venezuela, today. She is a wonderful woman who has been through so much. María presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you, María!” he wrote.Machado said she presented Trump with her Nobel medal “as a recognition of his unique commitment to our freedom.” After the meeting, she told supporters that the interaction had gone well and that they could “count on” the US president.A White House official confirmed that Trump intends to keep the medal.However, days ago, the Nobel Committee and institute clarified on the permanence of a Nobel laureate's status. It announced that the prize can not be revoked, shared, or transferred to others.The meeting came just days after Trump launched strikes on Venezuela under Operation Absolute Resolve, which led to the toppling of President Nicolas Maduro and his capture along with his wife, who were taken into US custody thereafter.The US raid in Caracas on January 3 had briefly raised hopes among Venezuela’s embattled pro-democracy opposition, led by Machado, who had called for an “end to tyranny” in the country.However, Trump soon sidelined Machado after the US kidnapped Maduro, arguing that she lacked both domestic support and the respect needed to lead the country.Venezuela’s opposition maintains that Maduro rigged the 2024 election to deny victory to Machado’s party, allegations that have been backed by Washington.On Thursday, the White House said Trump’s view of Machado remains unchanged.","US President Donald Trump met with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.

US Senate Hearing Turns Viral After Indian-Origin Doctor Refuses Yes Or No On Men Getting Pregnant

Who is Dr Nisha Verma ?





Dr Nisha Verma has drawn national attention after a tense exchange during a recent US Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing on abortion pill safety.During the hearing, Republican Senator Josh Hawley repeatedly questioned Verma on whether men can get pregnant, a line of questioning that quickly went viral on social media and reignited wider political and cultural debates around gender identity, reproductive rights and the language used in healthcare.Verma, who appeared as a Democratic witness, declined to give a direct yes-or-no answer and described the questioning as “polarizing”, saying she treats patients “with many identities”. Hawley responded by asserting that “it is women who get pregnant, not men.”The exchange has since fuelled sharp reactions online and among policymakers, with the debate likely to shape future discussions on abortion policy, transgender healthcare and the regulation of medication abortion in the US.Dr Nisha Verma is a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist and a complex family planning subspecialist.She was born in Greensboro, North Carolina, to Indian immigrant parents.She completed her Bachelor’s degree in Biology and Anthropology and her medical degree at the University of North Carolina, and later earned a Master’s in Public Health from Emory University.She trained in obstetrics and gynaecology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and completed a Complex Family Planning Fellowship at Emory University.According to Emory University, she is an Adjunct Assistant Professor at the Emory University School of Medicine.Dr Verma currently serves as Senior Advisor for Reproductive Health Policy and Advocacy at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), as per AcademyHealth.She provides reproductive healthcare in states including Georgia and Maryland, has testified before Congress on abortion restrictions, and is involved in research examining the impact of Georgia’s six-week abortion ban on high-risk pregnancies.",Dr Nisha Verma has drawn national attention after a tense exchange during a recent US Senate hearing on abortion pill safety.

Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity





President Donald Trump this week marked the ceremonial renaming of a roadway near his private club in Palm Beach, Florida, a move that adds yet another entry to a growing list of public-facing projects, institutions, and initiatives bearing his name since he returned to office in January.State lawmakers approved an honorary new name for a stretch of Southern Boulevard, the road that connects Palm Beach International Airport to Mar-a-Lago. The route is frequently used by the president’s motorcade when traveling between the airport and his residence.Speaking at an event held at Mar-a-Lago, Trump said he was “tremendously honored” by the decision. “I’ll remember this amazing gesture for the rest of my life,” he said.Local officials stressed that the change is symbolic. County commissioners told local media outlets that official addresses, emergency response systems, and government maps will remain unchanged.The renamed roadway is only the latest, example of Trump attaching his name to state-backed or federally linked projects while still in office, a practice historians note is highly unusual in Washington, where presidential naming honors typically come years or decades after a president leaves power and are usually authorised by Congress.The Palm Beach roadway now carrying Trump’s name runs directly to Mar-a-Lago, underscoring its personal significance. While the designation is honorary, it places Trump alongside a small number of living presidents whose names appear on public infrastructure during their lifetime.In December 2025, the White House announced that the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts would be renamed the Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. The decision was approved unanimously by the Kennedy Center’s board of trustees, which had been selected by Trump. The move triggered backlash in the arts community, with several performers withdrawing in protest, according to coverage by major US media organisations.On December 4, 2025, the Trump administration renamed the US Institute of Peace to the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace. The state department said the change was meant to “reflect the greatest dealmaker in our nation’s history.” The new name was installed on the building near the state department. The institute was originally created by Congress in the 1980s, a fact noted by historians and critics cited in national reporting.In December 2025, Trump announced plans for a new fleet of Navy vessels dubbed Trump-class battleships. The first ship, the USS Defiant, would belong to what the Navy described as “a class of American-designed battleships that will be the most lethal surface combatant ever constructed.” Forbes reported that the USS Defiant would be the biggest warship the US has built since World War II, while also noting expert criticism that such ships could be vulnerable to modern missile attacks.During his second term, Trump unveiled tax-advantaged savings and investment accounts for children, branded as Trump Accounts. According to PBS News, the accounts are “tax-advantaged savings accounts available for every American child up to the age of 18, and parents can put in up to $5,000 annually.” Children born between 2025 and 2028 automatically receive $1,000.The White House also rolled out redesigned national park passes featuring Trump’s face, in one version alongside George Washington, and in another showing Trump saluting. Newsweek reported that the passes were “reintroduced as part of a broader rebranding effort by the administration.”Trump announced a proposed investor visa known as the Trump Gold Card, which would offer a fast-track path to residency and citizenship for foreign nationals willing to pay at least $1 million USD to the US government.In October 2025, the administration introduced TrumpRx, a government-backed platform allowing Americans to purchase prescription drugs at discounted prices directly from pharmaceutical companies, according to White House briefings and national media reports.The Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, or TRIPP, is a US-backed infrastructure corridor connecting Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave via Armenia. The project, expected to be finalised in early 2026, aims to reduce Russian and Iranian influence in the South Caucasus while promoting trade and regional stability, according to diplomatic reporting.Some historians quoted by US media outlets have described the naming spree as a superficial attempt to cement Trump’s legacy, one that could prove temporary if future administrations reverse course. For now, however, Trump Boulevard joins an increasingly long list of places where the president’s name is quite literally written into the landscape.","President Donald Trump this week marked the ceremonial renaming of a roadway near his private club in Palm Beach, Florida.

UNITED NATIONS: The US stands by the ""brave people of Iran,"" and President Trump ""has made it clear all options are on the table to stop the slaughter,"" US ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz told the UN Security Council on Thursday.Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters in Iran, where thousands of people have been reported killed in a crackdown on the protests against clerical rule. But on Thursday, Trump adopted a wait-and-see posture, saying he had been told that the killings were easing and that he believed there was no current plan for large-scale executions.""President Trump is a man of action, not endless talk like we see at the UN.

Gaza War Not Over For IDF? 22,000 Israeli Troops Face Mental Health Crisis; PTSD Hits Hard





US President Donald Trump on Friday announced the appointment of Secretary of State Marco Rubio and former British prime minister Tony Blair as founding members of a new Gaza “board of peace.”Trump also named his special envoy Steve Witkoff, son-in-law Jared Kushner, and World Bank President Ajay Banga to the seven-member “founding executive board,” the White House said in a statement. Trump himself will chair the board, with additional members expected to be announced in the coming weeks.Blair’s appointment is seen as controversial in the Middle East due to his role in the 2003 Iraq invasion. Trump said last year he wanted to ensure that board members were “acceptable choice[s] to everybody.”The announcement follows Thursday’s unveiling of the board, a key phase two element of the US-backed plan to end the war in Gaza. Trump described the board as the “Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place.”The creation of the board comes shortly after a 15-member Palestinian technocratic committee was announced to manage day-to-day governance in post-war Gaza. Gaza native and former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath will head the committee.Trump also named US Major General Jasper Jeffers to lead the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza.The US-backed Gaza peace plan first went into effect on October 10, resulting in the return of hostages held by Hamas and a cessation of hostilities between the Palestinian militant group and Israel. The second phase of the plan is now underway, amid reports of aid shortages and ongoing violence.Hamas has not publicly committed to full disarmament, a key demand from Israel.","US President Donald Trump announced the appointment of Secretary of State Marco Rubio and former British prime minister Tony Blair as founding members of a new Gaza “board of peace” Trump also named his special envoy Steve Witkoff, son-in- law Jared Kushner, and World Bank President Ajay Banga to the seven-member executive board.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126597282,imgsize-1390065,width-400,resizemode-4/article-95.jpg"

Second U.S. Operation In Venezuela? FAA Makes Big Caribbean Airspace Announcement Post-Maduro Op





The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Friday said that it issued a series of aviation safety warnings, advising airlines to exercise caution while operating over Central America and parts of South America due to the risk of potential 'military activity' and GPS signal interference.The agency said it released multiple Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) covering Mexico, several Central American nations, Ecuador, Colombia and sections of airspace over the eastern Pacific Ocean. The advisories came into effect on Friday and will remain valid for the next 60 days.The US aviation authority posted multiple messages warning of a “potentially hazardous situation,” and to ""exercise caution"" in the airspace over Mexico and Central America due to ""military activities"". ""The FAA issued flight advisory Notices to Airmen for specified areas of Mexico, Central America, Panama, Bogota, Guayaquil and Mazatlan Oceanic Flight Regions, and in airspace within the eastern Pacific Ocean,"" said an FAA spokesperson, as quoted by AFP.The FAA’s action comes amid rising geopolitical tensions between the United States and several global leaders, amid a significant US military buildup in the southern Caribbean.The Trump administration recently conducted military operations targeting Venezuela, including an operation in which Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was seized. President Donald Trump has also publicly indicated that further military action remains under consideration, including potential operations involving Colombia.Last week, Trump claimed that drug cartels were effectively controlling Mexico and suggested that the US could carry out strikes on land targets to counter organised crime groups. The remarks were among several recent statements pointing to an increased willingness by Washington to deploy military force in the region.In the aftermath of the Venezuela operation, the FAA restricted commercial flights across parts of the Caribbean, prompting major airlines to cancel hundreds of services. FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford told Reuters earlier this week that the agency had closely coordinated with the US military in advance of the operation.","The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a series of aviation safety warnings, advising airlines to exercise caution.

President Donald Trump is not concerned about his immigration policies, but he expressed some discomfort over the way it looks, especially in Minneapolis, where US citizen Renee Good was shot dead by ICE agent Jonathan Ross on allegations that Renee Good was trying to run the ICE agent over. Both protests and ICE crackdowns are going on simultaneously as the administration is resolute to boot out the Somalis living off government welfare in Minnesota.Citing an insider, Axios reported that Trump wants deportations, mass deportations. ""What he doesn't want is what people are seeing. He doesn't like the way it looks. It looks bad, so he's expressed some discomfort at that. There's the right way to do this. And this doesn't look like the right way to a lot of people,"" the adviser said.The report said insiders are now planning to do something to change the optics as chaotic scenes from Minnesota are playing around the clock on TV and social media. An internal GOP polling alarmed some Trump advisers and those polls were even before Renee Good's shooting. 60% of independent voters and 58% of undecided voters said Trump was ""too focused"" on deporting illegal immigrants, the poll viewed by Trump's team found.33% said Trump was primarily deporting law-abiding people, as opposed to criminals. Two public surveys released this week — one from CNN, another from YouGov — found that most Americans said the agency was making US cities less safe.US citizen Renee Good was shot dead on January 7 by an ICE agent and the administration claimed it was act of 'self defense' as Good was coming at the agent with her car. This triggered a massive controversy as videos showed that Good was turning her car away and her last interaction with an ICE agent on that day was not heated.After Good's shooting as the crackdown continued, a video of a woman being dragged by ICE agents from her car in Minneapolis went viral. Bangladeshi-origin Aliya Rahman, a US citizen, said she was on her way to a medical appointment when she was detained by immigration officers. The administration accused her of obstructing ICE agents.Due to a heavy police presence in the school area at St Louis Park, several schools suspended in-person classes. “This is not how Minnesotans behave. This is not how St. Louis Park residents behave,” said St Louis Park Mayor Nadia Mohamed, the first elected Somali American mayor in the country.","US citizen Renee Good was shot dead on January 7 by an ICE agent and the administration claimed it was act of'self defense' as Good was coming at the agent with her car.

The ongoing legal dispute between Hunter Biden and the mother of his daughter has taken another sharp turn.New court papers filed urged an Arkansas judge to have former US President Joe Biden 's son arrested for failing to provide proper child support.34-year-old Lunden Roberts and the mother of Hunter’s 7‑year‑old daughter, Navy Joan Roberts, filed the motion on Tuesday. In the filing, she asked the court to reopen the long‑running case and consider incarceration for Biden until he complies with the 2023 agreement, according to court records.“Incarcerate him in the Independence County Detention Center as a civil penalty until he purges his contempt by complying with this court’s orders,” the motion read. Roberts said in the filing that previous measures have been ineffective and that jail time is necessary.The dispute comes from a 2023 settlement that reduced Biden’s monthly child support obligation from $20,000 to $5,000. As part of that agreement, Roberts agreed to drop her request for their daughter to take the Biden surname and to accept proceeds from a number of Biden’s art sales for their daughter’s benefit.Roberts accuses Biden of failing to meet other terms of the agreement, including regular payments and communication, and of inflicting “emotional trauma” on their daughter. In one example cited in court documents, Navy Joan allegedly felt upset when she attended a family wedding and realised her father would not take part in the event in the way other family members did.The motion also argues that the court should modify the child support amount, and that Biden’s income has changed significantly since the 2023 order and that Navy Joan does not have access to the same lifestyle as her half‑siblings.Hunter Biden has previously acknowledged paternity after a 2019 court‑ordered DNA test confirmed he is the father of Navy Joan.

Trump Warns ‘Professional Agitators’ With Insurrection Act As Minneapolis Erupts After ICE Shootings





US President Donald Trump said on Friday there was no immediate need to invoke the Insurrection Act in response to protests against immigration raids in Minnesota, a day after he warned he could use the law.“If I needed it, I would use it. I don't think there is any reason right now to use it,” Trump told reporters at the White House when asked about the measure, which permits the deployment of soldiers on US soil.This marks a tone-down from when the president had raised the possibility of deploying the military to the northern state for law enforcement purposes amid demonstrations against wide-ranging immigration operations led by his administration. “If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of ICE, who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State,” Trump had said in a post on Truth Social earlier.Protests in Minneapolis have seen crowds clash with immigration officers attempting to detain undocumented migrants, with some officers responding forcefully.Federal agents discharged their weapons in two separate incidents, wounding a Venezuelan man on Wednesday and killing an American woman last week.An AFP correspondent also witnessed officers roughly pulling a woman from her car on Tuesday, as the federal presence in the state continued to expand. Supporters of stricter immigration enforcement have since confronted opponents, leading to further tense encounters.Democratic Minnesota Governor Tim Walz accused federal agents of carrying out “a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota,” in a video posted on X on Wednesday night.The Insurrection Act allows a president to bypass the Posse Comitatus Act to suppress “armed rebellion” or “domestic violence,” authorising the use of the armed forces “as he considers necessary” to enforce the law.","Donald Trump says there is no immediate need to invoke the Insurrection Act in response to protests against immigration raids in Minnesota.

The moves, announced by Mayor Zohran Mamdani and senior city officials, mark the most aggressive phase yet of the administration’s push to reshape conditions for the city’s delivery workforce.On Thursday, the administration sent formal notices to more than 60 delivery app companies, including DoorDash, Instacart and Uber , warning them to comply with amendments to New York City’s Delivery Worker Laws by 26 January 2026.“Amendments to the Delivery Worker Laws go into effect on Jan. 26, 2026,” wrote Department of Consumer and Worker Protection Commissioner Sam Levine in the letters. “We expect your company to be in full compliance on that date… We will be closely monitoring for violations of law and will take follow-up action as warranted.”The changes, passed by the City Council last year, extend the city’s minimum pay standard to grocery delivery apps such as Instacart, bringing them into line with restaurant delivery platforms.They also give workers the right to set maximum delivery distances, a provision designed to reduce pressure on couriers to accept long trips for fear of losing access to work.Mayor Mamdani underlined the administration’s intent at a press conference held at the Worker’s Justice Project headquarters in Williamsburg, home to Los Deliveristas Unidos, the delivery worker organisation that has pushed for expanded labour protections.“No longer will we tolerate corporate mistreatment of workers across these five boroughs,” Mamdani said. “Which is why we have sent warning letters to 60 app companies warning them that new laws protecting workers will take effect on Jan. 26 of this year, and that those laws will be enforced.”Levine, a former official in the Biden administration’s Federal Trade Commission, said the letters were meant to leave no ambiguity about the city’s intentions. “I want these companies to start following the law,” he told Streetsblog. “My hope is that they realize they are in a new era and start coming into compliance, and that’s why we sent those letters.”Under the amended laws, companies face fines, lawsuits and even licence revocation if they fail to comply. The rules also require platforms to offer customers the option to tip at checkout rather than only after delivery, and to provide workers with itemised pay statements explaining how earnings are calculated.Alongside the warning letters, the city filed a case in New York State Supreme Court against Motoclick, a restaurant-facing delivery app it accuses of egregious violations of the Delivery Worker Laws. According to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, Motoclick ignored the city’s minimum pay rate and directly deducted money from workers’ earnings, including charging a $10 fee for cancelled orders and docking the full cost of refunded meals.“Motoclick and its CEO tricked New Yorkers into working for their platform with false promises and then stole their tips and earnings – sometimes even driving workers into debt,” said Levine. “We are seeking to shutdown this company and other predatory apps should be on notice. If you scam your workers, we will hold you and your executives accountable.”The department estimates that Motoclick and its chief executive, Juan Pablo Salinas Salek, owe workers millions of dollars in stolen pay and damages, and is seeking to shut the company down entirely.Mamdani framed the lawsuit as part of a broader shift in city policy. “Deliveristas make millions of New Yorkers’ day-to-day lives easier only for their own to be difficult. Today, however, marks the end of a chapter of thankless exploitation,” he said. “Our Department of Consumer and Worker Protection is already cracking down on everything from baseless violations of the law to deceptive tricks that hurt our delivery workers, and showing what a government that puts working people first can accomplish every day. ”Deputy Mayor for Economic Justice Julie Su described the case as a warning shot to the wider industry. “Today’s lawsuit against Motoclick is not just an action against one company, it’s a warning to every app-based company from this Administration. You cannot treat workers like they are expendable and get away with it. We will seek full back pay and damages. We will seek full accountability.”The enforcement push comes amid a broader fight over tipping practices. A recent report by the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection found that delivery workers have lost as much as $550 million in tips since Uber and DoorDash moved the tipping option to after checkout. According to the report, the average tip fell from more than $3 to less than $1 after the change, while platforms that kept tipping at checkout, such as Grubhub, did not see a comparable decline.DoorDash and Uber Eats have sued the city over the new tipping law, arguing that it violates their free speech rights and will make deliveries more expensive for customers. A DoorDash spokesperson said the company’s position remained unchanged: “Despite what DCWP Commissioner Levine thinks, our goal remains the same: to empower local economies and connect New Yorkers with the restaurants and businesses they love. [DoorDash workers] continue to earn fairly on our platform and customers continue to have the ability to tip post-checkout. ”Other companies struck a more conciliatory tone. Wonder, which now owns Grubhub, Seamless and Relay, confirmed it had received the mayor’s letter and said it would work with the administration. “Delivery drivers provide an essential service to millions of New Yorkers, and we look forward to partnering with the Mayor’s office on smart policy that makes delivery work better for everyone,” a spokesperson said.Levine said the Motoclick lawsuit and the warning letters were part of a wider compliance blitz tied to several local laws taking effect on 26 January. These include Local Laws 107 and 108 on tipping protections, Local Law 113 on pay transparency, and Local Laws 123 and 124 expanding minimum pay coverage, payment timelines and bathroom access for delivery workers.As the deadline approaches, the administration has made clear that enforcement will not be symbolic. With litigation already under way and dozens of companies on notice, New York is signalling that the next phase of its delivery worker reforms will be driven not by negotiation, but by penalties, court action and, if necessary, shutdowns.","NYC sues one app and warns 60 others of shutdowns.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services issued a fresh warning targeting Green Card applicants and cited recent cases where layers of screening threw up shocking discoveries about the applicants and appropriate actions have been taken. In one case, the USCIS said, screening revealed that an applicant was wanted for homicide by the Mexican government.In another incident, a Canadian with a pending Green Card application in the US was arrested at his immigration interview when it was discovered that he had recently been charged with drunk driving and then caused injury to an officer resisting arrest.""Green cards are for those who follow the law, not those who break it,"" the USCIS said in one message.

‘Thank you’ Iran: Donald Trump reacts to Tehran's execution halt; claims over 800 hangings cancelled,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/thank-you-iran-donald-trump-reacts-to-tehrans-execution-halt-claims-over-800-hangings-cancelled/articleshow/126588405.cms,"‘Back Off Now Or Face…’: Iran’s Grim Warning to US Forces As Trump Weighs Military Action





NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Friday said Iran’s leadership had called off the executions of hundreds of protesters arrested during a recent crackdown, thanking Tehran for the move.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said Iranian authorities had cancelled scheduled hangings that were to take place a day earlier. “I greatly respect the fact that all scheduled hangings, which were to take place yesterday (Over 800 of them), have been cancelled by the leadership of Iran. Thank you!” he wrote.Trump’s comments came amid international concern over Iran’s handling of protests and the treatment of demonstrators detained during the crackdown. Tehran had reportedly planned mass executions of protesters before reversing the decision.The death toll from the protests continues to climb, according to activists. However, President Trump suggested that the likelihood of US military action was diminishing, citing Iran’s decision to halt planned executions.Trump’s optimistic assessment contrasted with the more complex realities on the ground in Iran, but it appeared to mark a retreat from his earlier remarks that had implied a US strike could be imminent.Previously, Trump had posted about Iran and the protesters, saying, “Help is on the way.” When asked on Friday whether that promise still stood, he responded, “Well, we’re going to see.”Pressed on whether anyone had persuaded him to step back from what seemed like threats of military action, Trump said, “Nobody convinced me. I convinced myself.”He added, “They had more than 800 hangings scheduled yesterday. They didn’t hang anyone. They canceled the hangings. That had a big impact.”","US President Donald Trump said Iran’s leadership had called off the executions of hundreds of protesters arrested during a recent crackdown.

ICE said ‘medical distress’; examiner cites possible homicide — here’s what we know about Geraldo Lunas Campos’ death in custody,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ice-said-medical-distress-examiner-cites-possible-homicide-heres-what-we-know-about-geraldo-lunas-campos-death-in-custody/articleshow/126585555.cms,"



The death of a man held at a federal detention camp in Texas in early January may be investigated as a homicide after the local medical examiner reportedly found the preliminary cause was “asphyxia due to neck and chest compression”.Geraldo Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old Cuban migrant arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in July last year, was pronounced dead on 3 January. He was in ICE custody at Camp East Montana, a tent camp at the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso, Washington Post reported.In a press release about his death, ICE claimed he died after “experiencing medical distress” and said his cause of death was under investigation. The Department of Homeland Security had previously highlighted Lunas Campos’s arrest as one of the “worst of the worst”, a category used by DHS to trumpet what they claim as victories of Trump’s mass deportation campaign. He had convictions of child sexual abuse, possession of a firearm, and aggravated assault.However, in a recording reviewed and first reported on by the Washington Post, the El Paso county’s office of the medical examiner reportedly told a member of Lunas Campos’s family that the office was preparing to classify the death as a homicide, subject to results of a toxicology report.Lunas Campos was one of four ICE detainees who died while in custody in the first 10 days of the year and his death was part of a trend in which 2025 was the agency’s deadliest year in more than two decades. According to a Guardian investigation, last December was the deadliest month, with six fatalities.He was also at least the second person housed at the camp, which has repeatedly come under fire from human rights groups for reports of abuse and inhumane conditions, to die in recent months. Francisco Gaspar-Andres, a 48-year-old Guatemalan man who had also been held at Fort Bliss, died in hospital after health complications late last year.ICE officials and the county of El Paso’s medical examiner could not be reached for comment on whether Lunas Campos’s death would be officially classified as a homicide. A representative of the office responded to the El Paso Times saying that the autopsy report was still pending and not publicly available.ICE said in its press release that Lunas Campos had been put into segregation after he became “disruptive while in line for medication”. Officials said staff “observed him in distress and contacted on-site medical personnel for assistance”. Medical responders pronounced him deceased at 10.16pm.Witnesses detained with Lunas Campos told the Washington Post a different account. Santos Jesus Flores, who was detained at the camp, said he saw five guards choking Lunas Campos as he struggled after resisting being taken to the segregation unit because he did not have his medications.During the struggle, Jesus Flores said he heard Lunas Campos repeatedly say in Spanish that he could not breathe.“He said, ‘I cannot breathe, I cannot breathe.’ After that, we don’t hear his voice anymore and that’s it,” Flores told the Post.","Geraldo Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old Cuban migrant arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in July last year, was pronounced dead on 3 January.

Meet Saikat Chakrabarti: AOC’s ex-aide running for Congress from Pelosi’s backyard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/meet-saikat-chakrabarti-aocs-ex-aide-running-for-congress-from-pelosis-backyard/articleshow/126586976.cms,"From Silicon Valley engineer to political strategist

Why Pelosi’s backyard is such a big stage



What Chakrabarti is campaigning on

lowering the cost of living

building large amounts of housing

improving infrastructure and city services

reducing corporate influence in politics

The money and the momentum

A high-profile contest ahead





Saikat Chakrabarti, the former chief of staff to US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), is stepping into the political arena with a congressional run in California, launching a high-profile contest in San Francisco.The Indian-origin organiser and former Silicon Valley engineer is running as a Democrat in California’s 11th Congressional District, which covers San Francisco. The seat has long been associated with Democratic heavyweight Nancy Pelosi, who has announced she will not seek re-election in 2026. With Pelosi’s era shaping the district for decades, the race is being viewed as a major test of what comes next in one of the most influential Democratic strongholds in the US.Chakrabarti’s career did not begin in politics. He entered the tech world early, building a reputation in the Bay Area as a systems-minded engineer. He later became part of the early team at Stripe, the payments company that grew into one of Silicon Valley’s biggest success stories.His shift into national politics came through the progressive movement around Senator Bernie Sanders. During the 2016 campaign, Chakrabarti helped develop tools and strategy aimed at strengthening grassroots organising, with a focus on scaling volunteer networks and building infrastructure that could compete with traditional political machines.That experience placed him at the crossroads of two cultures: Silicon Valley’s “build fast” mentality and the progressive movement’s drive to challenge entrenched power.Chakrabarti became a recognised figure in progressive politics after playing a key role in Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s breakthrough 2018 campaign. The victory was widely seen as a defining upset and a turning point for the modern Democratic Party’s left wing.After AOC entered Congress, Chakrabarti served as her chief of staff and helped shape the messaging and strategy that turned her into a national political brand. He later moved on to work in the wider policy ecosystem pushing major progressive priorities, including efforts tied to the Green New Deal.His time in that movement space gave him a reputation as a bold strategist, admired by supporters who want sharper change and criticised by detractors who believe progressives promise more than they can deliver.San Francisco’s congressional district is one of the safest Democratic seats in the country, which means the main battle is typically inside the Democratic primary, not the general election. That reality makes the race less about party control and more about ideology, leadership style, and who gets to represent the future of Democratic politics in the city.Pelosi’s long legacy also adds symbolism. Her career represented a brand of Democratic power built on institutional influence, discipline, and longevity. Chakrabarti, by contrast, is tied to a newer progressive current shaped by movement politics, online messaging, and confrontational challenges to establishment leadership.That contrast is why his candidacy is being treated as more than a routine campaign announcement.Chakrabarti’s campaign messaging focuses heavily on affordability, daily quality-of-life issues, and the sense that San Francisco has become unliveable for ordinary working people. His slogans include themes such as “Make San Francisco livable,” “Rebuild the American Dream,” and “Save our democracy.”His pitch centres on major structural changes, including:He has also backed ideas such as banning stock trading by members of Congress and curbing the role of big money in elections, aiming to position himself as a reform-driven challenger.Chakrabarti’s fundraising has also drawn attention early in the race. Financial disclosures referenced in profile material show he has pulled in close to $1 million in receipts in a key period, including a large portion as candidate loans alongside individual contributions.That detail is likely to become part of the political conversation, especially as he frames himself as a candidate challenging entrenched power structures.San Francisco politics is intensely local, and voters are deeply focused on issues that define everyday life: housing costs, public safety, homelessness, and whether the city’s recovery matches its image as a global tech capital.Chakrabarti enters the race with a profile few candidates can match: a builder from Silicon Valley, a strategist who helped shape AOC’s rise, and now a Democrat trying to win on his own name in one of America’s most symbolic Democratic districts.His run will be closely watched by progressives, party insiders, and national observers as the campaign takes shape. It is about what kind of leadership voters want next, and whether the progressive movement’s most influential behind-the-scenes figures can translate their ideas into electoral power.","Chakrabarti is running as a Democrat in California’s 11th Congressional District, which covers San Francisco.

Shaksgam Valley: India bristles over China's fresh claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shaksgam-valley-india-bristles-over-chinas-fresh-claim-dispute-explained/articleshow/126529230.cms,"Why China Building Roads In Shaksgam Valley Is A Direct Strategic Challenge For India In Kashmir

What is the Shaksgam Valley?

What is the dispute about?

Why does Shaksgam Valley matter strategically?

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh



The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth



The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications



Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims



For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?





NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The Shaksgam Valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region. It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.

Pact To Power Bloc: How Turkish Arms, Saudi Money And Pakistan Nukes May Align In Islamic NATO





Islamic Nato in the making? Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, this can be seen as an effort in direction to reshape security alignments in the Middle East region and beyond, as Bloomberg reported.The pact, initially signed by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in September, reportedly states that “any aggression” against one member would be treated as an attack on all -- a provision that mirrors Article 5 of Nato, of which Turkey is a member and fields the second-largest military after the US.Talks on Turkey’s entry are said to be at an advanced stage, with a deal appearing likely, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on condition of anonymity.Bloomberg reported that the expanded alliance reflects growing overlap in the strategic interests of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan across South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa.Turkey also sees the arrangement as a way to strengthen its security and deterrence posture at a time when questions persist over US reliability and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato, despite Washington’s close military ties with all three countries.Saudi Arabia would bring financial strength to the grouping, Pakistan its nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkey contributes military experience and a rapidly expanding defence industry, said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.“As the US prioritizes its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan said.Turkish defence ministry declined to comment on the report. Pakistan’s information ministry did not respond to requests for comment, while Saudi officials were unavailable over the weekend.If Turkey formally joins the pact, it would highlight a new phase in relations with Saudi Arabia, once rivals for leadership of the Sunni Muslim world. After years of strained ties, the two countries are now deepening economic and defence cooperation, including holding their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.Despite shared concerns over Shiite-majority Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia favour engagement with Tehran rather than confrontation. They also back a stable, Sunni-led Syria and support Palestinian statehood.Turkey and Pakistan already enjoy close military ties. Ankara is building corvette warships for Pakistan’s navy, has upgraded Islamabad’s F-16 fighter jets, and shares drone technology with both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Bloomberg previously reported that Turkey now wants both countries to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet programme.The trilateral defence discussions come after a ceasefire between India and Pakistan ended a four-day military clash and high tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Regional tensions remain high, however, with Pakistan and Afghanistan at odds following clashes and accusations by Islamabad that the Taliban is sheltering hostile militant groups.Turkey and Qatar have mediated talks between the sides, though those efforts have so far failed to produce a breakthrough, Bloomberg reported.","Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

‘Not 1, Not 1,000’: Jem Chief Masood Azhar Returns With Audio Threat As India Tightens Terror Noose

Def experts: Azhar’s statement sign of post-Sindoor frustration





A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","New audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar has surfaced on social media.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality





Pakistan on Saturday claimed that Iraq has expressed “keen interest” in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft, following talks between the air chiefs of the two countries.According to a statement issued by the Pakistan Army, air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, chief of air staff of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), met lieutenant general staff pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi, commander of the Iraqi Air Force, during an official visit to Iraq.The discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, including joint training, capacity building and operational coordination.“The Iraqi air chief praised PAF’s professionalism and technological advancement, expressed interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak trainer aircraft,” the statement said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Both sides also agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability between the two air forces.The JF-17 Thunder is a single-engine, lightweight combat aircraft jointly developed by China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.Pakistan has claimed that the aircraft proved its capabilities during last year’s conflict with India, although its effectiveness remains disputed.Pakistan had also deployed Chinese-origin J-10 fighter jets during the May 7–10 hostilities with India.The development comes days after Pakistan and Bangladesh air chiefs held talks on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 jets by Dhaka. However, Bangladesh has not officially confirmed any such plan.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif recently claimed that the country has seen increased interest in its fighter aircraft following the May 2025 standoff with India. Reports have also suggested that Pakistan is exploring similar defence deals with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, amid ongoing financial pressures.Notably, Pakistan has repeatedly relied on International Monetary Fund support in recent years, with the IMF approving a $7 billion bailout in September 2024 and an additional $1.4 billion loan in May 2025.",Iraq has expressed “keen interest’ in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft.

'Cry of a wounded conscience': Hindu man killed in Pakistan; sparks widespread protests in Sindh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/cry-of-a-wounded-conscience-hindu-man-killed-in-pakistan-sparks-widespread-protests-in-sindh/articleshow/126447724.cms,"Hindu Farmer Killing in Sindh Triggers Protests A Day After India Exposed Pak's Record on Minorities





Widespread protests erupted in Pakistan’s Sindh province after a young Hindu farmer was killed by a landlord in Badin.According to a report by Pakistan's news outlet the Nation, Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.Following Kolhi’s death, demonstrators staged sit-ins on the Badin–Hyderabad National Highway and the Badin–Thar Coal Road. Hundreds of vehicles remained stranded for hours as protesters demanded justice for the killing of Kolhi and vowed not to disperse until those responsible are arrested.According to a statement shared by activist Shiva Kachhi, the protest has been ongoing without pause.“The protest for the arrest of the killers of the martyred Kailash Kolhi is making history. Shiva Kachhi, Chairman of Pakistan Darawar Ittehad, is leading the historic protest sit-in. This was not just a protest—it was the cry of a wounded conscience. From 10:00 am yesterday until late into the night, the sit-in continued without pause, proving that the demand for justice cannot be silenced,” Kachhi said in a social media post on X.“Men, women, elderly people, and innocent children stayed on the streets with one voice and one demand: justice for Kailash Kolhi.Arrest the killers. Despite exhaustion, hunger, and the cold of the night, the determination of the protesters remained unshaken. Kailash Kolhi’s only ‘crime’ was that he was poor, marginalised, and courageous enough to exist in a system that protects the powerful and crushes the weak. The tears of his children, the grief of his mother, and the silent agony of his widow are today questioning the entire system: Is the blood of the poor so cheap?” he added.Earlier, the victim’s family and community members staged a protest by placing the body at Piru Lashari Stop, where the SSP Badin assured them that the accused would be arrested within 24 hours.The incident occurred four days ago in Raho Kolhi village in the Piru Lashari city area. Despite assurances from district police officials, the main accused has yet to be arrested.The ongoing protest has drawn participation from leaders and workers of several political, nationalist, religious, and social organisations, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Jiye Sindh Mahaz, Qaumi Awami Tehreek, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (Bashir Qureshi group), and Awami Tehreek, The Nation reported.","Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif in a controversial statement has urged the United States and Turkey to “kidnap” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if they believed in justice and humanity, over the Israel-Gaza conflict.In a televised interview, whose clips have now gone viral on social media, Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away.”He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it.”Describing Netanyahu as the “worst criminal of humanity,” Asif claimed that “no atrocities in history match those committed against Palestinians in Gaza.” He added, “No community has done what Israel has done to Palestinians in the last 4,000-5,000 years. He [Netanyahu] is the biggest criminal of humanity. The world has not seen a bigger criminal.”Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes, beginning a sentence with, “And what does the law say about those who support such criminals…” before the show’s anchor, Hamid Mir, interjected and called for a break.Mir warned that Asif’s remarks risked being interpreted as a veiled reference to US President Donald Trump, and indicated that Asif would not remain on air after the break.Pakistan does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has historically expressed strong support for the Palestinian cause. Islamabad also maintains close ties with Iran, another regional critic of Israeli policies.The international criminal court (ICC) has previously issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu in connection with alleged war crimes in Gaza, a legal development referenced during the interview.","Khawaja Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away” He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it” Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126438854,imgsize-837064,width-400,resizemode-4/khawaja-asif-file.jpg"
Gen Z uprising in Pakistan? PhD student's article challenges those in power — why it was taken down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/gen-z-uprising-in-pakistan-phd-students-article-challenges-those-in-power-why-it-was-taken-down/articleshow/126409692.cms,"Badshahi Mosque, Lahore (AP photo)





Is Pakistan heading towards a Gen Z uprising? A PhD student from the country has sparked a debate after critically examining present-day Pakistan, under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and army chief and de facto power centre Asim Munir , without naming either directly.The piece, written through a lens that shows contrast in powerful boomer generation and youth of Gen Z-Alpha, quickly struck a chord online and became a flashpoint for what many described as a quiet rebellion. It highlighted the widening divide between Pakistan’s ruling establishment, often referred to as “Boomers,” and its increasingly restless Gen Z population.The article, titled “It is over,” was written by US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani and published in Pakistan’s daily The Express Tribune on January 1. It was later taken down, reportedly following pressure from the Pakistani military.“For the older men and women in power, it's over. The young generation isn't buying any of what you're trying to sell to them. No matter how many talks and seminars you arrange in schools and colleges, trying to promote patriotism, it isn't working,” Nizamani wrote.Writing from the perspective of Gen Z and Generation Alpha, Nizamani rejected what he described as an imposed narrative of patriotism pushed by those in power, arguing that such efforts no longer resonate with young Pakistanis.“Young minds, the Gen Z, the alphas, they know exactly what is happening, and despite your consistent efforts of trying to 'sell' your views of patriotism to them, they are seeing right through it. Thanks to the internet, thanks to whatever little education we have left, despite your best efforts of keeping the masses as illiterate as possible, you have failed. You have failed to tell people what to think, they are thinking for themselves. They might be a little too scared to speak their minds because they prefer breathing,” Nizamani wrote.He argued that forced patriotism, speeches and seminars cannot replace justice, opportunity and basic rights, and said young people clearly see corruption, inequality and hypocrisy despite censorship and propaganda.Nizamani also highlighted generational differences over economic freedom, writing, “The Gen Z wants erased restrictions on freelancing, the boomers want to increase regulations on freelancing.”Concluding his article, he wrote: “Boomers, we have had enough. We aren't buying your narrative anymore. It's worn out.”The article drew support from followers of former prime minister Imran Khan, who is currently incarcerated. The Canada wing of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) shared the article on X, highlighting its key points.“Zorain Nizamani's article ‘It is Over’ was removed from eTribune most likely for exposing the reality: DG ISPR's university visits are futile. The youth see through propaganda and are no longer easy to mislead or control,” the PTI Canada wing said.Pakistani activist Mehlaqa Samdani also linked the article’s removal to censorship. “Not surprisingly, this article is no longer accessible through the Express Tribune's digital edition, exactly the kind of censorship Zorain talks about,” she wrote.The episode has intensified online debate over whether Pakistan’s younger generation is moving from quiet disillusionment toward open resistance against an entrenched establishment widely seen as out of touch.","US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani wrote an article on Pakistan's ruling establishment.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality

Pakistan's repeated reliance on IMF

Bangladesh shows interest in Pak's JF-17

Pak seeks JF-17 deal with Saudi Arabia





Pakistan on Tuesday expressed confidence that it may no longer need financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund within six months, with Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif claiming the country had seen a surge in aircraft orders following a four-day military standoff with India in May, Geo TV reported.Speaking on a Geo News programme, Asif made a fanciful claim while arguing that the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict showcased Pakistan's ""resolve and military effectiveness"" to the world.Military tensions escalated in May 2025 after Pakistan-sponsored terrorists carried out a terror attack in Pahalgam, killing 26 civilians in April. India responded with a strong military operation, launching Operation Sindoor, under which it targeted and destroyed multiple terror camps and Pakistani military facilities.However, Khawaja Asif, appearing disconnected from the ground reality, made such statements after a Bangladeshi defence delegation met Pakistan's air chief to discuss a potential sale of the JF-17 Thunder, the multi-role fighter aircraft jointly developed by China and Pakistan.There are also reports of talks between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to convert about $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, according to two Pakistani sources cited by Reuters.According to Arab News, several countries have since stepped up defence engagement with Pakistan.“Right now, the number of orders we are receiving after reaching this point is significant because our aircraft have been tested,” defence minister Asif told Pakistan’s Geo News channel.“We are receiving these orders, and it is possible that after six months we may not even need the IMF,” he said.Pakistan markets the Chinese co-developed JF-17 as a lower-cost multi-role fighter and has positioned itself as a supplier offering aircraft, training and maintenance outside Western supply chains.“I am saying this with full confidence,” Asif said. “If all these orders materialise over the next six months, we will not need the IMF.”Pakistan has repeatedly turned to the International Monetary Fund over the years, for financial support to stabilise its fragile economy, with such assistance tied to strict conditions including fiscal reforms, subsidy cuts and revenue-enhancing measures.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a separate $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at bolstering the country’s economic stability and climate resilience.Demonstrating Dhaka’s efforts to move closer to Islamabad, Bangladesh has expressed “potential interest” in acquiring the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft from Pakistan, along with plans to resume direct flights between the two countries from January 29 after a gap of more than a decade.The JF-17, jointly developed by China and Pakistan, was deployed by Pakistan against India during the May 7–10 hostilities. In November last year, Indian Air Force chief Air chief Marshal A P Singh said the aircraft was among at least five high-tech Pakistani fighters shot down during Operation Sindoor.This latest development and closeness between Pakistan and Bangladesh comes under the pretext of Dhaka's straining relations with India.Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are also in talks to convert around $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, as two Pakistani sources told Reuters, in a move that would deepen military cooperation between two Islamic nations. Pakistan and Saudi signed a mutual defence pact last year.The discussions highlight efforts by the long-time allies to operationalise defence cooperation at a time when Pakistan is under acute financial strain and Saudi Arabia is recalibrating its security partnerships amid uncertainty over US commitments in the Middle East.","Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif says country may not need IMF help in six months.

Pakistan’s Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Tuesday said that nearly 71% of terrorist incidents reported in 2025 originated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). He attributed this concentration to a “politically conducive environment and the flourishing political-criminal-terror-nexus which is flourishing there”.Data released by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) reinforces the scale of the surge. KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025” — a year-on-year increase of more than 40%.The broader national picture is even starker. According to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths. These included 2,115 terrorists, 664 security personnel, 580 civilians and 28 members of pro-government peace committees. PICSS said violence intensified in both “tempo and lethality”, pushing multiple security indicators to their highest levels in years.“Militant attacks climbed to their highest annual total since 2014, and the use of suicide bombings and small drones showed a clear upward trend,” the report said.Suicide attacks rose by 53%, while terrorist incidents overall increased to 1,063 — the highest since 2014.Security forces and civilians also bore rising costs. Security personnel fatalities rose 26% to their highest level since 2011, while civilian deaths increased by 24%, marking the worst toll in a decade. Injuries surged by 53% to 2,263, with sharp rises across all categories.The violence has been most acute in KP and Balochistan. In Bannu alone, Deputy Inspector General Sajjad Khan said 27 police personnel were killed in 134 attacks during 2025. Police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations, arresting 105 militants and killing 65, he said.Pakistan frequently accuses Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities of sheltering the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group blamed for a sharp increase in attacks inside Pakistan since 2021. Afghan officials reject the allegations, insisting they do not permit their territory to be used for attacks against other countries.While the TTP operates independently from Afghanistan’s Taliban, the two groups maintain close ties.Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have deteriorated since October, when border clashes followed explosions in Kabul on Oct. 9 that Afghan officials attributed to Pakistan. Although Qatar later helped mediate a ceasefire, talks hosted by Turkey in November failed to produce a lasting agreement.","KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025’ The broader national picture is even starker. 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126375028,imgsize-1338682,width-400,resizemode-4/photo-credit-ap.jpg"

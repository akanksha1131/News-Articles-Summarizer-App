President Joe Biden on Saturday honoured Pope Francis with the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction, the highest civilian award given by the president, saying the pontiff was ""a light of faith, hope, and love that shines brightly across the world.""Biden had been scheduled to present the medal to the pope in person on Saturday in Rome on what was to be the final overseas trip of his presidency, but Biden cancelled his travel plans so he could monitor the wildfires in California.The White House said Biden bestowed the award to the pope during a phone call in which they also discussed efforts to promote peace and alleviate suffering around the world.It's the only time Biden has presented the honour with distinction during his presidency. Biden himself is a recipient of the award with distinction, recognised when he was vice president by then-President Barack Obama in a surprise ceremony eight years ago. That was the only time in Obama's two terms when he awarded that version of the medal.The citation for the pope says ""his mission of serving the poor has never ceased. A loving pastor, he joyfully answers children's questions about God. A challenging teacher, he commands us to fight for peace and protect the planet. A welcoming leader, he reaches out to different faiths.""Biden is preparing to leave office on January 20 and has doled out honours to prominent individuals, including supporters and allies, in recent weeks.","Biden had been scheduled to present the medal to the pope in person on Saturday in Rome.

BREAKING: President-Elect Trump And Melania Visit Capitol Rotunda Where Jimmy Carter Lies In State

A funeral steeped in fashion, tension, and political drama

Melania Trump has made her return to Washington DC, but it wasn’t just her presence at the funeral of former president Jimmy Carter that caught attention—her outfit became the talk of the town.The 54-year-old former First Lady , joined by her husband, President-elect Donald Trump , was seen attending the National Cathedral service Thursday morning. As the couple sat in the front row, all eyes weren’t just on the ceremonial proceedings, but on Melania’s striking outfit.The ex-beauty queen chose a long-sleeve Valentino black coat dress with an oversized white collar, paired with a dramatic print of a 19th-century neoclassical sculpture of lovers sharing an intimate kiss. While the dress itself was a statement, it quickly became the center of heated discussions on social media.Some took to X (formerly Twitter) to share their harsh opinions. “WTF is Melania wearing? Did the nun store have a sale?” one person posted, comparing her to a “nun.” Another mocked the ensemble, calling it a “pilgrim outfit,” referencing the dress’s exaggerated collar. The critiques only escalated, with one user adding, “Looks like our next four years of ‘What the f--- is Melania wearing?’ starts today.”But the fashion criticisms didn’t end with the former First Lady’s attire. Her reappearance also saw her catch the eye of former Vice President Mike Pence’s wife, Karen Pence, who appeared to avoid any interaction with either Donald or Melania. Mike Pence, however, shook hands with both, despite his recent vocal criticism of Trump in his memoir, So Help Me God.Not just Melania, but the entire event became a spectacle of political tension. As President-elect Trump and Barack Obama were seen chatting amicably, viewers couldn’t help but wonder what was being discussed behind the scenes. But it was Melania’s fashion choice and the stark dynamics between former political allies that kept the audience intrigued.In a moment of unusual tension, Kamala Harris—seated just in front of the Trumps—arrived and deliberately avoided making eye contact with Donald Trump. “Kamala arrived, Trump kept staring at her, she wouldn’t look at him,” one social media user noted.For Trump, the funeral was a chance to pay his respects to Carter, but his usual political posturing continued. Just days before the service, he had taken a swipe at the late president's controversial decision to relinquish control of the Panama Canal to Panama. “Jimmy Carter gave it to them for $1, and they were supposed to treat us well,” Trump had said in a news conference. ""It was the most expensive structure ever built in the history of our country.""While the day was meant to honor a former president, it became a moment filled with political undercurrents and fashion-focused commentary. Melania Trump, typically known for her sharp style, once again found herself at the center of a cultural conversation—this time not for a diplomatic or fashion-forward choice, but for a polarizing outfit that turned heads for all the wrong reasons.",Melania Trump's outfit at Jimmy Carter's funeral became the talk of the town.

US will get first female president in my lifetime, says Lara Trump



Donald Trump's daughter-in-law who played a major role in his re-election and is now readying for a greater role said women should trust the incoming president because Trump cares about women irrespective of their background, and religion and she is an embodiment of Trump's commitment to women's empowerment. In an exclusive interview to New York Post, Eric Trump's wife and former RNC co-chair Lara said Trump helped her to get where she is today. Be it his chief of staff Susie Wiles, press secretary Karoline Leavitt, cabinet picks like Kristi Noem and Linda McMahon, and attorney Alina Habba, Trump surrounds himself with strong women.“I think that’s what people who get to know Donald Trump appreciate: He doesn’t care what you look like, he doesn’t care about your religion, he doesn’t care about your gender, he doesn’t care who you love.""“He cares about whether or not you are going to be able to perform a job to your best ability,” Lara said. “It’s something I appreciate as a woman because I never want someone to give me a job because of my gender.”Lara is not from a business family like the Trumps and she did not even know much about the Trump family before she met Eric as part of her job as a story coordinator and producer for the TV Show “Inside Edition,” where she worked from 2012 to 2016.

'They are merely two nitwit celebrities'

As Meghan Markle and Prince Harry went to the Pasadena Convention Center Friday to meet the victims of the Eaton fire and the first responders in their latest attempt to stand by the people in the moment of distress, social media users asked they behave like royals even after stepping down from royal duties. According to reports, it was not a planned press visit and they wanted to meet the victims without creating any ripple in the media, but videos of their visit are all over social media.One report said they were serving food at the evacuation center anonymously but on Friday they took time to meet those who were affected.Both of them wore hats apparently to keep a low profile -- with their face not fully revealing. Meghan wore baseball hats and Harry chose a black Cali hat. They were seen speaking to the mayor in one video; and to a woman in another video. Meghan was seen teary-eyed hugging a woman in a viral photo.New York Post reported that the Duke and Duchess were focused on supporting and helping both physically and emotionally without causing chaos. The pair began their visit by serving meals alongside volunteers from chef Jose Andrés’ World Central Kitchen (WCK) outside the Convention Center, accompanied by the First Partner of California, Jennifer Siebel Newsom. Meghan and Harry later returned to the Pasadena Convention Center to meet with José Andrés, whose World Central Kitchen has been providing food to fire victims and first responders at pop-up food stations around LA County.Harry-Meghan haters who are not few in numbers on social media asked why they went to the centers behaving like they were still royals. ""Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, always willing to exploit a tragedy to promote themselves. It’s disgusting. And her and Harry’s attempts to still act like royals is appalling. They are merely two nitwit celebrities with a failing brand, and yet the mayor of Pasadena and Gavin Newsom’s wife are with them. Why? They offer nothing. They both need to get it through their thick heads that THEY ARE NOT ROYALS HERE. Just donate, maybe volunteer, but stop acting like you’re anything else. Royals represent their people and government, the cosplay royals represent nothing but their own greed. I’m sure Meghan is also panicking that her show and triumphant return will be wrecked by Mother Nature,"" one post read.Another claimed that Meghan actually got distracted while talking to a fire victim because ""she is looking for her next photo op moment"".Mayor Gordo said Harry and Meghan did not come out for publicity and genuinely came to work.","Meghan Markle and Prince Harry went to the Pasadena Convention Center Friday to meet the victims of the Eaton fire and the first responders.

MENLO PARK (US): Joining companies such as John Deere and Walmart, Facebook and Instagram's parent company Meta Platforms Inc is getting rid of its diversity, equity and inclusion programme that includes hiring, training and picking vendors, a company spokesperson confirmed on Friday. The move, which was first reported by Axios, comes on the heels of the social media giant's decision to end its third-party fact-checking programme and scale back policies on hate speech and abuse.Citing an internal memo sent to employees, Axios said the Menlo Park, California-based tech giant said the US Supreme Court ""has recently made decisions signalling a shift in how courts will approach DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion programmes)... The term DEI' has also become charged, in part because it is understood by some as a practice that suggests preferential treatment of some groups over others.""In practice, this means Meta will no longer have a team focused on diversity and inclusion and the company said it will instead ""focus on how to apply fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all, no matter your background.""The company will also end its ""diverse slate approach"" to hiring, which meant that a diverse pool of candidates was considered for every open position.Other companies that have curbed DEI programmes recently include McDonald's and automaker Ford as well as Walmart and farm equipment maker John Deere.Amazon also said it is halting some of its DEI programmes, although it did not specify which ones. In a Dec 16 memo to employees that Amazon shared on Friday, Candi Castleberry, a senior human resources executive, said the company has been ""winding down outdated programs and materials, and we're aiming to complete that by the end of 2024.""""We also know there will always be individuals or teams who continue to do well-intentioned things that don't align with our company-wide approach, and we might not always see those right away. But we'll keep at it,"" she wrote.Rather than ""have individual groups build programmes,"" she added, Amazon is ""focusing on programs with proven outcomes - and we also aim to foster a more truly inclusive culture.""","Facebook and Instagram's parent company Meta Platforms Inc is getting rid of its diversity, equity and inclusion programme.

Hollywood Sign Under Threat! Sunset Fire Endangers Iconic LA Landmarks | WATCH

Firefighters in Los Angeles are racing to contain wildfires that have devastated the region and displaced thousands as Santa Ana winds, infamous for turning fires into uncontrollable infernos, are expected to return, the National Weather Service warned.According to a report by the Associated Press, crews focused their efforts on the Palisades Fire in Mandeville Canyon, home to Arnold Schwarzenegger and other celebrities where helicopters dropped water to prevent flames from reaching the Getty Museum and UCLA. Ground teams worked tirelessly, using hoses to combat leaping flames on smoke-covered hillsides.County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath described the nights as ""unimaginable terror,"" with many more residents forced to evacuate due to the northeast expansion of the Palisades Fire, reported AP.At a briefing, CalFire Operations Chief Christian Litz said a main focus Saturday was the Palisades Fire burning in the canyon area, not far from the UCLA campus.“We need to be aggressive out there,” Litz said, according to AP.Over 56 square miles have burned, destroying 12,000 structures, including homes, schools, and historic landmarks.Recovery teams are also working to locate victims. Eleven fatalities have been confirmed so far, with cadaver dogs continuing searches in destroyed neighbourhoods. Survivors returned to sift through the ruins of their homes, salvaging keepsakes amidst heartbreak.“We have people driving up and around trying to get in just to look. Stay away,”AP quoted Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna as saying.The crisis has raised questions about leadership and resources. Fire Chief Kristin Crowley criticised city authorities for underfunding firefighting efforts and failing to maintain water supplies for hydrants. Governor Gavin Newsom has ordered an investigation into these failures.Amidst the devastation, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle visited evacuees, distributing food and offering support. Meanwhile, Disney pledged $15 million to assist in recovery efforts.","Over 56 square miles have burned, destroying 12,000 structures, including homes, schools, and historic landmarks.

Biden Administration spurs new battle with rules governing AI's global spread,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-administration-spurs-new-battle-with-rules-governing-ais-global-spread/articleshow/117162194.cms,"An Amazon-owned data center in Ashburn, Va., on March 10, 2024.

WASHINGTON: The next big fight over offshoring is playing out in Washington, and this time it involves artificial intelligence.The Biden administration, in its final days in office, is rushing to issue new regulations to try to ensure that the United States and its close allies have control over how artificial intelligence develops in the years to come.The rules have touched off an intense fight between tech companies and the government, as well as among administration officials.The regulations would dictate where American-made chips that are critical for AI could be shipped. Those rules would then help determine where the data centers that create AI would be built, with a preference for the United States and its allies.The rules would allow most European countries, Japan and other close US allies to make unfettered purchases of AI chips, while blocking two dozen adversaries, including China and Russia, from buying them. More than 100 other countries would face different quotas on the amount of AI chips they could receive from US companies.The regulations would also make it easier for AI chips to be sent to trusted American companies that run data centers, like Google and Microsoft, than to their foreign competitors. The rules would establish security procedures that data centers would have to follow to keep AI systems safe from cybertheft.The Biden administration's plan has prompted swift pushback from American tech companies, which say global regulations could slow their businesses and create costly compliance requirements. Those firms also question whether President Joe Biden should be setting rules with such far-reaching economic consequences in his final days in office.While some of the details remain unclear, the new rules may force tech companies that are pouring tens of billions of dollars into building data centers around the world to rethink some of those locations.Artificial intelligence, which can answer questions, write code and create images, is expected to revolutionize the way countries fight wars, develop medicines and make scientific breakthroughs. Because of its potential power, US officials want AI systems to be built in the United States or in allied countries -- where they will have more say over what the systems do -- rather than in countries that could share that technology with China or act in other ways contrary to US national security.Peter Harrell , a former White House economic official and a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the United States currently had a substantial edge in AI and the leverage to decide which countries could benefit from it.""It's important to think about how we want those transformational developments to be rolled out around the world,"" he said.The rules are largely about national security: Given the way that AI might transform military conflict, the regulations are designed to keep the most powerful technology in the hands of allies and prevent China from getting access to AI chips through international data centers.But US officials say data centers are also important sources of new economic activity for American communities. They want to encourage companies to build as many data centers as possible in the United States rather than in regions such as the Middle East, which is offering money to attract tech firms.Some labor unions have come out in support of the Biden administration's plan. That's because data centers are huge consumers of electricity and steel. Each one creates work for construction companies, electricians and heating, ventilation and air conditioning technicians, as well as workers involved in energy production.""Labor has a huge interest in the future of AI and technology, not only in terms of its application but in terms of the infrastructure that supports it,"" said Michael R. Wessel, an adviser to the United Steelworkers union.But US tech companies and their supporters argue that the rules could hold back technological developments, strain international alliances and motivate countries to buy alternative technologies from China, which is racing to develop its own AI chips.""The risk is that over the long term, countries are going to say, 'We cannot rely on the United States; we cannot be importing our advanced technology from the United States, because there is always this threat that the US government is going to take it away from us,'"" said Geoffrey Gertz, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.California-based Nvidia, which controls 90% of the AI chip market, has lobbied against the rules in meetings with Congress and the White House, as have Microsoft, Oracle and other companies. They worry that the rules could hurt international sales.Ned Finkle, Nvidia's vice president of global affairs, said in a statement that the policy would hurt data centers around the world without improving national security and would ""push the world to alternative technologies.""""We would encourage President Biden to not preempt incoming President Trump by enacting a policy that will only harm the US economy, set America back and play into the hands of US adversaries,"" Finkle added.Tech companies have also tried to blunt the impact by appealing to President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration, which can decide whether to keep or enforce the rules, tech executives and other people familiar with the exchanges said.Microsoft and Oracle declined to comment.Biden officials have also clashed over the regulations. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who is more sympathetic to industry complaints and had concerns about how the Trump administration would carry out the rules, has been at odds with the White House and other agencies, according to three officials and others familiar with the discussions, who declined to be named to discuss private deliberations.Some US allies expressed concerns about the rules, officials said. And in a Dec. 19 letter to the Biden administration, bipartisan lawmakers on the Senate Commerce Committee criticized the restrictions as ""draconian"" and said they would ""severely hinder the sale of US technology abroad.""After the White House decided to move forward, the Commerce Department pushed for additional changes to the rule, including increasing the number of chips that can be sold without a license and delaying the rule's start for 120 days to allow the Trump administration to potentially make changes, two officials said.It is unclear what Trump would do, although he has recently expressed support for having data centers built in the United States. His advisers include some China skeptics who are likely to favor tougher restrictions. Others, including the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, have business ties to countries in the Middle East that are likely to oppose any restrictions.The new rules build on export controls that the Biden administration has put in place in recent years to ban shipments of advanced AI chips to China and other adversarial countries and to require special licenses to send AI chips to countries, including in the Middle East.Those controls have allowed the United States to exert some global influence. To gain access to Nvidia chips last year, G42, a leading AI firm in the United Arab Emirates, promised to relinquish its use of technology made by Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications firm under US sanctions.But US concerns have grown that Chinese companies are getting critical technology by smuggling in chips or through remote access to data centers in other countries.Companies have also faced long waits to obtain licenses for even small numbers of chips, and foreign officials have appealed directly to the Biden administration to try to obtain them. So officials began working last year on a more transparent distribution system.Tech companies say the requirements could make data centers too expensive for some nations, preventing some from using AI to benefit their health care, transportation and hospitality industries. Among the countries that would face caps and other restrictions are traditional US allies including Israel and Mexico.""We can all agree that none of these workloads or uses of AI technology and the GPUs they rely on constitute national security concerns,"" said Ken Glueck, Oracle's executive vice president, in a company blog post referring to graphic processing units, or AI chips.Nvidia and other tech companies have also argued that the rules could backfire by driving buyers in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and elsewhere to Chinese companies like Huawei.Some US officials disagree. One analysis that US officials put together, including for consultations with private industry, argued that Chinese chipmakers faced significant hurdles and would not be able to export enough chips to train cutting-edge AI models. The analysis was viewed by The New York Times.""Huawei is struggling to make enough advanced chips to train AI models within China, much less export chips,"" said Matt Pottinger, a former deputy national security adviser to Trump and CEO of Garnaut Global, a China-focused research firm.","The Biden administration is rushing to issue new regulations on artificial intelligence. The regulations would dictate where American-made chips that are critical for AI could be shipped. The rules would allow most European countries, Japan and other close US allies to make unfettered purchases.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117162257,imgsize-1700830,width-400,resizemode-4/117162257.jpg"

The mammoth Palisades fire was roaring closer to residential areas of Los Angeles early Saturday, forcing a new round of evacuation orders and dimming hopes that a brief drop in wind speeds would help firefighters tame Southern California's devastating blazes.The desert winds that have stoked the fires were expected to pick up again Saturday afternoon. But even without high winds, the most destructive wildfires in Los Angeles' history expanded overnight across the region's bone-dry terrain.The Palisades fire, the largest of them, tore east, chewing up parched vegetation as it raced up the ridges of Mandeville Canyon. Authorities issued mandatory evacuation orders for an area including parts of the Brentwood and Encino neighborhoods, as well as the Getty Center, one of Southern California's cultural jewels.The blaze, which has burned through 21,600 acres and razed stretches between Santa Monica and Malibu since it broke out Tuesday, was only 8% contained, according to Cal Fire. To the east, firefighters had contained 3% of the 14,000-acre Eaton fire, near Altadena and Pasadena. The blazes, which have killed at least 11 people and destroyed thousands of structures, now rank among the five most damaging in California's history.With many people still unaccounted for, officials have said the death toll could rise.Los Angeles announced a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. for areas under mandatory evacuation orders. National Guard units have been deployed to secure evacuation zones.Here's what we're covering:--After reports emerged that a critical reservoir was offline when the fires started, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he was ordering an independent review to determine why firefighters ran out of water early on, calling the situation ""deeply troubling.""--Those who have died include a man in his 60s who lived in his childhood home and drove a bloodmobile; a retired aerospace engineer and an active church deacon; and a retired pharmacy technician whom neighbors called ""an angel.""--The combined area burned by this past week's fires is larger than the city limits of San Francisco, Pittsburgh, Boston or Miami. As of Saturday morning, more than 100,000 people were under evacuation orders, and some 160,000 electricity customers were without power.--Los Angeles County emergency management officials said that an erroneous evacuation alert that was transmitted this past week went out to nearly 10 million residents, or roughly the county's entire population. The fires' effects on cellphone towers could have caused the problem, the officials said, calling the error a ""serious breach of public trust.""--It is not clear what ignited the fires, and investigators will most likely take months to come to any firm conclusions. But power lines near the Eaton and Palisades fires were on when those blazes erupted Tuesday. Energy experts said that was concerning because electrical equipment has often ignited infernos during periods of high wind in California and elsewhere.","The Palisades fire, the largest of them, tore east, chewing up parched vegetation as it raced up the ridges of Mandeville Canyon.

An important reservoir was offline when California fires began,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/an-important-reservoir-was-offline-when-california-fires-began/articleshow/117161907.cms,"Firefighters battle a blaze in a residential neighborhood during the Eaton fire in Altadena, California, Jan. 8, 2025. (The New York Times)

An important reservoir that helps supply water in Pacific Palisades was offline at the time the fires began, officials said Friday, and that shutdown may have contributed to firefighters losing water so early in their fight against the blaze.The Santa Ynez Reservoir sits within the Palisades and can hold millions of gallons of water. Records show it was recently set to undergo maintenance to the reservoir's cover.Ellen Cheng, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , said in a statement Friday that the reservoir had been offline when the fires began.""We are still evaluating what role Santa Ynez being offline would have had on this situation,"" she said.Water for the Pacific Palisades is fed by a 36-inch line that flows by gravity from the larger Stone Canyon Reservoir, said Marty Adams, a former general manager and chief engineer at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. That water line also fills the Santa Ynez Reservoir.Water from the two reservoirs then sustain the water system for the Pacific Palisades and also pump systems that fill storage tanks that feed higher-elevation homes in the neighborhood. It was unclear whether officials could have brought the reservoir back online before the fire, after forecasters began warning of dangerous wildfire conditions.Officials have said that storage tanks in the Pacific Palisades area, each holding about 1 million gallons, were filled before the fire but then depleted as so many firefighters tapped into the system at once. The system struggled to refill the tanks in part because so much water was being pulled from the main water line before it could get to the pumps that feed the higher tanks.Adams said an operational reservoir would have been helpful initially to more fully feed the water system in the area. But he also said it appeared that that reservoir and the tanks would have eventually been drained in a fire that was consuming so many homes at once. Municipal water systems are generally designed to sustain water loads for much smaller fires than what consumed Pacific Palisades.Years ago, crews had installed a cover on the Santa Ynez Reservoir. Adams said he heard that the cover had been damaged, and contracting documents from November showed that a company was hired to repair the cover.Adams said repairs and maintenance for such systems would be normal, as would taking the reservoirs offline. Under normal circumstances, the water system in the area would have continued functioning just fine.Janisse Quiñones, CEO and chief engineer at the city's water department, has said that firefighting operation put immense strain on the system, with four times the normal demand over a 15-hour period.Traci Park, the Los Angeles City Council member whose district includes Pacific Palisades, had not been made aware that the reservoir was offline, a spokesperson said Friday.The spokesperson, Pete Brown, said Park and her team had many questions about the water systems and the Santa Ynez Reservoir, and would be seeking more answers about whether it should have been out of commission.",The Santa Ynez Reservoir sits within the Palisades and can hold millions of gallons of water.

In a clip shared by Mediaite, Harris turned around at one point and saw Obama and Trump chatting cordially, before quickly facing forward again, looking visibly unimpressed.

Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently in Adiala Jail , demanded a transparent investigation and the establishment of a judicial commission to examine violence on November 26 and May 9. He communicated this demand to lawyers and media during a meeting at the jail.Regarding ongoing negotiations in the country, Khan expressed skepticism, stating, ""The government's non-serious attitude towards negotiations is evident from the fact that I haven't even been allowed to meet with my negotiation committee yet. It seems like the purpose of negotiations is merely to waste time so that public reaction over the November 26th Islamabad massacre starts to fade.""Khan called for an impartial judicial commission to investigate the incidents, particularly the November 26 event. ""Peaceful citizens were massacred on November 26th; they were directly shot at, and D-Chowk was drenched in their blood. Many of our people are still missing. In any civilized society, those responsible for such shootings would have been held accountable, but this government has not even managed to form a judicial commission yet. A judicial commission acts as a (neutral) third umpire. Only an impartial commission can provide justice to the martyrs of November 26th (2024) and May 9th (2023). If this massacre is swept under the rug, no one’s life or property in Pakistan will be safe,"" he said.He also alleged mistreatment of PTI members in custody and called for these claims to be raised internationally. ""While in military custody, our innocent people were subjected to severe mental and physical torture. According to my information, three young men attempted suicide during custody. Sami Wazir’s condition is a stark testament to this brutality. What happened to PTI leaders like Shahbaz Gill and Azam Swati is no secret. Zille Shah was brutally murdered, and Intezar Panjutha was treated worse than animals. What kind of justice is this? Those who leave PTI are absolved of any charges related to May 9th, while those who refuse are subjected to all kinds of torture and pressure,"" Khan stated.Further threatening to take the alleges injustice to global forums, the ex-Pakistan PM added, ""We haven't obtained justice despite repeatedly appealing to Pakistan’s judicial system, leaving us with no choice but to raise our voice on international forums. Pakistan’s government is bound by international laws and treaties regarding human rights. I have instructed our lawyers to take these matters to global forums and draw the world’s attention to the ongoing human rights violations in Pakistan.""In connection to the May 9 case, Imran Khan has approached the Lahore High Court for bail, according to ARY News. The case is centred around severe unrest across Pakistan following Imran Khan's arrest on May 9, 2023. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters demonstrated their outrage through widespread protests in both rural and urban areas, prompting authorities to deploy military forces in Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad to maintain security. During these demonstrations, PTI supporters targeted military facilities, including an assault on the Corps Commander's residence in Lahore. Subsequently, Imran Khan was named as the primary accused in the legal proceedings. The November 26 protests were also centred on similar demands with PTI members demanding release of their leader.Khan also addressed the people of Pakistan saying, ""My message to overseas Pakistanis is that democracy and human rights have been obliterated in Pakistan, to be replaced by the law of the jungle. Your boycott of foreign currency remittances is critical. Your loved ones in Pakistan deserve the same rights that you enjoy abroad.""Khan also talked about the fake allegations and cases against him while putting forward the demand for transparent investigation and justice. ""Our government was falsely accused of resettling the Taliban. Terrorism did not resurface during our tenure, and even a year after it ended. The same people who are responsible for conditions in Balochistan are also responsible for the current chaos,"" he said adding, "" No leader in Pakistan’s history has ever faced 280 cases. This kind of treatment was only meted out to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during General Yahya's rule, and now it is being done to me.""Additionally, citing a World Bank report, Khan expressed concern about rising poverty and the impact of political instability on the economy. ""according to a recent World Bank report, an additional 13 million people have fallen below the poverty line. Every institution, including the judiciary, NAB, FIA, and police, have been tasked to work against PTI, causing political and economic systems to collapse and instability to reach its peak. Economic growth will remain zero as long as political instability persists. All of this is being done to bolster the plan for a decade-long dictatorship. Anyone who supports this lawlessness can have their corruption of billions pardoned.""According to PTI, Khan has been imprisoned for over 520 days.",Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan is currently in Adiala Jail.

ISLAMABAD: State-run Pakistan International Airlines resumed direct flights to Europe on Friday following a decision by the European Union's aviation safety agency to lift a four-year ban over safety standards, officials said.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the resumption, saying it would help improve the airline's image.The flight from Islamabad to Paris was fully booked with more than 300 passengers, the airline said.Defense Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif inaugurated the twice-a-week flights and vowed that PIA will expand its operations to other European countries soon.Asif said in a speech that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency had imposed the ban on PIA's operations to Europe because of an ""irresponsible statement"" by a former aviation minister.The curb on PIA was imposed in 2020 after 97 people died when a PIA plane crashed in Karachi in southern Pakistan. Then-Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said an investigation into the crash found that nearly a third of Pakistani pilots had cheated on their pilot's exams. A government probe later concluded that the crash was caused by pilot error.The ban caused a loss of nearly $150 million a year in revenue for PIA, officials say.Also Friday, the first international flight from Gwadar, a new airport in southwestern Pakistan, departed for Muscat, government officials said. The Chinese-funded airport was inaugurated by Chinese Premier Li Qiang in October.The airport, Pakistan's largest, is located in restive southwestern Balochistan province and is part of a massive investment by Beijing that links a deep seaport and airport on the Arabian Sea by road with China.","The flight from Islamabad to Paris was fully booked with more than 300 passengers, the airline said.

"Paris, we are coming today: Twitter erupts over post by Pakistan International Airlines (PIA)",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-airlines-twitter-pia-paris-9-11/articleshow/117118737.cms,"Pakistan International Airlines' Greatest Hits



Standing Passenger Incident: Allegedly allowing an overbooked passenger to fly standing in the aisle because no seats were available. The Goat Sacrifice: A ground crew sacrificed a black goat at Islamabad Airport for good luck, sparking global ridicule. The Forgotten Passenger: Leaving a passenger stranded at a layover airport while the flight took off without them. Paris, We’re Coming: The now-infamous image of a plane seemingly diving into the Eiffel Tower, proving that PIA’s marketing gaffes remain undefeated.

There are airlines that symbolize innovation, and then there’s Pakistan International Airlines (PIA)—an entity so hilariously unpredictable that it’s essentially become the aviation world’s sitcom. From passengers reportedly standing in the aisles on overbooked flights to sacrificing goats for “divine intervention,” PIA has firmly cemented its status as the king of chaotic headlines.This time, PIA has outdone itself. An ostensibly official post from the airline’s X handle (formerly Twitter) sent shockwaves through the internet, especially curious since X has been largely restricted in Pakistan. The tweet featured an image of a PIA aircraft seemingly nosediving into the Eiffel Tower, accompanied by the caption: “Paris, we are coming today.” The unfortunate imagery immediately drew parallels to an old PIA ad that showed the shadow of a plane ominously cast over the Twin Towers.The internet, as expected, went into overdrive. User @zain175 sarcastically remarked, “First, they wanted to shadow skyscrapers, now they’re going straight for landmarks. Bold marketing strategy!” Meanwhile, @dexter7695 shared the image with the caption, “PIA: where every flight feels like an episode of ‘Final Destination.’” Another user, @sanjeevsanyal, joked, “This marketing strategy is so bad, it might actually be genius.”The tweet also reignited memories of PIA’s greatest hits. @muzairb quipped, “First it was goats, now it’s global landmarks. PIA never disappoints.” @cruindggn added, “At this point, PIA should just rename their airline to ‘Oops Air’ and own it.” User @saikirankannan chimed in with, “Next stop: the Leaning Tower of Pisa. ‘We’re just helping it lean a little more.’”Others couldn’t help but connect the mishap to Pakistan’s controversial ties to 9/11 and Al-Qaeda. While none of the 9/11 hijackers were Pakistani, the eventual discovery of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad cast a shadow over the country’s global reputation. In fact, there's a long-standing joke where former Pak premier Pervez Musharraf calls up George W Bush to offer his condolences but ends up accidentally calling before the incident.The tweet unwittingly touched a nerve, blending dark humor with unfortunate timing, leading many to wonder who approved such an image for a public-facing platform.PIA’s PR misstep is just another in a long line of its infamous blunders, but it has, once again, captured the internet’s imagination for all the wrong reasons.Love it or hate it, PIA always keeps us entertained—whether it’s on the tarmac, in the skies, or on social media.","Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) posted an image of a plane seemingly nosediving into the Eiffel Tower with the caption: ""Paris, we are coming today"" The image drew parallels to an old PIA ad that showed a plane ominously cast over the Twin Towers.

KARACHI: Armed militants stormed a police checkpost in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province and also set fire to machinery and equipment of a cement factory in the vicinity before escaping from the scene, authorities said. The incident took place on Thursday in Mastung town.A police official confirmed that the attack took place at a time when the security personnel were changing at the checkpost and the armed militants snatched guns, ammunition, wireless sets and motorcycles before putting equipment in the cement factory on fire.The armed militants had escaped well before security personnel reached the scene.However, there were no casualties in the attack, sources said.He said on Thursday armed militants suspected of being members of outlawed separatist groups had also carried out a similar operation in Khuzdar which is located in a remote area of the Balochistan province.He said according to reports the separatists had robbed a bank and burnt a police station before escaping from there.Security and political think tank groups say that since last year the separatist groups operating in the province have become increasingly bold and stepped up their terror attacks on security forces, installations and civilians working in Balochistan from other provinces.""Balochistan is a very big province in terms of land and most of this land is in rough mountainous terrains and in remote areas and it becomes easier for these militants to carry out their attacks,"" one security analyst said.Balochistan, bordering Iran and Afghanistan, is home to a long-running violent insurgency.

Armed outlaws in Pakistan's Punjab province kidnapped three Hindus and issued an ultimatum, demanding the release of their accomplices from police custody.The incident took place in the Bhong area of Rahim Yar Khan district, around 400 kilometers southwest of Lahore, on Wednesday.The victims, identified as Shaman, Shameer, and Sajan, were near the Chowk Sawetra Basic Health Unit (BHU) in Bhong when five armed dacoits abducted them at gunpoint and took them to the Katcha riverine area, a region notorious for criminal activity.In a video released later by the outlaws’ ringleader Ashiq Korai, the gang threatened Ahmedpur Lama police station officer Rana Ramzan, warning that if Korai’s 10 family members were not freed, the kidnapped youths would be killed.The gang also threatened to attack the police. The video showed the abducted Hindus in chains, pleading for their release.The incident shows the ongoing lawlessness in the Katcha area, a riverine belt spanning parts of southern Punjab and Sindh provinces. Despite multiple operations, authorities have struggled to curb the power of these criminal gangs, who frequently engage in kidnappings for ransom and target minority Hindu communities to pressure authorities into compliance.Last year, the region witnessed a deadly attack on police, with 12 officers killed and seven injured when dacoits ambushed two police vehicles in the same district.","Armed outlaws in Pakistan's Punjab province kidnapped three Hindus and issued an ultimatum, demanding the release of their accomplices from police custody.

BALOCHISTAN: Two young men have reportedly been forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces in Balochistan's Dera Bugti district, according to a report by the Balochistan Post.The victims, identified as Ashref, the son of Bhora Khan Bugti, and Pato Khan, the son of Siraj Bugti, were allegedly detained by Frontier Corps (FC) personnel. As of now, their whereabouts remain unknown, the Balochistan Post reported.Enforced disappearances have been a persistent issue in Balochistan, with human rights groups accusing Pakistan's security forces and intelligence agencies of being complicit in the practice. Activists argue that such abductions, often without due process or legal justification, target civilians and exacerbate fear in the region.The case of Ashref and Pato Khan is part of a broader pattern of disappearances in the area. According to the Balochistan Post, in December alone, eight individuals were reported missing in Dera Bugti, underscoring the continued prevalence of this issue in the province.Families of the disappeared often face considerable difficulties in seeking justice or information about their loved ones. Despite growing international criticism, the practice remains widespread, fuelling tensions in the volatile region.Recently, Pakistan's security forces have reportedly abducted four individuals in the Kech district of Balochistan, with their families still unaware of their whereabouts, according to the Balochistan Post.The victims have been identified as Ramzan Baloch, Shagarullah, Sher Jan Ishaq, and Farooq Ishaq. Ramzan Baloch, an employee of the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), was taken into custody on Monday at 7 pm (local time) in the town of Mand. The fate of the abducted individuals remains unclear, and their families are left in distress, unable to obtain any information on their detention or location.The ongoing enforced disappearances in Balochistan highlight a grave human rights crisis, with victims' families facing uncertainty and fear, while the international community calls for accountability and an end to such abuses.","Two young men have reportedly been forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces in Balochistan's Dera Bugti district.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday announced that the federal government has decided to cut the number of affiliated agencies by half, abolishing 1,50,000 jobs, as part of a sweeping cost-cutting and efficiency drive.""We are reducing the federal government's size step by step. So far, 80 departments have been consolidated into 40,"" Aurangzeb said at a press conference where he highlighted the government's goal to complete these reforms by June 2025.He added that 60% of vacant positions have been abolished, which comes to 150,000 government jobs.He said that right-sizing was part of the restructuring initiative launched in mid-2024 by a committee formed under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to rationalise expenditures and improve performance.According to the minister, the committee was to look into 43 ministries and their subordinate agencies. He said that the federal government's annual expenditure on these departments was Rs900 billion.He said that the six ministries that the government had initially selected for right-sizing included Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan, States and Frontier Regions (SAFRON), IT and Telecom, Industries and Reproduction, National Health Services and Capital Development Authority (CAD).He said that the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON are being merged and CAD is being abolished.According to the minister, in the second phase, out of the 60 subordinate institutions of the Ministry of Science and Technology, Commerce Division, Housing and Works, and National Food Security Research, 25 institutions will be abolished, 20 will be reduced in size and nine will be merged.""We took four ministries in the second phase and after that, we have now taken five more ministries,"" he said, adding that those selected for the third phase were ministries of federal education and professional training, information and broadcasting, power division, finance division, and national heritage and culture.He said that work had been done over the past several years to reduce the size of the federal government, but ""the problem was that if you wanted to do everything possible at once, it couldn't be done, so we decided to do it gradually, in stages.""The minister said the federal government also plans to transfer hospitals to provincial administrations. ""This is not just about cutting costs; it's about improving efficiency,"" he said.Aurangzeb also said that the plan was to shift Pakistan's economic framework towards export-driven growth, supported by digitalisation and technology initiatives and the prime minister is expected to inaugurate a new technology-related program in Karachi soon.He said that the government's focus on macroeconomic stability helped the key indicators to improve and Pakistan was standing at a promising economic juncture due to various government efforts.The size of the Pakistani government came into the crosshairs after the sharp increase in expenditures and questions were being raised over it.The current government has been taking steps and reducing the size and expenses. It abolished the traditional pension system for government employees last year and reduced the pension benefits for the current employees.","Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb announced that the federal government has decided to cut the number of affiliated agencies by half. 60% of vacant positions have been abolished, which comes to 150,000 government jobs.

DHAKA: Bangladesh's interim government has once again attempted to downplay the attacks on minority communities, particularly Hindus, by framing them as ""politically motivated"" rather than communally driven. Despite widespread evidence to the contrary, officials insist that the majority of these incidents are rooted in political agendas, not religious intolerance.According to a police report released on Saturday, 115 cases related to complaints of communal attacks have been registered since August 2024, in which at least 100 people have been arrested.The Bangladesh Hindu Buddha Christian Unity Council claimed that 1,769 ""communal attacks"" and ""acts of vandalism"" took place against minorities in the Muslim-dominated nation. The attacks, vandalism and looting included 2,010 incidents on the lives, properties, and places of worship of the minority communities, it said.The police investigation, however, has revealed that 1,234 incidents were ""political in nature"" and only 20 were communal, said the chief adviser Muhammad Yunus's press wing officials who shared the police report. At least 161 claims were found to be false or untrue, said the report.In a bid to alley fear among the minorities the government reiterated its zero-tolerance policy towards any communal attacks in the country, stressing police have been ordered to arrest the culprits.The government has also announced that it will compensate the victims.","Bangladesh's interim government has attempted to downplay the attacks on minority communities.

Majority of the attacks on minorities in Bangladesh that took place since Sheikh Hasina's ouster were 'not communally motivated -- rather, they were political in nature', according to a police report.This came after the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council reported that minorities in Bangladesh faced 1,769 incidents of communal violence and vandalism, the Daily Star reported.Of these reported incidents of communal violence against minorities in Bangladesh since August 4, 2024, police have registered 62 cases and arrested at least 35 individuals based on investigation findings, according to the report.The police report indicated that most attacks on minorities in Bangladesh were politically driven rather than communally motivated, with investigations confirming 1,234 incidents as political and only 20 as communal. Moreover, the report said that at least 161 claims of attacks were false, while the Council reported that 1,452 incidents—82.8% of the total—occurred on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina was ousted from power, the daily star reported.The report said that 53 cases has been filed and 65 arrests have been made.

Pakistan said on Saturday that the Afghan Taliban government did not attend a global summit on girls' education in the Muslim world organised in Islamabad.""We had extended an invitation to Afghanistan but no-one from the Afghan government was at the conference,"" education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui told news agency AFP.""Nevertheless, representatives from various organisations dedicated to girls' education in Afghanistan will be participating in the event,"" he said.The Taliban have deliberately deprived 1.4 million Afghan girls of schooling through bans, a UN agency said last year. Afghanistan is the only country in the world with bans on female secondary and higher education.The Taliban, who took power in 2021, barred education for girls above sixth grade because they said it didn't comply with their interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law. They didn't stop it for boys and show no sign of taking the steps needed to reopen classrooms and campuses for girls and women.Unesco said at least 1.4 million girls have been deliberately denied access to secondary education since the takeover, an increase of 300,000 since its previous count in April 2023, with more girls reaching the age limit of 12 every year.The UN agency warned that authorities have ""almost wiped out"" two decades of steady progress for education in Afghanistan. "" The future of an entire generation is now in jeopardy,"" it added. It said Afghanistan had 5.7 million girls and boys in primary school in 2022, compared with 6.8 million in 2019.The enrollment drop was the result of the Taliban decision to bar female teachers from teaching boys, Unesco said, but could also be explained by a lack of parental incentive to send their children to school in an increasingly tough economic environment.Meanwhile, Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Malala Yousafzai also attended the Pakistan-organised event. Malala was nearly killed by militants as a schoolgirl.Yousafzai was evacuated from the country in 2012 after being shot by the Pakistan Taliban, who were enraged by her activism, and she has returned to the country only a handful of times since.","Afghanistan is the only country in the world with bans on female secondary and higher education.

'Visa extension' irrelevant once passport scrapped: Bangladesh on Hasina,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/visa-extension-irrelevant-once-passport-scrapped-bangladesh-on-hasina/articleshow/117101547.cms,"Sheikh Hasina

DHAKA: Referring to reports of India extending the visa of deposed PM Sheikh Hasina , the Bangladesh interim govt on Thursday clarified that visa-related matters become irrelevant once a passport has been cancelled. She had escaped to India in Aug last year after mass protests against her led to the fall of the Awami League govt. It appears she is in India on a residence permit, which is different from a visa.Earlier, the Bangladesh govt had revoked the passports of 97 people, including Hasina, citing their alleged involvement in ""enforced disappearances"" and killings during the protests. ""I'll provide a general answer: if a passport is cancelled, the issue of a visa no longer exists,"" foreign affairs ministry spokesperson Mohammad Rafiqul Alam told reporters.He said information regarding passport cancellations is communicated to Bangladesh missions abroad to ensure that countries with diplomatic ties to Bangladesh are aware of such actions. Asked about reports of visa extension , foreign adviser Md Touhid Hossain said, ""Like you, I also learned about this through the newspaper. What can we do?"" He added that India is yet to respond to request for Hasina's extradition.","She had escaped to India in Aug last year after mass protests against her led to the fall of the Awami League govt.

Sheikh Hasina's extradition unrelated to reported extension of her Indian visa: Bangladesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sheikh-hasinas-extradition-unrelated-to-reported-extension-of-her-indian-visa-bangladesh/articleshow/117092382.cms,"DHAKA: Bangladesh's interim government led by Muhammad Yunus on Thursday said deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina's reported extension of visa was unrelated to Dhaka's request for her extradition to stand trial. ""We have requested India to return Sheikh Hasina as a Bangladeshi citizen. Her status in India has no relevance to this request. It is not a matter of our consideration,"" a foreign office spokesman told journalists in a weekly media briefing.Hasina, 77, has been living in India since August 5 last year when she fled Bangladesh following a massive student-led protest that toppled her Awami League's (AL) 16-year regime.Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has issued arrest warrants for Hasina and several former Cabinet ministers, advisers, and military and civil officials for ""crimes against humanity and genocide"".The interim government on Tuesday said it has revoked the passports of Hasina and 96 others over their alleged involvement in enforced disappearances and the July killings.On Thursday, spokesman Rafiqul Alam added that Dhaka did not ""have additional information, so we will not speculate"" as he was asked for comments about the media reports that New Delhi recently extended Hasina's visa while Bangladesh revoked her diplomatic passport.But he said when a Bangladeshi citizen's passport is scrapped, the country concerned is informed through Bangladesh's missions and in such cases, a visa is no longer required.Bangladesh last month officially sought Hasina's repatriation to stand trial on charges of mass killings during the Anti-Discrimination Student's Movement dubbed as July-August uprising that toppled her Awami League government on August 5. Hasina secretly left for India the same day.Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal, originally formed to try the hardened collaborators of atrocities of Pakistani troops during its 1971 Liberation War, so far has issued two arrest warrants ordering authorities to arrest her and ensure her court appearance by February 12 as she was also accused of enforced disappearances during the past 16-year rule.New Delhi acknowledged the receipt of the extradition request but made no response to the letter.Asked how long India could delay responding to Bangladesh's note verbal and the diplomatic process involved, the spokesman said, ""There is no black-and-white answer to this.""""We will wait for India's response,"" he said.","Sheikh Hasina, 77, has been living in India since August 5 last year.

Fight For The Skies: Israel Scrambles Response As Iran Rains Fire Amid Airspace Showdown | Watch





Exiled Iranian royal Reza Pahlavi, son of the last Shah of Iran, issued a dramatic call to action on Tuesday, urging Iran’s military, police, and state employees to join a nationwide uprising against the Khamenei-led Islamic Republic, declaring that its ""fall has begun. ""In a sweeping address to the Iranian people, Pahlavi wrote on X, ""The Islamic Republic has reached its end and is in the process of collapsing. Khamenei, like a frightened rat, has gone into hiding underground and has lost control of the situation. What has begun is irreversible.""He expressed solidarity with those affected by the country’s turmoil and reiterated his long-standing opposition to war. ""In these difficult days, my heart is with all the defenceless citizens who have been harmed and have fallen victim to Khamenei's warmongering and delusions.""Calling the current moment a “sharp turn in history,” Pahlavi asserted, ""The regime’s apparatus of repression is falling apart. All it takes now is a nationwide uprising to put an end to this nightmare once and for all.""Encouraging people across Iranian cities—from Bandar Abbas to Mashhad—to take to the streets, he sought to calm fears of chaos post-regime: ""Do not fear the day after the fall of the Islamic Republic.Iran will not descend into civil war or instability.""He said preparations were already in place: ""We have a plan for Iran’s future and its flourishing. We are prepared for the first hundred days after the fall, for the transitional period, and for the establishment of a national and democratic government—by the Iranian people and for the Iranian people.""To members of Iran’s state apparatus, Pahlavi appealed directly: ""Do not stand against the Iranian people for the sake of a regime whose fall has begun and is inevitable. By standing with the people, you can save your lives.""His call came a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced strong support for regime change in Iran during an interview with the opposition-linked Iran International news outlet, saying, ""The regime’s days are numbered… I know that Iran can be great again. It was a great civilization, and this theological thuggery that has kidnapped your country will not stand for long, and you are the future, not them. ""Netanyahu added: ""A light has been lit—carry it to freedom. Your hour of freedom is near; it’s happening now.""Highlighting what he described as widespread dissent, Netanyahu said, ""These dictators in Iran, sure they fear us—but they fear you, the people of Iran, even more. They understand that 80 percent of Iranians despise them.""In a separate interview with Fox News, the Israeli leader indicated that ongoing pressure on Tehran could lead to a change in regime: ""Regime change could certainly be the result.""Citing ancient ties between the Iranian and Jewish people, Netanyahu said, ""The Persian people and the Jewish people have had an ancient friendship that goes back to the times of Cyrus the Great; that could happen again."" He emphasised, however, that the final decision rests with Iranians: ""The decision to act, to rise up, at this time is the decision of the Iranian people.""Israeli PM also confirmed that Israel’s recent strikes, dubbed ""Operation Rising Lion"", were launched based on intelligence that Tehran had stockpiled enough enriched uranium to build nine nuclear bombs.","Exiled Iranian royal Reza Pahlavi, son of the last Shah of Iran, issued a dramatic call to action on Tuesday.

Kristi Noem hospitalised: US homeland security secretary admitted for treatment; DHS cites allergic reaction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kristi-noem-hospitalised-us-homeland-security-secretary-admitted-for-treatment-dhs-cites-allergic-reaction/articleshow/121920629.cms,"Kristi Noem admitted to hospital





US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was taken to a hospital in Washington, DC, on Tuesday after suffering an allergic reaction, according to officials from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).The 53-year-old cabinet member was transported by ambulance out of precaution and is now alert and recovering, a DHS spokesperson confirmed. “Secretary Noem had an allergic reaction today. She was transported to the hospital out of an abundance of caution. She is alert and recovering,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.Noem was admitted to the emergency room, where CNN reporters observed several Secret Service agents positioned at multiple entrances.Appointed to lead the department shortly after Donald Trump secured a second presidential term, Noem was confirmed by the Senate in late January. Her appointment followed a career as South Dakota’s governor and representative in Congress.Since taking over the DHS, she has become a key figure in enforcing Trump’s renewed focus on strict immigration controls. Under her leadership, the department has overseen troop deployments to the southern border and the use of emergency powers to facilitate mass deportations of undocumented migrants.In addition to overseeing immigration enforcement, Noem also manages the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), though she has recently called for the agency to be dismantled. She has repeatedly criticised FEMA as ineffective and unnecessary. Last week, Trump also stated his intention to phase out FEMA following the end of this year’s hurricane season.As news of her hospitalisation spread, messages of support poured in online.Bruce LeVell, former Executive Director of President Trump’s National Diversity Coalition, posted on X, “My dear friend @Sec_Noem, our fearless Secretary of Homeland Security, was just rushed to the hospital. My heart is with her during this challenging time, but I know her strength and determination will shine through. Please join me in keeping Kristi in your prayers for a swift and full recovery.“She has been tirelessly spearheading @realDonaldTrump initiative to uphold law and order and utilise ICE to keep our country safe from criminals. Let’s stand strong for her, just as she’s stood strong for America.”Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk also called on supporters to “Pray for Kristi”.","US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was taken to a hospital in Washington, DC, on Tuesday after suffering an allergic reaction.

O'Keefe was beaten and then left outside the home, not hit by car







After deliberating since June 13, the jury Wednesday pronounced the verdict in the Karen Read case and found her not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend John O'Keefe but guilty of a lesser charge of drunken driving. Read's lawyers have been claiming for long that she was framed by the police after she dropped O'Keefe off at a party at the resident of a fellow officer. Prosecutors argued the 45-year-old Read hit O’Keefe, 46, with her SUV before driving away, but the defense maintained O’Keefe was killed inside the home and later dragged outside.The incident took place in January 2022. It became one of the most highly watched cases.Read faced charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter and leaving the scene outside Boston. A second-degree murder conviction would have carried a life sentence.Read's first trial ended in a mistrial in July 2024 after the jury could not reach a verdict.Read’s defense said O’Keefe was beaten, bitten by a dog, then left outside a home in the Boston suburb of Canton in a conspiracy orchestrated by the police that included planting evidence.Prosecutors have described Read as a scorned lover who chose to leave O’Keefe dying in the snow after striking him with her SUV outside the house party. The state’s case was led by special prosecutor Hank Brennan, who called fewer witnesses than prosecutor Adam Lally, who ran the first trial against Read.Describing O’Keefe as a “good man” who “helped people,” Brennan told jurors during closing arguments that O’Keefe needed help that night and the only person who could provide it was Read. Instead, she drove away in her SUV. “She was drunk. She hit him and she left him to die,” he said.Defense attorney Alan Jackson rejected the idea that there was ever a collision at all. He and the defense called forward expert witnesses who agreed. “There is no evidence that John was hit by a car. None. This case should be over right now, done, because there was no collision,” Jackson said during closing arguments.","Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend John O'Keefe.

As the conflict between Israel and Iran entered its seventh day, both countries continued to launch strikes against each other on Thursday.The Israeli military said early Thursday that it was carrying out a ""series of strikes"" in Tehran and other parts of Iran. The Israeli Air Force confirmed on X that it had begun ""a wave of attacks in Tehran and other areas,"" but did not share details about the targets. These strikes came after Israel said it had intercepted a drone launched from Iran in the early hours of Thursday.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he was still deciding whether the United States would take part in Israel’s military action. He said Iran had contacted the US to discuss possible talks at the White House, but may have waited too long.Israel's military also issued a warning for people to leave the area around Iran’s Arak heavy water reactor. The warning, posted on social media platform X, included a satellite image of the plant marked with a red circle, similar to other warnings that have come before earlier strikes.The Arak reactor is located about 250 kilometers southwest of Tehran. Heavy water is used to cool reactors and can create plutonium, which may be used in nuclear weapons if a country chooses that path instead of using enriched uranium.While Israel confirmed it was continuing strikes around Tehran and other parts of Iran, it has not provided immediate details about the intended targets.Senior US officials are preparing for the possibility of a strike on Iran in the coming days, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing sources familiar with the matter.The Bloomberg report said the situation remains fluid and could change. Some of the sources mentioned that a strike might take place over the weekend.Amid the ongoing conflict between the two regional powers in the Middle East, a flight carrying 110 Indian nationals evacuated from Iran landed in Delhi as part of Operation Sindhu.Earlier, as tensions escalated, Indian students in Tehran were moved out of the city. Through arrangements made by the Indian embassy on Tuesday, 110 of them crossed the border into Armenia under the same operation.At least 639 people have been killed and 1,329 injured in Israeli strikes across Iran, according to a report released Thursday by the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists.The group said it had verified the deaths of 263 civilians and 154 members of the security forces. The figures cover the entire country.Human Rights Activists, which previously tracked casualties during the 2022 protests following Mahsa Amini’s death, said it cross-checks local Iranian reports with information from a network of sources inside the country.Iran has not been providing regular updates on casualties during the conflict. Its last report, released on Monday, stated that 224 people had been killed and 1,277 wounded.US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he was still deciding whether the United States would take part in Israel’s military action. He also said Iran had reached out to start talks.""I may do it, I may not do it,"" Trump told reporters. ""I can tell you this, that Iran's got a lot of trouble, and they want to negotiate.""Trump said Iran had even suggested sending officials to the White House to talk about its nuclear program in an attempt to stop the Israeli strikes.When asked if it was too late for talks, Trump responded: ""Nothing is too late.""In a televised statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump a ""great friend"" and thanked him ""for the support of the United States in defending Israel's skies"".Iran has not requested military assistance from Russia during its ongoing air conflict with Israel, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday.""Our Iranian friends have not asked us about this,"" Putin was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP.Russian President on Wednesday also offered to help mediate an end to the conflict. He suggested that Moscow could assist in negotiating a settlement that would allow Iran to maintain a peaceful nuclear program while addressing Israel’s security concerns.Speaking to reporters from international news agencies, Putin said, ""It's a delicate issue,"" but added, ""in my view, a solution could be found,"" news agency AP reported.When asked how Russia would respond if Israel were to kill Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Putin declined to answer. ""I don't even want to discuss such a possibility,"" he said.Putin also said that Russia had shared its proposals with Iran, Israel, and the United States.""We are not imposing anything on anyone; we are simply talking about how we see a possible way out of the situation. But the decision, of course, is up to the political leadership of all these countries, primarily Iran and Israel,"" he said.Moreover, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday in a speech broadcast on state TV: ""This nation will never surrender.""He added: ""America should know that any military intervention will undoubtedly result in irreparable damage.""Earlier, Trump had said that the United States knows Khamenei's location but would not act against him ""for now"".Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said on Thursday that Iran remained committed to “diplomacy” but was acting in “self-defence” in response to Israel’s actions.","Israel confirms continuing strikes around Tehran and other parts of Iran.

Tensions between Iran and Israel continued as the conflict entered its seventh day with airstrikes, missile fire, and growing international concern. Israel says it has targeted key nuclear-related sites in Tehran, while Iran has launched a limited missile response. Here are the latest developments in the conflict:Trump again refused to say whether he would order a strike on Iran. “I have a plan for everything… anything could happen,” he said.He added that his decisions were not yet final and that “things change—especially with war.”The US president further said he may meet Iranian officials but claimed it was ""too late"" for talks. ""They should have taken the deal. We spoke for 60 days. Now they wish they had,"" he said.Trump held a Situation Room meeting on Thursday to discuss the conflict, which lasted about an hour. Officials didn’t confirm who attended or what decisions were made.Senior diplomats from Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the European Union will hold nuclear talks with Iranian officials on Friday in Switzerland. The meeting comes at a tense moment, with US President Donald Trump still undecided on whether to authorise American military support for Israeli strikes targeting Iran’s nuclear programme, an official told AP.Explosions echoed across Tehran on Wednesday as Israel launched three waves of airstrikes on the Iranian capital. Less than a week into the conflict, Israeli forces now claim they have full control of the skies over Tehran.Footage from Tehran also showed smoke rising from areas near a police building and a Red Crescent facility.According to the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists, at least 639 people have been killed and 1,329 injured in the Israeli strikes across Iran. The group reported that among the dead are 263 civilians and 154 members of Iran’s security forces.Iran fired a small number of missiles at Israel, according to the IDF. No casualties or damage were reported.Air defences intercepted the missiles, and sirens were heard in central Israel, including Jerusalem, it said.India’s Operation Sindhu began with an evacuation flight carrying 110 Indian citizens from Yerevan, Armenia, landing safely in New Delhi.The Ministry of External Affairs earlier confirmed that Indian students in Tehran had been moved to safety with help from the Indian Embassy.Iran is facing a near-total internet blackout, according to NetBlocks. The communication ministry blamed Israel for “abusing the network,” while Iranian media reported that Israeli hackers briefly hijacked state TV, airing protest footage.Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran remains committed to diplomacy but reserves the right to defend itself.""Iran only retaliated against the Israeli regime. We haven’t targeted those supporting it,” he wrote on X.He called Israel “illegitimate” and repeated Iran’s stance of “self-defence, not aggression.”Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Moscow could help negotiate a peaceful settlement between Israel and Iran. Speaking to global media heads, Putin said Russia had shared proposals with Tehran, Tel Aviv and Washington.“We are not imposing anything,” he said. “We are only showing how we see a way out.

A Global Picture: Wealth Growth Tilted to the Americas

Global private wealth rose by 4.6% in 2024, up from 4.2% in 2023.





Most of the increase came from North America, where stable currencies and strong financial markets drove momentum.





The Americas led with more than 11% of global wealth growth.





In contrast, the Asia-Pacific and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) regions saw sluggish growth: below 3% and 0.5%, respectively.





The United Arab Emirates continued its meteoric rise on the global wealth map in 2024, adding approximately 13,000 new millionaires, according to the, released Wednesday.This fresh wave of high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) pushed the UAE’s millionaire count to a striking 240,343, marking a 5.8% year-on-year increase. This growth makes the UAE the second-fastest-growing millionaire market, trailing only Türkiye, which experienced an 8.4% rise. A good number of these newly created millionaire base in the UAE came about from re-locations, as has been the case for four years now.Aaccording to the Swiss bank: “In 2024, Turkey stands out from the crowd thanks to an 8.4% increase in its number of dollar millionaires over 2023, equivalent to a boost of roughly 7,000 people in a single year. The UAE (had) a rise of 5.8% in millionaire numbers, thanks to approximately 13,000 new entrants in this category.”To put it in human terms: According to Worldometers data, the UAE’s population grew by 385,048 last year.While the total population is estimated at around 11 million, adults in their prime working years (25-54) number a substantial 7.28 million. With such a high concentration of wealth, effectively about one in every 30 adults or economically active individuals in the UAE is a millionaire.The country’s HNWIs now collectively control about $785 billion (Dh2.88 trillion) in wealth. Meanwhile, the average wealth per adult in the UAE currently stands at $147,663.According to the report:This concentration of wealth is clearly reflected in the UAE’s property and investment markets. According to Knight Frank, a notable influx of high-net-worth individuals from Saudi Arabia, India, China, and the UK is driving larger, multi-million dollar deals, particularly in premium locations such as Jumeira Bay Island.Paul Donovan, Chief Economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a statement highlighted the broader implications of this capital accumulation:“Wealth is not just an economic measure – it’s a social and political force. As we navigate the fourth industrial revolution and rising public debt, the way wealth is distributed and transferred will shape opportunity, policy, and progress.”One particularly notable trend in the UAE is the coming wave of wealth transfers. UBS estimates that the country will see $19 billion (Dh70 billion) in intra- and inter-generational transfers. That figure represents 1.4% of the UAE’s total private wealth.This includes wealth moving between:Globally, the report expects over $83 trillion to change hands in the next two to three decades, most significantly in the:Regionally, the UAE ranks second in the Middle East for millionaire population:Globally, Switzerland maintained its position as the wealthiest nation by average adult wealth:By contrast, while the UAE’s average per adult ($147,663) trails these top-tier economies, its pace of wealth creation—and wealth attraction, signals an upward trajectory.Not all of the 13,000 new millionaires in the UAE were homegrown. According to, citingdata, the UAE attracted 7,200 millionaires from abroad in 2024, a 53% increase from the previous year.This surge in financial migration brings the total number of resident HNWIs to 130,500, as reported earlier. Industry experts suggest that favorable tax policies, political stability, and high-end infrastructure continue to make the UAE a magnet for mobile global wealth.While the UAE experienced notable domestic gains, the global wealth landscape also saw overall expansion:","In 2024, the UAE gained 13,000 millionaires, bringing the total to 240,000 with $785 billion in wealth. 62% of this wealth is held in financial assets, from equities and bonds to private investments.

The battle between Iran and Israel has escalated into one of the Middle East's most defining confrontations in decades, and the fate of the conflict may hinge on a deceptively simple number: how many medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) Iran has left.According to Israeli military data and independent expert estimates, Iran has fired around 700 MRBMs at Israel over the past 14 months, including more than 380 in just the last six days. That leaves Tehran's remaining stockpile somewhere between 300 and 1,300 missiles, depending on who you ask—a wide range that underscores just how murky and consequential the numbers game has become.The Iranian arsenal has been battered not only by its own usage but also by Israel's relentless six-day aerial assault. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) claim to have taken out at least a third of Iran's MRBM launchers, directly impacting Tehran's ability to sustain long-range attacks.""If these launch estimates hold, Iran's deterrence capabilities are hanging by a thread,"" CNN quoted Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the foundation for the defense of democracies. He warns that Iran's missile stockpile may soon drop ""below four digits""—a psychological and strategic red line for the Islamic Republic.Taleblu noted that Iran's missile strategy relies heavily on overwhelming quantity rather than cutting-edge technology. ""For the Islamic Republic, quantity has a quality of its own,"" he said. ""Losing that quantity threatens their entire warfighting doctrine.""Damage to Iran's infrastructure may be even more severe than previously acknowledged. UK chief of the defence staff admiral Tony Radakin revealed in December that 100 Israeli aircraft launched a devastating barrage that nearly wiped out Iran's air defense network and its ballistic missile production capabilities—for a full year.Israeli intelligence further claims that strikes earlier this year destroyed key facilities responsible for missile motor production, severely disrupting Iran's supply chain. However, experts caution that foreign support, especially from China, could help Iran recover and rebuild its production lines faster than expected.Despite this, conflicting narratives persist. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently claimed Iran could ramp up production to 300 missiles a month, theoretically reaching 20,000 missiles in six years. But he offered no concrete evidence for the claim, prompting skepticism from analysts.Iran has so far refused to disclose its actual missile count. But according to Dr Eyal Pinko, a former Israeli naval intelligence officer and current fellow at the Begin-Sadat Center, the current estimate ranges between 700 and 800 MRBMs left, factoring in recent launches and confirmed losses.For Tehran, this situation is precarious. Iran is not known for conventional warfighting prowess, and it historically leans on its missile arsenal as both deterrent and diplomatic leverage. If its MRBM supply dips too low, Iran could be forced into negotiations from a position of weakness—or escalate the conflict in desperation.As Israeli airpower continues to pound Iranian positions, the war appears to be shifting from a contest of ideologies to one of inventory. In this war of missiles, every launch narrows Tehran’s strategic options—and may ultimately determine whether the conflict burns out or blows up.","The fate of the conflict may hinge on how many medium-range ballistic missiles Iran has left.

Iran-Israel war: A lifeline for Netanyahu?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iran-israel-war-a-lifeline-for-netanyahu/articleshow/121934308.cms,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu





As Israeli warplanes continue to hammer Iranian targets, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has emerged politically reinvigorated, both domestically and on the world stage.Just days before Israel’s offensive began, Netanyahu’s coalition government was teetering on collapse over internal tensions, particularly over plans to conscript ultra-Orthodox Jews. Facing mounting criticism for his handling of the prolonged Gaza war and a hostage crisis dating back to Hamas’s October 2023 attack, Netanyahu’s leadership seemed on the brink.Now, with the war against Iran reshaping Israel’s political mood, Netanyahu’s approval ratings are rebounding. A new poll published by a conservative Israeli broadcaster shows 54% of respondents support the prime minister, up significantly from earlier weeks.“Netanyahu is greatly strengthened,” said Yonatan Freeman, a geopolitics expert at Hebrew University. “There’s broad public support for his argument that striking Iran preemptively was necessary.”Even opposition leader Yair Lapid backed the decision, calling the strike “the right one” in a Jerusalem Post op-ed.For Netanyahu, who has long warned of Iran’s nuclear ambitions, this war appears to be a defining moment.“Israel is fighting for its survival and has a chance to reshape the Middle East,” he said before the strikes began.The Israeli leader’s international standing, badly damaged by the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and an ICC arrest warrant for alleged war crimes, has seen a shift. Since the Iran offensive began, European leaders have rallied behind him. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz even said Israel was doing “the dirty work… for all of us.”Yet analysts warn the support may be fleeting. “If the war drags on, public sentiment could turn again,” said Denis Charbit of Israel’s Open University. “Netanyahu is asserting his Churchillian image, but the final act is still unwritten.”","Netanyahu's approval ratings are rebounding.

As political instability escalates in parts of the Middle East, the UAE is witnessing a growing wave of travel changes, with visitors and residents alike choosing to stay longer or cancel upcoming trips. Travel agencies in the country are fielding a sharp increase in calls from individuals, particularly from Jordan, Lebanon, and Iran, seeking solutions to remain in the UAE amid safety concerns and disrupted flight operations.Travel agents across the UAE have reported a noticeable surge in inquiries from tourists who had entered the country on short-term visit visas but now wish to remain longer than originally planned. The key reasons include airspace closures, flight cancellations, and widespread concerns about returning to areas affected by ongoing conflict.Speaking to a local news outlet,Bharath Aidasani, managing partner at Pluto Travels, confirme that many of these visitors are actively seeking legal avenues to extend their stay.“Flights to some of these countries are being cancelled or delayed,” he said.“We are getting many calls from visitors who are worried about returning and want to extend their visas or exit and re-enter legally.”He noted that Jordanian, Lebanese, and other Middle Eastern nationals are among the most frequent callers, and that inquiries are coming in daily.“Some visitors are scrambling to find a solution,” Aidasani explained. “They are either trying to extend their visas or making plans to exit and re-enter the UAE on a fresh visa.”For many, the UAE is now seen as a safe haven compared to the unpredictability back home. Aidasani emphasized that this perception of the Emirates as a secure place is a major factor in their decision.“The UAE continues to be seen as a safe place in the region, and many people feel more secure staying here until the situation improves,” he said.The shift in travel patterns is not limited to tourists. UAE residents, especially expatriates originally from regions experiencing tensions, are also opting to delay or cancel summer holiday plans.Subair Thekepurathvalappil, senior manager at Wisefox Tourism, toldthat many of their clients, including long-term residents, have decided against traveling this summer.“People who had planned to travel for the summer are now staying back,” he said. “They are concerned about the ongoing conflict and airspace closures. Many don’t want to take the risk of traveling right now.”He noted that some residents were hesitant not only due to the conflicts themselves, but also due to unpredictability in flight schedules and the risk of being stranded or delayed.In recent weeks, multiple flights connecting the UAE with countries such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Iran have been cancelled or rescheduled, primarily due to airspace restrictions linked to ongoing regional tensions. The geopolitical strain, particularly involving Iran and Israel, has led to closures of key flight corridors.As a result, passengers on connecting flights that pass through the affected region are also facing indirect disruptions, including missed connections and longer flight durations caused by re-routing.These delays have created further uncertainty for travelers, who are now increasingly cautious and opting to reconsider their immediate travel plans.With the situation remaining fluid, travel experts are urging visitors not to wait until the last minute when it comes to visa extensions or travel decisions. Being proactive can help avoid penalties or complications.Subair Thekepurathvalappil, senior manager at Wisefox Tourism, advised short-term visitors to take timely action if they're uncertain about their travel plans.“If you’re on a visit visa and unsure of your travel plans, it’s better to extend it in advance,” he said. “Delaying could mean paying fines or even overstaying by accident. Act early and speak to your travel agent or apply through official channels.”He also recommended that both visitors and residents take the following precautions:","Travel agents across the UAE have reported a noticeable surge in inquiries from tourists who had entered the country on short-term visit visas but now wish to remain longer.

Gulf waters under watch: Qatar warns of potential regional impact



Nuclear and energy sites struck as conflict enters fifth day



Qatar condemns strikes on energy infrastructure







Amid heightened conflict between Israel and Iran, Qatar has stepped up monitoring of radiation levels in the Gulf, following Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and energy sites. On Tuesday, Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari confirmed that Doha is closely tracking environmental developments in the region, while calling for international awareness of the potential fallout from strikes on sensitive facilities.“We are monitoring this on a daily basis,” al-Ansari said during a news conference.“We have nothing to be concerned about right now, but obviously prolonged escalation will have unpredictable consequences.”Al-Ansari stressed the strategic and environmental importance of the Gulf’s waters, describing them as the region’s primary water source. He warned that any military action targeting nuclear or energy-related facilities could result in outcomes beyond current prediction.“We have to emphasise, when we are talking about the waters of the Gulf, it’s the main source of water for all of us here in the region,” he said.“The international community has to make it very clear that any targeting of nuclear facilities, any targeting of fuel or energy facilities in this region, would have ramifications that are unknown to us in the Gulf.”The current escalation began Friday when Israel launched a major air campaign against Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. This marked the start of a now five-day-long exchange of missile strikes between the two countries.Iran’s key nuclear enrichment facilities, which were among the Israeli targets, are located deep inland. However, Iran also operates a nuclear power plant at Bushehr, situated along the Gulf coast.According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran informed the UN nuclear watchdog that the Bushehr plant had not been targeted. The statement was issued by the IAEA on Friday.On Saturday, Israel targeted a significant Iranian gas installation on the Gulf coast. The facility supports the South Pars gas field, a major energy project shared between Iran and Qatar.While confirming that Qatar’s part of the shared gas field remains unaffected, the Qatari government expressed concern over the risks such attacks pose to regional stability.“Qatar's own facilities in the field are secure,” said al-Ansari.Nonetheless, he strongly criticised the Israeli strikes on Iran’s energy assets.He described the actions as “reckless,” adding to Qatar’s calls for de-escalation and urging international stakeholders to prevent further destabilisation in the Gulf.","Qatar has stepped up monitoring of radiation levels in the Gulf, following Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and energy sites.

Grief Meets Generosity: A Community Stands Up

‘Support Group to Help’





In the quiet hours after disaster, the first residents of the 67-storey Marina Pinnacle Tower, also known as Tiger Tower, have been allowed back into the building to retrieve what little may be left. The high-rise in Dubai Marina was partially gutted by a fire on Friday night. Days later, the reality of what was lost is beginning to sink in.For many, it’s not just belongings, but entire lives turned to soot. Charred walls, soot-covered furniture, and gutted rooms greeted them, turning tearful reunions with their homes into moments of anguish.Salma Sherif Elhouseny, an Egyptian business consultant, had only been in Dubai for a year and a half. Her apartment on the 40th floor had been her safe space in a new country. She returned to it escorted by a Dubai Police officer, stepping carefully over blackened rubble. A video she later shared shows her sobbing uncontrollably as she is led through the ruins by a Dubai Police officer.“My master bedroom… it’s completely gone. I'm devastated, everything's lost. My jewellery, my laptop, my clothes, birth and education certificates, all the money I had, it was all here,” she told, her voice still trembling.“I know others have lost more, but I am alone in this city. This was everything I had.”She had waited several hours just to be allowed in, eventually escorted up through a cargo elevator shortly before midnight.“I was just lucky they let me in,” she said.Authorities have implemented strict controls to manage the entry of displaced tenants. Dubai Police and Civil Defence now require residents to register their names, present Emirates ID and tenancy (Ejari) documents, and wait for their turn. Entry is granted to small escorted groups, each allowed only around 10 minutes inside.Passports, medications, laptops, car keys, these are the urgent items people are prioritising as they step into their damaged homes.“There’s a system in place, and they are trying their best,” one tenant told, acknowledging the structure amid the chaos.But the process hasn’t been smooth for everyone.“Some people are misusing the opportunity by carrying heavy suitcases and staying longer than allowed. It slows everything down and delays those still waiting,” said another resident.Some floors, particularly the lower ones, appear to have escaped major damage. An Indian homeowner who visited his third-floor apartment said he felt fortunate.“Some smoke damage, but nothing serious. I consider myself lucky, given what others are going through.”For many others, especially those living on higher floors, access is still out of reach.Yasemin Fuentes, a Turkish expat who lived on the 47th floor with her husband, daughter, and three pets, has made multiple attempts to retrieve essentials, all unsuccessful.“More than 200 people were waiting, and it was too hot. I was told only those with medical needs or flights were being allowed in briefly,” she said. “We’re still wearing the clothes we fled in. I haven’t been able to get my ID or second phone.”The night of the fire, Yasemin hadn’t even been aware of the danger until a friend from a neighbouring tower called her around 10pm.“There was no alarm. I grabbed my daughter, our two cats, and the dog. By the time we got to the stairwell, it was filled with smoke. That’s when panic really kicked in.”Others, now allowed in, are documenting and sharing their losses through WhatsApp support groups.For residents living in shared accommodations, the experience has been even more constrained.“You’re only allowed into your own room. Police were very strict about that,” said one tenant.“And if you're above the 40th floor, there’s no electricity at all. We were given enough time to collect essentials, though.”Even as residents cope with trauma and uncertainty, community solidarity has begun to fill the gaps left behind by the fire.A WhatsApp group namedhas grown to over 1,000 members. It now functions as a central hub for aid, offering everything from temporary accommodation and clothing to food supplies. Volunteers continue to show up, helping neighbours with what they can.Mental health professionals have stepped in too, offering free counselling to those impacted. Daily virtual sessions featuring laughter therapy and traditional yoga are being held every morning from 6:45am to 7:45am until Friday, providing some emotional relief for those still processing what happened.There are no easy recoveries from events like this, but in the ruins of Marina Pinnacle, the compassion of a city is beginning to rebuild what flames took away.","First residents of Dubai's Tiger Tower have been allowed back into the building to retrieve what little may be left.

US Vice-President JD Vance on Tuesday warned that Donald Trump might take ""further action"" in a bid to end Iran's nuclear programme hours after the US president strongly advocated against Tehran possessing any nuclear weapon.""The president has shown remarkable restraint in keeping our military's focus on protecting our troops and protecting our citizens. He may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment,"" Vance said in a post X.Clearing the air over US's stance regarding Iran possessing nukes, Vance said, ""First, POTUS has been amazingly consistent, over 10 years, that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. Over the last few months, he encouraged his foreign policy team to reach a deal with the Iranians to accomplish this goal. The president has made clear that Iran cannot have uranium enrichment. And he said repeatedly that this would happen one of two ways--the easy way or the 'other' way. """"Second, I've seen a lot of confusion over the issue of ""civilian nuclear power"" and ""uranium enrichment."" These are distinct issues. Iran could have civilian nuclear power without enrichment, but Iran rejected that. Meanwhile, they've enriched uranium far above the level necessary for any civilian purpose.They've been found in violation of their non-proliferation obligations by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is hardly a rightwing organization,"" he added.Earlier in the day, Trump had made it clear that Iran ""cannot have nuclear weapons"" saying, ""Iran should have signed the “deal” I told them to sign. What a shame, and waste of human life. Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I said it over and over again! Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!""Israel's recent military operation targeted Iran’s key nuclear facilities at Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan, according to the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). A major above-ground section of Natanz, including its power infrastructure, was destroyed, and satellite imagery suggests potential damage to its underground enrichment plant.While no visible damage was found at the deeply buried Fordow enrichment site, the IAEA confirmed that four buildings at the Isfahan facility were hit — including a chemical lab, uranium conversion plant, reactor fuel plant, and a metal processing unit under construction.","US Vice-President JD Vance warned that Donald Trump might take ""further action"" in a bid to end Iran's nuclear programme.

A Sharjah court has convicted two school staff members of negligence in the death of eight-year-old Indian student Rashid Habib, more than a year after he tragically died following a fall at his school in Muwaileh.The Sharjah Federal Court of Appeal overturned an earlier acquittal by a lower court and ordered the defendants to pay Dh200,000 in legal blood money to the boy’s family. Additionally, each staff member was fined Dh2,000.The court found that the two staffers had failed in their duty to escort and monitor students from the school bus to their classrooms. CCTV footage reviewed during the investigation showed that Rashid was left unaccompanied at the time of the incident.The Grade 1 student collapsed while walking alone to his classroom on 11 March 2024, the first day of Ramadan, shortly after arriving at the CBSE-curriculum school.He was rushed to Al Qassimi Hospital in a state of cardiac arrest but was declared dead despite resuscitation attempts.A forensic report from Sharjah Police stated that Rashid had sustained a bruise on his face, a fractured cheekbone, internal bleeding under the scalp, and severe brain injuries, including swelling and bleeding.Surveillance footage confirmed that no school staff were present with the children during the incident. The footage also showed that another child had attempted to hit Rashid moments before he fell. However, the crucial seconds capturing the exact moment of the fall were missing.The appeal court ruled that the staff’s absence amounted to gross negligence, emphasising that the accident could likely have been prevented had the staff been present.Rashid’s father, Habib Yasar, told Khaleej Times: “Not a day goes by when we don’t remember Rashid. Our lives have never been the same. We keep thinking of what could have been if someone had just been there to watch over him. Why was there no CCTV camera? A school is supposed to be like a second home, but it didn’t take care of my child. This conviction brings some closure, but the pain remains. We lost a part of ourselves that day. ”The family had previously claimed Rashid was bullied and attacked during the missing seconds, a charge the school denied.Due to ongoing legal and administrative proceedings, the name of the school involved is being withheld.",Rashid Habib collapsed while walking alone to his classroom on 11 March 2024.

UAE legalizes tobacco-free nicotine pouches to help smokers quit cigarettes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-legalizes-tobacco-free-nicotine-pouches-to-help-smokers-quit-cigarettes/articleshow/121910813.cms,"Nicotine pouches offer a smoke-free alternative by delivering nicotine through the mouth, lowering lung damage risks compared to cigarettes./ (File)

Khaleej Times





The UAE will officially allow the sale of tobacco-free nicotine pouches starting July 29, following the enactment of a new Cabinet resolution that sets technical standards for this emerging smoking alternative. The new law aims to provide smokers with additional tools to quit cigarettes.Dr Sanam Mallick, Consultant in Family Medicine at Burjeel Hospital Abu Dhabi, described nicotine pouches as small, smokeless products that contain nicotine but no tobacco. “People place them between their gum and lips to absorb nicotine without smoking or chewing tobacco. They’re popular as a discreet alternative to cigarettes or chewing tobacco. Nicotine pouches contain nicotine, the same chemical that we find in tobacco,” he toldNicotine, the addictive substance in tobacco, is released by these pouches and stimulates dopamine production, the ‘feel-good hormone.’ This process helps reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, thereby assisting smokers in quitting.“Nicotine pouches can be a valuable tool for some people trying to quit smoking, but whether they’re a good option compared to other smoking cessation methods depends on a few factors,” Dr Mallick explained.One major benefit of nicotine pouches is the absence of smoke inhalation, which significantly reduces the risk of lung damage associated with traditional cigarettes. However, Dr Mallick cautioned that, like all nicotine products, pouches can be addictive. “They still contain nicotine, so they don’t remove the addiction, just the smoking behaviour. (Additionally), because they’re relatively new, the long-term health impacts are still being studied. ”Regarding effectiveness, Dr Mallick noted that some smokers have successfully used pouches to gradually reduce or replace cigarette smoking, while others find it challenging due to the continued oral habit. “Others may find the oral fixation or habit harder to break, since pouches still involve placing something in the mouth (similar to chewing tobacco).”Nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) such as patches, gum, and lozenges are well-established methods known to increase quit rates by 50 to 70 per cent. “Nicotine pouches might offer similar benefits, but without long-term studies, their effectiveness compared to these therapies is less certain,” Dr Mallick added.Shiraz Khan, Chief Operating Officer at Aster Retail GCC, further explained the difference between nicotine pouches and patches. “Nicotine from pouches is absorbed through the lining of the mouth. In contrast, nicotine patches are transdermal products applied to the skin. They slowly release nicotine into the bloodstream over a period of time, helping to reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings,” he said. “The key difference lies in the method of delivery. Pouches work via oral mucosal absorption, while patches deliver nicotine through the skin.”Currently, NRTs such as patches, gum, and lozenges are widely available in UAE pharmacies, often sold over the counter without prescription. However, some higher-dose patches or combination therapies might require healthcare provider supervision, Khan noted.NRTs are popular among smokers aiming to quit due to their discreet usage, absence of smoke, and perceived lower harm compared to traditional tobacco products. “Products like nicotine gums and lozenges have seen rapid growth due to their discreet use, lack of smoke, and perceived lower harm compared to traditional tobacco products,” Khan said.Under UAE regulations, all nicotine products must carry health warnings and age restriction labels, with sales prohibited to anyone under 18 years. Packaging and labelling are required to comply with UAE-specific guidelines, including Arabic labelling. “Only licensed retailers or pharmacies may sell these products,” Khan added.Globally, tobacco remains the leading preventable cause of disease and premature death. According to a guide released last year by the UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention (Mohap), the global tobacco epidemic claims nearly eight million lives annually, ranking it as one of the world’s most serious public health threats.In the UAE, the National Health Survey of 2018 found that nearly 16 per cent of men and 2.5 per cent of women are smokers.To bolster tobacco cessation efforts, UAE authorities have committed to providing counselling and psychological support to individuals seeking to quit all forms of tobacco, including e-cigarettes.",The UAE will allow the sale of tobacco-free nicotine pouches starting July 29.

How difficult is it to target Fordow?







With tensions escalating between Israel and Iran, the focus has shifted to one of the most heavily guarded sites in the Islamic Republic: the Fordow nuclear facility, buried deep within a mountain.Designed specifically to survive conventional attacks, Fordow represents a critical node in Iran’s nuclear program — and destroying it is central to any serious effort to cripple Tehran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons.But there’s a catch- only the United States possesses a weapon capable of penetrating that mountain.And with the US President Donald Trump repeatedly claiming the Iran ""should not have a nuclear weapon"", that too in all caps on Truth Social, Israel and the States seem to be on the same page.Known officially as the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), this 30,000-pound bomb is a feat of engineering tailored for one purpose — to annihilate deeply buried and fortified targets. Commonly called a “bunker-buster,” it was developed after intelligence revealed adversaries like Iran and North Korea were moving critical infrastructure, including nuclear programs, underground to avoid airstrikes.Israel has long expressed concern about Iran’s nuclear ambitions, particularly after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported in 2023 that uranium at Fordow had been enriched to 83.7% purity — just below the 90% threshold needed for a nuclear weapon.Also Read: Why Israel needs Donald Trump to take out Iran's nukes - Explained But while Israel has advanced fighter jets and intelligence capabilities, it lacks both the MOP and the aircraft needed to deliver it. The US has historically declined to provide this bomb to Israel, fearing it could trigger a broader regional war.""We've had a policy for a long time of not providing those to the Israelis because we didn't want them to use them,"" said General Joseph Votel, commander of US Central Command during Trump's first term.Instead, the US has used its possession of the MOP as a deterrent, signaling to Iran that its underground facilities are still vulnerable.Without access to the MOP, Israel has developed contingency plans to cripple Fordow indirectly:Fordow is Iran’s second nuclear enrichment site after its main facility at Natanz. To date, there’s no indication that Israeli strikes have damaged Natanz’s underground enrichment halls, nor have they targeted the tunnel networks Iran is constructing nearby.Smaller than Natanz, Fordow is embedded into a mountainside near the city of Qom, roughly 60 miles (95 kilometers) southwest of Tehran. Construction is believed to have begun in 2006, and the facility became operational in 2009—the same year Iran officially revealed its existence.Deeply fortified beneath approximately 80 meters (260 feet) of rock and earth, Fordow is also reportedly shielded by surface-to-air missile systems supplied by both Iran and Russia. However, those air defenses are believed to have already been compromised in recent Israeli airstrikes.Despite its formidable protection, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has emphasized that the mission to target Iran aims to dismantle its nuclear and missile programs, which he views as an existential threat. According to Israeli officials, Fordow remains a key objective in that broader strategy.","Israel has long expressed concern about Iran’s nuclear ambitions, particularly after the IAEA reported in 2023 that uranium at Fordow had been enriched to 83.7% purity — just below the 90% threshold needed for a nuclear weapon.

A Turkish court on Tuesday sentenced a far-right politician to more than two years in prison for inciting public hatred and hostility, but ordered his release because of time already served.Umit Ozdag, the leader of Turkey's Victory Party, was detained in January over accusations that he insulted President Recep Tayyip Erdogan with comments that he made during a party meeting.A day later, Ozdag was formally arrested and charged with inciting hatred against migrants. He was blamed for last year's anti-Syrian refugee riots in the central Turkish province of Kayseri, during which hundreds of homes and businesses were attacked.Ozdag, a 64-year-old former academic, is an outspoken critic of Turkey's refugee policies, and has previously called for the repatriation of millions of Syrian refugees.During his trial, Ozdag acknowledged advocating the return of refugees, but strongly denied that he had incited violence against them. He maintained that his imprisonment was politically motivated and aimed at silencing him.The court sentenced him to two years and four months in prison, but ordered his release, ruling that he has already served a sufficient portion of the sentence.The trial took place amid a widespread crackdown on the opposition to Erdogan's Justice and Development Party.Officials from municipalities controlled by the main opposition - the Republican People's Party, or CHP - have faced waves of arrests this year. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, viewed as the main challenger to Erdogan's two-decade rule, was detained in March over allegations of corruption.Many people in Turkey consider the cases to be politically driven, according to opinion polls. However, Erdogan's government insists that the courts are impartial and free from political involvement.","Umit Ozdag, leader of Turkey's Victory Party, was detained in January over accusations that he insulted President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Field Teams Deployed, Focus on Passenger Welfare



Airspace Closures Trigger Wide-Scale Flight Disruptions



Commitment to Service Quality and Passenger Safety







The United Arab Emirates has activated its comprehensive emergency airport response plan in the wake of escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East that have prompted multiple countries to close their airspace. The closures, initiated by Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, and Israel, have led to widespread disruption in regional air travel, causing flight rerouting and delays that have affected thousands of passengers.As reported byon Tuesday, June 17, 2025, the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Ports Security (ICACP) confirmed that a full-scale business continuity strategy was triggered to maintain the seamless operation of passenger movement across all UAE airports.“Necessary measures have been taken to preserve service quality at the UAE’s airports and manage the impact of recent regional developments,” the authority stated in its official Monday release.As part of the national response, UAE authorities deployed field teams around the clock, comprising trained personnel and supported by advanced technological infrastructure. These teams were stationed across UAE airports to manage passenger flows, expedite immigration procedures, and collaborate closely with airline operators on rescheduling disrupted flights.The ICACP emphasised that “the mechanism for travelers’ entry into UAE airports was aligned with the evolving operational situation,” enabling flexibility in managing sudden disruptions.In addition to ground coordination, the government placed a strong focus on the well-being of affected travellers. Temporary accommodation was arranged for those stranded due to cancelled or rerouted flights. Real-time updates and logistical support were provided directly to passengers, ensuring transparency and reduced anxiety during their wait.Support teams were also positioned to offer one-on-one guidance, helping passengers navigate their onward travel plans amid the uncertainty.The emergency protocol was set in motion following the widespread airspace closures that unfolded earlier in the week. Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, and Israel shut down their skies as tensions between Iran and Israel escalated sharply. The closures sent ripple effects across international air corridors, disrupting flight routes and triggering mass cancellations and rerouting operations across the region.Local airports in the UAE, which serve as major global aviation hubs, were particularly impacted by these developments. However, thanks to pre-established emergency measures and real-time inter-agency coordination, operational continuity was largely preserved.According to ICACP, the plan encompassed “a set of regulatory and logistical procedures carried out in partnership with strategic stakeholders across the aviation sector,” helping to absorb the shock of the disruptions without significant breakdowns in service.The ICACP praised the composure and cooperation demonstrated by passengers during the travel disruptions, noting that their patience contributed significantly to the successful implementation of emergency procedures.Authorities reaffirmed the UAE’s commitment to “safety, operational excellence, and proactive crisis management.” They added that the nation’s response was anchored in “authentic Emirati values and international best practices,” ensuring that service quality was upheld with minimal impact on travellers.By deploying well-coordinated field support and leveraging advanced operational protocols, the UAE effectively contained the fallout from regional developments, once again demonstrating its resilience and leadership in global aviation management.","Field teams deployed 24/7 at UAE airports to assist stranded travellers amid widespread flight delays and rerouting caused by regional airspace shutdowns.

Why the stakes are so high







As tensions between Iran and Israel escalate, a chilling question arises: Could this spiral into a nuclear crisis? In the past five days, the situation has worsened, with Israel reportedly targeting nuclear sites in Tehran. Experts warn that any further escalation could be catastrophic. At the heart of these rising tensions lies Iran’s most secretive and fortified nuclear facility, Fordow.Tucked deep beneath a mountain near Qom, the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant is one of Iran’s most secretive and heavily fortified nuclear sites. Its underground design—80 to 90 meters below the surface—makes it virtually impenetrable to aerial strikes, even with the most advanced bunker-buster bombs in Israel’s arsenal. Originally exposed in 2009 through Western intelligence, Fordow was built in secrecy and designed for survivability, especially in the face of potential military attacks on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.What makes Fordow particularly alarming to global powers is its capacity to enrich uranium to levels close to weapons-grade. According to the IAEA, the site now houses 2,700 centrifuges and has been enriching uranium to 60%—a short technical step away from the 90% needed for nuclear weapons.According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), uranium enriched to 83.7% purity was found at the site in 2023, dangerously close to the 90% enrichment level needed for nuclear weapons.Experts warn that Iran could produce enough material for multiple bombs in just weeks if it chooses to weaponize its stockpile. Fordow’s strategic importance lies not only in its enrichment capabilities but in its symbolic and operational role as a hardened fallback facility, raising the stakes of any military or diplomatic attempt to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions.Despite repeated Israeli attempts to neutralize it, Fordow remains intact. Only the US possesses the kind of ordnance—like the GBU-57 bunker-buster—that might reach its buried core, and even that would likely require multiple strikes. For Iran, Fordow is a nuclear insurance policy. For the world, it is a red line—and possibly a countdown.""The Iranians fully understood that the Israelis would try to get inside their programs, and they built Fordo inside of a mountain a long time ago to take care of the post-Iraq problem,"" said Vali Nasr, an Iran expert who is a professor at Johns Hopkins University.Only one known weapon could potentially take out Fordow: the US-made 30,000-pound bomb. This bomb, also called ""bunker buster,"" is capable of burrowing through rock and steel before detonating.But there's a catch: Israel doesn't have it. The United States has consistently denied Israeli requests for the bomb, citing fears that its use could provoke a full-scale regional war.""We've had a policy for a long time of not providing those to the Israelis because we didn't want them to use them,"" said general Joseph Votel, former head of US central command.While Israel lacks the bunker buster or a heavy bomber to deliver it, it hasn't given up on options:""The Israelis have sprung a lot of clandestine operations lately,"" said general Kenneth McKenzie Jr, former commander of US central command. ""But the physics of the problem remain the same.""While the US has moved aircraft and refuelling tankers into the region, there's no indication yet that US President Donald Trump is prepared to shift long-standing US policy and provide Israel with the bomb. Officials warn that deploying it would involve complex coordination and risk significant collateral and geopolitical fallout.""If we use the bunker buster, there could be nuclear contamination,"" general Votel said. ""I think there would also certainly be fallout internationally over the idea that the United States joined Israel in what would be viewed as an illegal attack on the sovereignty of Iran,"" he added.Fordow is not just a physical challenge—it is a political one. An Israeli strike on the site, especially with US involvement, could trigger Iranian retaliation against American assets across the Middle East and plunge the region into another war.Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and remains a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). But with enrichment levels rising and regional threats mounting, international anxiety over Fordow continues to grow.Fordow symbolises the nuclear stalemate between Iran and its adversaries. For Israel, it represents the limits of its conventional reach. For the US, it is a geopolitical tripwire. And for Iran, it remains a testament to strategic foresight in the face of existential threats. As the Middle East teeters on the edge of a broader conflict, what happens—or does n't—at Fordow could shape the course of history.","Despite repeated Israeli attempts to neutralize it, Fordow remains intact. Fordow’s strategic importance lies not only in its enrichment capabilities but in its symbolic and operational role as a hardened fallback facility.

‘First We Destroy, Then…’: Israel’s Chilling New Confession After Snubbing Putin’s Mediation Offer





Israeli defence minister Israel Katz on Tuesday warned that Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei could have a ""similar fate"" to Iraq's former dictator Saddam Hussein ""Remember what happened to the dictator in the neighbouring country of Iran who took this path against Israel,"" Katz told news agency Reuters.Katz's caveat linking Khamenei's fate to Saddam Hussein could be considered a highly charged statement, reflecting the deepening hostility between the Jewish State and its arch-rival Tehran.Saddam Hussein was overthrown and executed following a US-led invasion in 2003, symbolising the total collapse of his regime.By drawing this parallel, Katz is not only issuing a personal threat to Khamenei but also hinting at the potential for regime change in Iran if its aggressive policies, particularly towards Israel, persist.The statement seems aimed at both psychological warfare and international signalling, reaffirming Israel’s resolve to confront what it perceives as existential threats. According to the Israeli government, the threat stems from the Khamenei-led state actively involved in the enrichment of uranium beyond permitted limits that could potentially make Iran a nuclear-capable nation.Invoking Saddam’s fate serves as a cautionary tale, warning Khamenei that unchecked defiance and militarism could lead to catastrophic personal and national consequences.Saddam was known for his hostility towards Israel, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s. During the 1991 Gulf War, Saddam's forces fired Scud missiles at Israel, aiming to draw Israel into the conflict and destabilise the US-led coalition against him.Despite the provocation, Israel, under US pressure, chose not to retaliate. Saddam’s regime was marked by brutal oppression, regional wars, and defiance of international norms. Eventually, the US invaded Iraq in 2003, citing weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) that were never found. Saddam was captured later that year, put on trial, and executed on December 30, 2006.The conflict between Israel and Iran has intensified for the fifth consecutive day, pushing the region dangerously close to an all-out war. Throughout the night, the area saw heavy missile fire, drone shoot-downs, and swift evacuation directives. Air raid sirens echoed across Israel, while explosions lit up Tehran’s skyline.On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump cut short his appearance at the G7 summit in Canada, warning civilians to ""immediately evacuate Tehran"" -- raising suspicions that much would be brewing in West Asia than what meets the eye.As casualties mount, with evacuation orders affecting hundreds of thousands and major regional air routes coming to a standstill, concerns are growing over the possibility of a wider regional war. Despite the ongoing violence, Trump maintains that ""Iran still wants a deal,"" even as his national security team convenes in Washington.Meanwhile, Israel asserts it has total control over Iranian skies, signalling a further escalation. The situation remains tense and highly volatile.","Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei could have a ""similar fate"" to Iraq's former dictator Saddam Hussein.

Emotional and Psychological Impact of False Promises





Many expatriates arriving in the UAE have been found working without formal contracts or employment visas, leaving them vulnerable to legal and financial troubles. Despite receiving job offers or offer letters, these individuals often start working on visit visas, only to be abandoned by employers and forced to leave the country empty-handed.Jobseekers arriving in the UAE are being warned strongly against beginning work while still on visit visas—even if they have received job offers. According to UAE labour laws, it is unlawful to work without a valid employment visa. Yet, several cases have emerged where expats start working based on job offer letters or verbal promises, hoping to secure a permanent employment visa later.Dina Subhi Al Obaidi, a UAE-based recruiter and founder of Chronicle L.L.C FZ, told Khaleej Times that “It’s illegal to hire or allow anyone to work on a visit visa.” She emphasized that “Employers must obtain labour approval and issue valid work permits before an employee begins any job duties.”Al Obaidi pointed out that many candidates, especially those new to the UAE or on visit visas, “often lack clarity on hiring processes” and are sometimes “left unsupported or misled. Awareness is key to protection.”Two individuals’ experiences highlight the risks faced by those working on visit visas without formal contracts.Under UAE law, working on a visit visa is prohibited. Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 and Federal Decree Law No. 29 of 2021 require employees to have a valid work permit and residency visa before beginning any job.Employers who violate these regulations face heavy penalties. According to Article 60(1)(a) of Federal Decree Law No. 9 of 2024, fines range from Dh100,000 to Dh1 million for hiring without proper documentation.Dina Subhi Al Obaidi highlighted common red flags that candidates should watch for, including:“These are unacceptable and unethical practices,” she said.She added that ethical hiring involves “issuing a formal offer letter, completing the visa process before onboarding, and being transparent about salary and responsibilities.” Employers have a responsibility “to support candidates who are new but show potential.”Beyond the legal implications, the human cost of unethical hiring practices is deeply significant. Dr Amir Javaid, a consultant psychiatrist at Burjeel Medical City in Abu Dhabi, highlighted the emotional toll these false job promises take on individuals. He explained that such experiences often lead to “emotional instability, anger, and irritability,” especially for expatriates who find themselves isolated and vulnerable in a foreign country.“Behind every CV is a person who may have left home in search of a future,” Dr Javaid told Khaleej Times. “When their hopes are shattered by broken promises, it causes profound feelings of betrayal and insecurity.” This emotional upheaval can result in long-term psychological consequences, including depression, anxiety, low self-confidence, and even post-traumatic stress disorder. Some affected individuals may require professional psychiatric care to cope and recover.Dr Javaid urged jobseekers to remain vigilant for signs of trauma following such experiences. Symptoms might include mood swings, irritability, sleep disturbances, social withdrawal, and a noticeable lack of motivation.From an employer’s perspective, Dr Javaid emphasized the critical role of responsibility and transparency. “Companies must avoid making false promises, provide clear and timely notice when changes occur, offer alternative roles where possible, and prioritize the psychological safety of their employees.” He further recommended that organisations foster empathetic communication and engage occupational health teams to support employees’ mental well-being.","Many expats arriving in the UAE have been found working without formal contracts or employment visas.

Conflicting intelligence interpretations

Blowback risk and strategic stakes





When Israel launched airstrikes against Iran last week, it claimed the attacks were needed to stop Iran from getting close to building a nuclear weapon. But US intelligence had a different view. As per a CNN report, officials said Iran was not actively working on a bomb and was likely still up to three years away from being able to build and use one.According to four people familiar with the US assessment, Iran was not actively building a bomb, and even if it suddenly decided to do so, it was likely two to three years away from delivering a functioning nuclear weapon.Despite major damage to Iran’s Natanz facility, home to advanced centrifuges, the more heavily fortified Fordow enrichment plant remains untouched. According to US officials, the strikes may have delayed Iran’s nuclear progress by only a few months, not derailed it.Israel, defense experts say, lacks the firepower to strike Fordow without specific US military support, including bunker-busting bombs and stealth bombers. “If you really want to dismantle them, it’s either a US military strike or a deal,” said Brett McGurk, a former Middle East envoy under both Trump and Biden.That dilemma now lands squarely on President Donald Trump’s desk. While he has insisted the US is not currently involved in Israel’s attacks, he acknowledged on Sunday: “It’s possible we could get involved.” Speaking from the G7 summit in Canada, Trump urged both Iran and Israel to talk “before it’s too late.”Despite close cooperation between US and Israeli intelligence services, the two nations have long differed on interpreting Iran’s nuclear intent. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard testified in March that the US believes Iran halted weaponization in 2003 and hasn’t resumed it.Pressed on that during a Fox News interview, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted the evidence Israel shared was “absolutely clear” that Iran was working “in a secret plan to weaponize uranium.”Still, the International Atomic Energy Agency noted Iran has enough enriched uranium to theoretically make multiple bombs—but emphasized the country has not taken steps to build or deliver a weapon.US officials now worry that Israel’s strikes could backfire. “You could actually have Iran more inclined to go for a nuclear weapon,” McGurk warned, especially if key infrastructure like Fordow remains intact and Iran feels cornered.Iran has told regional mediators like Qatar and Oman that it won’t return to talks under fire. Meanwhile, the US is realigning its forces in the region, moving the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group to the Middle East and deploying missile defense assets to the eastern Mediterranean.Israel’s blitz, aimed at stopping a nuclear sprint, may have instead sparked the very race it feared, one that only diplomacy or deeper US involvement might now halt.","Israel launched airstrikes against Iran last week, claiming the attacks were needed to stop Iran from getting close to building a nuclear weapon. But US intelligence had a different view. Officials said Iran was not actively working on a bomb and was likely still up to three years away from being able to build and use one.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121907675,imgsize-122604,width-400,resizemode-4/121907675.jpg"

What’s Next? More Airbus Orders May Follow

More A350s, to complement the airline’s current dominance in that model.





Airbus A330-900s, a potential replacement for its aging A330-200s and A330-300s.









In late May 2025, Qatar Airways made the strategic decision to cancel its order for 25 Boeing 737 MAX 10s, a move confirmed by CEO Badr Mohammed Al Meer in an interview with Bloomberg. a move that not only ends its short-lived venture into the type but also reshapes the airline’s entire narrowbody strategy. The order, which also included options for 25 more, was placed during the 2022 Farnborough Airshow, a time when the airline’s relationship with Airbus was at an all-time low, the deal was positioned as a solution for the airline’s regional network, with Boeing Commercial Airplanes’ then-CEO Stan Deal praising the aircraft as ""ideally suited for Qatar Airways' regional network.""But two years later, delays in the 737 MAX 10’s certification, which has pushed its expected entry into commercial service to 2026 at the earliest, have forced the airline to reconsider. Qatar Airways is not alone in facing these setbacks, major carriers like United Airlines, American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines are also waiting, with growing frustration.In fact, United’s Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella, told Reuters that the 737 MAX 10 isn’t expected to arrive before 2027 or even 2028, and the airline is now hesitant to convert any MAX 9 orders into MAX 10s.“We want to see the aircraft certified before we make the firm commitment,” Nocella said.Qatar Airways, meanwhile, opted to walk away entirely.Qatar’s move to order the 737 MAX 10s in 2022 wasn’t born purely of performance metrics, it was a response to an escalating legal and commercial dispute with Airbus. That year, Qatar Airways grounded all 29 of its Airbus A350s, citing what it described as ""accelerated surface degradation"" of the aircraft’s painted fuselage.In response, the airline filed a lawsuit seeking $600 million in damages from Airbus and publicly challenged the safety and airworthiness of the A350 fleet. Airbus, while acknowledging cosmetic and surface issues, insisted the aircraft were structurally safe and continued deliveries to other customers.During this high-profile conflict:At the peak of the fallout, the Boeing 737 MAX 10 was pulled in to fill that gap, offering Qatar Airways an alternative narrowbody solution as it severed ties, temporarily, with Airbus.But in early 2023, the feud reached a resolution. Both parties issued a joint statement announcing that the matter had been settled amicably:""Qatar Airways and Airbus are pleased to have reached an amicable and mutually agreeable settlement in relation to their legal dispute over A350 surface degradation and the grounding of A350 aircraft. A repair project is now underway and both parties look forward to getting these aircraft safely back in the air.""Following this, Qatar reinstated the order for 50 A321neos, and Airbus resumed delivery plans for the grounded A350s. The settlement not only restored fleet development plans but reset the tone of the Qatar-Airbus relationship.Qatar Airways’ Chief Executive Officer Badr Mohammed Al Meer, in an interview with, confirmed the airline had dropped the MAX 10 order, which also included options for 25 more aircraft. This decision, he revealed, was made in conjunction with a massive new Boeing widebody order that dwarfs the value of the narrowbody deal.Earlier this month, Qatar Airways placed its largest-ever aircraft order, agreeing to purchase 130 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 30 Boeing 777-9s, with options for an additional 50 aircraft, a potential total of 210 widebodies valued at $96 billion.Responding to whether the airline was playing Boeing and Airbus against each other, Al Meer toldFrancine Lacqua:“You know, for the time being, we need to focus on finalizing our agreement with Boeing. As you saw, we are not like other airlines where we split our orders 20 today, 20 next year. Because we are basing our order on a very solid strategy and we decided to go with the 210 aircraft order. However, it doesn’t mean that Airbus is out of the game. Our narrowbodies will continue to be Airbus.”In a separate public comment, Al Meer reiterated the airline’s direction:“Our narrowbody [fleet] will continue to be Airbus. We are receiving 50 A321neos starting next year. So our whole narrowbody fleet will be basically operated by Airbus. We continue to receive A350-1000s, and there will always be a chance for another order from Airbus.”As of now, Qatar Airways operates a limited narrowbody fleet consisting of:Several MAX 8s previously operated by Qatar Airways have already been leased to IndiGo for routes between Qatar and India. The remaining three are expected to be phased out soon, aligning with the airline’s plan to standardize its narrowbody fleet around Airbus.Qatar Airways is already the largest operator of the Airbus A350-1000 globally. The aircraft typically features two configurations:In the years ahead, the airline will boast one of the most modern widebody fleets in the world, operating from its hub at Doha Hamad International Airport (DOH).While Boeing has secured a record-breaking widebody order, there’s speculation that Qatar Airways may also return to Airbus for additional widebodies. Possibilities include:Qatar Airways' renewed ties with Airbus open the door for future deals, as the airline looks to refine and expand its fleet under a disciplined, long-term strategy. The airline is clearly not chasing diversification for its own sake, it's targeting operational efficiency, flexibility, and strategic alignment with its growth ambitions.As for Boeing, with a growing backlog of 737 MAX 10 orders, the manufacturer now faces intensifying pressure to resolve regulatory hurdles that have kept the aircraft grounded in the certification process. The delays are prompting several major carriers to reconsider their long-term fleet strategies. Qatar Airways is not alone in stepping back from the MAX 10; United Airlines, one of the aircraft’s largest customers, has expressed deep concerns over delivery timelines. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and Alaska Airlines, all with MAX 10 orders in the pipeline, are also closely watching the certification timeline, with some reportedly exploring alternative options or reconfiguring existing commitments.","Qatar Airways cancelled its remaining order for 23 Airbus A350s.

Ali Shadmani, the wartime chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces and a trusted aide to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was killed in an airstrike in Tehran, according to a statement released by the Israel defense forces on Tuesday.“For the second time in 5 days— the IDF has eliminated Iran’s war-time chief of staff, the regime’s top military commander,” the IDF said in a X post.Shadmani’s assassination marks the second instance of a top Iranian commander being eliminated by Israel during its ongoing military offensive.A senior general, he was appointed to his position following the death of his predecessor, Major General Gholam Ali Rashid, who was killed in Israel’s initial strikes on Friday. Major General Shadmani had served as the head of the Khatam-al Anbiya central headquarters, Iran's military emergency command, for only about four days. In this role, he was tasked with overseeing coordination between the Iranian army and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.Under Shadmani’s command, the Khatam-al Anbiya central headquarters “was responsible for managing combat operations and approving Iran’s attack plans.”the IDF told the news agency The Times of Israel.It added “in his various roles, he had a direct influence on Iran’s offensive plans targeting the State of Israel,” the IDF says.Shadmani had earlier held the positions of deputy commander at the Khatam-al Anbiya Headquarters and chief of operations within Iran’s armed forces.The strike is the latest in a series of attacks targeting senior commanders and scientists, further weakening Iran’s leadership structure.","Ali Shadmani was the wartime chief of staff of Iran's armed forces.

Poll Should shipping companies reconsider routes through the Strait of Hormuz given current tensions? Yes, it's too risky No, it's still safe





The Emirati national guard said it evacuated 24 people from an oil tanker Tuesday after a collision between two ships just east of the world's most critical oil chokepoint, the Strait of Hormuz.The crude oil tanker, ADALYNN, was bound for Egypt's Suez Canal when the crash in the Gulf of Oman happened. NASA FIRMS satellite data showed heat signatures in the area early morning.The United Arab Emirates national guard said it deployed its coast guard's search and rescue boats to the site, 24 nautical miles off the country's coast, and that the crew was evacuated to the port of Khor Fakkan.British maritime security firm Ambrey had earlier said that the incident was not security-related, as the days-long conflict between Israel and Iran, which is just across the Strait of Hormuz from neighbouring Oman, continued to unfold.The strait is the strategic maritime entryway to the Persian Gulf and sees about a fifth of the world's oil pass through it, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In 2024, an average of 20 million barrels of oil travelled through it daily.After Israel launched airstrikes against Iran on June 13, worry mounted over whether the Islamic Republic might block the waterway.Maritime ship experts say shipowners are increasingly wary of using the waterway, with some ships having tightened security and others cancelling routes there.As the Israel-Iran warfare intensified over the weekend, hundreds of ships in the strait saw spotty navigation signals and had to rely more on radar, though it wasn't immediately clear what caused Tuesday's incident.The Financial Times reported Friday that the world's largest publicly listed oil tanker company, Frontline, said it would turn down new contracts to sail into the Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz after the Israel-Iran conflict broke out.Meanwhile, oil prices continued to climb as U.S. futures were lower Tuesday morning after Israel's military issued an evacuation warning to 330,000 people in Iran's capital, Tehran.Tuesday's rescue came less than two weeks after the UAE national guard airlifted an injured man from an oil tanker to an Emirati hospital.","The crude oil tanker, ADALYNN, was bound for Egypt's Suez Canal when the crash in the Gulf of Oman happened.

Iran retaliates with over 100 missiles and drone strikes





The conflict between Israel and Iran continued to escalate for a fifth day pushing the region to the edge of a full-scale war. Over the night the region witnessed marked missile exchanges, drone interceptions and urgent evacuation orders.As air raid sirens blared in Israel and explosions lit up the skies over Tehran, US President Donald Trump cut short his appearance at the G7 summit in Canada, warning civilians to “immediately evacuate Tehran.” He later posted from Air Force One that “IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON,” signalling an increasingly hardline stance.With death tolls rising, evacuation orders issued for hundreds of thousands, and regional airspace grinding to a halt, the situation has sparked fears of a much larger regional conflagration. Despite the bloodshed, Trump insists Iran still wants a deal, even as his military team gathers in Washington and Israel claims total control over Iranian skies.The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have announced the elimination of Ali Shadmani, Iran's newly appointed wartime Chief of Staff, in a targeted airstrike on central Tehran. The IDF stated that following ""a sudden opportunity overnight,"" Israeli Air Force fighter jets struck a manned command centre, killing Shadmani, who was described as ""the most senior military commander and the closest figure to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.Shadmani had assumed his position just days earlier, succeeding Gholam Ali Rashid, who was also killed in an Israeli strike. The IDF noted that Shadmani had commanded both the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Iranian armed forces, and his death represents a significant blow to Iran's military leadership. This operation marks the second such elimination within five days, following the death of his predecessor.The ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Tuesday confirmed that Indian students in Tehran have been moved out of the city for safety reasons, with arrangements made by the Embassy of India. In light of the worsening security situation, other Indian residents who are self-sufficient in terms of transport have also been advised to relocate to safer areas outside the capital.“Indian students in Tehran have been moved out of the city for reasons of safety, through arrangements made by the Embassy. Other residents who are self-sufficient in terms of transport have also been advised to move out of the city in view of the developing situation,” the MEA said.The ministry also stated that some Indian nationals had been assisted in leaving Iran through the border with Armenia.The Embassy remains in regular contact with the Indian community and continues to offer all feasible assistance. “Further advisories may be issued given the fluid situation,” the MEA added.The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that Iran had launched another salvo of missiles toward Israel in the early hours of Tuesday. Air raid sirens sounded across northern Israel, and residents were ordered to take shelter. While the IDF’s defence systems intercepted many of the missiles. “We will defend American interests,” said White House spokesperson Alex Pfeiffer, confirming US forces remained in a defensive posture. Despite the fresh attacks, there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage from the latest barrage.From Canada’s G7 summit, President Donald Trump issued a warning: “Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!” He reiterated on Truth Social that “IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON,” and blamed Iran for not signing the deal he had proposed. Soon after the post, the White House announced Trump would return to Washington ahead of schedule “because of what’s going on in the Middle East.” National Security Council members were called into the Situation Room as Trump signalled the US would remain on high alert.The G7 summit in Canada saw a major rift as President Trump refused to endorse a joint statement calling for de-escalation. European leaders, including Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer, had pushed for a unified message affirming Israel’s right to self-defence and condemning Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Trump’s refusal blocked consensus. According to CNN, Trump had given Iran a two-month ultimatum earlier this year, and the current strikes were timed to follow that deadline. His exit from the summit symbolised the shifting priorities of US foreign policy amid a rapidly widening conflict.On Monday, Israel’s military issued a mass evacuation warning to around 330,000 people in central Tehran, targeting an area that includes Iran’s state TV headquarters, police buildings, and three major hospitals—one linked to the Revolutionary Guard. The warning comes as part of Israel’s ongoing air campaign against Iran, which has already prompted large-scale displacement.Tehran, home to roughly 9.5 million people, has seen a surge in people fleeing the city. One resident, Alireza, told The Washington Post he left for Gilan province after an airstrike hit near his home: “We were lucky to leave very early… the roads got really crowded.”Both The Post and The New York Times reported long queues at petrol stations, with some resorting to rationing, after Israel targeted vital energy infrastructure including refineries and fuel depots.China’s embassy in Israel on Tuesday urged its citizens to leave the country “as soon as possible” . In a statement on WeChat, the embassy advised Chinese nationals to exit via land border crossings, “on the precondition that they can guarantee their personal safety,” adding, “It is recommended to depart in the direction of Jordan.” The embassy warned that the conflict is “continuing to escalate,” noting, “Much civilian infrastructure has been damaged, civilian casualties are on the rise, and the security situation is becoming more serious. ”Air travel was thrown into chaos as airspace closures rippled across the region. Iran’s skies remain entirely shut, while Israel closed Ben Gurion Airport “until further notice.” Airports in Iraq and parts of Lebanon also shut down, leaving tens of thousands stranded. “The domino effect here is massive,” aviation safety expert John Cox told AP. Flights were grounded, crews misplaced, and airlines faced mounting losses as the region braced for further escalation.Despite the military escalation, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News that President Trump was still open to a nuclear deal with Iran. “We are postured defensively in the region to be strong in pursuit of a peace deal,” Hegseth said, confirming he was en route to the Situation Room to brief the president. Trump echoed the sentiment at the G7, suggesting Iran was “at the negotiating table” and that “a deal will be signed.” Yet his statements were coupled with warnings and calls for evacuation, reflecting a dual-track strategy.Iran’s counter-offensive has grown fiercer. The Islamic Republic fired over 100 ballistic missiles overnight, bringing the total launched since Friday to more than 370. Iranian officials also confirmed three drone strikes on the South Pars gas complex, the country’s main production hub. The attacks, they said, were in direct retaliation for Israeli airstrikes that have so far killed at least 224 people in Iran. Officials vowed further responses to what they termed “aggression against the homeland.”","The conflict between Israel and Iran continued to escalate for a fifth day pushing the region to the edge of a full-scale war.

HELLSCAPE Tel Aviv! Iran’s Terrifying Attack Quakes Israeli City; IDF ‘Fails’ To Intercept Missiles

'Evacuate NOW': Iran's Terrifying BOMBING Threat To Israeli Media Houses After State TV Attack





Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday accused Iran of pushing the region toward a ""forever war"" and warned the situation is approaching the ""brink of a nuclear war.""In a wide-ranging interview with ABC News, Netanyahu argued that the only way to end hostilities is by directly targeting the Iranian regime's leadership - including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.When asked about reports that US President Donald Trump rejected an Israeli proposal to assassinate Khamenei due to fears of escalation, Netanyahu countered, ""It's not going to escalate the conflict, it's going to end the conflict.""The remarks come as tensions between Israel and Iran have surged since a wave of airstrikes and missile exchanges erupted late last week. Netanyahu squarely blamed Iran for regional instability, pointing to its alleged involvement in attacks across the Middle East.""We've had half a century of conflict spread by this regime that terrorizes everyone in the Middle East; has bombed the Aramco oil fields in Saudi Arabia; is spreading terrorism and subversion and sabotage everywhere,"" he said.""The 'forever war' is what Iran wants, and they're bringing us to the brink of nuclear war. In fact, what Israel is doing is preventing this, bringing an end to this aggression, and we can only do so by standing up to the forces of evil.""Asked directly if Israel would target Iran’s supreme leader, Netanyahu responded, ""We're doing what we need to do."" He added, ""I'm not going to get into the details, but we've targeted their top nuclear scientists. It's basically Hitler's nuclear team.""Netanyahu appealed to American interests, warning that the threat Iran poses is not limited to Israel. ""Today, it's Tel Aviv. Tomorrow, it's New York. Look, I understand 'America First'. I don't understand 'America Dead'. That's what these people want. They chant 'Death to America.'""""So we're doing something that is in the service of mankind, of humanity, and it's a battle of good against evil. America does, should, and does stand with the good. That's what President Trump is doing, And I deeply appreciate his support,"" he said.The Israeli leader also dismissed a Wall Street Journal report that Iran is seeking to de-escalate and resume nuclear talks. ""I'm not surprised. I mean, they want to continue to have these fake talks in which they lie, they cheat, they string the US along. And, you know, we have very solid Intel on that,"" he said. ""They want to keep on building their nuclear weapons and building their mass ballistic missile arsenal, which they're firing at our people. ""He rejected the idea of halting strikes in exchange for renewed diplomacy, adding, ""They want to continue to create the two existential threats against Israel while they're talking. That's not going to happen.""When asked about criticism from US conservatives like commentator Tucker Carlson who oppose military support for Israel, Netanyahu reiterated the global threat he believes Iran poses: ""Iran is a threat to the entire world.""The Israeli PM again echoed his recent birthday message to President Trump, saying, ""We're not just fighting our enemy. We're fighting your enemy. For God's sake, they chant, 'death to Israel, death to America.' We're simply on their way. And this could reach America soon.""Pressed on whether he would halt military action if President Trump requested a diplomatic pause, Netanyahu was non-committal but praised Trump’s leadership: ""Well, President Trump has been a great leader, a great leader of the world, and a great leader and a great friend of Israel, and he put forward the terms very clearly in the negotiations.""""He said Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, and in order for it not to have a nuclear weapon, it cannot have the capacity to enrich uranium, which is the prerequisite for nuclear weapons.""","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran is pushing the region toward a ""forever war"" Netanyahu argued that the only way to end hostilities is by directly targeting the Iranian regime's leadership - including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

As night attacks stretch into Tuesday morning, global leaders express concern while military actions intensify between Israel and Iran. Confrontation have escalated sharply, with fresh explosions reported in Tehran late Monday night.State-linked Fars News Agency said Iran’s air defences were activated over the capital after blasts were heard in the eastern part of the city.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards announced the ninth wave of drone and missile strikes targeting Israel. A spokesman for the Guards said these attacks would continue “without interruption until dawn,” highlighting Iran’s intent to sustain pressure overnight.In a retaliatory warning, Iranian authorities have told Israel to evacuate the headquarters of Channels 12 and 14. This followed an Israeli airstrike on IRINN, a state-run television channel in Tehran on Monday, which forced a news presenter to flee during a live broadcast.Iranian authorities have claimed that they uncovered and shut down a drone manufacturing site in Tehran allegedly linked to Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency. According to Iranian state media, two individuals accused of working with Mossad were arrested in separate operations in Tehran and Alborz provinces.The Israel Defence Forces have confirmed missile detections across several areas following Iran’s latest wave of attacks. Sirens were activated as part of emergency procedures, and the Israeli Air Force has launched strikes on missile infrastructure in western Iran. Israeli officials claim to have achieved air superiority over Tehran, saying that a significant portion of Iran’s missile launchers has already been destroyed.The United States has moved quickly to adjust its military posture in the Middle East. Defence secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed the deployment of additional assets to the region, saying the move is meant to enhance the safety of American forces. In a statement on social media, Hegseth said, “Protecting US forces is our top priority”.Tehran has submitted a formal complaint to the United Nations, accusing Israel of deliberately targeting its nuclear facilities. In a letter to UN Secretary-General António Guterres and the Security Council, Iran’s representative, Amir Saeid Iravani, cited recent Israeli airstrikes on the Natanz nuclear complex and referred to a 1981 Security Council resolution condemning similar actions.Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has strongly criticised Israel’s actions, saying they undermine ongoing nuclear negotiations with the United States. During calls with foreign ministers from France, Britain, Germany, and the European Union, Araghchi said that Israel’s military aggression is “a blow to diplomacy.”US president Donald Trump has urged Iran to agree to a deal, repeating his warning that Iran must not be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. In a social media post, he told residents of Tehran to “immediately evacuate” and criticised Iran for not signing the deal he had earlier proposed. Despite the worsening crisis, Trump has not joined other G7 leaders in calling for de-escalation. The White House later confirmed that Trump would leave the G7 summit in Canada a day early to focus on the unfolding conflict.","Iran’s Revolutionary Guards announced the ninth wave of drone and missile strikes targeting Israel.

Political Pressure Closes In



Starmer Responds



Why a Statutory Inquiry Matters



Subpoena witnesses, including former officials, police officers, and social workers;

Demand the release of classified documents and internal reports;

Take testimony from survivors in private or public;

Recommend structural reforms for law enforcement, social services, and public communication.

For many survivors, this is the first time they feel their voices might lead to actual accountability.

What Happens Next



Musk’s involvement, while controversial, showed how digital platforms can force action on long-ignored issues.

Starmer’s government is now under pressure to implement swift reforms and offer compensation to survivors.

The political debate has sharpened, with opposition parties vowing to make grooming gangs a central issue in the next election.

Final Word







After years of public outcry, multiple local reviews, and political hesitation, the UK government has announced a full national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs and institutional failures that enabled decades of child sexual exploitation.The decision, announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer on June 14, marks a dramatic shift in tone for his administration—one that had previously resisted demands for a public investigation into what many see as one of Britain’s worst safeguarding scandals.The tipping point? A perfect storm of political pressure, survivor testimony, community backlash—and unusually, a global spotlight powered by Elon Musk , who used his platform, X (formerly Twitter), to repeatedly target Starmer’s record on grooming gangs.The term “grooming gangs” refers to loosely organised groups of men who exploited underage girls—typically white, working-class, and often in care—in towns across northern England from the early 1990s onwards.The 2014 Jay Report on Rotherham, commissioned after investigative journalism exposed widespread abuse, identified over 1,400 victims between 1997 and 2013. Similar patterns were later uncovered in Rochdale, Telford, Oxford, and Oldham.What made the cases especially sensitive was the ethnic background of many offenders—in several high-profile cases, the perpetrators were men of Pakistani Muslim heritage. However, the official framing used the broader term “Asian grooming gangs”—a euphemism that triggered resentment among British Indians, Sikhs, and East Asians who said their communities were being unfairly implicated.British-Indian communities, especially Hindus and Sikhs, have long objected to the blanket use of the term “Asian grooming gangs.” Their frustration boiled over in January this year when Starmer, in response to criticism from Elon Musk, once again used the phrase during a televised interview.Community leaders issued sharp statements denouncing what they called an ethnic smear. “Why should we be classified as part of these gangs?” asked Jay Shah, spokesperson for Friends of India Society International UK. “Asian means Vietnamese, Sri Lankan, Japanese, Indian, etc. When it comes to grooming gangs, we are Asian. When it comes to Kashmir, we are Indian.”The Hindu Council UK called Starmer’s wording a “whitewash of heinous atrocities,” noting that Hindu and Sikh girls had also been among the victims. Sikh Youth UK, which has documented grooming cases involving Sikh victims for over 15 years, said it had worked with thousands of families and even caught perpetrators outside Sikh schools. The Network of Sikh Organisations described Starmer’s comments as “extremely disappointing” and accused politicians of “protecting perpetrators rather than victims.”Both the Hindu Council UK and INSIGHT UK have since backed Conservative calls for a national inquiry—arguing that political correctness has too often silenced honest debate about ethnicity and crime.The turning point came not from Westminster but from Silicon Valley.In early 2025, Elon Musk—whose X platform has grown into a global political amplifier—began posting repeatedly about grooming gangs. Quoting survivor testimonies, reposting historical reporting, and tagging British officials, Musk accused UK authorities of “turning a blind eye to organised rape” and suggested that political leaders, including Starmer, were “cowards unwilling to confront the truth.”One post from March read: “If these were elite London girls being trafficked, the BBC would talk about nothing else. But poor northern girls? The state looked away.”While the tone of Musk’s commentary sparked debate—especially among British politicians who viewed it as inflammatory—it undeniably brought renewed international attention to the issue.By May, Musk’s X account had posted or amplified over 150 messages about grooming gangs, triggering renewed media coverage, a spike in search interest, and thousands of public responses. Hashtags such as #JusticeForRotherham, #GroomingGangsInquiry, and #StarmerFailedUs trended across the UK and US.The growing visibility added fuel to a debate already brewing in Parliament.In January, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper had quietly commissioned Baroness Louise Casey to conduct a “rapid review” into previous investigations—including Oldham and Rochdale—after persistent claims that public officials downplayed or ignored evidence of abuse.Casey’s report, delivered in May, was damning. It found that multiple public bodies “failed in their duty of care” and that in some cases, victims were dismissed or even blamed. Crucially, it called for a full statutory public inquiry with the ability to compel testimony and evidence.Simultaneously, Conservative MPs, Reform UK leaders, and victim advocacy groups demanded action. Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman, a long-time critic of the “Asian gangs” terminology, stated that Starmer had “run out of excuses.” Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called the lack of a national inquiry “a betrayal of Britain’s daughters.”On June 14, Keir Starmer announced the establishment of a judge-led inquiry under the 2005 Inquiries Act, which gives it full legal powers. He said the investigation would “examine past failures, hold institutions to account, and ensure this can never happen again.”Starmer, who previously served as Director of Public Prosecutions, defended his record, pointing to a rise in grooming-related prosecutions during his tenure. But critics argue that his earlier reluctance to endorse a national inquiry allowed the issue to fester—and exposed Labour to accusations of institutional denial.“There is no more denying the scale of failure,” Starmer said at a press conference. “This inquiry is about justice—for survivors, for their families, and for the country.”Unlike previous reviews—many of which lacked transparency and enforcement—this inquiry has legal teeth. It can:The inquiry will take several months to set up, with hearings likely to begin in early 2026. Its findings could reshape the way Britain handles child protection, race relations, and public accountability. But in the short term, it’s already had an impact:This is not just a story of abuse—it’s a story of institutional failure, political caution, and the new ways power is exercised across borders and platforms. Whether the inquiry delivers justice remains to be seen. But for the thousands of girls whose pain was ignored—and for the communities wrongly smeared along the way—this is a reckoning long overdue.","After years of public outcry, multiple local reviews, and political hesitation, the UK government has announced a full national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs.

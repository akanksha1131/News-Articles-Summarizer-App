"Canada's Justin Trudeau faces internal revolt, calls for resignation grow",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/time-for-pm-to-step-aside-canadas-trudeau-faces-internal-revolt-calls-for-resignation-grow/articleshow/116584503.cms,"Canada PM Justin Trudeau (NYT photo)

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is under growing pressure to step down as support within his own Liberal Party continues to crumble. On Sunday, former allies spoke out, saying many Liberal MPs now believe it’s time for him to resign.The turmoil comes after the unexpected resignation of deputy PM and finance minister Chrystia Freeland, a key figure in Trudeau’s government for nearly a decade. Freeland reportedly clashed with Trudeau over US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose 25% tariffs on Canadian imports. Her departure has sparked more criticism from within the party.Chandra Arya, an MP from Ottawa, told CBC on Sunday, ""A majority of the caucus thinks it is time for the prime minister to step aside."" This came after a meeting of Liberal MPs from Ontario on Saturday, where more than 50 of the 75 MPs reportedly said they no longer support Trudeau.Anthony Housefather, an MP from Quebec, also called for Trudeau to leave, saying, ""The prime minister needs to go. We're in an impossible situation if he stays."" Housefather warned that the party would face major losses in an election if Trudeau remains leader.Trudeau is reportedly meeting with advisers to decide his next steps. While the next election is scheduled for October 2025, many believe it could happen much sooner. Trudeau attempted to address criticism by reshuffling a third of his cabinet on Friday.Adding to the pressure, New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh announced on Friday that his party would back efforts to topple Trudeau’s minority government early next year. This is a change from the NDP’s previous position of opposing non-confidence votes.If another non-confidence vote is held, the NDP’s support would likely lead to the government’s collapse.Trudeau, who led the Liberals to election victories in 2015, 2019, and 2021, is now trailing Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre by 20 points in public opinion polls.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is under growing pressure to step down as support within his own Liberal Party continues to crumble.

A bridge connecting two Brazilian states collapsed Sunday, killing at least one person and causing a sulfuric acid spill. The incident occurred on the BR-226 highway between Estreito, Maranhão, and Aguiarnópolis, Tocantins.As per Reuters report, it was the central section of the 533-meter Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira Bridge that gave way as vehicles crossed.A city councilman from Aguiarnópolis, Elias Junior, was filming a video highlighting safety concerns about the bridge when it suddenly gave way. During his recording, Junior was appealing to authorities to address the structural issues of the bridge, emphasising its inability to support heavy lorry traffic. As he was demonstrating a significant crack along the bridge's shoulder, the whole structure started to crumble forcing him to retreat hastily.As a result of the collapse, a tanker truck carrying sulfuric acid fell into the Tocantins River, according to the National Department of Transport Infrastructure.Rescue workers confirmed one death and rescued one survivor. Preliminary reports quoted by Reuters indicate two trucks, a car, and a motorcycle also plunged into the river, which is over 50 meters deep, potentially involving 11 people.Divers suspended their search Sunday evening after discovering a submerged tanker leaking sulfuric acid, the Tocantins fire department reported.The bridge, opened in 1960, is a reinforced concrete structure. It forms part of the BR-226 highway linking Brasília to Belém, the planned host city for next year's UN Climate Change Conference.","A bridge connecting two Brazilian states collapsed Sunday, killing at least one person and causing a sulfuric acid spill.

Police confirmed that he did not know the victim and had no prior criminal record in New York City. He was found riding another train, still wearing the same gray hoodie and paint-splattered pants from the attack, reported the New York Post.The New York Police Department (NYPD) launched a manhunt for Zapeta, which led to his arrest after he was spotted by a passenger on a train at 34th Street in Manhattan. The passenger alerted the police, who were able to track him down. While Zapeta has been detained, authorities have yet to press formal charges, and the investigation is ongoing.According to sources from The New York Post, a lighter was allegedly found in Zapeta’s possession at the time of his arrest. Further details about Zapeta's background are expected to be revealed at a press conference scheduled by the NYPD at Police Plaza at 1 pm local time.The tragic event took place at 7:30 am when officers responded to reports of a fire at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue subway station.

A calm yet chilling attack

A swift arrest

Elon Musk’s fiery response

A shaken city

A city on edge

The New York City subway witnessed one of its most horrifying incidents on Sunday morning when a sleeping passenger was set on fire aboard an F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station . The attack, which NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch described as “one of the most depraved crimes one person could possibly commit,” left the victim dead and stunned commuters and authorities alike.At 7:30 am, as the F train idled at the station, a man approached the victim—a woman seated quietly at the end of the subway car. Without hesitation, he used a lighter to ignite her clothing, as reported by the New York Post. “The suspect calmly walked up to the victim … and used what we believe to be a lighter to ignite the victim’s clothing, which became fully engulfed in a matter of seconds,” Tisch explained during a press conference.Patrolling officers, drawn by the smell and sight of smoke, found the woman engulfed in flames. Though they quickly extinguished the fire, she succumbed to her injuries at the scene. Chilling video footage showed the suspect watching the horrifying spectacle unfold, his demeanor disturbingly detached.The suspect fled the scene but was soon apprehended, thanks to quick-thinking officers and observant citizens, reported the Post. He was found riding another train, still wearing the same gray hoodie and paint-splattered pants from the attack. Tisch credited the public for their role in the arrest, saying, “I want to thank the young people who called 911 to help. They saw something, and they said something, and they did something.”The man, identified as a migrant from Guatemala, had previously entered the US in 2018 through Arizona. Authorities are still determining his immigration status. Police confirmed that he did not know the victim and had no prior criminal record in New York City.The brutal attack even caught the attention of Tesla and X owner Elon Musk, who took to his platform to express outrage. Responding to a post on X that read, “The man who set an innocent woman on fire on the New York Subway, Sebastian Zapeta, is a recent ‘MIGRANT’ from Guatemala. The Biden regime REFUSED to deport him, and an innocent woman lost her life as a result. MASS DEPORTATIONS NOW!” Musk commented, “Enough is enough.”The tech billionaire’s statement has added fuel to an already heated debate about immigration policies and crime rates, with critics and supporters engaging in fiery exchanges online.The crime scene became a somber spectacle for commuters and MTA workers. Around 1 pm, the woman’s charred body was removed from the train, leaving witnesses in shock. “It just looked like all the clothes were burnt off,” one MTA worker recounted. Another commuter, Alex Gureyev, lamented, “It’s scary … Everybody keeps saying it’s going back to the seventies. It’s a frequent occurrence—muggings, killings, fighting, shootings. Very bad.”The attack has reignited concerns about subway safety. Governor Kathy Hochul had recently deployed 1,000 National Guard troops to patrol the subway system during the holiday rush, but crime continues to surge. Subway murders have risen by 60% this year, with eight people killed as of September, compared to five during the same period last year.The heinous attack capped off a violent 24-hour period on the subway. Earlier that day, separate incidents included a deadly stabbing during an argument on a Queens-bound 7 train and an assault on a conductor on a northbound D train.","A sleeping passenger was set on fire aboard an F train at the Coney Island- Stillwell Avenue station.

Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption drive targets record number of ‘tigers’ this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/xi-jinpings-anti-corruption-drive-targets-record-number-of-tigers-this-year/articleshow/116564279.cms,"Heightened scrutiny on central agencies

Challenges within the PLA

Chinese President Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign in 2024 hit a new record, with 56 senior officials—all at vice-ministerial rank or higher—being placed under investigation. This marks a nearly 25% increase from the 45 high-ranking officials investigated in 2023, according to a report by the South China Morning Post.These investigations are headed by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), China’s top anti-corruption watchdog.The campaign’s scope has widened, with corruption cases in top party organs and ministries doubling in 2024. Notable increases were also seen in the aviation and defense industries. However, corruption cases in the finance sector—a major focus in 2023—have declined. Four senior state bankers were investigated this year, compared to eight in the previous year.Twelve of the 56 officials detained this year held roles in the central Communist Party and state agencies—double the number in 2023. This indicates a growing emphasis on targeting corruption within the top echelons of the party apparatus and ministries.Since launching his anti-corruption drive in 2012, Xi has pursued a relentless campaign to root out both high-level “tigers” and low-level “flies.” The military, particularly the PLA Rocket Force responsible for overseeing China’s nuclear arsenal, has been a focal point of this effort.Corruption within the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) continue to pose significant challenges to Xi Jinping's rule in China. These issues are more than a financial burden for Xi; they undermine the effectiveness of China’s armed forces at a time of rising geopolitical tensions. Xi’s vision to transform the PLA into a global military powerhouse hinges on addressing these internal vulnerabilities.Critics argue that Xi’s consolidation of power may exacerbate corruption, as centralized authority and a lack of institutional checks allow malpractices to flourish. The opaque nature of China’s political and military systems further complicates efforts to measure the extent of corruption or its impact on military capabilities.The anti-corruption purges are reshaping the power balance within the PLA and the broader Communist Party. Even senior loyalists are not immune, as evidenced by the investigation of high-profile figures like Miao Hua, a key player in the PLA Rocket Force.","Chinese President Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign in 2024 hit a new record, with 56 senior officials placed under investigation.

The couple previously celebrated their engagement in Positano, Italy, joined by notable figures such as Bill Gates, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Queen Rania of Jordan according to the New York Post.Bezos and Sanchez have kept their wedding plans private, with no official confirmation of the date. The couple has been inseparable since they began dating in 2018, making their relationship public in 2019 shortly after Bezos finalised his divorce from MacKenzie Scott.Rumours of their engagement first surfaced in December 2019 when Sanchez was seen wearing a massive heart-shaped ring. Bezos officially proposed in May 2023 aboard his $500 million mega-yacht, presenting Sanchez with a cushion-cut pink diamond valued at $2.5 million.The bride-to-be shares three children: Nikko, 23, with former NFL player Tony Gonzalez, and Ella, 16, and Evan, 18, with ex-husband Patrick Whitesell. Bezos has three children with his ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott.Meanwhile, as news of the lavish wedding unfolds, Amazon is facing a nationwide workers' strike.

The victim’s families that once trusted educator are now telling her to “burn in hell.”Alissa McCommon , a fourth-grade teacher from Tipton County , admitted to charges related to five of her potential 21 victims. The fourth grade teacher also had her license revoked according to the New York Post.Previously accused of assaulting a former student in 2021, McCommon pleaded guilty to rape, statutory rape, sexual exploitation and solicitation of minors.Circuit Court Judge Blake Neill imposed the sentence, with all charges running concurrently and no possibility of parole. McCommon, will also be required to register as a violent sex offender and is prohibited from contacting any of her victims.According to WREG, the former Charger Academy educator built relationships with the preteens in her class by playing video games with them, following them on social media, and befriending their mothers, all while exploiting her position of authority.McCommon developed a strong attachment to one student, contacting him more than 200 times and sending explicit photos via Snapchat. In one message, she threatened to take her life if he ended their relationship, according to the outlet.Investigation into McCommon was initiated in 2021 and a mother also reported inappropriate texts from the teacher to her son in 2023. McCommon was suspended from her position without pay on August 24, 2023, and arrested on September 8, 2023, following a 23-count indictment for multiple sexual offenses involving several students, according to Tipton County District Attorney Mark Davidson.She was released on bond but was re-arrested less than a month later for violating her release conditions by contacting one of her victims. During this time, McCommon also told one of the boys that she was pregnant with his child.McCommon, a mother of two beforehand, said she was ready to bring their alleged child into the world. DNA evidence further confirmed the former teacher’s claims that he was the father, according to WREG.A judge later ruled that McCommon would have “no contact with the infant child.”The victim’s mother said the newborn would not be influenced by its felony mother and that McCommon has to face her punishments.“The innocent child will be loved and raised without your influence. There’s no amount of time they can give you that will equal what God will give you. You will burn in hell.”Davidson applauded McCommon’s guilty plea and subsequent prison sentence.“We are glad that we were able to achieve finality, certainty and closure for the victims and their families and the Tipton County community in this case.”","Alissa McCommon, a fourth-grade teacher from Tipton County, admitted to charges related to five of her potential 21 victims.

Trump taps billionaire Stephen Feinberg to be deputy defence secretary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-taps-billionaire-stephen-feinberg-to-be-deputy-defence-secretary/articleshow/116582417.cms,"President-elect Donald Trump announced on Sunday tapped Stephen Feinberg , a billionaire supporter with ties to the defence contracting industry , for the role of deputy secretary of defence . The announcement, made on Trump’s social media platform, follows reports that the offer was extended to Feinberg earlier in December.Feinberg serves as co-CEO of Cerberus Capital Management , an investment firm with interests in hypersonic missile development and a former owner of the private military contractor DynCorp , which was acquired by Amentum in 2020.During Trump’s first term, Feinberg chaired the president’s Intelligence Advisory Board , which advises the president on intelligence and counterintelligence matters. Trump praised Feinberg as “an extremely successful businessman” who would contribute to “Making the Pentagon Great Again.”The role of deputy defence secretary involves overseeing the daily operations of the defence department, a vast organization comprising over three million military and civilian personnel. The appointment carries heightened significance amid debates over Trump’s nominee for defence secretary, Pete Hegseth , a former Fox News contributor who has faced controversy.Hegseth’s past includes an allegation of sexual assault in 2017 by a woman who claimed he raped her at a California Republican women’s event. While no charges were filed after a police and prosecutor review, Hegseth’s attorney stated the encounter was consensual and described the woman as the initiator, adding that Hegseth had been “visibly intoxicated” at the time.Trump also nominated additional defence-related appointments on Sunday. He nominated Elbridge A. Colby , a former deputy assistant secretary of defence known for his hawkish stance on China and advocacy for defending Taiwan in potential conflicts, as undersecretary for policy. Keith Bass, a retired Navy officer who previously led the White House Medical Unit under both the Obama and Trump administrations, was named as the pick for assistant secretary of defence for health affairs.","Stephen Feinberg is co-CEO of Cerberus Capital Management and a former owner of private military contractor DynCorp.

Young nuns: Two diverse paths to a rare life of faith,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/young-nuns-two-diverse-paths-to-a-rare-life-of-faith/articleshow/116582188.cms,"Young nuns: Two diverse paths to a rare life of faith

From Ghana to Texas to a New Orleans convent

A family comes to terms with daughter’s choice

Less than 1% of Catholic nuns in the United States today are 30 or younger. Seyram Adzokpa and Zoey Stapleton are two of the young women who have made the rare decision to join a religious community and begin the long process to become nuns. Here are their stories.The first time Sister Seyram Mary Adzokpa felt pulled toward religious life was walking in a Texas Walmart, at the age of 25, with her mother.Born in Ghana, Adzokpa had never encountered a nun. Her family attended the Catholic church faithfully, but she knew nothing of the religious life and always thought marriage would be her path.“I wanted a husband like my dad. With three kids. I had the names of my two girls picked out,” she said.Eleven years after moving to the United States she was introduced to this new possibility as she watched two Dominican sisters enter the store.“I still cannot describe the feeling,” she said remembering how perfectly pressed their habits were. “My heart just — I can’t explain what it felt like — but it was a pull.”But it wasn’t until the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, about a year later, that she fully embraced the call.“There was fear. Absolutely,” said Adzokpa, who at the time was working on the front lines as a nurse.“However, there was also a desire to cling, or reach out for someone who knew what was going on. And that person would be God.”Her spiritual director at church encouraged her to explore the call and “date” Jesus. “I guess you can say sort of like an imaginary friend,” she said.She cooked with Jesus, cleaned with Jesus, even had date nights with Jesus, setting the table for two at dinner and selecting movies to watch together.It was on one of these date nights when Adzokpa came across a film about the Venerable Henriette DeLille, one of three founders of the Sisters of the Holy Family in New Orleans, the community which she would officially join in late September 2021 at 27-years-old.But before she could join, she had to tell her family. And as a child of immigrants, she feared disappointing them.“They made this trip for us,” she said. “Came to the United States for better education, better life, a career, the American dream, right? And then here I am telling them that I’m throwing it all away to go be poor and obedient and chaste.”To her surprise, their support was overwhelming.“I thank God for that,” she said.Three years later, Adzokpa has said her temporary vows with the order and is using her nursing experience to help care for the elderly sisters in the community whose average age is about 80.She’s found a balance between medicine and spirituality that she’d been craving but was missing out in the world.“Despite having a career and a life that I enjoyed, still being able to respond to this call is God’s persistence,” she said. “I truly believe that when he calls you, he will hunt you down. He will not stop fighting.”Similarly to Adzokpa, it was a challenge for Zoey Stapleton, 24, to fathom being apart from her family so permanently. But if she were to pursue the persistent call to religious life, this would be the reality.“We have a very, very tight bond,” said Stapleton, who grew up an only child just outside of Hershey, Pennsylvania. “So obviously, entering into this new arena, this new adventure, means that we’re going to be separated.”After receiving an undergraduate degree in clinical psychology and a masters in mental health counseling from Franciscan University in Ohio, she found herself back home in Palmyra, enjoying time with family and friends before entering her pivotal next chapter.Steam rose around her cheeks as she sautéed vegetables while cooking dinner with her mother, Peggy, on an evening in July. Her father, Tom, occasionally walked into the kitchen, reminiscing over old family photos and discussing their upcoming annual trip to the New Jersey coast.This would be their last family vacation before Stapleton entered the religious community, the Franciscan Sisters, T.O.R. of Penance of the Sorrowful Mother, in Toronto, Ohio.They set the kitchen table for dinner and as the sun faded out the back windows, they sat to bow their heads in prayer before enjoying the home-cooked meal.Although the news of both her decision and acceptance into the religious institute didn’t come as a complete surprise to her parents, their own acceptance wasn’t always easy.Choking back tears after dinner, Peggy remembered asking her fellow parishioners at St. Joan of Arc Catholic Church to pray for them.“This is a change of life,” Peggy said to her daughter as they sat together in the living room. “You’re giving up so many worldly things.”Zoey, who still enjoys painting, used to draw pictures of the house she hoped to have in Hershey, said Peggy. “It was like it just came crashing down.”But after weeks of processing, she found peace. “What can be better than Jesus, God asking your daughter to be so close to him?”The conversation ended in laughter as Peggy asked her daughter when the community’s chapel was open to the public, hinting at her future visits.In early August, Zoey joined the order as a postulant. She waved from the steps of the motherhouse as her parents drove down the winding driveway, her mother waving back from the sunroof of their car.And just months later, as the sisters’ voices rang out into the vaulted wood ceilings of the chapel during Mass, her parents could be found in the pews just a few rows behind her.",Less than 1% of Catholic nuns in the United States today are 30 or younger. Seyram Adzokpa and Zoey Stapleton are two of the young women who have made the rare decision to join a religious community.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116582306,imgsize-30616,width-400,resizemode-4/116582306.jpg"
Trump upending politics globally a month before he takes office,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-upending-politics-globally-a-month-before-he-takes-office/articleshow/116582211.cms,"Donald Trump (AP file photo)

His second term doesn’t start for a month, but Donald Trump is already sending shockwaves around the world.His trade threats helped set off a cabinet crisis in Canada that has Prime Minister Justin Trudeau teetering. In Europe, tariff fears have weakened already-wobbling governments.Allied leaders are racing to find ways to keep up support for Ukraine as Trump drives for a quick deal to end Russia’s invasion. The prospect of talks has both sides pushing on the battlefield, with Moscow using its most sophisticated missiles and Kyiv taking the fight to the Russian capital with the brazen assassination of a general.In the Middle East, the Trump-friendly leaders of Israel and Turkey are pressing for advantage as Iran, a perennial target of the incoming president, reels from setbacks for its proxies Hezbollah and Hamas and the abrupt fall of the dictator it backed in Syria.China, which has largely avoided Trump’s post-election social media spotlight so far, is shoring up its trade defenses ahead of what’s expected to be an onslaught from the new administration.“We’re on Trump time and we want to get stuff done in a hurry,” Keith Kellogg, the retired general Trump has named as his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, told Fox Business on Dec. 18 as he prepared for his first trip to the region - even before the inauguration. “He made promises on the campaign trail and we’re going to fulfill those promises.”While it’s not unusual for political leaders at home and abroad to jockey for the ear of an incoming president, the scale of Trump’s pre-inauguration influence is vast.“There’s new light all over the world, not just here,” Trump claimed in a Phoenix speech Sunday.That came after he’d warned Panama that the US objects to rates to use the Panama Canal and is concerned about growing Chinese influence over the conduit — going so far as to say he might demand its return to American control.Domestically, he spent the last week steering talks on a spending bill to avoid a government shutdown. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said policymakers are beginning to factor in some of the president-elect’s potential moves, such as tariffs. The US stock market and bitcoin have rallied since the election, something Trump likes to take credit for. President Joe Biden, meanwhile, has all but vanished from the stage.For the world, the turmoil is a taste of what the new Trump term is likely to bring, as the incoming president pushes his “America First” agenda without many of the guardrails that constrained his first term. Populist forces are on the rise in many countries, with Trump allies challenging establishment leaders.Fresh from a tweet storm that influenced the spending-bill talks in Washington, billionaire Trump confidant Elon Musk Friday turned his attention to Europe, endorsing the far-right AfD party as the only way to “save Germany.”That earned him a rebuke from embattled Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who faces snap elections in February with support for his party dropping amid deepening economic woes. Musk stepped up the pressure Saturday, calling on Scholz to resign after a deadly attack on a Christmas market.In the UK, Trump’s ascent has emboldened Nigel Farage of the populist Reform UK party, who met with Musk at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate last week. UK lawmakers are weighing changing donation rules to prevent Musk from barging in.The stakes are possibly highest for Ukraine, where Russia’s full-scale invasion is nearly three years old and allied support for Kyiv is showing signs of flagging.Trump isn’t promising to deliver a deal to end the fighting even before he takes office as he did on the campaign trail, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has already given up his earlier demand that Russia cede all the land it’s taken as part of any ceasefire deal.Germany’s Scholz held his first direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in two years last month, drawing fierce criticism from Zelenskyy. Until now, it’s largely been Hungary’s Viktor Orban — a Putin sympathizer whom Trump is fond of - seeking to act as an intermediary.On Sunday, Trump himself left the door open to meeting the Kremlin leader, who he claimed “wants to meet me as soon as possible.”Scholz said this month he’s “confident that we can develop a joint strategy for Ukraine.” He has continued to decline to provide Ukraine with long-range Taurus missiles, breaking from Biden’s policy — one Trump thinks is a mistake.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke with Trump by phone and picked Peter Mandelson, a Labor Party veteran and trade specialist, as envoy to Washington. That choice drew criticism from Trump’s former campaign co-manager, Chris LaCivita, who called Mandelson “an absolute moron.”Trump’s impending arrival has also buoyed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He has aligned himself with Trump, who faces fewer political pressures than Biden over the death toll from fighting in Gaza.Netanyahu also sent troops further into Syria after the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime. Turkey, whose leader is another Trump ally, is expanding its reach Syria through groups it supports.“All of these leaders in the Middle East, they know the former president, now the president-elect, they know his team, so it’s kind of a unique moment in history where you have two presidents, and their teams, working on the ceasefire at the same time,” Morgan Ortagus, a former State Department spokeswoman during Trump’s first term, said on Bloomberg Television’s Balance of Power, referring to talks on a deal in Gaza.In India, Trump’s arrival has coincided with an emboldened Narendra Modi preparing to host Putin for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine. Modi is one of the world leaders Trump has cultivated through praise and shows of friendship.China has embarked on something of a charm offensive, including with US allies, ahead of Trump’s return — while also preparing tools for a potential trade war in the form of limits on exports of critical minerals to the US and by signaling a warming with both Japan and India.“In 2016, there was this constant sense of uncertainty, of alarm,” said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Now there’s a fairly robust data set of how Trump behaved and how other countries behaved in reaction to him, and what worked well and what didn’t.”But leaders are already learning that the carefully crafted strategies for dealing with the incoming president don’t always play out as planned.After Trump threatened to slap a 25% tariff on imports from Canada, Trudeau hopped on a plane to Trump’s Florida estate to talk the issue over at dinner. Then he offered a border-security plan to assuage Trump’s concern (even though Canadian officials say migrant flows across the frontier are tiny).Trump’s camp touted that as an early victory. “President Trump is already acting as the president,” Karoline Leavitt, his incoming press secretary, told Fox Business on Sunday.For his part, Trump offered no concessions and has spent the weeks since the dinner trolling Trudeau, suggesting Canada should become the 51st US state and complaining about the trade imbalance between the countries.Now, Trudeau’s government is at risk after his top lieutenant quit, citing in her resignation letter a disagreement over spending and how to prepare for a potential Trump trade war.","Donald Trump is already sending shockwaves around the world.

Agenda for ""Liberation Day""

Panama Canal and foreign policy

Praise for Elon Musk

Vaccine skepticism

and TikTok

Closing rhetoric

President-elect Donald Trump, during his fiery speech at the AmericaFest in Phoenix, Arizona, on Sunday, took a direct swipe at ""woke culture,"" calling it ""bullshit"" and blaming it for undermining America’s strength. The 78-year-old’s comments sparked widespread reactions on social media, including an endorsement from Elon Musk, who tweeted “YES!” alongside a viral clip of Trump’s remarks.“Woke has to stop. It’s destroying our country. Woke is bullshit,” Trump declared, referencing the renaming of US military bases that previously honored Confederate leaders. He pledged to reverse such changes, including restoring the original name of Fort Bragg in North Carolina, now called Fort Liberty.Trump also vowed to end critical race theory and “transgender insanity” in schools, promising a hardline approach to culture war issues as part of his post-inauguration agenda.“I will sign executive orders to end child sexual mutilation, get transgender out of the military, and out of our elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools,” Trump said, signaling his administration's hardline stance.Trump also promised to “keep men out of women’s sports,” emphasizing that “it will be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.”The president-elect’s remarks come amid a growing political divide in the US over transgender rights , with states moving in opposite directions on issues such as medical treatments for minors and access to LGBTQ-themed books in public and school libraries. Republican-controlled states have sought to restrict access, while Democratic states have moved to safeguard transgender rights.In his first rally-like speech since the November election, he also threatened to retake control of the Panama Canal, pushed back on criticism of Elon Musk’s influence, and suggested he could soon meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Trump outlined his plans for his first day in office, which he referred to as ""liberation day."" He vowed to crack down on illegal immigration, expand domestic energy production, and eliminate ""woke ideology"" from public institutions.In a broader policy statement, Trump criticized the renaming of Mount McKinley to Denali during the Obama administration. He promised to restore the mountain’s original name, saying, “McKinley was a very good, maybe a great president. He deserves that honor.”The former president surprised many by suggesting he might seek to reclaim control of the Panama Canal, calling it a “vital national asset.” He criticized Panama’s handling of the canal and demanded it be returned to the US, warning Panamanian officials to “be guided accordingly.” Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino swiftly rebuffed the comments, asserting the canal’s sovereignty and emphasizing cooperation on mutual security issues.Trump also floated the possibility of an early meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. “Bringing the war to an end is one of the things I want to do quickly,” he said, noting that Putin had expressed readiness for talks.Responding to claims that Elon Musk was acting as a “shadow president,” Trump dismissed the idea but praised Musk’s contributions to technology and space exploration. “No, he’s not going to be president. He wasn’t born in this country,” Trump quipped, adding, “I like having smart people.”Trump defended his controversial choice of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Health and Human Services Secretary, hinting at possible investigations into vaccines and their links to autism despite a lack of scientific evidence. “We’re going to find out a lot,” Trump said, emphasizing his goal to “make America healthy again.”On TikTok, Trump expressed openness to allowing the app to continue operating in the US, citing its role in reaching young voters during the 2024 election. “Maybe we gotta keep this sucker around for a little while,” he said.Trump concluded by reiterating his commitment to fulfilling his campaign promises and tackling culture wars head-on. “We’re going to stop woke,” he declared, signaling a combative presidency ahead.","President-elect Donald Trump took a direct swipe at ""woke culture,"" calling it ""bullshit"" and blaming it for undermining America's strength.

What is DOGE?

Miller’s current role

In a significant move to shape his incoming administration, President-elect Donald Trump has named Katie Miller to an advisory board tasked with slashing government regulations and trimming federal agencies. But who is Katie Miller, and why has she emerged as a key figure in this effort?Miller, a veteran of Trump’s first administration, served as deputy press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security and later as press secretary for former Vice President Mike Pence. She is also the wife of Stephen Miller , Trump's incoming deputy chief of staff and homeland security adviser.

She has been a loyal supporter of mine for many years and will bring her professional experience to Government Efficiency,"" Trump announced on Truth Social.The Department of Government Efficiency, an informal advisory board, is spearheaded by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy , two billionaires who have pledged to drastically reduce the size of the federal government. Musk has already outlined ambitious plans to shrink the number of federal agencies from over 400 to just 99. The initiative aims to ""slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,"" Trump said in earlier remarks.While Miller is one of the first named members, Musk and Ramaswamy have yet to unveil the full team. However, their vision has drawn both support and criticism for its bold approach to dismantling what they describe as an ""unaccountable bureaucracy.""Katie Miller is currently serving as the spokesperson for the transition team of Robert Kennedy Jr , Trump’s designated Health and Human Services secretary.

Musk's growing influence in Washington

A controversial agenda

Concluding with familiar flourish

At AmericaFest 2024 in Phoenix, President-elect Donald Trump addressed swirling rumors about ceding his presidency to tech billionaire Elon Musk . Speaking to a lively crowd, Trump dismissed the claims with his trademark candor, joking, “I’m safe, you know why? He wasn’t born in this country.” The remark, referencing Musk’s South African origins, drew laughter and applause from the audience.Rumors had gained traction in some media outlets, but Trump dismissed them outright. “They’re on a new kick,” he said. “All the different hoaxes. The new one is that President Trump has ceded the presidency to Elon Musk. No, no, that’s not happening,” Bloomberg quoted Trump as saying.Despite the speculation, Trump praised Musk, a significant donor to his campaign, for his intelligence and contributions. “Isn’t it nice to have smart people we can rely on? Don’t we want that? But no, he’s not going to be president, that I can tell you,” Trump reiterated.Musk, whose companies heavily interact with federal regulations and contracts, has become a polarizing figure in US policymaking. His influence was evident last week when the Republican-controlled House passed legislation, avoiding a government shutdown, a move attributed partly to Musk’s efforts.Trump recently appointed Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the newly formed Department ofGovernment Efficiency , a temporary agency headquartered at SpaceX's Washington office.In his first rally-style appearance since winning the 2024 election, Trump unveiled a sweeping agenda. Promising to rebuild urban centers , cut taxes, and increase wages, he declared January 20 as “liberation day.”On cultural issues, Trump called for a “commonsense revolution” and condemned progressive policies. “Woke needs to come to an end. It’s ruining our nation,” he said, vowing to remove critical race theory and transgender policies from schools and military settings.Trump also pledged to address “transgender madness” on his first day in office, promising executive orders to ban transgender Americans from military service and women’s sports. “With the stroke of my pen, on day one, I will stop the transgender lunacy,” he declared.Trump ended the rally with his signature phrase, “Together we will fight, fight, fight, and together we will win, win, win!” The event concluded with Trump dancing to the Village People’s “YMCA,” a hallmark of his campaign appearances, as supporters cheered.","President-elect Donald Trump addressed swirling rumors about ceding his presidency to tech billionaire Elon Musk.

He claimed that the Panamanian authorities “haven’t treated us fairly” in their operation of the Panama Canal and criticised the fees for using the waterway as “ridiculous.”He also stated that if the principles behind the 1970s treaty, which granted Panama full control of the canal, were not followed, “then we will demand” that it be returned to the United States “in full, quickly and without question.” The canal is a key route for thousands of ships every year, making it critical for US and international trade.Trump, who regularly blames migrants from Latin America for America’s drug problems, reiterated his vow to immediately launch “the largest deportation operation in American history” upon taking office. He went further, stating he would “immediately designate the (drug) cartels as foreign terrorist organisations,” and promised that “this criminal network operating on American soil will be dismantled, deported, and destroyed.”During his first term in 2019, after the killing of nine American citizens from a Mormon community in Mexico, Trump had vowed to apply the terrorist designation to Mexican cartels. However, he later relented following a plea from then-Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.","Donald Trump pledges to'stop the transgender lunacy' from day one of his presidency.

If the court rules against ByteDance and no sale occurs, TikTok could face an effective ban on January 19, just one day before Trump takes office.It remains unclear how Trump would address the divestiture order, which was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate.Speaking at AmericaFest, an annual gathering organised by conservative group Turning Point, Trump told the crowd, ""They brought me a chart, and it was a record, and it was so beautiful to see, and as I looked at it, I said, 'Maybe we gotta keep this sucker around for a little while.'""Trump also met with TikTok's CEO on Monday and expressed his fondness for the app, attributing his campaign's success to its platform.The US Justice Department has argued that TikTok's connection to China remains a significant national security risk, a position supported by many lawmakers.

This included the forced conversion of children to Christianity.The investigation found that between 1828 and 1970, 3,104 indigenous students died at these schools, which is thrice the number reported by a recent government assessment. The schools, described by experts as having conditions similar to “prison camps,” were sites of high mortality, with children dying from disease, malnutrition, accidents, and sometimes under mysterious circumstances.Many of the children who died were buried in cemeteries near the schools, often far from their families and tribes. The bodies of these children were rarely returned home. As time passed, poor record-keeping has made it difficult to pinpoint the full extent of the deaths, with some gravesites either hidden, neglected, or paved over. The Post’s conclusions were drawn from “hundreds of thousands” of government documents.President Joe Biden sparked widespread attention in October when he issued a historic apology for what he called one of the nation’s ""most horrific chapters"": the forced removal of Native American children from their homes and their placement in these often abusive institutions. His apology followed a government report that documented the deaths of nearly 1,000 children, though the actual number was believed to be much higher.The Biden administration has since committed to significant support for Native American communities, investing in tribal autonomy, protecting sacred ancestral lands, and tackling gender-based violence. However, Native Americans remain among the poorest groups in the US, a direct result of centuries of marginalisation.In Canada, where more than 4,000 children are thought to have died or disappeared from similar residential schools, a government commission condemned the institutions as ""cultural genocide.""","Washington Post investigation finds 3,104 indigenous students died at boarding schools between 1828 and 1970.

Queens Stabbing: Just after midnight on Sunday, a fight among five men on a southbound 7 train at Woodside Avenue and 61st Street turned deadly. A 69-year-old man allegedly stabbed one person in the chest and another in the face. The victim stabbed in the chest died at the hospital. The suspect is in custody and awaiting charges.

Assault on D Train: At 4:30 am, a passenger threw a can at the conductor of a northbound D train, forcing it out of service. The 38-year-old conductor was hospitalized in stable condition. The attacker remains at large.

In a horrifying turn of events a woman was burned to death aboard an F train in Coney Island, New York, on Sunday morning after a man allegedly threw a lit match at her, causing her to catch fire, according to police sources.NYPD officers responded to reports of a fire at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue subway station shortly before 7:30 am and found the woman engulfed in flames on an idling train. Emergency services declared her dead at the scene.Alex Gureyev, 39 year old Brooklyn construction manager said, “It’s scary.”Sources said the victim was surrounded by liquor bottles, though it is uncertain if they played a role in the fire. The woman appeared to have been sleeping when a man in his 20s, seated across from her, approached and threw the match. The suspect fled the station and the motive behind the attack remains unclear.In a video that has captured the incident, the man accused of setting the passenger on fire can be seen calmly on a bench, watching as she burned to death. Disturbing footage obtained by The Post shows the suspect nonchalantly observing the flames engulf the woman, who was standing by the door of the subway car as the train idled.A transit officer walks by the open door and appears to briefly speak into his radio as he continues down the platform. After the officer passes, the suspect, described as a 25- to 30-year-old man, approximately 5 feet 6 inches tall, weighing around 150 pounds, stands up, seemingly to leave. The video then cuts off.The suspect was last seen wearing a grey hoodie, jeans, brown boots, and a dark knit hat with a red band, according to the NYPD. Authorities are offering a $10,000 reward for any information that could lead to his arrest.The incident had shocked commuters as the woman’s body was carried out of the station inside a black body bag just after 1 pm, as per the New York Post.“It’s incredible,” a commuter said.An MTA worker described the scene to The Post, saying the woman's clothes appeared to have been completely ""burned off.""“I was just walking by. The cops was there already. I didn’t see her in flames but that’s what I heard. It was out. They shut the lights off [in the car] so nobody could see,” the worker said.Commuters continuously paused in their tracks while transferring trains to take in the horrific scene.Gureyev said, “It’s going down hill a bit. Everybody keeps saying it’s going back to the seventies. It’s a frequent occurrence — not like this, setting people on fire — but like the mugging, the killings, the fighting, the shootings, they’re really common nowadays. [It’s] very bad.”The incident comes as New York Governor Kathy Hochul has increased National Guard patrols in the city’s subway system for the holiday season. The deployment brings the total number of guards to 1,000 as part of a $100 million security initiative. While Governor Hochul claimed a 10 per cent drop in transit crime since March, the murder rate in the subway system has risen by at least 60 per cent this year.These incidents underscore ongoing safety concerns in New York City’s subway system, even as millions of holiday visitors descend upon the city.","A woman was burned to death aboard an F train in Coney Island, New York, on Sunday morning after a man allegedly threw a lit match at her. The woman appeared to have been sleeping when a man in his 20s, seated across from her, approached and threw the match.

Meaningful dialogue based on positive intentions should be held,"" PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said.He stressed that the potential talks should have a defined timeframe, adding that the dialogue must progress positively considering the sensitivity of the situation.National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq had taken the lead by offering on Wednesday that he was ready to host the two sides and facilitate their parleys.He welcomed the newly constituted committee and invited the government and opposition for talks, saying ""the speaker's office is always open for members"", according to a statement issued by the NA Secretariat.The speaker called on members of both committees to meet on Monday morning, adding that he would meet them at his chambers in Parliament House.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram said his party accepted the speaker's invitation to meet. He said their committee will attend the meeting on Monday.Akram said the PTI founder will be informed about the progress of the meeting and he will decide whether to cancel the civil disobedience movement .The talks are being held after the PTI had threatened to give a call for civil disobedience.The party posted on X from the account of the jailed former prime minister regarding the call for civil disobedience movement, which was initially shared on December 19, stating that the campaign will be launched if the government doesn't make progress on the party's demands by Sunday.""I had presented two demands to the government, the release of under-trial political prisoners and the establishment of a judicial commission for a transparent investigation into the events of May 9, 2023 and November 26, 2024,"" the post quoted PTI founder Khan. It further stated that both of these demands ""are legitimate"".""If the government fails to take any action on them by Sunday, the first phase of the civil disobedience movement - 'remittance boycott' - will be launched,"" it said.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram also reiterated that the civil disobedience drive would be launched tomorrow (Monday) if the party's demands go unmet.However, the issue of civil disobedience has been apparently put on hold for some time while allowing the two sides to address the differences through political means.Khan, 72, on December 5 had warned of a civil disobedience movement from December 14 if his demands about the release of political prisoners facing trial and the formation of a judicial commission to probe the events of May 9, 2023, and November 26 this year were unmet.Meanwhile, Pakistan's military courts sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for attacking military installations during riots which erupted following the arrest of Khan in May last year, the Army announced on Saturday.On May 9, 2023, Khan's PTI supporters allegedly attacked several military installations, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and the ISI building in Faisalabad, to vent their anger against the arrest of their party founder in a corruption case.Hundreds of suspects were arrested in the countrywide swoop and at least 103 were handed over to the military authorities for trial due to their involvement in attacks on military installations.Khan's party has launched multiple protests through 2023 and 2024 demanding the release of their supreme leader, the latest being in November 2024.The former prime minister, currently lodged at the Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, was arrested in August last year and faces multiple cases since his government was toppled in April 2022.","The committee includes deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan.

"1,566 terror attacks killed 924 in Pakistan over past 10 months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/1566-terror-attacks-killed-924-in-pakistan-over-past-10-months/articleshow/116551393.cms,"KARACHI: Ten years have passed since Ajoon Khan's son died in a ghastly attack by the Pakistani Taliban that killed about 150 people, mostly children, at a military-run school in Peshawar, in northwestern Pakistan. But the pain of loss is unrelenting - it grows only deeper with time. Khan, a lawyer, said he could never forget the parents sobbing and pleading outside the school gates.The brutal assault on the school in Peshawar led to rare political unity in support of a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy for Pakistan and a vast military operation in the country's former tribal areas near Afghanistan. The efforts forced militants to retreat across the border and brought a degree of relative peace to Pakistan. Large-scale terrorist attacks were significantly reduced, with fatalities dropping from 2,451 across 1,717 attacks in 2013 to 220 in 146 attacks in 2020. But the hard-won gains are now in jeopardy.Over the past few years, violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan. Experts attribute the increase to the Afghan Taliban's seizure of power in neighbouring Afghanistan in Aug 2021.Last week, the interior ministry reported that 924 people, including civilians and law enforcement personnel, had been killed in 1,566 terrorist attacks across the country over the past 10 months. It said 341 terrorists had been killed during the period.Early on Saturday, sixteen soldiers were killed in northwest Pakistan in an attack by Islamist militants, a senior police official in the South Waziristan region said. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack, giving a higher figure for the number of personnel killed, Reuters reported.Experts and security officials have identified a range of challenges impeding Pakistan's progress against terrorism: political instability, weak governance, dwindling public support, economic constraints and reduced US counterterrorism assistance after the end of the 20-year war in Afghanistan.""The greatest challenge lies in mobilising the necessary financial resources and manpower for operations across such vast regions,"" said Muhammad Amir Rana, director of the Pak Institute for Peace Studies, a security think tank in Islamabad. The source of the problem for Pakistan, experts say, is found across the border, in Afghanistan.The Taliban administration in Kabul, the Afghan capital, denies accusations of harbouring militants from TTP. But Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace, said the TTP had been given ""a permissive safe haven in Afghanistan,"" which had allowed it to become ""resilient and lethal.""Pakistani security officials privately acknowledged that they had misjudged how the new Taliban rulers of Afghanistan would handle TTP. The officials had anticipated that the Taliban leaders would help curb the TTP in return for the covert support that Pakistan had provided them during the US-led war. Instead, the Taliban in Kabul have provided the TTP with resources and advanced American-made weapons and equipment seized after the collapse of the US-supported Afghan govt, according to a senior security official in Islamabad who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The TTP has gone on to unleash a wave of attacks inside Pakistan as it wages a campaign whose aim is to overthrow the govt. Among them was a suicide bombing in January 2023 that killed over 100 people at a mosque in Peshawar.Pakistani security forces have also been locked in a conflict with ethnic separatist groups in Balochistan, an arid province bordering Afghanistan and Iran that is home to the Chinese-run port Gwadar. nyt","Violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan.

Pakistan’s military announced Saturday that 25 civilians have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their alleged involvement in violent protests following the arrest of former PM Imran Khan on May 9 last year, which resulted in the death of at least eight people.Khan’s supporters stormed govt buildings and military installations. The military’s statement detailed that the convictions relate primarily to attacks on key military sites, including Jinnah House (the Lahore corps commander’s residence), General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, and a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) base in Mianwali.The sentences were issued by Field General Court Martial as part of the first phase of trials. Supreme Court had earlier conditionally allowed military courts to pronounce verdicts for 85 civilians detained in connection with the riots.The military statement highlighted that the convicts have the right to appeal and other legal recourses as guaranteed by law.The May 9 violence led to the arrest of many politicians and supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party. PTI has denied involvement in the violence. However, govt and military maintain that the attacks were meticulously planned and executed by PTI brass.Khan and his party have called for a judicial probe into the May 9 events, claiming the violence was a “false flag” operation intended to suppress PTI.PTI condemned the military court’s decision. National Assembly leader of opposition Omar Ayub wrote on X: “Military court sentences against civilians rejected. The detainees are civilians and cannot be tried by military courts.” He labelled the process as “kangaroo courts”.PTI’s US chapter criticised the rulings. “Colonels and majors, acting as judges, have sentenced civilians it tried in military courts. These civilians were held for over a year in harsh conditions, with many tortured into giving false confessions,” it posted on X.Amnesty International also denounced the military court’s decision, describing it as “an intimidation tactic, designed to crack down on dissent”.Army’s media wing Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) referred to the protests as “politically provoked violence and arson”. ISPR said further sentences for the remaining accused will be announced once the legal process is completed.",25 civilians have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years.

Sixteen Pakistani soldiers were killed and five critically injured on Saturday after militants attacked an army post near the Afghan border.The attack happened overnight in the Makeen area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, roughly 40 kms (24 miles) from the border.More than 30 militants assaulted the post, according to two intelligence officials who spoke to AFP (anonymously). The attack lasted two hours. “The militants set fire to the wireless communication equipment, documents and other items present at the checkpoint,” one official said.

Driving the news

Speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, US deputy national security adviser Jon Finer described Pakistan’s missile advancements as a troubling shift in the country’s strategic posture.

described Pakistan’s missile advancements as a troubling shift in the country’s strategic posture. “Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology, from long-range ballistic missile systems to equipment that would enable the testing of significantly larger rocket motors,” Finer said.

“If these trends continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.”

This revelation comes on the heels of Washington imposing a fresh wave of sanctions on Pakistan’s missile program. For the first time, the measures target Pakistan’s state-run National Development Complex, alongside three private Karachi-based companies accused of supporting missile development.

Why it matters

Finer’s revelation marks a stark turning point in US-Pakistan relations, underscoring a broader erosion of trust since the 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Historically viewed as a key partner in counterterrorism, Pakistan’s ballistic missile advancements are now seen as a direct challenge to US security.

The move also raises critical questions about whether Pakistan’s missile program, long designed as a counter to India, is shifting toward broader ambitions with potentially global consequences.

Two senior US officials, speaking anonymously, revealed that Washington has repeatedly pressed Islamabad to explain the development of more powerful rocket engines but received evasive responses. “They don’t acknowledge our concerns. They tell us we are biased,” said one official.

This development places Pakistan alongside nations like Russia, North Korea, and China—states identified by the US as adversaries with nuclear weapons and missile systems capable of reaching American soil.

The strain in US-Pakistan relations reflects a broader geopolitical realignment in South Asia. Pakistan continues to cultivate strong ties with China while voicing concerns about US defense cooperation with India, including technology transfers and joint missile projects.

The big picture

Sanctions imposed:

The US has sanctioned Pakistan’s National Development Complex over proliferation-related concerns tied to ballistic missile development.This is a big deal; unlike recent rounds of US sanctions, this targets a government entity instead of just companies. Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Center’s South Asia Institute

Zoom in: Eroding US-Pakistan ties

The tensions over Pakistan’s missile program reflect a larger deterioration in the once-robust US-Pakistan partnership.

Historical context: Pakistan was a key ally during the Cold War and a central partner in the US-led war on terror, particularly after the 9/11 attacks. However, relations have soured over the years due to Pakistan’s alleged support for Taliban factions and its increasingly close ties with China.

India factor: The US-India defense relationship has grown stronger in recent years, underpinned by agreements like the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) and the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA). Washington has facilitated India’s acquisition of advanced missile systems, which has drawn criticism from Islamabad for allegedly undermining regional stability.

What it means for India

Accelerating India's missile programs:

India’s strategic reassessment:

Proxy conflicts:

Nuclear security risks:

Strengthening India-US ties

What’s next

The US administration is expected to maintain pressure on Pakistan through diplomatic channels and additional sanctions, while continuing to bolster ties with India.

The US appears to view Pakistan’s missile development as a broader shift in its strategic posture. Finer emphasized that Pakistan’s actions raise “real questions” about its intentions, particularly given its long-standing partnership with the US in security and counterterrorism.

Washington is also likely to encourage other countries to scrutinize Pakistan’s missile program as part of broader non-proliferation efforts.

Pakistan, however, is expected to deepen its reliance on China, which has historically supported its missile program and nuclear ambitions.

The United States has expressed alarm over Pakistan’s ongoing development of long-range ballistic missiles, a move Washington sees as an emerging security threat.Meanwhile, Washington’s public condemnation of Pakistan’s missile program could fuel further regional instability.The US State Department sanctioned Pakistan’s NDC for its involvement in developing long-range missile systems. This marks the first time a Pakistani state-owned enterprise has faced direct sanctions tied to missile production. Three Karachi-based companies—Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, Affiliates International, and Rockside Enterprise—were also sanctioned for supporting the program.Islamabad has dismissed the US sanctions as “discriminatory” and warned that such actions could upset the region’s strategic balance. Its Foreign Office defended the missile program as “defensive in nature,” aimed solely at countering Indian aggression and preserving peace in South Asia.Pakistani officials argue that their missile program is not intended to target the US. Diplomatic sources in Islamabad insist the program is designed to counter perceived threats from India, with whom Pakistan has fought three wars since 1947, a Reuters report said.In a strongly worded statement, the Pakistani Foreign Office accused the US of “double standards.” It criticized Washington for imposing sanctions on Pakistani entities while granting India waivers for advanced military technology. “Such policies have dangerous implications for the strategic stability of our region and beyond,” the statement read.Pakistan's development of long-range missiles may prompt India to fast-track its missile initiatives, particularly the Agni series, and enhance its Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) systems.Pakistan’s expanded missile range could push India to reevaluate its nuclear policies, potentially reconsidering its no-first-use stance or enhancing second-strike capabilities.Pakistan’s growing confidence, potentially bolstered by Chinese support, might lead to more aggressive postures, including cross-border skirmishes.The growing political instability in Pakistan increases the risk of its nuclear assets falling into the hands of radical groups, posing a significant threat to India and the world.: Pakistan's missile advancements could lead to closer India-US defense cooperation, including technology transfers and intelligence sharing.(With inputs from agencies)","US deputy national security adviser Jon Finer described Pakistan's missile advancements as a troubling shift in the country's strategic posture.

A senior White House official on Thursday said that Pakistan's development of sophisticated missile technology, including long range ballistic missiles , represents an emerging threat to the United States.The statement comes in the wake of sanctions imposed on four Pakistani entities, including the state-owned national development complex (NDC), for their role in advancing Pakistan's missile program.Principal deputy national security advisor Jon Finer, speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on Thursday, outlined the Biden administration’s growing concerns over Pakistan's missile development activities.“Simply put, we are going to keep the pressure on Pakistan regarding its long-range missile program, even as we also continue to seek diplomatic resolutions to address our concerns,” Finer said.The sanctions announced Wednesday target the NDC, based in Islamabad, which oversees Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, as well as three Karachi-based entities: Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, Affiliates International, and Rockside Enterprise.These entities were identified as contributors to the program, prompting what Finer called “necessary measures to curb these advancements.”Finer pointed out the significance of the sanctions. “This is the first time we have sanctioned a Pakistani state-owned enterprise tied to missile development,” he said.According to Finer, Pakistan’s recent advancements include the development of long-range ballistic missile systems and technologies that enable testing of larger rocket motors. “If these trend lines continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States, raising real questions about Pakistan's intentions,” he added.The official pointed out that only a small group of nations—Russia, North Korea, and China—possess nuclear weapons and missile capabilities capable of directly reaching the US, making Pakistan's actions particularly concerning. “It is hard for us to see Pakistan's actions as anything other than an emerging threat to the United States,” Finer said.Despite longstanding ties between the US and Pakistan in areas such as counter-terrorism and development, Finer expressed frustration over Islamabad's apparent disregard for American concerns. “We have provided support to Islamabad during difficult times and continue to desire a cooperative relationship in areas of shared interest,” he said. “That makes us question even more why Pakistan would be motivated to develop a capability that could be used against us.”The Biden administration has already implemented three rounds of sanctions over the past year targeting non-Pakistani entities supporting Pakistan’s ballistic missile program.Finer stressed that the US would not tolerate the continued development of capabilities perceived as a direct threat. “The United States cannot, will not simply sit back and watch the development of this capability that we believe could pose a threat ultimately down the road,” he stated.“This is of such great concern because it raises fundamental questions about Pakistan's intentions, and we are determined to ensure our security and that of our allies,” he added further.","White House official: Pakistan's development of missile technology represents an emerging threat to the United States.

Pakistan slams US missile sanctions as ‘biased’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-slams-us-missile-sanctions-as-biased/articleshow/116480917.cms,"TOI correspondent from Islamabad:

Pakistan criticised the US Thursday for imposing more sanctions on its missile programme, saying it reflected Washington’s double standards and discriminatory practices.The response came hours after the US announced the additional sanctions on four entities in Pakistan, claiming they were contributing to proliferation and delivery systems of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).The US State Department identified the firms as Islamabad-based National Development Complex (NDC) and three companies in the southern port city of Karachi: Affiliates International, Akhtar and Sons Private Ltd, and Rockside Enterprise.State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the measures were imposed under an executive order that “targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.” “The US will continue to act against proliferation and associated procurement activities of concern,” Miller said.In its reaction, Pakistan’s foreign ministry termed the decision “unfortunate and biased”, insisting that its strategic capabilities were meant to defend its sovereignty and preserve peace and stability in South Asia. According to the ministry, the sanctions defied the “objective of peace and security by aiming to accentuate military asymmetries,” an apparent reference to Pakistan’s rivalry with nuclear-armed India. “Such policies have dangerous implications for the strategic stability of our region and beyond,” the ministry said.The US had also imposed sanctions on Pakistani firms and a Chinese research institute in the past over alleged support and involvement in proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. “Similar listings of commercial entities in the past were based on mere doubts and suspicion without any evidence whatsoever. While claiming strict adherence to non-proliferation norms, licensing requirements for advanced military technology to other countries have been waived off in the past,” the ministry said.“Such double standards and discriminatory practices not only undermine the credibility of non-proliferation regimes but also endanger regional and international peace and security,” it added.According to the State Department, Islamabad-based NDC had sought to obtain components for the country’s long-range ballistic-missile program and missile-testing equipment. It said the NDC “is responsible for the development of Pakistan’s ballistic missiles,” including the Shaheen family of missiles.The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a media outlet aimed to reduce man-made threats to human existence, said the Shaheen series of missiles is nuclear-capable. The Bulletin estimates Pakistan’s arsenal at about 170 warheads.In Sept this year, the US had imposed sanctions on a Chinese research institute and several companies involved in assisting Pakistan’s missile programme. Additional sanctions were imposed in Oct on China-based firms for supplying missile-applicable items to Pakistan.",The US State Department identified the firms as Islamabad-based National Development Complex (NDC) and three companies in the southern port city of Karachi. The measures were imposed under an executive order that “targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery”,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116480909,imgsize-14244,width-400,resizemode-4/116480909.jpg"

The move freezes any US-based assets belonging to the targeted entities and also forbids American citizens or businesses from engaging with them.“In light of the continuing proliferation threat of Pakistan’s long-range missile development, the United States is designating four entities for sanctions pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13382, which targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery,” a press release by the US Department of State said.The NDC, headquartered in Islamabad, plays a central role in Pakistan’s missile development efforts, according to a State Department factsheet. It has been actively seeking components for the country’s long-range ballistic missile systems, including the SHAHEEN family of missiles, which are believed to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads.Research by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists suggests that Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal now consists of approximately 170 warheads. The country conducted its first nuclear test back in 1998, and remains outside the Non-Proliferation Treaty which is an international agreement aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.The sanctions also target three private firms—Affiliates International, Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, and Rockside Enterprise—accused of helping the NDC acquire equipment for its missile programme.“The United States will continue to act against proliferation and procurement activities that pose a concern,” Miller further added in the release.The Pakistani embassy in Washington is yet to respond to the sanctions.",The U.S. has announced a fresh wave of sanctions targeting Pakistan’s long-range ballistic missile programme.

A rebel army in Myanmar announced the capture of a major military headquarters in the South Asian country's western Rakhine state , dealing a major blow to the ruling. The Arakan Army (AA), part of the anti-junta resistance movement, claimed that it seized the western military command on Friday after two weeks on intense fighting.""This marks a turning point in the conflict,"" the Arakan Army said in a statement late Friday night. Myanmar’s military government has not commented on the development.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military overthrew an elected civilian government in early 2021, sparking protests that escalated into a nationwide armed rebellion.The Arakan Army, a member of the Three Brotherhood Alliance , has been instrumental in the resistance. The alliance launched an offensive in October 2023, achieving several key victories, including the historic seizure of Lashio in August, the first time a regional military command has fallen to rebel forces.Rakhine, a coastal state bordering Bangladesh and the Bay of Bengal, is one of Myanmar’s most impoverished regions despite its offshore natural gas reserves and a proposed economic zone in Kyauk Pyu, which hosts pipelines carrying oil and gas to China.Fighting in Rakhine resumed last November after a ceasefire between the Arakan Army and the junta collapsed. Since then, the AA has made major territorial gains.However, some Rohingya activists accuse the group of targeting their community during its offensive in northern Rakhine, forcing tens of thousands to flee to Bangladesh.","Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military overthrew an elected civilian government in early 2021.

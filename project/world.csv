Trump Picks Hardliners Marco Rubio, Mike Waltz For U.S. Secy Of State & Security Chief Positions

US President-elect Donald Trump has started building his administrative team with appointments of several advisers and political associates to various positions, including the role of White House chief of staff.His initial appointments have focused on crucial policy areas, particularly immigration, which featured prominently in his campaign messaging for 2024.The anticipated administration structure is likely to differ from his previous term. In an October interview, he acknowledged that selecting ""bad, disloyal people"" was his primary error during his first tenure.Susie Wiles, aged 67, served as the principal adviser and effective campaign manager for Trump's 2024 presidential bid.Her political roots are deeply embedded in Florida's political landscape. Initially, she contributed to Ron DeSantis's successful gubernatorial campaign. Later, she played an instrumental role in Trump's victory over DeSantis during the 2024 Republican primary.As Trump's first significant appointment following his president-elect status, Wiles's selection could prove crucial for the incoming administration, given her established rapport with him. Her leadership of Trump's most structured presidential campaign among his three attempts notably earned his confidence.She distinguished herself by successfully steering Trump's direction through a unique approach. Rather than challenging his instincts directly, she gained his respect by demonstrating positive outcomes when he followed her strategic guidance.Mike Waltz, a retired Army National Guard officer, has been selected as national security adviser. The three-term Florida congressman brings experience from multiple Afghanistan tours and previous Pentagon service. He will address various international challenges, including Ukraine's armament needs, Russia-North Korea relations, Middle Eastern conflicts, and Israel's situation with Hamas and Hezbollah.Tom Homan, 62, has been designated as 'border czar'. The former US Immigration and Customs Enforcement leader under Trump's first administration will oversee an extensive deportation programme. Despite promising humane implementation, his support for previous strict border policies has drawn criticism from Democrats.Elise Stefanik, appointed as United Nations ambassador, has consistently supported Trump since his first impeachment. The 40-year-old New York representative, currently third-ranking in House leadership, gained prominence through her questioning of university presidents regarding campus antisemitism.Stephen Miller, aged 39, assumes the role of deputy chief of staff for policy. The former senior adviser and immigration hardliner currently leads America First Legal, challenging various institutions on free speech and national security matters.Lee Zeldin, aged 44, has been nominated to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. The former New York representative, whilst lacking environmental expertise, has pledged to promote American energy independence whilst maintaining environmental standards.",Trump picks hardliners Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz for U.S. Secy Of State & Security Chief positions.

NEW DELHI: Canada's Brampton Triveni Mandir and Community Centre has called off a life certificate event that was planned for November 17, citing concerns about potential violent protests.The event, a consular camp, was set to assist Indian-origin Hindus and Sikhs in renewing essential life certificates, a requirement for various official purposes.The temple administration released an official statement detailing the reasons behind the cancellation on Monday. ""Please be advised that the Life Certificate Event scheduled at Brampton Triveni Mandir by the Indian Consulate on November 17, 2024, has been cancelled. This is due to official intelligence from Peel Regional Police, stating that there is an extremely high and imminent threat level of violent protests,"" the statement said.The temple authorities expressed regret to the community, many of whom rely on these consular services. “We apologize to all community members who were depending on the event. We are deeply saddened that Canadians now feel unsafe coming to Hindu Temples in Canada,” the statement added.The administration also urged Peel Police to take stronger action against threats targeted at the Hindu community and ensure the safety of all Canadian citizens, regardless of their faith.Chief of Police with the Peel Regional Police in Canada, Nishan Duraiappah wrote to Brampton Triveni Mandir & Community Centre, requesting them to consider rescheduling the upcoming Consular Camp on November 17. ""We believe that a temporary postponement could contribute meaningfully to de-escalating the present tensions and safeguarding the wellbeing of those attending your location,"" the letter read.Brampton Triveni Mandir serves as a community hub for Hindus and like-minded individuals, hosting gatherings for worship, religious discourses, and community service activities. However, in recent weeks, the temple has faced heightened tensions following incidents at nearby locations.This comes after an Indian consular camp at the Hindu Sabha Temple in Brampton was violently disrupted on November 3. Following this, The Consulate General of India in Toronto announced the cancellation of several scheduled consular camps across Canada after local security agencies indicated that they were unable to guarantee the required safety measures for these community events.The Hindu temple attack prompted a strong reaction from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who took to social media to condemn the ""deliberate attack."" In his post on X (formerly Twitter), PM Modi said, ""I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada. Equally appalling are the cowardly attempts to intimidate our diplomats. Such acts of violence will never weaken India’s resolve. We expect the Canadian government to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law.""This comes amid escalating diplomatic tensions between Canada and India, following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s allegations last year of a “potential” involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Khalistan supporter Hardeep Singh Nijjar.The claims, categorically denied by India, led to the expulsion of Canadian diplomats from India and strained bilateral ties, with New Delhi insisting that Canada has given space to pro-Khalistan elements.","Canada's Brampton Triveni Mandir and Community Centre has called off a life certificate event that was planned for November 17.

BNP worried interim govt may extend tenure

DHAKA: Bangladesh’s newly appointed interim govt adviser Mahfuj Alam has removed the portrait of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from the Darbar Hall of Banga Bhaban, in what critics said was “complete and utter disrespect” of the country’s first president and the constitution.Banga Bhaban is the residence and main workplace of the President of Bangladesh.Posting a photo of himself at Darbar Hall after taking oath on Sunday, Mahfuj on Monday wrote on Facebook: “It is a shame for us that we couldn’t remove his pictures from Banga Bhaban after the 5th of August. Apologies.”A political activist, who wished to remain unnamed, suggested that the removal of Mujib’s portrait from Darbar Hall might be linked to a desire to alter the constitution and erase the spirit of 1971 Liberation War , “promoting a Pakistani ideology in Bangladesh”.The Bangladesh constitution mandates that the portrait of Mujibur be preserved and displayed at the offices of the president, PM, speaker, and chief justice, as well as at all govt and semi-govt offices.Mujibur is also the father of deposed PM Sheikh Hasina “No individual should change it (the constitution) with the stroke of a pen,” Kamal Hossain , one of the framers of the current constitution said, adding, “reforms should be carried out only after taking people’s opinions into account”.Suspecting that Bangladesh’s interim govt may be thinking of extending its tenure, the BNP has reminded the Muhammad Yunus-led dispensation that its primary duty is to promptly transfer power to elected representatives after conducting a fair election.On Monday, senior BNP politician Hafizuddin Ahmed claimed several individuals with pro-Awami League affiliations had been appointed to the interim govt’s advisory council.Two leading coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement have also criticised the new govt additions.The interim govt was expanded Sunday with the addition of three new advisers.

LONDON: An opponent of vaccines who wrote social media posts urging violence against scientists, politicians and public health officials during the Covid-19 pandemic was sentenced Monday to five years in prison after being convicted of encouraging terrorism .A British judge said 55-year-old Patrick Ruane had a “compulsive and obsessive” opposition to vaccines and spewed vitriol on the Telegram messaging app . One message described “whacking” England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, over the head.In a series of messages in 2021, Ruane posted that he was “all for hunting them down and … executing” those who made and delivered Covid-19 vaccines. He encouraged others to “find where they live, put a kill squad together and shoot” them in their beds.In a discussion about Whitty, the vaccine opponent wrote that hitting someone on the back of the skull with a bat or a metal mace “would turn said target into a vegetable for the rest of its life.” He also advocated blowing up vaccine laboratories and 5G phone towers.“This wasn’t idle chit-chat online – he was encouraging people to seriously injure or kill others, suggesting who to target,” said acting commander of the Met Police counterterrorism command.

American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone

US President-elect Donald Trump according to NYT has chosen Republican Senator Marco Rubio as his pick for Secretary of State , positioning Rubio to become the first Latino to serve in America's top diplomatic role.Born in Miami, Florida, on May 28, 1971, Rubio has earned a reputation as a conservative leader, particularly on foreign policy issues. He is known for his hawkish stance on countries like China, Iran, and Cuba. Rubio’s selection is seen as an effort by Trump to diversify his administration's leadership, potentially strengthening his appeal among Latino voters , a demographic that has traditionally leaned Democratic but shifted in Trump's favour during the recent election.While Rubio has been a vocal advocate for a strong US presence on the world stage, he has, in recent years, adjusted some of his positions to align with Trump’s approach of restraint.Rubio’s parents emigrated from Cuba in 1956, settling first in Miami and later in Las Vegas, where his father worked as a bartender and his mother as a hotel housekeeper. Although raised Catholic, Rubio was briefly baptized as a Mormon before returning to his Catholic roots. The family returned to Florida in 1985, where Rubio graduated from the University of Florida in 1993 before earning a law degree from the University of Miami.Rubio’s political career began early. He worked for Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen before serving on the West Miami City Commission. In 1999, he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives, where he served until 2008, including stints as majority leader and speaker.In 2009, Rubio launched his campaign for the US Senate seat left vacant by Mel Martinez’s resignation. Initially trailing Florida Governor Charlie Crist, Rubio’s fortunes changed when Crist broke from the Republican Party and declared himself an independent. Rubio won the 2010 election by a significant margin in a three-way race.Once in the Senate, Rubio aligned himself with the conservative wing of the Republican Party. He opposed key Democratic initiatives such as gun control, the Affordable Care Act, and climate-change legislation. Despite this, he broke with many in his party when he co-authored a 2013 immigration reform bill that sought to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The bill ultimately failed to pass.Rubio also became known for his foreign policy views, particularly his opposition to the Obama administration's attempts to normalize relations with Cuba. His foreign policy stance has often reflected an interventionist approach, particularly regarding China and the Middle East.Rubio’s 2016 presidential campaign was initially seen as a strong challenge to Donald Trump. He positioned himself as a candidate who could unite the Republican Party establishment but struggled against Trump’s dominance in the race. After a brutal series of defeats, Rubio suspended his campaign after losing the Florida primary.Following his return to the Senate, Rubio began to embrace more populist conservative views, aligning more closely with Trump’s America First agenda. He became a vocal supporter of Trump and developed a strong working relationship with him. Although Rubio initially backed efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, he ultimately voted to certify Joe Biden’s victory after the January 6 Capitol attack.Rubio’s foreign policy views align with Trump on many fronts, though there are some key differences. Both have been critical of Nato, with Rubio co-sponsoring legislation that would make it more difficult for a president to withdraw from the alliance without Senate approval. Rubio is also a staunch critic of China, pushing for greater scrutiny of Chinese investments in US technology and advocating for a hardline approach on issues like Huawei’s influence.One of Rubio’s most personal stances is his opposition to normalizing relations with Cuba, a policy he shares with Trump. He is also a vocal critic of the Maduro regime in Venezuela, reflecting his deep personal connection to the island through his Cuban-American heritage.Rubio is married to Jeanette Dousdebes, whom he met as a teenager, and they have four children. He has authored two books:(2012), a memoir about his upbringing, and(2015), which outlines his policy views.","Donald Trump has chosen Republican Senator Marco Rubio as his pick for Secretary of State.

"Meet Mike Waltz, India Caucus head chosen by Trump as US national security adviser",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/meet-mike-waltz-india-caucus-head-chosen-by-trump-as-us-national-security-adviser/articleshow/115198131.cms,"Michael Waltz. (Photo/Agencies)

Who is Mike Waltz?

US President-elect Donald Trump has selected Republican Representative Mike Waltz as his national security adviser, as per various media reports. Waltz, a former Army Green Beret, who is also the head of India caucus , has established himself as a prominent critic of China.The position of national security adviser does not need Senate approval. In this role, Waltz will brief Trump on crucial national security matters and facilitate inter-agency coordination.Born in Boynton Beach, Florida, Waltz was raised by a single mother and is the son and grandson of Navy Chiefs. He is a three-term Republican representative from Florida's east-central region, holds the distinction of being the first Green Beret (US special forces) elected to the US House of Representatives.Recently re-elected, Waltz has served as chairman of the House armed services subcommittee on readiness and has been a member of both the House foreign affairs committee and the permanent select committee on intelligence, according to The Associated Press.Waltz has openly supported Trump's foreign policy positions whilst criticising the Biden administration's 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal. He once said, ""Disruptors are often not nice. Frankly our national security establishment and certainly a lot of people that are dug into bad old habits in the Pentagon need that disruption,"" adding, ""Donald Trump is that disruptor.""As co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, Waltz was instrumental in arranging Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 2023 address at Capitol Hill during his US visit. The Senate’s India Caucus, established in 2004 by then-Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator John Cornyn, was the first country-focused caucus established in the Senate. It promotes a relationship between India and the United States, ""based on mutual trust and respect"".A strong advocate for robust defense policies, especially in terms of US-India relations and countering China's influence, Waltz is a seasoned expert on foreign policy. He has championed closer ties with India, focusing on defense and security collaboration.Waltz has consistently taken a strong stance on China, previously calling for a US boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, citing China’s role in the Covid-19 outbreak and its alleged mistreatment of Uighur Muslims.Waltz is also a member of the Republicans' China Task Force, where he has voiced concerns about the US military's readiness for a potential conflict in the Indo-Pacific region. In his book, ""Hard Truths: Think and Lead Like a Green Beret"", published earlier this year, Waltz outlined a five-part approach to avoiding war with China. His strategy includes accelerating arms deliveries to Taiwan, strengthening commitments to Pacific allies, and modernizing US aircraft and naval fleets.Regarding Ukraine, Waltz's stance has evolved over time. After Russia's 2022 invasion, he urged the Biden administration to increase weapon support to Kyiv to counter Russian forces. However, during a recent event, he suggested the need for a reassessment of US objectives in Ukraine, questioning whether the nation's current investments align with America's strategic interests in the Pacific.""Is it in America's interest, are we going to put in the time, the treasure, the resources that we need in the Pacific right now badly?"" he asked.Waltz has commended Trump for encouraging Nato allies to boost defense spending, though he diverges from the president-elect's stance on potentially leaving the alliance. ""Look, we can be allies and friends and have tough conversations,"" Waltz said last month.Waltz's potential new role could signal a shift toward a more assertive US approach to China and a strengthened partnership with India—an alliance Waltz believes is crucial for stability and mutual benefits in defense and economics.Known for his hardline stance on China, Waltz has highlighted the importance of alliances with democracies like India to reinforce regional stability. His experience as a military veteran is expected to translate into joint US-India initiatives on defense, intelligence, and counter-terrorism efforts, particularly in Asia.A graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, Waltz served four years in active-duty Army before joining the Florida Guard. He completed multiple combat in Afghanistan, the Middle East, and Africa, earning four Bronze Stars for his service.","US President-elect Donald Trump has selected Republican Representative Mike Waltz as his national security adviser.

What’s next

In a move that signifies a hardline approach towards China, US President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Florida Representative Mike Waltz as his new national security advisor (NSA). Waltz, a retired Army Green Beret with extensive experience in US military operations and policy, has positioned himself as a fierce critic of China and advocate for US strategic preparedness in the Indo-Pacific region.Waltz’s appointment underscores the incoming administration’s commitment to addressing what he calls “the greater threat” posed by the Chinese Communist Party. Waltz had called for a US boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing over the origin of Covid-19 and its mistreatment of Uighurs.In a recent Economist article co-authored before the election, Waltz and former Pentagon strategist Matthew Kroenig argued that America must shift its strategic focus from Europe and the Middle East to the Indo-Pacific. “The next president should act urgently to bring the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East to a swift conclusion and finally focus strategic attention where it should be: countering the greater threat from the Communist Party,” they wrote.Waltz has consistently advocated for strengthening the US military’s preparedness to counter potential Chinese aggression , especially regarding Taiwan. In his Economist article, he wrote, “America is not building armed forces to deny a Chinese attack on Taiwan. It has cut defense spending in real terms, allowing the balance of power to shift in China’s favor.” He has called for a significant increase in defense spending and revitalizing the US defense-industrial base, highlighting a belief in comprehensive military readiness.Waltz's appointment comes at a time when US-China relations are already strained, exacerbated by past trade wars, military posturing in the South China Sea, and ideological confrontations.Waltz’s elevation to a pivotal role in Trump's administration not only signals a more muscular approach to China but also suggests that Indo-US ties will become even more critical. India, which has its own complex and contentious relationship with China, may view Waltz’s strategic focus as a fortuitous alignment.Waltz’s appointment holds positive implications for India. As the co-chair of the India Caucus in Congress, he has championed policies supportive of US-India ties. This dual role may bode well for New Delhi, particularly amid China’s assertive posturing along the Line of Actual Control(LAC). India, which has sought stronger defense and strategic cooperation with Washington, could see opportunities to deepen its partnership under an NSA who recognizes the strategic importance of an Indo-Pacific alliance.Waltz, 50, brings a robust background to the role of national security advisor. A retired Army colonel and Green Beret, he has substantial experience in combat operations and strategic defense, including multiple tours in Afghanistan and policy work at the Pentagon under secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates. Waltz is also a vocal advocate for an assertive US military posture. His past criticisms of President Joe Biden’s handling of foreign policy, particularly the withdrawal from Afghanistan, highlight his belief in maintaining US global strength and readiness.Trump's decision to tap Waltz aligns with his broader vision of America First—a doctrine that emphasizes US strength, security, and economic interests over multilateral commitments that Trump perceives as disproportionately burdensome. This approach could unsettle Nato allies who recall Trump’s past skepticism about the alliance. During his first term, Trump questioned the value of Nato, suggesting at one point that the US might reconsider its participation if members did not meet defense spending targets. This rhetoric, often viewed as undermining Article V of the Nato treaty, created friction in Europe. Waltz’s views on focusing resources toward China could reignite concerns among European allies about shifting US priorities away from traditional partnerships.Trump’s appointment of Waltz is part of a broader wave of key selections shaping his second administration. Other appointments include Elise Stefanik as US ambassador to the UN and Tom Homan as “border czar,” each reflecting Trump’s America First principles. The inclusion of Waltz, a seasoned military officer with extensive foreign policy experience, highlights the administration’s prioritization of hard power and strategic competition over diplomacy-first approaches.For China, Waltz’s hawkish views will be met with concern, as it signals a US administration less inclined to compromise. For India, this is an opportunity to solidify a strategic partnership that counters shared threats. While Beijing may double down on its regional initiatives, such as the Belt and Road and military maneuvers in the South China Sea, the Indo-US alignment under Waltz’s advisorship will likely serve as a counterforce.The coming months will set the tone for US foreign policy, with Waltz playing a critical role in shaping strategies that reinforce military capabilities in the Indo-Pacific. Expect diplomatic outreach to India and a strong emphasis on enhancing defense ties. This could translate into new bilateral agreements, joint military operations, and coordinated policies in regional forums like the Quad. Nato and European allies may need to recalibrate their own strategies as US resources pivot toward countering China.(With inputs from agencies)",US President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Florida Representative Mike Waltz as his new national security advisor.

Melania Trump to skip traditional White House meeting with Jill Biden: Reports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/melania-trump-to-skip-traditional-white-house-meeting-with-jill-biden-reports/articleshow/115198217.cms,"Incoming First Lady Melania Trump will not attend the customary White House meeting with First Lady Jill Biden , CNN reported quoting sources. The traditional meeting, which usually marks the beginning of a peaceful transition between the outgoing and incoming first families, will take place without Melania, who reportedly has a scheduling conflict related to the promotion of her newly released memoir.A source close to the situation told CNN that while the decision had not been officially confirmed, Melania Trump would not be participating in the meeting with Jill Biden, scheduled for Wednesday at 11am. Meanwhile, a representative from Jill Biden’s office stated that the Bidens had extended their congratulations to the Trumps, along with an invitation for the traditional White House visit. However, it appears Melania has declined the offer.This marks a major shift from the usual protocol, which has seen outgoing and incoming first ladies meeting to exchange advice and set a tone of collaboration ahead of the new administration. In 2020, a similar meeting between Jill Biden and Melania Trump did not take place, as Donald Trump refused to meet with Joe Biden after his election defeat, citing unfounded claims of election fraud.This year’s White House meeting is particularly noteworthy as it will be the first time an outgoing president has met with an incoming one he competed against in a campaign since the 1992 transition, when President George HW Bush sat down with President-elect Bill Clinton.Following the 2016 election, Trump and then-President Barack Obama held a 90-minute discussion in the Oval Office, where Obama expressed his commitment to helping Trump succeed for the sake of the country.Despite some initial awkwardness, the meeting was described as cordial, with Trump calling Obama ""a good man"" and expressing respect for him. However, this brief moment of cooperation quickly gave way to Trump’s contentious presidency, marked by baseless claims of wiretapping and accusations against Obama.","Incoming First Lady Melania Trump will not attend the customary White House meeting with First Lady Jill Biden, CNN reported.

DUBAI: Israel has begun a construction project along the so-called Alpha Line that separates the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from Syria, apparently laying asphalt for a road right along the frontier, satellite photos analysed by the AP show. Israeli troops have entered the demilitarised zone during the work, the United Nations confirmed to the AP, a violation of the ceasefire rules governing the area.The work, which earlier satellite photos show began in earnest in late Sept, follows the completion by the Israeli military of new roadways and what appears to be a buffer zone along the Gaza Strip’s frontier with Israel.The Israel military also has begun demolishing villages in Lebanon, where UN peacekeepers have come under fire. So far, there has been no major violence along the Alpha Line, which delineates the demilitarised zone between Syria and Israeli-occupied territory that UN peacekeepers have patrolled since 1974.Syria, which has been at war with Israel since its founding in 1948 and relies on Iran for support, has remained silent regarding the construction.But the Golan Heights remain a flashpoint for the two countries — making any changes along the border potentially that much more sensitive. The Israeli military did not respond to requests for comm ent and Syrian officials in Damascus declined to comment.High-resolution images taken on Nov 5 by Planet Labs PBC for the AP show over 7.5km of construction along the Alpha Line, starting some 3km southeast of the Israeli-held Druze town of Majdal Shams, where a July rocket strike killed 12 children playing soccer. The images appear to show a trench between two embankments, parts of which appear to have been laid with fresh asphalt. There also appears to be fencing running along it as well toward the Syrian side.The construction follows a southeast route before heading due south along the Alpha Line, and then again cutting southeast. The images show excavators and other earth-moving equipment actively digging along the route, with more asphalt piled there. The area is also believed to be littered with unexploded ordnance and mines from decades of conflict.The UN maintains a peacekeeping force in the demilitarised zone called the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, or UNDOF.","Israeli troops have entered the demilitarised zone during the work, the United Nations confirmed to the AP.

Pakistan's Punjab province has introduced strict measures to combat rising illnesses caused by severe air pollution. Starting Monday, most outdoor activities are banned, and shops, markets, and malls in certain areas are required to close early.This move follows an earlier decision to shut down educational institutions and public spaces like parks and zoos in Lahore and nearby districts until November 17.Lahore, which has been ranked as the world's most polluted city by Swiss air quality monitor IQAir, recently recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of over 600, significantly lower than the alarming 1,900 it reached earlier in the month. For context, an AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good'.The worsening air quality has led to a sharp increase in cases of respiratory diseases, eye irritation, and conjunctivitis in districts like Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala.The Punjab government noted an unprecedented rise in patients suffering from these conditions, attributing the spread of pink eye disease to dust, smoke, and chemical exposure.As part of the new restrictions, outdoor sports events, exhibitions, and festivals have been prohibited, while essential religious activities remain exempt. Pharmacies, dairy shops, and vegetable outlets are allowed to operate until 8 pm (local time).The pollution crisis has been particularly severe in Lahore, where thick smog has caused reduced visibility, leading to road accidents. In one incident, nine people were injured on GT Road when a van collided with a parked truck due to the dense haze.Authorities in Multan are facing even more critical conditions, with the AQI reaching over 2,000 last Friday. The concentration of PM2.5 particles, a harmful pollutant known to cause severe respiratory issues, was recorded at 947 micrograms per cubic meter, which is nearly 190 times higher than World Health Organization guidelines.Critics have pointed out that the government has been slow to enforce preventive measures, with many residents seen without masks despite the hazardous air quality.Authorities have blamed cross-border winds from India for exacerbating the smog, claiming that pollutants drifting from across the border have worsened the air quality in Pakistan’s Punjab province. The Punjab government has expressed its intention to take up the issue with Indian authorities through diplomatic channels.","Pakistan's Punjab province has introduced strict measures to combat rising illnesses caused by severe air pollution.

LAHORE: Pakistan's Punjab province banned most outdoor activities and ordered shops, markets and malls in some areas to close early from Monday to curb illnesses caused by intense air pollution.The province has already closed educational institutions and public spaces like parks and zoos until Nov. 17 in places including Lahore, the world's most polluted city in terms of air quality according to Swiss group IQAir's live ratings.The districts of Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala have seen an unprecedented rise in patients with respiratory diseases, eye and throat irritation, and pink eye disease, the Punjab government said in an order issued late on Sunday.The new restrictions would also remain in force until Nov. 17, it said.""The spread of conjunctivitis/ pink eye disease due to bacterial or viral infection, smoke, dust or chemical exposure is posing a serious and imminent threat to public health,"" it said.While outdoor activities including outdoor sports events, exhibitions and festivals, and outdoor dining at restaurants have been prohibited, ""unavoidable religious rites"" are exempt from this direction, the order said.Some outlets like pharmacies, oil depots, dairy shops, and fruit and vegetable shops have similarly been exempted from the directions to close by 8 p.m. local time.Lahore's air quality remained hazardous on Monday, with an index score of more than 600, according to IQAir, but this was significantly lower than the 1,900 that it touched in some places earlier this month.A score of 0-50 is considered 'good'.Several parts of South Asia are engulfed by a toxic haze each winter as cold air traps dust, emissions, and smoke from farm fires.Punjab has blamed its particularly toxic air this year on pollution wafting in from India, where northern parts have also been battling hazardous air, and has said it will take the issue up with the neighbouring country through its foreign ministry.India's Supreme Court on Monday directed the Delhi government to decide by Nov. 25 on imposing a 'perpetual ban' on firecrackers, legal news portal Bar and Bench reported.Firecrackers set off by revellers on Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights that was celebrated on Oct. 31 this year despite a ban, has aggravated the region's pollution problem.","Pakistan's Punjab province has banned most outdoor activities and ordered shops, markets and malls in some areas to close early.

Internet users in Pakistan reported significant disruptions to Virtual Private Network (VPN) services over the weekend, with reports of “restricted access” and “throttled connectivity” affecting popular VPN providers, Dawn reported. This surge in access issues comes just days after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated former US President Donald Trump on social media platform X, a post which attracted scrutiny and sparked debate online.An outage-tracking website, issues were reported on VPN services such as VPN Unlimited and TunnelBear, Dawn reported quoting Downdetector. Users described difficulties connecting, with VPN Unlimited showing a peak of reported problems at around 6:15 pm and TunnelBear users noting connectivity issues into the evening.For many Pakistanis, VPNs are a vital tool for accessing blocked sites, including X (formerly Twitter), which has been restricted due to national security concerns. This recent wave of connectivity issues has reignited discussions over digital freedom and government policies limiting online access.Prime Minister Sharif's recent tweet congratulating Trump for his second term win garnered significant attention for both its content and the reaction it received. In his message, Sharif wrote, ""Congratulations to President-elect Donald Trump on his historic victory for a second term! I look forward to working closely with the incoming administration to further strengthen and broaden the Pakistan-US partnership.” However, X attached a community note to the tweet, pointing out that Sharif himself had banned X in Pakistan and was likely using a VPN to access the platform, which is “unlawful under Pakistani law.”This community note intensified debates over VPN usage in the country, with some citizens arguing that restrictive internet policies compel even government officials to bypass their own regulations. Another note was attached to a subsequent tweet by Sharif, congratulating Pakistan’s cricket team.In February, X was banned in Pakistan, with authorities citing “national security concerns” and non-compliance with local laws as justification. Despite the restrictions, X remains a key platform for official statements from the government.Last August, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) announced plans to scrutinise VPN services in the country, aiming to limit access to only those services that align with government regulations.

However, loans are still necessary to service existing debts, most of which are owed to Western financial institutions.The country had anticipated raising $3.2 billion against the $2.5 billion in debt needs since IMF’s approval of a $7 billion package for Pakistan in September. This included a $1.2 billion Saudi oil facility.As per sources, no agreement has been reached regarding the Saudi oil facility, five months into the fiscal year.Each month of delay reduces available funds by $100 million within the fiscal year. Pakistani authorities remain optimistic about convincing Riyadh to extend the facility. However, finance ministry spokesperson Qumar Abbasi did not respond to queries regarding the status of the $1.2 billion oil facility.Apart from IMP, Pakistan is also seeking a $1 billion loan from Dubai Islamic Bank, while requesting China to reschedule $3.4 billion in debt from China's Export-Import (Exim) Bank.Out of this amount, approximately $750 million is due in the current fiscal year. The rescheduling of this debt has been included in the country's external financing plans, as per sources.Due to its weakened financial position and the constraints imposed by the IMF agreement, Pakistan lacks the flexibility to repay its debt to China.Around $3.9 billion, of the total $6.5 billion in Chinese commercial debt, is due in the current fiscal year. The government successfully rolled over a $200 million debt that matured in September. However, sources suggest that no progress has been made in arranging another rollover, with a $1 billion payment due in March 2025.As part of its $3.2 billion plan, the government also secured Pakistan's most expensive loan in history—a $600 million facility from Standard Chartered Bank. The finance minister stated that this facility would not be utilized, while the IMF distanced itself from the loan arrangement.IMF's unexpected visit comes just six weeks after the loan's approval and four months before the planned review, which will evaluate performance against the July-September targets and assess progress for the October-December 2024 quarter.Official figures show a tax collection shortfall of Rs 190 billion over the past four months, with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collecting Rs 3.440 trillion, against a target of Rs 3.632 trillion, despite record-high taxes this year.",IMF's unexpected visit comes just six weeks after the loan's approval and four months before the planned review.

A serious incident on GT Road near Kalashah Kako saw nine people injured when a van collided with a stationary truck, its driver unable to see the parked vehicle through the dense haze.The smog has also forced Lahore high court to mandate a shutdown of all trade activities by 8 pm and close markets on Sundays, aiming to minimize pollution-inducing activity.In Multan, conditions reached what experts called ""apocalyptic"" levels, with the AQI exceeding 2,000 on Friday morning.

The WHO deems PM2.5 levels above five micrograms per cubic meter harmful.In response, the state government is on high alert, implementing emergency measures to curb pollution levels. Public parks and museums across major cities have been closed until at least November 17.Authorities have also faced criticism for failing to enforce preemptive anti-smog directives, with citizens often seen without masks despite the severe air quality.Multan, the largest city in southern Punjab, recorded an extremely dangerous Air Quality Index (AQI) of 2,135 between 8am and 9am on Friday, according to data from IQAir, as reported by Dawn.

The proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), the most prominent militant group in the restive province, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying its suicide unit, the Majeed Brigade, had carried out the bombing to target a “Pakistani army unit” returning via train after completing a course at an infantry school.Authorities said the blast was a “suicide attack” primarily on law enforcement agencies, while civilians were also targeted. Forty-six among the injured were Pakistan army soldiers, police said. The explosion occurred as a popular morning train, Jaffar Express, was about to leave a station in Quetta for Peshawar in the northwest.Pakistan Railways had restored train services between Quetta and Peshawar last month after a suspension of seven weeks because separatist militants in Balochistan had blown up a key railway bridge in Aug.Social media videos captured Saturday’s explosion. The bomb went off when hundreds of people were at the platform. A video of the aftermath showed injured individuals and debris strewn throughout the station. The steel structure of the platform’s roof had been ripped apart.“The target was army personnel from the Infantry School,” said Muazzam Jah Ansari, police chief of Balochistan province.Wasim Baig, spokesperson for the provincial health department, said the death toll rose to 26 after two people succumbed to their injuries in hospital while 62 others were injured.The BLA has long waged an armed rebellion, driven by demands for independence and control over the province’s gas and mineral resources.Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti called the act deplorable and the perpetrators “worse than animals”. He said the authorities would pursue them and “bring them to their logical end”.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced the bombing, saying those who orchestrated the attack “will pay a very heavy price for it”, adding that security forces were determined to eliminate “the menace of terrorism”.A decades-old insurgency has destabilised Balochistan and created security concerns for China-led projects trying to access the province’s untapped resources. In Aug at least 73 people were killed in Balochistan province after separatist militants attacked police stations, railway lines and highways.Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest province and the richest in terms of natural resources, but it is the least developed. The region shares a volatile border with Iran and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, and also boasts a vast coastline along the Arabian Sea.The govt’s military operation to suppress the separatist movement in the province has resulted in widespread human rights abuses against Baloch dissenters, including disappearances, torture and extrajudicial killings.","14 soldiers, six railway employees and six civilian passengers killed.

KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA: Front Line Defenders have condemned the arrest of human rights defender Idris Khattak, demanding his immediate release due to safety issues and deteriorating health .According to Front Line Defenders, Idris Khattak was abducted on November 13, 2019, and was later tried by the military court under the Official Secrets Act . In December 2021, he was sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment.In the 5 years of imprisonment, the human rights defender has gone through unsanitary and unsafe conditions in the jail.In a post on X, the Front Line Defenders stated, ""We urge Pakistani authorities to immediately end the persecution and incarceration of HRD Idris Khattak , especially given his age and underlying health concerns. Following his enforced disappearance , and 5 years of unjust imprisonment for his human rights work campaigning for religious and ethnic minorities , we call for his immediate and safe release to his family.""Idris Khattak is a prominent human rights advocate in Pakistan. His activism has focused on defending the rights of religious and ethnic minorities, often in the face of systematic state repression. Khattak has been particularly vocal about abuses carried out by military and intelligence agencies, especially in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region, which has experienced ongoing conflict and instability.United Nations human rights experts also lamented the conviction and said, ""Mr. Khattak's reported sentencing is an attack against the human rights community in Pakistan and sends a chilling message to civil society activists monitoring and reporting on alleged violations, committed by the military and security forces or with their consent or acquiescence, such as systematic or widespread enforced disappearances.""Pakistan is known for violating human rights by forcibly disappearing the activists and defenders. The people who are abducted by the Pakistan military forces are not given medical assistance and are not allowed to meet their families.","Idris Khattak is a prominent human rights advocate in Pakistan.

Amid attempts to strike a balance in its relations with the US and China, Pakistan has said it can help bridge the differences between the two world powers.Relations between Washington and Beijing have been strained over their attempts to increase their global influence. The tensions stem mainly from disagreements over trade, Taiwan, the South China Sea and China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).While Pakistan has aligned itself with the US for military cooperation and counter-terrorism efforts, it relies heavily on China to address its financial woes. Islamabad has strengthened economic ties with Beijing through initiatives like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).“Pakistan has the potential to serve as a bridge between China and the United States,” Pakistan ambassador to Washington Rizwan Saeed Sheikh was quoted as saying by state-run Radio Pakistan on Friday.The statement was made just hours after Pakistan’s foreign office declared on Thursday that Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election would not impact Pakistan’s ties with China. When questioned on the matter, Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch had responded, “Pakistan’s relations with China are all-weather. They are strategic and a source of stability in our foreign policy.”Baloch said Islamabad does not even need to consider the possibility that its relationship with China will be affected by any domestic development in another country.The intricate rivalry between the US and China affects Pakistan as it manages its strategic alliances with both powers while enduring a protracted economic crisis.“Our relations with the US are decades old, and we look forward to further strengthen and broaden the Pakistan-US relationship in all fields,” Baloch said. “As the deputy PM (Ishaq Dar) said in a tweet yesterday, we look forward to fruitful and mutually beneficial cooperation between Pakistan and the US.”During the Cold War, Pakistan and the US had developed close defence ties, but their relationship was also put to the test by different priorities on various issues.Relations between the two had soured in recent years as Washington accused Islamabad of aiding the Taliban in their 2021 takeover of Kabul, accusations that Islamabad denied. Tensions increased even more between the two countries when Pakistan’s jailed former PM Imran Khan accused the Biden administration of planning his removal through a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in April 2022, a claim denied by the US.","Pakistan has said it can help bridge the differences between the two world powers.

DHAKA: Bangladesh’s interim govt said on Sunday that it would request an Interpol “red notice” alert to repatriate deposed PM Sheikh Hasina and her Awami League colleagues from abroad to face trial for alleged crimes against humanity. They are accused of involvement in “killings and genocide” during the student-led uprising in July-Aug that led to Hasina’s ouster. “It will be done very soon,” law adviser Asif Nazrul said on Sunday.France-based Interpol publishes red notices at the request of a member nation, based on an arrest warrant issued in their home country. The Yunus-led administration has moved quickly to try the top Awami League functionaries, including Hasina and general secretary Obaidul Quader, by having arrest warrants issued against them through International Crimes Tribunal (ICT). A local court has ordered the authorities to arrest and present them before it by Nov 18. ICT chief prosecutor Muhammad Tajul Islam said steps would be taken to bring Awami League to justice if the govt issues directives.The development came even as complaint of “genocide” and other crimes was filed at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague against 62 individuals, including interim govt chief adviser Muhammad Yunus.The complaint was filed by former Sylhet mayor Anwaruzzaman Chowdhury. Other than Yunus and his advisers, Chowdhury also wants co-ordinators of the students’ uprising prosecuted. Chowdhury has alleged “genocide and crimes against humanity against Awami League’s leaders and activists, Hindus, Christians, Buddhists and police in Bangladesh, all of whom were killed in the name of the students’ movement”. The complaint was lodged under Article 15 of ICC’s Rome Statute, which empowers individuals and others to send information on crimes within the court’s jurisdiction. Yunus’ law adviser Nazrul dismissed the plea as an attempt to mislead global opinion. “This is not a case. It is just a petition. Any person can do that,” he said.",Bangladesh's interim govt wants to repatriate deposed PM Sheikh Hasina and her Awami League colleagues from abroad.

DHAKA: Around 200 Bangladeshis abducted by security forces during toppled premier Sheikh Hasina's rule are still missing, a commission tasked with investigating enforced disappearances said Tuesday.Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India in August as a student-led uprising saw protesters flood streets of the capital Dhaka, bringing a dramatic end to her iron-fisted tenure.Her government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killing of hundreds of political opponents and the unlawful abduction and disappearance of hundreds more.A commission of inquiry set up by the caretaker government now running the country said that five people had been released from secret detention centres after Hasina's ouster, but that many more were still unaccounted for.""There is no trace of at least 200 people. We have been working to locate them,"" commission member Noor Khan said.The commission said it had identified at least eight secret detention centres in Dhaka and its outskirts, some with cells as small as three by four feet (90 by 120 centimetres).It said the walls of these cells had engravings that appeared to show their occupants having kept tally of the number of days they had been detained.One commissioner said there had been efforts by unnamed law enforcement agencies to erase evidence of these secret detention centres after Hasina's overthrow.Commissioners said most disappearance cases brought to its attention blamed the elite Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) police unit.The RAB was sanctioned by Washington in 2021 alongside seven of its senior officers in response to reports of its culpability in some of the worst rights abuses committed during Hasina's rule.Commission chair Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury said that institutional breakdowns in the government and judiciary had also allowed a climate of impunity to flourish under Hasina.""They used the law enforcement agency not in the public interest, but for their own agenda and political interest,"" he said.The commission was established by the interim government of Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus as part of its efforts to implement far-reaching democratic reforms.Yunus has previously said he inherited a ""completely broken down"" system of public administration that needed a comprehensive overhaul to prevent a future return to autocracy.","Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India in August as a student-led uprising saw protesters flood streets of the capital Dhaka.

MANDALAY: Sculptor Aung Naing Lin has spent decades carving Buddha statues to help guide Myanmar's faithful -- but getting the marble he needs from rebel-held quarries in the midst of civil war is now a perilous task.Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been mired in bloody conflict since the military toppled the government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021, terminating a 10-year experiment with democracy and sparking a widespread armed uprising.In recent months, opponents of the military have advanced with rocket and drone attacks on Mandalay -- the country's second-biggest city, with a population of 1.5 million.The rebels have also seized the hillside quarries that have for generations provided the marble that adorns Mandalay's palaces and monasteries, as well as the shrines in ordinary homes.Now, moving the precious stone and roughly carved statues by truck across the divide of the civil war, from rebel to junta-held territory, is expensive, difficult and dangerous.""The situation around the Madaya township (where the quarries are located) is not very good,"" Aung Naing Lin told AFP at his noisy workshop in Mandalay, his face and hair speckled with white dust.""It is not easy to go, and we cannot bring the stones back.""Surrounded by dozens of blank-faced Buddha statues waiting to be given eyes, ears and lips, Min Min Soe agreed.""Sales are not that bad, but the challenge is bringing the statues here,"" he said.""We can sell only the statues we have here and we cannot bring new raw statues in.""The owner of another workshop, who did not want to be named, said associates of his were recently arrested when taking a shipment of marble from rebel-held Madaya.""They were detained by the local military column and were asked how they brought the stones out from the village as that area was controlled by the PDF,"" they said.""People's Defence Forces"" are units made up of former students, farmers and workers who have left their lives behind to take up arms and oppose the junta's coup.There are dozens of PDFs across the country, and they have dragged the junta into a bloody stalemate.The junta has designated them as ""terrorists"", and contact with them can bring years in prison.""Later, they released the people who had been detained and gave the stones back,"" the workshop owner said.""It's like a warning to all. We dare not to bring stones from the village under this situation.""The quarries of Madaya have long been interwoven with the cultural and religious history of Myanmar.In the 1860s, following two disastrous wars with the British, then-king Mindon commissioned craftsmen in Mandalay to transfer Buddhist scriptures from palm leaf manuscripts onto 720 blocks of solid marble to ensure they survived any further destruction.The stone also resonates with the military that has ruled Myanmar for much of its history since independence from Britain in 1948.In 2020, it sanctioned the building of a 25-metre (82-foot) high statue of the Buddha made from Madaya marble to adorn its custom-built capital Naypyidaw.Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing declared the statue finished last year and a visit has since become a stock feature of the itineraries of the few foreign delegations that visit the isolated junta.While the fighting continues north of Mandalay, Min Min Soe and others work to put the finishing touches on the dozens of roughly hewn statues.Their forefathers used chisels, but nowadays, craftsmen use drills to etch everything from Buddha's face, the folds in his robe, fingernails and the lotus flower he sits on.The laborious final stages of smoothing the rough edges are done by women using sandpaper, said Min Min Soe.""Women are better at this as they are more patient,"" he said.A finished statue around 25 centimetres (10 inches) high fetches between 100,000 - 200,000 Myanmar kyat ($50-$100 at the official exchange rate), he said.Outside one of the workshops on the busy street, workers packed a sitting Buddha statue into a wooden protective frame before shipping it off to a customer.Min Min Soe says looking after the dozens of his creations still in stock helps him find his own peace amid rumours of an attack on Mandalay.He considers them ""living Buddhas"".""I clean the statues at 4 am every day... This is not only for my business but also to gain merit,"" he said.""I want them to be clean and good-looking no matter if they are sold or not.""",Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been mired in bloody conflict since the military toppled the government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021.

I have witnessed the atrocities against them—their temples, businesses, and homes,"" Hindu civic leader Charu Chandra Das Brahmachari told news agency AFP.The interim administration under Muhammad Yunus has recognized and condemned these incidents against Hindus, while maintaining that many of the attacks were politically rather than religiously motivated.Continuous demonstrations since then indicate ongoing attacks and demand action from Yunus's administration, which serves as an ""advisory council"" responsible for implementing democratic reforms and organizing new elections.Recent tensions escalated when sedition charges were filed against 19 individuals who participated in an earlier minority rights demonstration in Chittagong.Authorities accused these individuals of disrespectingBangladesh 's national flag by positioning a saffron flag—the symbolic color of Hinduism—above it.""Framing our leaders with false charges, like sedition, has made us skeptical of the government's intentions,"" said protest member Chiranjan Goswami.In predominantly Muslim Bangladesh, Hindus constitute the largest minority religious group, representing approximately eight percent of the population.Reports also indicate attacks on Sufi shrines, with Islamist groups suspected of targeting alternative Islamic practices.Saturday's protest followed a larger gathering in Chittagong the previous day, which drew 10,000 participants.Minority community leaders have announced plans for additional demonstrations in the coming weeks.In August, Hasina, aged 77, departed by helicopter to India as protesters filled Dhaka's streets, marking a dramatic conclusion to her authoritarian leadership.Her administration faced accusations of extensive human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings of thousands of political opponents during her 15-year tenure.","Demonstrators call on interim government to establish legislation protecting minorities.

'My intention was not to be nasty': Viral post's writer Narinder Kaur apologizes



Conspiracy theories over Kate Middleton's cancer resurfaced on social media as the Princess of Wales joined William and King Charles at a Remembrance event in London Saturday. The event made her first formal appearance since finishing her chemotherapy but social media users again started their theories that Kate either never had cancer or she exaggerated her health situation.These conspiracy theories have their roots in Sky News Australia's royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills' comments that she made in September: “In March the princess confirmed that pre-cancerous cells had been found following abdominal surgery and that she would have to undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy.” Mills wrote this as part of the report that covered Kate's announcement that she was cancer free.All these started with a post made by TV presenter Narinder Kaur who commented on Kate Middleton's looks at the Remembrance event and posted: ""Genuine question -- why has Kate aged so much? Isn't she only 42? Is she a smoker? It's the only explanation."" Narinder posted and then drew a huge backlash.51-year-old Narinder is a Good Morning Britain panelist and a former Big Brother contestant. She appears as a commentator of shows including GMB, GB News and Loose Women.Social media users schooled Kaur and informed her that Kate Middleton underwent cancer treatment and that was the point when many started regurgitating the conspiracy theory that she actually never had cancer.""My brother had cancer...he didn't age like that,"" Kaur replied defiantly before apologizing.Later, Kaur said her post was stupid and being nasty was not her intention but she received ""sexual, racist and violent"" abuse because of her post.""I thought I'd do a quick video instead of tweet after tweet, because it becomes pretty ridiculous – as if it wasn't ridiculous enough already.""I put out a stupid tweet. That wasn't my intention, my intention was not to be malicious or nasty or anything.""I'm not like that, anybody who knows me. It was stupid to ask about the ageing. I've admitted that, I've put my hands up and apologised if it caused offence.""The only people who were offended though, because many people on Twitter and social media have asked exactly what I've asked but did not receive the sexual, racial, violent abuse that I did from accounts with EDL flags, Union Jacks, disgusting abuse,"" she said.Kaur said her brother ""went through brutal treatment of chemo"" when he was suffering from cancer before his death and claimed she wouldn't have made remarks about Kate's appearance with regard to her cancer diagnosis. She also talked about Kate's privilege of not having to work during the treatment. She said she was attacked only because she was a brown woman from India and had the gall to comment about the looks of Kate Middleton. She said she never spoke about cancer or Meghan Markle but the debate plunged into something different exposing her to online threats.",'My intention was not to be nasty': Viral post's writer Narinder Kaur apologizes for her now-deleted post.

King Charles leads silence for UK war dead as Kate returns to public life,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/king-charles-leads-silence-for-uk-war-dead-as-kate-returns-to-public-life/articleshow/115142694.cms,"LONDON: King Charles III led Britain in two minutes of silence on Sunday to honour the country's war dead at a remembrance service also attended by Catherine, Princess of Wales, as she returns to royal duties after cancer treatment.The king, who was also diagnosed with cancer this year, was among dignitaries to lay wreaths at the Cenotaph memorial in central London after the nation fell silent at 11:00 am (1100 GMT).Crowds lined the Whitehall area of the capital as political leaders including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, current and former members of the armed forces, and war veterans paid their respects to Britons killed in the world wars and other conflicts.Catherine, wife of heir to the throne Prince William, watched the ceremony from a government building balcony as she stepped up her return to royal duties since ending chemotherapy in September.The event came after she smiled and clapped alongside her husband Prince William at the Festival of Remembrance commemorative concert on Saturday night, the first major royal occasion she had attended since her treatment.The events, two of the most important dates in the royal calendar, marked the first time the princess had carried out two consecutive days of public official engagements this year.Buckingham Palace announced in February that Charles, 75, had been diagnosed with an undisclosed cancer and would withdraw from public life to undergo treatment.The following month Kate, 42, revealed that she also had been diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing chemotherapy.Both have since made limited returns to public duties, with Charles recently pausing his treatment while on tour in Australia and Samoa.William said this week that the past year had been ""brutal"" and probably the ""hardest"" of his life because of the twin diagnoses.""Honestly, it's been dreadful,"" he told reporters on Thursday at the end of a four-day visit to South Africa for his Earthshot prize initiative.""So, trying to get through everything else and keep everything on track has been really difficult.""Queen Camilla, Charles's wife, missed the remembrance events due to a chest infection.","King Charles III led Britain in two minutes of silence to honour the country's war dead.

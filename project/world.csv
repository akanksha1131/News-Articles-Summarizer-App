"Epstein is ‘greatest blackmailer ever’: Commerce secretary makes bombshell claims, suggests he may have traded videos for leniency",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-is-greatest-blackmailer-ever-commerce-secretary-makes-bombshell-claims-suggests-he-may-have-traded-videos-for-leniency/articleshow/124280818.cms,"Howard Lutnick makes bombshell claims on Jeffrey Epstein





US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has alleged that high-profile associates of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were actively involved in Epstein's illicit activities and may have been blackmailed with compromising videos.Speaking on the New York Post's Miranda Divine Pod Force One podcast on Wednesday whether high-profile associates of Epstein knew of his behavior and just ignored it, Lutnick stated, ""No, they participated. They participated That's what his MO was -- 'Get a massage, get a massage.'""Lutnick further claimed, ""And what happened in that massage room, I assume, was on video. This guy was the greatest blackmailer ever.""He suggested that Epstein may have exchanged blackmail material for a reduced prison sentence in the ""sweetheart deal"" Epstein received during his 2008 state charges.""I assume, way back when, they traded those videos in exchange for him getting that 18-month sentence, which allowed him to have visits and be out of jail. I mean, he's a serial sex offender. How could he get 18 months and be able to go to his office during the day and have visitors and stuff? There must have been a trade,"" Lutnick added.These allegations contrast with statements made by FBI Director Kash Patel, who, during testimony before Congress last month, responded to Senator John Kennedy's inquiry about whether Epstein trafficked young women to others besides himself by saying, ""Himself. There is no credible information. None. If there were, I would bring the case yesterday that he trafficked to other individuals.""Meanwhile, the Trump administration has faced criticism for its decision not to release materials pertaining to the Epstein investigation. In July, following backlash from MAGA supporters, the administration announced that no additional files would be made public.President Donald Trump, who was friends with Epstein in the 1990s before their falling out, dismissed calls to release the files as a ""hoax"" orchestrated by his political adversaries.""It's all been a big hoax,"" Trump told reporters in July. ""It's perpetrated by the Democrats and some stupid Republicans, and foolish Republicans fall into the net. And so they try and do the Democrats' work."" In the same interview, Lutnick described Epstein as ""gross."" ""I say to him, 'Massage table in the middle of your house? How often do you have a massage?'"" Lutnick recounted. ""And he says, 'Every day.' And then he gets, like, weirdly close to me, and he says, 'And the right kind of massage.'""","US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has alleged that high-profile associates of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were actively involved in Epstein's illicit activities.

‘Lawful not murder: Donald Trump declares US in 'armed conflict' with drug cartels; labels strikes ‘necessary’ to safeguard Americans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/lawful-not-murder-donald-trump-declares-us-in-armed-conflict-with-drug-cartels-labels-strikes-necessary-to-safeguard-americans/articleshow/124281834.cms,"Donald Trump (AP)





US President Donald Trump has declared that the United States is in a formal ""armed conflict"" with drug cartels designated as terrorist organizations, and that suspected smugglers for these groups should be considered ""unlawful combatants,"" as per a confidential notice sent to Congress this week.The notice, sent to multiple congressional committees, provides further detail on the administration’s previously limited legal justification for three US military strikes last month on boats in the Caribbean Sea. These attacks, which killed all 17 people on board, are argued by the administration to be lawful rather than murder, as reported by the New York Times.Under international law, a country engaged in an armed conflict can legally kill enemy combatants even if they do not pose an immediate threat, detain them indefinitely without trial, and try them in military courts.White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly stated that Trump is following through on his commitment to combat drug cartels.“As we have said many times, the President acted in line with the law of armed conflict to protect our country from those trying to bring deadly poison to our shores, and he is delivering on his promise to take on the cartels and eliminate these national security threats from murdering more Americans,"" Kelly was quoted as saying by ABC News.The memo states that Trump has ""determined"" that cartels involved in drug smuggling are ""nonstate armed groups"" whose activities ""constitute an armed attack against the United States.""The notice to Congress did not identify any specific drug cartels involved in the alleged armed conflict, nor did it clarify the criteria the administration uses to determine whether individual suspects are sufficiently connected to these groups to justify military action.The memo refers to a September 15 incident in which three people were killed on an alleged Venezuelan vessel, asserting that US actions in striking the boat were consistent with the law of armed conflict.""The vessel was assessed by the US intelligence community to be affiliated with a designated terrorist organization and, at the time, engaged in trafficking illicit drugs, which could ultimately be used to kill Americans,"" the memo stated.It added that, although the strike was limited in scope, US forces remain prepared to continue military operations ""as necessary"" to prevent further deaths or injuries to Americans by eliminating the threat ""posed by these designated terrorist organizations.""US officials have long argued that Venezuelan cocaine shipments fuel overdose deaths in the country and accuse President Nicolás Maduro of enabling drug trafficking, a charge he denies. The Trump administration has also offered a $50 million bounty for his capture.","US President Donald Trump has declared that the United States is in a formal ""armed conflict"" with drug cartels designated as terrorist organizations.

Understanding how UAE fuel prices are set

Tips to save on fuel in 2025





The UAE Fuel Price Committee has announced the fuel prices for October 2025, reflecting a slight increase across all fuel types compared to September. These adjustments align with global oil market trends and are part of the UAE's monthly review process to keep domestic fuel prices in line with international rates.These price changes are determined based on the average global price of oil and are applicable across all Emirates, including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and others. The UAE's approach to fuel pricing ensures that residents and businesses experience consistent and transparent fuel costs. For people commuting daily to work, school, or errands, the small price hike may feel noticeable at the pump. Middle-class and lower-income residents can manage costs by:The recent increase in UAE fuel prices for October 2025 is closely linked to trends in the global oil market, which plays a major role in determining local fuel costs. Factors such as international supply and demand, geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions, and fluctuations in crude oil prices all have a direct impact on the rates residents pay at the pump. For example, disruptions in major oil-exporting countries or unexpected changes in production can quickly drive up global prices, which then filter down to domestic markets. Additionally, seasonal demand spikes, such as increased travel during holidays, can also influence pricing.By understanding these global dynamics, everyday commuters and middle-class families can better anticipate changes and plan their monthly fuel budgets more effectively, rather than being caught off guard by sudden hikes.Fuel pricing in the UAE follows a deregulated model introduced in August 2015, which links local petrol and diesel rates to international oil prices. This policy ensures transparency and aligns retail prices with global market conditions. Each month, the UAE Fuel Price Committee reviews global trends and announces new rates, typically during the final days of the month. These rates take effect from the 1st day of the following month.This approach means UAE motorists feel the impact of both upswings and drops in the international energy market, encouraging more efficient fuel usage while maintaining pricing fairness.Looking to keep more dirhams in your pocket while filling up? Think of it as fuel-saving hacks for everyday heroes. First, carpooling like a boss sharing rides with friends or colleagues not only saves cash but also gives you some gossip time on the road. Next, combine your errands; that extra trip to the supermarket? Toss it in with the school run. Drive like a Zen master gentle acceleration, smooth braking, and no sudden sprints can stretch every litre farther. Don’t forget your car needs TLC too; proper tire pressure and timely servicing mean your engine sips fuel, not gulps it. And if you really want to be clever, fill up during off-peak hours, so you avoid long queues and unnecessary idling. A little planning and some smart moves can turn fuel anxiety into a monthly money-saving win.While the October 2025 fuel price adjustments represent a modest increase, they underscore the UAE's commitment to aligning domestic fuel prices with global market conditions. Staying informed about these changes allows consumers and businesses to plan and adapt accordingly.","The UAE Fuel Price Committee has announced the fuel prices for October 2025, reflecting a slight increase across all fuel types compared to September.

No threat found: New Jersey’s Joint military base McGuire lifts hour-long lockdown; false shooter report triggers chaos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-threat-found-new-jerseys-joint-military-base-mcguire-lifts-hour-long-lockdown-false-shooter-report-triggers-chaos/articleshow/124241101.cms,"New Jersey's Joint base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL) (Pic credit: AP)

Why is Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst significant?







A lockdown at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL) in Burlington County, New Jersey, was lifted around noon on Tuesday after a hoax shooter threat.A lockdown was imposed just before 11 am ET, which lasted approximately one hour following a report of an active shooter at the major US military installation. However, authorities later determined there was no active shooter threat.Base officials an hour later confirmed in a Facebook post stating, “ALL CLEAR. All personnel are to resume normal operations.” The lockdown had been ordered just before 11 am, with an earlier advisory urging personnel outdoors to take cover.“Our priority is the safety and security of everyone on the installation,” Col. Michael Stefanovic, JBMDL commander, said in a statement. “We worked closely with local law enforcement and emergency responders to ensure the situation was investigated and resolved as quickly as possible.”Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, located in central New Jersey, is a key tri-service US military installation, formed in 2009 through the merger of McGuire Air Force Base, Fort Dix, and Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst. Spanning over 42,000 acres across Burlington and Ocean counties, the base supports air mobility, training, and engineering operations critical to national defense.The installation is home to more than 40 units and mission partners, including the Air Force’s 305th Air Mobility Wing, Army Reserve and Guard units, and Navy test and evaluation programs. Its strategic location allows for rapid global deployment of personnel and equipment, while also serving as a central training hub for service members."," lockdown at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst lifted after hoax shooter threat. lockdown was imposed just before 11 am ET, which lasted approximately one hour.

Thinking of inviting your parents, siblings, or even a friend, to visit you in the UAE? You’ll now need to show what’s in your paycheck. The country has introduced new income rules for sponsoring visitors, with different salary slabs depending on who you’re inviting. It’s part of a bigger shake-up to the UAE’s visa system, which now includes new categories, special permits, and updated rules for families, professionals, and humanitarian cases.Inviting someone to the UAE on a visit visa now depends not just on who they are, but also on how much you earn. As part of sweeping updates to its visa system, the UAE’s Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has introduced income-based eligibility rules for residents sponsoring friends and family.According to the ICP, the updated policy lays out three distinct salary thresholds:These new requirements are part of a broader set of regulatory updates introduced by the ICP. The income-based criteria are intended to ensure financial responsibility on the part of the sponsor and to streamline the process in a way that supports transparency and sustainable immigration management.According to the ICP, the changes were introduced following extensive studies that examined present and future trends in residency and international mobility.The analysis also incorporated feedback from customers, stakeholders, and frontline service centers. These insights were gathered via mechanisms such as customer councils, call centers, and the authority’s complaints and inquiry platforms.Once the visit visa is approved, visitors, whether family or friends, can generally stay in the UAE for 30 to 90 days, depending on the visa type issued. Some of these visas also come with the option to extend the stay, usually in two stages:These extensions are not automatic and are subject to approval and additional fees.If you're planning to sponsor a friend or relative, make sure all the required documents and conditions are in place before applying. The process is straightforward, but attention to detail matters. Here’s what’s expected:If you’re sponsoring a relative, you’ll need to submit proof of kinship and a valid justification for the visit. For instance, if you're sponsoring a foreign woman whose husband resides in the GCC, you must also attach a copy of his UAE or GCC residence permit.As part of the updated framework, the UAE has launched four new types of visit visas tailored to specific professional and economic sectors:These new categories are intended to attract global talent and enhance the UAE’s visibility as a destination for innovation, leisure, and industry-specific gatherings.Also read: UAE launches 4 new special Visit Visas for AI, cruise, events, and entertainment Beyond the visit visa updates, the ICP has introduced sweeping changes to residency rules, aimed at offering more flexibility across humanitarian, family, and professional circumstances. Here’s a summary of key developments:A one-year renewable residency permit can now be issued to foreigners from countries experiencing war, disasters, or unrest. Notably, this permit does not require a guarantor or host. Its issuance or cancellation will be based on reports by the General Directorate of Identity and Foreigners Affairs.Importantly, the Director General of Identity and Foreigners Affairs has the authority to waive standard requirements like financial solvency or kinship degree in special humanitarian cases involving relatives or in-laws. This aims to ensure compassionate handling of vulnerable individuals.Two categories of women are now eligible for a renewable one-year residence permit:All applicants must demonstrate financial capability and adequate housing. Custody disputes will be settled by a designated legal committee.Applicants must now either prove strong financial solvency related to their planned business, or clearly demonstrate they are already actively engaged in a similar business either abroad or through a registered UAE-based entity.Regulations for truck drivers have been streamlined. These visas can be single or multiple-entry and must be sponsored by licensed freight or logistics companies.

Trump’s Most Awkward Speech Yet? Generals Refuse to Clap, Silence Fills the Room | WATCH





US defense secretary Pete Hegseth on Tuesday announced new directives for the military, including implementing gender-neutral physical fitness standards and eliminating what he described as ""woke"" culture from the armed forces. The announcement came during an in-person meeting with military officials at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia.The new policies are guided by what Hegseth calls the “1990 test,” which examines whether changes to military standards since 1990 were necessary due to evolving combat needs or were influenced by other priorities. “The 1990s test is simple. What were the military standards in 1990, and if they have changed, tell me why: Was it a necessary change based on the evolving landscape of combat, or was the change due to a softening, weakening or gender-based pursuit of other priorities?” he explained.“I don’t want my son serving alongside troops who are out of shape, or in a combat unit with females who can’t meet the same Combat Arms physical standards as men, or troops who are not fully proficient on their assigned weapons, platform, or task, or under a leader who was the first but not the best. Standards must be uniform, gender neutral and high,” Hegseth said.Women were first allowed in direct combat roles during the Obama administration.While Hegseth did not announce a full rollback of women in combat, he made it clear that the “highest male standards” would now apply to all combat roles. He acknowledged that this could result in fewer women qualifying for some positions.“We very much value the impact of female troops — our female officers and NCOs are the absolute best in the world. But when it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender-neutral,” he said. “If women can make it, excellent. If not, it is what it is. If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it. That is not the intent, but it could be the result. ”Under the new rules, all combat personnel, including generals and admirals, will be required to pass two yearly physical tests. Hegseth emphasized that the standards are “gender neutral” but will be based on the “highest male standard” for physical fitness in combat roles.","US defense secretary Pete Hegseth on Tuesday announced new directives for the military.

Here’s everything you need to know about Civil Marriage Law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-getting-married-in-abu-dhabi-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-civil-marriage-law/articleshow/124227630.cms,"Skip the stress, keep the romance: Civil Marriage Abu Dhabi

Who can marry in Abu Dhabi? Eligibility and legal framework



How to apply and what documents you need



The ceremony, legal effect and practical aftercare

Why expatriates are choosing Abu Dhabi for civil marriage

Legal benefits and global recognition of Abu Dhabi civil marriage





Abu Dhabi’s civil marriage service lets couples solemnize a legally recognized, secular marriage at the Abu Dhabi Civil Family Court under Law No. 14 of 2021. The service is open to most residents and visitors (with a key exception for Muslim UAE nationals) and is designed to be fast, internationally recognised and simple to navigate. If you’re planning to marry in Abu Dhabi, here’s a clear, practical guide to who can apply, what to prepare, how the ceremony works, the fees and why the reform matters for expatriates.Abu Dhabi’s civil-marriage scheme is governed by Abu Dhabi Law No. 14 of 2021 and applies to people regardless of religion or nationality, except for UAE nationals who are Muslims they remain subject to Sharia-based family law. Applicants must be at least 18 years old, give mutual consent, must not be married to someone else, and must not be related within the first or second degree. Tourists and non-residents can apply online and must travel to Abu Dhabi for the ceremony once approved. The move to allow civil marriage grew from wider UAE reforms introduced since 2021 to provide non-religious personal-status options and align with international norms.Couples can submit applications through the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department’s online portal or at authorised typing centres. The core documents are passports (and Emirates ID if resident), a completed application form, and proof that any prior marriage has been legally dissolved (divorce decree or death certificate).A prenuptial agreement is optional. There are two service tracks: the standard service (about AED 300, processed within roughly 10 working days) and an express option (around AED 2,500) that can be processed in one working day and lets couples choose the ceremony date. After approval, the court schedules the ceremony at its Civil Family Court.On the ceremony day both parties attend the Abu Dhabi Civil Family Court with IDs; no external witnesses are required because the civil marriage officer serves as the legal witness. Vows are played via a pre-recorded audio available in multiple languages, though couples can exchange rings, recite their own vows and bring guests or a photographer. After signing, the marriage certificate is legally binding; many couples choose to have the certificate attested by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for overseas use and embassy recognition. The process is intentionally straightforward to ensure the marriage is widely accepted by foreign authorities.Abu Dhabi has emerged as a preferred destination for non-Muslim expatriates and mixed-nationality couples seeking to formalize their unions legally. For many, coming from countries with strict marriage laws, religious restrictions, or cumbersome bureaucratic processes, Abu Dhabi offers a simpler, faster, and transparent system. Unlike traditional procedures that may require approval from multiple authorities or religious institutions, the civil marriage framework in Abu Dhabi allows couples to complete the process efficiently through a single legal channel.The system is particularly appealing for couples who previously faced hurdles due to differences in religion or nationality. Expats report that the process is streamlined, well-documented, and predictable, reducing both time and administrative stress. By providing a legally recognized, state-backed platform, Abu Dhabi has become a go-to destination for couples who want their marriage to be valid, hassle-free, and compliant with international legal standards.One of the biggest draws of Abu Dhabi’s civil marriage system is its legal robustness and international recognition.

‘New level of escalation’: Putin warns Trump on sending Tomahawks to Ukraine; US plans may be unfeasible due to limited inventories,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-level-of-escalation-putin-warns-trump-on-sending-tomahawks-to-ukraine-us-plans-may-be-unfeasible-due-to-limited-inventories/articleshow/124282124.cms,"



Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that supplying US Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine could trigger a “whole new level of escalation”, including in relations between Moscow and Washington.Speaking at a forum in Sochi, Putin said that it would not alter the situation on the battlefield, where the Russian army is making slow but steady advances.""Using Tomahawks without the direct participation of American military personnel is impossible. This would mark a completely new, qualitatively new stage of escalation, including in relations between Russia and the United States,"" Putin said at the forum.However, few hours after Putin's warning, Reuters reported that the Trump administration’s plan to send Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine may be unfeasible because current inventories are committed to the US navy and other uses.A US official told Reuters that there was no shortage of the Tomahawk missile, which the military frequently uses for land attack missions, suggesting that alternative shorter-distance weapons could be provided to Kyiv.The official added that the US may consider allowing European allies to purchase other long-range weapons and supply them to Ukraine, but Tomahawks were unlikely.In recent weeks, President Donald Trump has significantly shifted his rhetoric regarding the war in Ukraine, suggesting Kyiv could retake all the land Russia has seized and describing the Russian military as a ""paper tiger.""One tangible outcome of this new stance is the US decision to assist Ukraine in targeting Russian energy infrastructure. A new financial mechanism, the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL), has been developed by the US and its allies to supply Ukraine with new weapons and those from US stocks using funds from Nato countries.Supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine could significantly expand its strike capabilities, enabling it to hit targets deep inside Russian territory, including military bases, logistics hubs, airfields, and command centres that are currently beyond reach.The Kremlin said on Thursday that if the US provides Tomahawks to Ukraine, it would trigger a new round of dangerous escalation between Russia and the West.According to Pentagon budget documents, the US Navy, the primary user of the Tomahawk, has thus far purchased 8,959 missiles at an average price of Rs 10.8 crore each. The Tomahawk missile has been in production since the mid-1980s. In recent years, production has ranged from 55 to 90 per year. According to Pentagon budget data, the US plans to buy 57 missiles in 2026.","Vladimir Putin said supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine could trigger a ‘whole new level of escalation’ Putin said that it would not alter the situation on the battlefield, where the Russian army is making slow but steady advances.

Russian President Vladimir Putin fired back on Thursday at US President Donald Trump for calling Russia a “paper tiger,” suggesting that Nato itself might fit that description.Speaking at the Valdai Discussion Group in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Putin stated that Russian forces were advancing along the entire front in Ukraine and that nearly the entire US-led Nato alliance was now opposing Russia.""A paper tiger. What follows then? Go and deal with this paper tiger. Well if we are fighting with the entire Nato bloc, we are moving, advancing, and we feel confident, and we are a paper tiger, then what is Nato itself?"" Putin said.Trump, who had previously suggested that Kyiv should cede territory to achieve peace with Moscow, changed his stance sharply last week. He expressed confidence that Ukraine could reclaim all its territory from Russia and referred to Moscow as a ""paper tiger,"" a statement he reiterated this week.Russia's war in Ukraine, Europe's deadliest conflict since World War Two, has escalated into the most significant confrontation between Russia and the West since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.Russian officials have declared that they are now engaged in a ""hot"" conflict with the West.At the forum, Putin also addressed the reports over US supplying Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine. He said, ""It is impossible to use Tomahawks without the direct participation of American military personnel.""""This will mean a completely new, qualitatively new stage of escalation, including in relations between Russia and the United States.""However, Reuters reported that the Trump administration’s plan to send Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine may be unfeasible because current inventories are committed to the US navy and other uses.In a stern message to Nato, Putin asserted that member countries were supplying Ukraine with intelligence, weapons, and training, and were stirring up hysteria about alleged Russian plans to attack a Nato member—claims he dismissed as ""impossible to believe."" He added, ""If anyone still has a desire to compete with us in the military sphere, as we say, feel free, let them try. Russia's countermeasures will not be long in coming.

Russian president Vladimir Putin said that the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk was a ""disgusting crime"" that reveals a ""deep rift"" in American society.Speaking at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi, a forum of Russian experts, Putin also offered his condolences to Kirk's family, nearly three weeks after the killing.""This is a disgusting atrocity, especially since it was broadcast live. We all saw it. It was truly horrific,"" Putin said. ""First and foremost, I extend my condolences to Mr Kirk’s family and all his loved ones. We sympathize and empathize.""He said the killing reflected deep divisions in US society but noted Washington’s leadership was focused on restoring domestic order without external escalation.“This is a sign of what happens, a deep rift in society. There is no need to escalate the situation from our side because the political leadership tries to set it straight in domestic policy. I think the US is going this way.”Kirk was fatally shot in September while delivering a speech at Utah Valley University.His accused killer, Tyler Robinson, has been charged with seven offenses, including aggravated homicide, punishable by the death penalty, along with felony discharge of a firearm, obstruction of justice, and witness tampering.Robinson appeared in court on Monday and is set to return on October 30, with prosecutors noting they have already compiled “voluminous” evidence against him, as reported by Fox News.Elsewhere in his remarks on Thursday, the Russian leader appeared to push back at Trump’s characterization of Russia as a “paper tiger” that had been “fighting aimlessly” in Ukraine for the past three years.""A paper tiger?

US government shutdown: Education dept employees' out-of-office emails altered to blame Democrats; claim 'none of us contested',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-government-shutdown-education-dept-employees-out-of-office-emails-altered-to-blame-democrats-claim-none-of-us-contested/articleshow/124280514.cms,"



While the US government has already been shut down, some of the employees of the education department discovered their email accounts had been manipulated during their furlough this week.Five employees of the education department discovered that while they were out of the office, they had included partisan talking points that blamed the government shutdown on Democrats.The employees, who spoke with NBC News and provided copies of their out-of-office messages, reported that the wording had been altered from their original compositions. All are civil servants, not political appointees, and requested anonymity out of fear of professional repercussions.Initially, Education officials sent employees templates of nonpartisan out-of-office messages to use in their emails. Several employees stated they used this language earlier in the week, only to find that while they were furloughed, someone had changed it.“We’re looking to hear from federal government workers. If you’re willing to talk with us, please email us at tips@nbcuni.com or contact us through one of these methods,” one employee said.And now the altered email messages included statements such as: “Thank you for contacting me. On September 10-2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations. Due to the lapse of appropriations, I am currently in furlough status. I will respond to emails once government functions resume.”One individual reported changing the out-of-office message back to the nonpartisan version, only to have it revert to the partisan wording later.“None of us consented to this. And it’s written in the first person, as if I’m the one conveying this message, and I’m not. I don’t agree with it. I don’t think it’s ethical or legal. I think it violates the Hatch Act,” the employee stated, referring to the law that limits federal employees’ political activity.Another employee explained, “I took the statement that they sent us earlier in the week to use. And I pasted it on top of that — basically has a standard out-of-office. They went in and manipulated my out-of-office reply. I guess they’re now making us all guilty of violating the Hatch Act.”On Wednesday, NBC News reported that some employees at federal agencies were being offered partisan language blaming Democrats for the shutdown to use as their out-of-office messages. Additionally, several federal websites now display language targeting Democrats or the “radical left.” The Education Department’s actions have been criticised for involving individual civil servants in political messaging regardless of their personal views.Madi Biedermann, the deputy assistant secretary for communications, responded: “The email reminds those who reach out to Department of Education employees that we cannot respond because Senate Democrats are refusing to vote for a clean CR and fund the government. Where’s the lie?”One employee expressed frustration over the lack of accountability, stating, “Nobody follows the law anymore, so why does it matter? It seems like laws are dotted lines now, not solid lines. It seems there’s no one to hold this administration accountable to laws.” Regarding potential repercussions, the employee added, “Clearly, this wasn’t done by me; it was done while I was in a furlough status. I think I’d be able to argue that point. ”","Five employees of the education department discovered that while they were out of the office, they had included partisan talking points that blamed the government shutdown on Democrats.

Maria Niotis and Isabella Salas, two teen girls, were killed in a hit-and-run incident in New Jersey after they complained of relentless stalking by the accused killer, now identified as 17-year-old Vincent Battiloro. The two teen girls were riding an electric bike when the unnamed 17-year-old allegedly struck and killed them both on Monday at around 5:26 p.m., according to the Union County Prosecutor's office.Vincent was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. One neighbor confirmed that Vincent parked outside one of the girls' homes for months and was not stopped by school administrators or police. ""I had only seen one girl. And then I walked down the street a little bit and I saw the other girl. Just horrible. Nothing in the world is more horrible than what I saw yesterday. I have kids, you know, and so no family should have to go through this,"" a neighbor said.Vincent was hit with numerous municipal summonses connected to the deadly crash that took place Monday evening. At least 15 tickets were issued to Battiloro, of Garwood, municipal court records indicated.The citations include leaving the scene of an accident, reckless driving and speeding, as well as driving without a license, registration or insurance card.Battiloro hosted a chilling livestream on YouTube the day after he allegedly killed two teens.

I’m a nice kid. I’m 17 years old with a good family by my side. And these allegations that have been ruining everything, is a shame,” he added during the livestream before playing an online video game with another person.Westfield Police Chief Christopher Battiloro, who is a Cranford resident, made a statement on Facebook clarifying that he is not the uncle of the accused. ""While social media has made it known that the accused is related to me, he is not my son and not a member of my immediate family.

What are the predictions for Diddy's sentence?



If Diddy walks free







Sean Diddy Combs will get his sentencing Friday after a jury convicted the music mogul of two counts for transportation to engage in prostitution, while he was cleared of the serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. The prosecutors are seeking a sentence of 11 years but Combs' team insists that a 14-month sentence is more adequate. If he is given 14 14-month sentence, he will walk free soon, as he already served a year in prison.Ronald Chapman II, a defense attorney, told Newsweek that he believes that judge Arun Subramanian will ""score this case much lower"" than federal prosecutors. He said Subtamanian can sentence Diddy to up to 6 years 8 months in prison, or he may get as little as 70 months.Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Reality Tea that Diddy is going to get close to five years in prison. ""That is within the four to five year range the prosecution originally mentioned after the verdict, and the five to seven year range recommendation by US Probation. The government’s new, 11 year recommendation seems like sour grapes and piling on, especially because it is more than the 10 year statutory maximum on one of the prostitution counts.Diddy's ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, who testified against him for four days, said she is scared that if Combs walks free, his first action will be seeking revenge on her and all those who spoke up about his abuse at trial.The trial saw Combs' lawyers acknowledging that Combs had assaulted women but they argued that those actions did not constitute trafficking charges. Though Combs did not testify at his trial, his defense team indicated in recent court papers that he intends to ""allocute,"" or speak to the judge, before his sentence is handed down. Combs' lawyers asked that their client be allowed to wear ""non-prison clothing"" at the sentencing.

Candace says Tyler's father did not know he was gay







After dropping the bombshell that Tyler Robinson was framed as the Charlie Kirk shooter, Candace Owens claimed that the FBI did not release door cam footage that came to her from a source who claimed that the killer was seen with a woman who was probably helping the killer. Candace said she did not initially have any evidence to support her claim, but now she has, as an Instagram user @Shanerinthehouse shared a video where eyewitnesses inadvertently revealed that there was a woman.""What the heck is going in? Who was the woman who was with the shooter, and why wouldn't the FBI release that footage?"" Candace said. ""Yet they chose during their 33-hour manhunt that they were also looking for a woman who could have been the accomplice. What happened to this lady?"" Candace said.Owens has so far put forward several conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk's assassination. And the latest is her obsession to prove that Tyler Robinson was not the killer. Candace claimed Tyler was not a gun enthusiast but a fisherman. He had the gun because he inherited it as an heirloom.Candace said all the messages that the Feds claimed he sent to his boyfriend, Lance Twiggs, were fictional.The family friend informed Robinson's family that Tyler was identified as the shooter. ""He gave them a heads-up. The family friend told the family that turning himsef in would be the best option, as otherwise, his house would have been swatted and things would turn ugly,"" Candace said, adding that her source told her that he did not even set foot on the Utah Valley University campus. ""Even current actual UVU students are not that familiar with the campus and the rooftop,"" she said.Candace connected the dots with the Dairy Queen photo and exclaimed that a cold-blooded killer would not stop to have an ice cream after a murder. She insinuated that Tyler was at Dairy Queen, from where he was 'framed' for the murder.Candace said Tyler's father revealed to sources that he did not know that his son was gay, and they thought Lance Twiggs was just his roommate. Tyler even told his family that he would make them meet a girl who was probably Lance.Candace added that there was something very weird about the law enforcement's story of how Tyler was nabbed, as they got too much into the details of who helped them find Tyler and why the person's identity was kept a secret if he was a public figure.","Candace Owens says there was a woman with the killer of Charlie Kirk.

US President Donald Trump has launched an unprecedented move targeting top American universities, offering them federal funding in return for promoting conservative ideas on their campuses.The initiative, conveyed through a 10-point “compact,” was sent out from the White House on Wednesday, called “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education” was reported by Wall Street Journal.Under the deal, universities that sign on are promised “multiple positive benefits,” including “substantial and meaningful federal grants.” In exchange, they must ensure a “vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus,” elevate the profile of conservative viewpoints, and eliminate academic departments that “purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas.”Other key stipulations of the compact include banning race or sex as factors in student admissions and hiring, freezing tuition fees for five years, and capping international undergraduate students at 15%. This includes promoting a wide range of views and “transforming or abolishing institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas,"" according to the compact.Each university would also have to commission an annual poll of students and faculty to evaluate adherence to the pact.Although only nine universities have been formally approached with the compact, the memorandum carries an implicit warning to all federally funded institutions. It states that while “institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those” in the memo, this comes at the cost of losing all federal funding streams.The terms would be enforced by the Justice Department, with violators losing access to the compact’s benefits for no less than a year. Repeated violations would trigger a two-year penalty.The nine universities named in the initiative are Vanderbilt University, Dartmouth College, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Arizona, Brown University, and the University of Virginia.The Trump administration has leveraged its control over federal funding at several other universities, including Harvard and Columbia, by withholding research grants while pushing for changes to their governance and policies.","The initiative, conveyed through a 10-point ‘compact,’ was sent out from the White House on Wednesday.

Pak Parliamentarian Mocks Army Chief Munir As ‘Salesman’, PM Sharif As ‘Manager’ Over Trump Meeting





The Commonwealth Observer Group (COG) has officially released its report on Pakistan’s 2024 general elections, noting “conditions that appeared to impact one party’s ability to fairly contest the election” — namely the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), led by incarcerated former Prime Minister Imran Khan The report, which included a ""Letter of Transmittal"" by COG chairperson and former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, cited the denial to PTI of its election symbol, Khan’s consecutive convictions ahead of polling, and restrictions on freedom of association and assembly.Jonathan wrote: “When looked at in isolation, some – though not all – of the arguments advanced by key institutions in support of their actions appear somewhat justifiable. Yet, collectively, it could not go unnoticed that these decisions consistently limited one party's ability to contest the election on a level playing field.”The observers expressed particular concern over the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s revocation of PTI’s iconic “bat” symbol — linked to Khan’s cricketing past — on grounds that the party failed to hold intra-party elections. With the decision coming just weeks before polling, PTI candidates were forced to run as independents, depriving them of a unifying symbol.The group also flagged Khan’s multiple convictions shortly before polling day, along with restrictions on PTI’s rallies and gatherings. “There were also limitations on fundamental political rights, including freedom of association and assembly. These limitations were felt most acutely by PTI and its supporters,” the report said.The COG called for reforms to strengthen transparency and ensure a level playing field for all parties in future Pakistani elections.The report found that mainstream English-language media “broadly followed the principles of fair and accurate election reporting,” though PTI-affiliated independent candidates received ""less positive"" coverage.By contrast, state-owned PTV News lacked balance, focusing mainly on the ruling PML-N and PPP, and reportedly barred references to Khan by name. The group concluded that these factors may have “impinged on the credibility, transparency and inclusiveness of the electoral process.”The report had been controversial after media reports suggested the Commonwealth had “buried” it following widespread problems in the February 8 polls. Submitted to the Commonwealth secretary-general on November 20, 2024, the publication was delayed without explanation.The PTI had repeatedly demanded its release, arguing it confirmed “systemic rigging, institutional bias, and deliberate targeting” of the party and its founder.","Commonwealth Observer Group releases report on Pakistan's 2024 general elections.

Israel-Hamas peace plan: Pakistan sending troops to Gaza?

Trump's 20-point peace plan







Pakistan’s top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations’ peacekeeping force under a comprehensive peace deal announced by US President Donald Trump.The decision was announced by Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday.At a press conference in Islamabad, Dar was asked directly about Pakistan’s role in the initiative, which aims to end the bloodshed in Gaza. “The force [here] is a peacekeeping force. On the ground, there will be Palestinian law-enforcement agencies... there will be [separate] forces supporting them. Indonesia has offered 20,000 troops for that. I am sure Pakistan's leadership will also be making a decision on this,” he said.Dar explained that the idea was to set up an independent Palestinian government of technocrats overseen by an international body. He said Pakistan had asked for the arrangements to be documented at the UN Security Council.He shared that a preparatory meeting of leaders from eight Muslim countries with US President Trump was held in New York last week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. “The objectives were to try for a ceasefire in Gaza, make arrangements for sending humanitarian aid, stop the forced displacement of Palestinians and make arrangements for the return of the displaced Gazans,” he said.Dar added that the plan also included Gaza’s reconstruction and halting Israel’s efforts to annex the West Bank. According to him, Trump proposed that his team work with the foreign ministers of the Muslim nations to create a “workable solution.”The foreign minister said Saudi Arabia had reached out to Pakistan with a draft joint statement on the plan, which was later revised after his input. He noted that the Palestinian Authority welcomed the statement.On Monday, Donald Trump unveiled a 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the Gaza war by demanding Hamas’s disarmament, the immediate release of all hostages within 72 hours, and a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces. Under the proposal, Hamas would be excluded from any future governance; militants willing to abandon arms would receive amnesty, while those wishing to leave Gaza would be allowed safe passage. The plan also involves a temporary technocratic Palestinian committee ruling Gaza under oversight by an international “Board of Peace” led by Trump and including Tony Blair, until the Palestinian Authority is reformed.The initiative calls for humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza without interference from either Israel or Hamas, managed by UN agencies and the Red Crescent, with reconstruction under a “New Gaza” framework. Trump gave Hamas three to four days to accept the plan or face what he called “a very sad end.”","Pakistan's top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations' peacekeeping force.

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





At least nine people, including four militants, were killed in two separate bomb-related incidents on Tuesday in South Waziristan district of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, reported news agency PTI.The first explosion occurred in Ashangi Lagad village, where five villagers were killed instantly after coming into contact with a bomb-like object lying on the road.The powerful blast sparked panic in the area, with residents demanding that authorities step up efforts to clear unexploded devices and protect civilians. Security forces and local administration officials later reached the site and launched an investigation.Hours later, in the Wacha Khawora area of Wana, four militants were killed when an improvised explosive device (IED) they were attempting to plant went off prematurely. Among those killed were a local militant commander, Yar Muhammad Muslim, Zameed Alam of the Ashangi tribe, and two unidentified associates.Earlier, at least ten people were killed and several others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside the paramilitary headquarters in Quetta on Tuesday.The blast was reportedly heard miles away, and ambulances quickly arrived to transport the wounded to nearby hospitals.“The blast occurred as an explosive-laden vehicle took a turn from Model Town towards Hali Road, near the Frontier Constabulary (FC) headquarters,” said Muhammad Baloch, SSP special operations Quetta.This follows heightened tensions in the region. On September 3, a suicide bombing at a political rally in Quetta killed 11 leaving over 40 injured.

Amid Trump-Sharif Meeting, Political Expert Explains Why US is Eyeing Pakistan As Military Launchpad





: In an effort to worm its way back into Washington’s good books, Pakistan ’s hybrid military-civilian leadership flashed glimpses of its purported rare earths bearing mineral wealth during a meeting with US President Donald Trump last week, going by a photo released by the White House.Among a dozen photos featured in the White House picture gallery relating to the Shahbaz Sharif- Asim Munir meeting with Trump is one where the duo is showing Trump an open 18x18 inch wooden box with colorful stones presumably bearing some mineral deposits. Two of the larger rocks appear to be bastanzite and monazite clumps that typically bear rare earths elements (REE) such as cerium, lanthanum, and neodymium. Some of the smaller candy-colored pebbles look like gemstones.Pakistan has long spoken of its vast untapped oil, gas, and mineral ores, some bearing rare earths, mostly in the troubled Balochistan region wracked with insurgency, and also in Khyber-Pakhtoonwa. While none of the mineral deposits are commercially proven or quantified, Pakistan’s leadership showcased the baubles to the US President to highlight collaboration and exploration bids it has signed with a private US firm earlier this month.The charm offensive also included PM Sharif wearing a lapel pin the had both the US and Pakistani flags, a gesture some Pakistani trolls on social media termed as “embarrassing.”While there is no direct government-to-government agreement to explore or exploit the mineral wealth, Pakistan's Frontier Works Organization (FWO)—a military-linked engineering and mining entity—signed an MoU on September 8 with the Missouri-based US Strategic Metals (USSM), a private US firm specializing in critical minerals.The agreement, with an initial funding of $ 500 million from USSM, envisages three phases: Phase 1 (Immediate, 2025–2026) involving export of readily available minerals (e.g., antimony and copper concentrates) to US markets, generating quick revenue. Phase 2 (Medium-term, 2026–2028) involving construction of processing plants and refineries in Pakistan, with technology transfer for REE separation and purification. Phase 3 (Long-term, 2028+), involving large-scale exploration and exploitation, including drilling in high-potential REE belts; and developing 5–10 mining projects.Islamabad's rare earths gambit with the US — which could cause Pakistan's patron China to burst a blood vessel since it has a stranglehold on rare earths supply to the US — comes on the heels of the its crypto caper, where it used a British-Pakistani entrepreneur to position itself as crypto capital where American businesses with ties to the Trump family could make a fortune.","Pakistan has long spoken of its vast untapped oil, gas, and mineral ores, some bearing rare earths.

NEW YORK: Despite being among one of the world's worst performers when it comes to democracy, and registering a high number of human rights violation cases, Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif defended the country's 'hybrid model' of governance where the army and civilian leadership work hand in glove in running the country.He made the remarks in an interview to British-American journalist Mehdi Hasan while defending Pakistan. Asif called the US democracy a ""deep state"" and tried to brush away the charges of military might in Pak governance.When asked by Hasan, ""It's a strange system you have in Pakistan. I think you've called it a hybrid model - where the military and civilian leaders effectively share power. But the military leaders are really the ones in charge, are they not? In most countries, the head of the army answers to the defence minister. In your country you, the defence minister, answer to the head of the army, don't you?

That's what the accusation is"", Asif put the blame on past leadership, stating, ""You can say that because of our military rulers - it is more visible...""On being further probed as to where the power lies in Pakistan, the defence minister explained it as ""hybrid"".Earlier this year, Asif had told Arab News about the 'hybrid regime' that currently runs the country, Dawn reported.

Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi has been granted a temporary travel exemption to visit India next week. This marks the first high-level visit by a Taliban leader to New Delhi since the group took power in Afghanistan in 2021.According to officials, the UN Security Council sanctions committee has authorised Muttaqi to travel to New Delhi between October 9 and 16.The visit is expected to revive earlier plans that were delayed after sanctions restrictions prevented him from travelling, according to news agency Afghanistan International.Before arriving in India, Muttaqi will attend the seventh round of the “Moscow Format” talks in Russia on October 6 at the invitation of Russian officials. This will be the first time the Taliban participates as a member, rather than a guest in the multilateral forum.Describing the development as an “important step,” Muttaqi said he hoped such platforms would help strengthen trust and improve ties with neighbouring countries.The planned trip to India comes after months of speculation. In August, reports suggested that New Delhi was considering inviting Muttaqi, but government sources had clarified that India would approach the UN for a waiver only once the visit was finalised.Afghan media had then reported that the absence of approval had delayed the plan.India’s engagement with the Taliban has steadily increased in recent years, largely built around humanitarian assistance and developmental aid.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has twice spoken with Muttaqi, including last week when he conveyed condolences over the recent earthquake in Afghanistan and announced India’s relief assistance.Earlier this year, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri also met Muttaqi in Dubai to discuss Afghanistan’s urgent developmental needs.India has consistently maintained that while it is aligned with the international community on the question of formal recognition of the Taliban regime, it will continue to provide humanitarian aid and support to the Afghan people.New Delhi has delivered large quantities of food, medicines and relief material and has over 500 development projects running across Afghanistan.Taliban officials have also called for stronger ties with India. Suhail Shaheen, head of the Taliban’s political office in Qatar, recently said high-level visits such as Muttaqi’s were essential to explore cooperation in trade and other areas, adding that the Taliban valued India’s assistance and historical friendship with the Afghan people.If the visit goes ahead, it will mark a landmark moment in India-Afghanistan relations, signalling New Delhi’s intention to cautiously deepen engagement with the Taliban regime while balancing global concerns about recognition and sanctions.",Amir Khan Muttaqi has been granted a temporary travel exemption to visit India next week.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban’s first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that “eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place “until further notice.”Just last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan’s fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide “to prevent immoral activities.” They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

At least one student was killed, dozens were injured, and 65 were feared buried in the debris after Al Khoziny Islamic boarding school building collapsed in Indonesia.Rescue workers, police, and soldiers, who had been digging through the night, pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java. Additional bodies were spotted, suggesting the death toll could rise, AP reported.Families of the students gathered at hospitals and near the collapsed building, anxiously awaiting news of their children. Relatives wailed as they watched rescuers pull a dusty, injured student from the buried prayer hall.A notice board at the command post established in the boarding school complex listed 65 students as missing as of Tuesday morning. They were mostly boys in Class 7 to Class 11, aged between twelve and seventeen.“Oh my God... my son is still buried, oh my God please help!” a mother cried hysterically upon seeing her child's name on the board, followed by the cries of other parents facing similar losses.“Please, sir, please find my child immediately,” pleaded a father, holding the hand of one of the rescue team members. Heavy slabs of concrete, rubble, and unstable parts of the building hampered search and rescue efforts, said Nanang Sigit, a search and rescue officer leading the operation.Heavy equipment was available but not being used due to concerns it could cause further collapse. “We have been running oxygen and water to those still trapped under the debris and keeping them alive while we work hard to get them out,” Sigit said.He added that rescuers had seen several bodies under the rubble but were focused on saving those still alive. Several hundred rescuers participated in the effort, equipped with breathing apparatus, extrication tools, medical evacuation equipment, and other support devices.The students had been performing afternoon prayers in a building undergoing an unauthorised expansion when it suddenly collapsed on top of them, provincial police spokesperson Jules Abraham Abast said. Residents, teachers, and administrators assisted injured students, many with head injuries and broken bones.Female students were praying in another part of the building and managed to escape, survivors said. One male student, a thirteen-year-old boy, was killed, and ninety-nine other students were injured and taken to hospitals, some in critical condition, officials said. Authorities were investigating the cause of the collapse. Abast said the old prayer hall was two stories, but two additional floors were being added without a permit.“The old building's foundation was apparently unable to support two floors of concrete and collapsed during the pouring process,” Abast said.","Rescue workers, police, and soldiers pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java.

Since vacating the Prime Minister’s official residence in Baluwatar, Oli has relocated to a rented house in Gundu, following an arson attack on his private residence in Balkot by protestors.The CPN-UML chief alleged that the current administration lacked democratic legitimacy and was formed through “vandalism and arson”, not the people’s mandate.Challenging the government to disclose any communication he had with state authorities during the protests, Oli said, “Publish them with courage.Make public the instructions I gave.” He denied any wrongdoing and questioned the basis of efforts to link him to the violent unrest.He also raised concerns over reported threats to his safety and criticised the government for inaction. “On social media, there are open calls to attack my residence. What is the government doing? Just watching?” he asked.The former PM expressed strong objection to reports that the government was planning to withhold passports of several political leaders, including himself, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Arzu Rana Deuba, Ramesh Lekhak, and Deepak Khadka.Oli accused the ruling dispensation of creating a climate of insecurity and targeting opposition leaders. “This government is throwing the country into insecurity,” he alleged.Meanwhile, a recent monitoring report by Nepal’s national human rights commission (NHRC) blamed the previous government, led by Oli and then-home minister Ramesh Lekhak, for failing to anticipate the scale of the Gen Z protests. The NHRC said that while the initial demonstrations on September 8 were peaceful, the use of excessive force by security personnel on September 9 led to dozens of deaths and widespread violence.Rights groups have held Oli and Lekhak accountable for the crackdown, which played a key role in the fall of their administration. The NHRC report highlighted poor coordination, declining morale among security forces, and inadequate preparation as contributing factors to the high casualties.","KP Sharma Oli accuses Sushila Karki-led government of attempting to strip him of his security and official entitlements.

India Dragged Into Bangladesh Politics: Muhammad Yunus Accuses New Delhi of Spreading Propaganda





DHAKA: Bangladesh's student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) threatens to halt elections after the Election Commission (EC) refused to allocate the symbol it demanded ahead of the February polls.NCP, a large offshoot of Students against Discrimination (SAD), which led last year's street campaign dubbed as the July Uprising, toppling then prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League and installing professor Muhammad Yunus as the chief adviser.""The commission could not show any legal logic for not allocating the 'shapla' (water lily) as our symbol and therefore we are sticking to our demand,"" NCP's convenor Nahid Islam was quoted as saying on Wednesday by newspapers a day after the EC revealed its decision on the issue.Islam said NCP would give its ""final reaction"" once the EC takes its ""formal decision"".However, the party's chief coordinator for northern Bangladesh, Sarjis Alam, threatened to halt the polls unless their demand was met.""Since there is no legal barrier, the NCP must get the 'shapla' as its symbol; there is no other option. Unless we get it, we will see how the election is held and how someone could dream of attaining power,"" Alam posted on social media.EC's senior secretary, Akhter Ahmed, on Tuesday told a media briefing that NCP would not be allotted the symbol they demanded as it is ""not included in the list of electoral symbols as per the regulations"".""The 'shapla' is not on our list of 115 electoral symbols. According to the rules, political parties must choose a symbol from the approved list,"" he said.The ""shapla"" is the national emblem of Bangladesh.NCP chief coordinator Nasiruddin Patwary led the party delegation to the EC to get its registration earlier and said the party must be registered with the ""shapla"" symbol.Asked how they would secure the symbol since it was not included in the EC's revised list, he said amendments could be made at any time.Patwary also said the party expected to win around 150 constituencies out of 300, with nominations including former army officers, as well as women, farmers, and workers involved in the July uprising.Several political analysts, however, speculate a bleak fate for NCP in elections, particularly after their nominees witnessed a landslide defeat in students' union elections in two major public universities - the premier Dhaka University and suburban Jahangirnagar University.Bangladesh's largest Islamist Party, Jamaat-e-Islami-backed Islami Chhaita Shibir, won in most of the posts in both elections. Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, the student wing of former prime minister Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party, also witnessed an astounding defeat, though it emerged as the second biggest student group in the central students union polls in the two universities.",Bangladesh's student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) threatens to halt elections.

Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Saar condemned the deadly terrorist attack that targeted a Manchester synagogue on Thursday, criticising UK authorities for what he described as their “failure to address this toxic wave of antisemitism.”“I am appalled by the murderous attack near Heaton Park Synagogue on the morning of Yom Kippur, the holiest day for the Jewish people. My deepest condolences go to the families who have lost loved ones, and I wish a swift recovery to the injured,” Saar said on X.He called for the “truth” to be told, adding: “Blatant and rampant antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement, as well as support for terror, have recently become widespread in London, other UK cities, and on campuses.”Saar further said Israel expects “more than words” from the Keir Starmer-led government, demanding “effective action and enforcement against antisemitic and anti-Israeli sentiment in Britain.”The attack, carried out with a car and a knife, left two people dead and four injured. Police neutralised the suspect and arrested two others.The incident comes ahead of the second anniversary of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel, after which Israel - a Jewish state - launched a military offensive in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. Tensions between Israel and the UK have also grown following Britain’s recent recognition of a Palestinian state, along with several other Western nations.","Gideon Saar criticises UK authorities for what he described as their “failure to address this toxic wave of antisemitism’ The attack, carried out with a car and a knife, left two people dead and four injured.

UK horror: British Pakistani jailed 35 years for assaulting minor girls; victims had 'deeply troubled home lives',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-horror-british-pakistani-jailed-35-years-for-assaulting-minor-girls-victims-had-deeply-troubled-home-lives/articleshow/124271448.cms,"



A 65-year-old British Pakistani man, known as Boss Man, a grooming gang ringleader, was sentenced to 35 years in prison for raping two schoolgirls in Rochdale.Mohammed Zahid, father of three children, who showed a ""chilling disregard"" for the girls, was one of seven men convicted in June of committing a range of sexual offences between 2001 and 2006. He gave the girls free underwear from his market stall, expecting regular sex for him and his friends in return, BBC reported.Mushtaq Ahmed, 67, Kasir Bashir, 50, Mohammed Shahzad, 44, Naheem Akram, 49, Nisar Hussain, 41, and Roheez Khan, 39, also received lengthy prison sentences at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court.The court heard how the girls were sexually exploited from the age of 13 in filthy flats, car parks, alleyways, and disused warehouses in the Greater Manchester town.Referred to as Girl A and Girl B, they were treated as ""sex slaves"" and expected to ""have sex with the men whenever and wherever they wanted."" Both girls, who were not acquainted with each other, had ""deeply troubled home lives"" and were provided with drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, and places to stay by the men, the court was told.During the sentencing, Judge Jonathan Seely described the treatment of the girls by the ""predatory"" men as ""appalling.""He said, ""They were abused, degraded and then discarded. It would have been obvious to these men that they craved the attention that their home lives didn't provide. They felt they had little or no choice but to submit to the almost incessant sexual abuse meted out to them.""All the paedophiles worked either at the market or as taxi drivers, the court heard.Girl A informed the jury that she may have been preyed on by hundreds of men as her phone number was circulated, adding, ""there was that many it was hard to keep count."" She told local children's services in 2004 that she was ""hanging around"" with groups of older men, drinking and smoking cannabis, the court was told.Girl B, who was residing in a children's home when she encountered the men at the market, claimed that police and social workers were aware of the situation but ""weren't concerned enough to do anything about it.""She said, ""It was in my file, when I looked it up. I read it. I was picked up by the police for loitering and prostituting from the age of 10."" Social services and police have previously apologised for their past failings regarding the girls.The convictions and sentences in full were as follows: - Pakistan-born Mohammed Zahid of Station Road, Crumpsall, was convicted of raping Girl A and Girl B, indecency with a child, and procuring a child to have sex and was jailed for 35 years.Mushtaq Ahmed, 67, of Corona Avenue, Oldham, and Kasir Bashir, 50, of Napier Street East, Oldham, both born in Pakistan, were convicted of repeated counts of rape and indecency with a child in relation to Girl B and were jailed for 27 and 29 years respectively.Mohammed Shahzad, 44, of Beswicke Royds Street, Rochdale; Naheem Akram, 49, of Manley Road, Rochdale; and Nisar Hussain, 41, of New Field Close, Rochdale, were convicted of repeated counts of rape against Girl A and were jailed for 26, 26, and 19 years respectively.Pakistan-born Roheez Khan, 39, of Athole Street, Rochdale, was found guilty of a single count of rape against Girl A and jailed for 12 years. In 2016, Zahid was jailed for five years after being convicted of engaging in sexual activity in 2005 and 2006 with a 14-year-old girl whom he met when she visited his stall to buy tights for school. Bashir was sentenced in his absence after he absconded while on bail before the trial commenced.Detective Chief Inspector Guy Laycock from Greater Manchester Police stated that the men ""preyed on the girls' vulnerability for their own depraved sexual gain."" He added, ""This horrific abuse knew no limits, despite their denials throughout this lengthy investigation and court case.They had a callous disregard for these women when they were girls and continue to show no remorse for their unforgivable actions all these years later.""Liz Fell, specialist prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, commended the men for exploiting the teenagers' ""difficult circumstances"" and praised the victims for coming forward. She said, ""Both victims have shown an enormous amount of strength and dignity throughout what has been a lengthy and challenging legal process.""","Mohammed Zahid, 65, jailed for 35 years for raping two schoolgirls in Rochdale.

How Indian nationals are snapping up British buy-to-lets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/how-indian-nationals-are-snapping-up-british-buy-to-lets/articleshow/124261789.cms,"TOI Correspondent from London:





Indian nationals are the largest non-UK shareholders of buy-to-let companies in Britain this year, according to analysis by estate agency Hamptons.Analysis of data by Hamptons shows that Indian investors are followed by Nigerians, Poles and Irish. Indians have made up the largest group since 2023; in 2022, they were the second-largest.In the first half of this year, Indian nationals founded 684 new buy-to-let companies, with more registered in Hillingdon than in any other area. Nigerian investors follow closely with 647 new incorporations. This shift reflects wider post-Brexit migration patterns.Buy-to-let companies are special-purpose companies set up to buy and manage residential rental properties.EU nationals now account for 49% of non-UK shareholders, down from 65% in 2016. There has been a general fall in shareholders from the Anglosphere, too. In 2016, Irish, Americans, South Africans and Australians all featured in the top 10. By 2025, only Irish nationals remained, ranking fourth. Instead, Indian and Nigerian investors are stepping into the spotlight, despite rents falling this year for the first time in five years.There were approximately 127,000 more Nigerian nationals and 178,000 more Indian nationals immigrating to the UK in 2023 compared with 2019, according to the Office of National Statistics.Twenty per cent of buy-to-let companies set up in the UK so far this year are owned by non-UK national shareholders, up from 13% in 2016. The remaining 80% are owned by UK shareholders. Seven per cent of Indian nationals who own UK buy-to-let companies set up over the past decade live in India.At current rates, around 67,000 new companies will be set up by the end of 2025, with around 13,500 owned, at least in part, by non-UK nationals. Companies are a more tax-efficient way of managing rental properties in Britain.Whilst London has always been an attractive investment choice for foreign landlords, between 2016 and 2025 the share of new non-UK national landlords has more than doubled in the East Midlands, West Midlands and Scotland.Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons, said: “While overseas-based investors are part of the picture, the majority of purchases by non-UK nationals reflect domestic demand. Up until 2021, this demand was most likely to come from EU nationals based in the UK, but since then it has shifted to reflect changes in broader migration patterns. Indian and Nigerian nationals are increasingly likely to buy UK buy-to-let property in a limited company structure. ”","Analysis of data by Hamptons shows that Indian investors are followed by Nigerians, Poles and Irish.

Shehbaz Sharif Left Red-Faced as UN Probes Political Sloganeering During Pakistan PM's UNGA Speech

Why is PoK witnessing protests?





Ongoing protests in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) have raised “serious concern” among a UK parliamentary group, which has written to the British government over the unrest in the region.Imran Hussain, chair of the Kashmir All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), shared a letter on social media on Tuesday highlighting the issue to Hamish Falconer, the UK minister responsible for Pakistan at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO).Hussain, a member of the ruling Labour Party, wrote, ""Reports from the ground indicate a complete communications blackout, with mobile, internet, and landline services suspended across the region.”The Bradford East MP added, ""These actions have caused deep anxiety among many of our constituents, who are unable to contact loved ones. The atmosphere has been further strained by reports of heavy deployment of police and paramilitary forces, raising serious concerns about the safety and well-being of residents.""In its statement, the Kashmir APPG condemned both the communications shutdown and the use of force, calling them a “significant” human rights issue.It urged the UK government to engage diplomatically with Islamabad and press for a “peaceful and negotiated settlement” in the region.“We respectfully request that the FCDO urgently raise this matter with the Pakistani government and push for the immediate restoration of communications, de-escalation of tensions, and meaningful dialogue with stakeholders. We urge the government to act with urgency and moral clarity to prevent further deterioration of the situation,” the letter read.The FCDO has not yet issued a response. However, Falconer has previously reaffirmed the UK’s commitment to working with international partners to promote “longer-term stability” in the region.The protests initially began with demands for a regular and subsidised supply of flour and electricity in PoK.Over time, the movement has grown to encompass a wider array of issues, including reducing the privileges of the Kashmiri elite, abolishing reserved assembly seats, and securing access to free education and healthcare. Activists say the renewed demonstrations stem from the government’s failure to fully implement earlier agreements with protesters, fuelling widespread frustration across local communities.The protesters have now submitted a 38-point charter of demands, calling for measures such as ending the 12 reserved seats for refugees, rolling back elite privileges, completing pending road construction projects, providing tax relief, maintaining subsidies on flour and electricity, and reforming the judiciary.",Kashmir All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) writes to UK government over protests.

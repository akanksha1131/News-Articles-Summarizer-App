Sri Lanka election results: President Dissanayake's NPP headed for landslide victory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sri-lanka-election-results-president-dissanayakes-npp-party-headed-for-landslide-victory/articleshow/115319499.cms,"Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's party set for absolute majority

Sri Lanka's National People's Power (NPP) party, led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake , is set secure majority in the parliamentary snap elections. By Friday at 6 am (local time), the NPP had secured 52 seats, with about 62 per cent of the national vote, totaling over 4.4 million votes. The party currently holds 35 seats through district-based proportional representation.The opposition parties have suffered significant losses, with the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) receiving 18 per cent and the National Democratic Front (NDF), supported by former president Ranil Wickremesinghe, obtaining less than 5 per cent of votes. The SJB has secured 8 seats, whilst the NDP has obtained just one seat.The Sri Lanka People's Front (SLPP), associated with the Rajapaksa family, has managed to secure 2 seats despite ranking fourth in the vote count.Political observers indicate that the NPP has achieved a substantial improvement compared to the September presidential election . They anticipate the party will surpass 150 seats, securing an absolute majority in the 225-member assembly.As the island nation awaits the final results for the elections held on November 14, Dissanayake's NPP, founded in 2019, is vying to secure a majority to implement key anti-poverty reforms and tackle economic challenges following Sri Lanka’s severe financial crisis. This crisis led to the ousting of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022 and prompted a $2.9 billion IMF bailout.Dissanayake, who won the presidency in September, faces opposition from Sajith Premadasa's United People's Power and conservative factions. A win for the NPP would mark the first time a leftist coalition controls both the presidency and parliament, potentially shifting Sri Lanka’s policies toward a socialist approach and redefining its international relations, particularly with China and India.","Sri Lanka's National People's Power (NPP) party, led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, is set secure majority in the parliamentary snap elections.

North Korea's Kim Jong-un orders 'mass production' of suicide attack drones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-orders-mass-production-of-suicide-attack-drones/articleshow/115319358.cms,"A target explodes during a performance test of drones overseen by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. (Photo/Agencies)

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has instructed the ""mass production"" of suicide attack drones , according to state media reports on Friday, after he observed a test of the system the day before.Kim supervised tests of drones intended to hit both land and sea targets, which were developed by North Korea's Unmanned Aerial Technology Complex (UATC).""He underscored the need to build a serial production system as early as possible and go into full-scale mass production,"" said the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).""Suicide drones"" are drones equipped with explosives and designed to crash into enemy targets, functioning similarly to guided missiles.Also referred to as loitering munitions, these weapons have been widely used in the war in Ukraine and in the Middle East.North Korea displayed these suicide drones for the first time in August, with experts suggesting this capability may be due to North Korea’s increasing alliance with Russia. North Korea and Russia have recently ratified a comprehensive strategic partnership that their leaders signed in June, which includes a mutual defence pact.""The suicide attack drones to be used within different striking ranges are to perform a mission to precisely attack any enemy targets on the ground and in the sea,"" KCNA said.Kim described the drones as an ""easy to use... component of striking power,"" citing their relatively low cost and wide range of applications, as reported by KCNA.In 2022, North Korea sent drones across the border, and South Korea’s military was unable to shoot them down, citing their small size. South Korea has since established a drone operations command to address this growing threat.Earlier this year, North Korea accused South Korea of infringing on its sovereignty by flying drones over its territory to drop propaganda leaflets, an allegation denied by South Korea's military.In October, North Korea modified its constitution to designate South Korea as a ""hostile"" state, reflecting worsening relations since Kim declared Seoul his country's ""principal enemy"" in January.","North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has instructed the ""mass production"" of suicide attack drones.

"China's president unveils a megaport in Peru, but locals say they're being left out",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/chinas-president-unveils-a-megaport-in-peru-but-locals-say-theyre-being-left-out/articleshow/115319911.cms,"Chinese President Xi Jinping looks on during a ceremony to virtually inaugurate a Chinese-funded port in the city of Chancay, at the government palace in Lima, Peru, Thursday, Nov 14, 2024. (AP)

CHANCAY: On the edge of Peru's coastal desert, a remote fishing town where a third of all residents have no running water is being transformed into a huge deep-water port to cash in on the inexorable rise of Chinese interest in resource-rich South America.The megaport of Chancay, a $1.3 billion project majority-owned by the Chinese shipping giant Cosco, is turning this outpost of bobbing fishing boats into an important node of the global economy.From the presidential palace in Lima, 60 kilometers (37 miles) south of the port inauguration ceremony, China's President Xi Jinping watched a livestream of the ribbon-cutting alongside his Peruvian counterpart, Dina Boluarte, late Thursday.The leaders' faces appeared on a giant screen in Chancay, where engineers in bright orange safety vests declared the port operational to the swell of string instruments. Chinese dancers with red dragon-costume heads seemingly burst out of nowhere to prance around the docking station as a crane lowered the first aluminum containers onto a berthed cargo ship.""Considerable income and enormous job opportunities will be generated for Peru,"" Xi said from Lima, where world leaders were preparing to gather for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. ""This will generate tangible results for the people of the region.""But the development - expected to encompass 15 quays and a large industrial park drawing more than $3.5 billion in investment over a decade - has met a skeptical response from impoverished villagers, who say it is depriving them of fishing waters and bringing no economic benefit to locals.""Our fishing spots no longer exist here. They destroyed them,"" said 78-year-old fisherman Julius Caesar - ""like the emperor of Rome"" - gesturing toward the dockside cranes. ""I don't blame the Chinese for trying to mine this place for all it's worth. I blame our government for not protecting us.""The Peruvian government hopes the port will become a strategic transshipment hub for the region, opening a new line connecting South America to Asia and speeding trade across the Pacific for Peru's blueberries, Brazil's soybeans and Chile's copper, among other exports.Officials cite the port's potential to generate millions of dollars in revenues and turn coastal cities into so-called special economic zones with tax breaks to lure investment.""We Peruvians are focused primarily on the well-being of Peruvians,"" Foreign Minister Elmer Schialer told The Associated Press.But many of Chancay's 60,000 residents are unconvinced. Fishermen returning to port with smaller catches complain that they have already lost out.The dredging of the port - which sucked sediment from the seabed to create a shipping channel 17 meters (56 feet) deep - has ruined fish breeding grounds, locals said.""I've been out in the water all day and I'm always needing to venture farther,"" said Rafael Avila, a 28-year-old fisherman with sand in his hair, returning to shore empty-handed and exhausted.""This used to be enough,"" he said, pointing at his painted dinghy. ""Now I need a larger, more expensive boat to reach the fish.""To make extra cash, Avila started offering occasional joyrides to selfie-taking visitors wanting to get a glimpse at the hulking Chinese ships.With some of the world's largest container ships to berth at Chancay Port in January 2025, residents also fear the arrival of pollution and oil spills. In 2022, a botched tanker delivery at La Pampilla refinery nearby sent thousands of barrels of crude oil spilling into Peru's famously biodiverse waters, killing countless fish and putting legions of fishermen out of work.Today a glance at the moribund town center, featuring mostly empty seafood restaurants, tells the story of diminished fishing stocks and decimated tourism even without the port being operational.The port's breakwater changed the currents and destroyed good surfing conditions, locals said, affecting everyone from ice vendors to truckers to restaurant owners. ""No to the megaport"" is spray-painted on a wall overlooking the waterfront.""This port is a monster that's come here to screw us,"" said 40-year-old Rosa Collantes, cleaning and gutting slimy drum fish on the shore. ""People come to the port and they say 'Wow, tremendous!' but they don't see the reality.""Port authorities say they're aware of the stark contrast between the sleek modern port and the surrounding village of Chancay, where many live on unpaved roads lined with ragged shacks and littered with trash.""You cannot build a state-of-the-art port and have a city next to it that has no drinking water, no sewage, a collapsing hospital and no educational centers,"" said Mario de las Casas, a manager for Cosco in Chancay, adding that the company had already launched studies to determine how the port could help reduce inequality and spur local growth.""The port should not be a blemish,"" De las Casas said.","The megaport of Chancay, a $1.3 billion project majority-owned by the Chinese shipping giant Cosco, is turning this outpost of bobbing fishing boats into an important node of the global economy.

Investigators assess if Netanyahu’s aides forged Oct 7 phone records,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/investigators-assess-if-netanyahus-aides-forged-oct-7-phone-records/articleshow/115318782.cms,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (File photo)

On the morning that Hamas raided Israel last year, a top Israeli general called his prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to tell him that hundreds of militants appeared to be preparing to invade. Now, aides to the PM are under investigation for altering details about that call in the official record of Netanyahu’s activities that day, according to four officials briefed on the investigation.The investigation is seen as deeply sensitive in Israel, where the question of what Netanyahu knew in advance of Hamas’ invasion, and when he was told, could prove crucial to his political future. It is expected to play a key part in a postwar assessment of the role political and military leaders may have played in one of the worst military failures in Israel’s history. The accusation is just one of several levelled at PM’s aides in recent weeks. While Netanyahu himself is not a subject of a police inquiry, officials in his office are under investigation for trying to bolster his reputation throughout Israel’s war with Hamas by leaking classified military documents, altering official transcripts of his conversations and intimidating people who controlled access to those records.Though disparate and complex, the cases have helped foster the impression among Netanyahu’s critics that his team has used illicit means to improve how he is perceived, at the expense of either the truth or national security, or both. Netanyahu and his office have denied the accusations, countering that it is his accusers who, by spreading falsehoods, have undermined Israel at a time of national peril. The full extent of the new claims has not been revealed as most of them are subject to a gag order.","Aides to Benjamin Netanyahu are under investigation for altering details about that call in the official record of Netanyahu’s activities.

Remove words ‘secularism’ & ‘socialism’ from Bangladesh statute: AG,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/remove-words-secularism-socialism-from-bangladesh-statute-ag/articleshow/115318739.cms,"File photo

Stop Hasina remarks

DHAKA: Bangladesh attorney general Md Asaduzzaman has called for removing “socialism” and “secularism” from the country’s constitution, sparking concerns that the predominantly Muslim nation could be shifting toward an Islamic state . The proposal comes just months after the mass uprising that unseated the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League govt early Aug.According to agency reports, Asaduzzaman argued during a high court hearing on the validity of the 15th constitutional amendment that “socialism and secularism do not reflect the realities of a nation where 90% of the population is Muslim”. The suggestion intensified debate over Bangladesh’s future ideological direction.The country’s top law official, appointed by the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt, asserted that “democracy, not socialism , can be the fundamental principle of state policy,” and urged the court to declare the 15th amendment unconstitutional, suggesting that only select provisions be retained.The 15th amendment, passed in 2011 under the now-ousted Awami League administration, designated “nationalism, socialism, democracy, and secularism” as foundational principles of Bangladesh’s state policy, restored freedom of religion, and increased women’s representation. The amendment also abolished the caretaker govt system for overseeing elections, introduced capital punishment for unconstitutional regime changes, and designated Bangladesh’s founding president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the “father of the nation”.Asaduzzaman contended that the amendment “directly contradicts” the spirit of the 1971 Liberation War, the anti-autocracy movement of the 1990s, and the mass uprising in July-August 2024. “If this amendment is not scrapped, the souls of the martyrs, including Abu Sayeed and Mugdho (Mir Mahfuzur Rahman), won’t rest in peace,” he said.Referring to Mujibur Rahman, popularly known as Bangabandhu, the attorney general accused the Awami League of politicising his legacy for partisan gain. “Mujibur Rahman was the undisputed leader of Bangladesh, but Awami League politicised him in the party’s interest.”Kamal Hossain , one of the original framers of the constitution, voiced opposition to the attorney general’s stand. He emphasised that constitutional changes should not be undertaken unilaterally. “Reforms should be carried out only after taking people’s opinions into account,” he said.Hossain also criticised the controversial Article 7A, added under the 15th amendment, which criminalises any attempt to suspend or subvert the constitution through force or unconstitutional means. Such acts are classified as sedition and are punishable by death.Hossain argued that this restriction curtails democratic change and disregards the recent popular movement that overthrew Hasina’s Awami League administration of 15 years. He called for the restoration of the caretaker govt system.Dhaka has urged New Delhi to prevent ex-PM Hasina from making political statements from India , said Toufique Hasan, a spokesperson for Bangladesh foreign ministry. Asked about the process of bringing Hasina back to Bangladesh to appear before the country’s International Crimes Tribunal, Hasan said the ministry has not received any request from relevant authorities.",Bangladesh attorney general Md Asaduzzaman has called for removing “socialism’ and “secularism” from the country’s constitution.

US President-elect Donald Trump named Robert F Kennedy Jr as the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on Thursday.Trump announced the appointment on X, stating that Kennedy would play a key role in protecting Americans from harmful substances. ""I am thrilled to announce Robert F Kennedy Jr as The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). For too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health. """"The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country. Mr. Kennedy will restore these Agencies to the traditions of Gold Standard Scientific Research, and beacons of Transparency, to end the Chronic Disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!"" Trump added.Kennedy, an environmental activist, previously ran for president as an independent before endorsing Donald Trump in August. This endorsement came with the understanding of a potential role in Trump's administration.The HHS oversees agencies like the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health. It also manages MedTrump has stated Kennedy will focus on chronic diseases and reducing chemicals in food. Kennedy has been critical of the FDA, stating on social media, ""The FDA's war on public health is about to end.""Robert F Kennedy Jr, a familiar name due to his famous family, is known for his work as an environmental lawyer and activist. He recently made headlines for his short-lived run for President of the United States in the 2024 election.Kennedy, born in 1954, is the son of Robert F Kennedy, who served as US Attorney General and a US Senator. Growing up in a family deeply involved in politics and public service shaped Kennedy Jr's career path.Kennedy Jr. earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in American history and literature from Harvard University in 1976. He then pursued law, obtaining his Juris Doctor degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1981. His legal education continued at the London School of Economics and culminated in a Master of Laws degree from Pace University School of Law in 1987.This extensive education provided the foundation for his career dedicated to environmental law and activism. He served as an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), where he took part in legal cases concerning natural resources and environmental lawApart from this, RFK Jr also is the president of the Waterkeeper Alliance, an organisation that is committed to preserving the world's water bodies. While leading the waterkeeper alliance he has amplified their outreach toward ensuring clean, safe, and accessible water and giving the ability to community members to conserve their space.Robert F Kennedy Jr became an anti-vaccine activist largely out of concern for vaccine safety and mistrust in regulatory oversight. His journey began with environmental work, where he initially focused on toxins like mercury. Over time, he extended this focus to vaccines, especially after raising alarms about thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative previously used in vaccines, which he alleged could cause neurological damage. Despite thimerosal being phased out from most vaccines, Kennedy maintained his stance, contending that vaccine safety testing is inadequate and expressing skepticism toward the pharmaceutical industry and federal health agencies like the CDC and FDA.In 2011, he founded(CHD), an organisation that campaigns against vaccines and alleges undue influence by pharmaceutical companies over regulatory bodies. Kennedy believes vaccines can harm children and argues that public health authorities prioritize corporate interests over citizens' well-being. His views remain controversial, with health officials worldwide debunking his claims and pointing to the strong evidence of vaccine safety and effectiveness.Kennedy's stance gained renewed visibility during the COVID-19 pandemic as he questioned the accelerated vaccine development and distribution. He has voiced concerns about the potential for adverse effects and believes that Americans should have greater choice over vaccinations, a position that resonates with certain social media influencers and wellness advocates.","President-elect Donald Trump named Robert F Kennedy Jr as the Secretary of Health and Human Services on Thursday.

A US federal appeals court on Wednesday ruled to uphold an Indiana law prohibiting the use of puberty blockers and hormones for transgender youth under 18. The decision from the 7th US circuit court of appeals allows the controversial law to remain in effect.The ruling comes as the US supreme court prepares to hear a challenge to a similar law in Tennessee, potentially impacting similar laws across the nation.The Indiana law, passed by a Republican-controlled legislature , has been fiercely challenged by families of transgender children and healthcare providers. They argue that it discriminates based on sex and interferes with parents' rights to make medical decisions for their children.Circuit judge Michael Brennan, writing for the majority, said the law ""bars gender transition procedures regardless of whether the patient is a boy or a girl"" and rejected the discrimination claim. He further argued that parents do not have an unfettered right to any medical treatment for their children.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), representing the plaintiffs, did not immediately comment on the decision. Indiana attorney general Todd Rokita celebrated the ruling on social media platform X, saying, ""A huge win for Hoosiers and will help protect our most precious gift from God - our children.""This case is one of many across the US grappling with the use of puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender youth. Currently, 26 states have implemented bans or restrictions on these treatments.Proponents of such laws cite the need to protect children from what they consider experimental treatments.

Lahore, the city with over 14 million people surrounded by industrial factories, has hit record pollution levels this month. The toxic smog affecting Lahore and other parts of Pakistan has worsened, with more than 15,000 cases of respiratory and viral infections reported in a single day, Ary News reported on Thursday.According to Swiss group IQAir, Lahore’s pollution index reached a staggering 1165, while New Delhi and surrounding areas hovered around 350.Hospitals in Lahore are experiencing an influx of patients presenting symptoms including dry cough, respiratory distress, pneumonia, and chest infections.The primary government healthcare facilities have recorded substantial patient numbers: Mayo Hospital attended to over 4,000 individuals, Jinnah Hospital treated 3,500 patients, Gangaram Hospital received 3,000 cases, and Children's Hospital managed more than 2,000 patients.Healthcare professionals in Pakistan have highlighted the increased risk to children and individuals with underlying conditions such as asthma and cardiac ailments, Ary News reported.The atmospheric pollution has triggered a surge in various ailments, including pneumonia, chest infections, and dermatological conditions.The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that air pollution can lead to strokes, heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory issues. Children, babies, and the elderly are especially vulnerable to these health risks.PM2.5, the fine particulate matter that poses the greatest danger, is the chief pollutant in Lahore’s air. It originates from fossil fuel combustion, dust storms, and wildfires, and has been linked to asthma, heart and lung disease, cancer, and cognitive impairment in children.Pakistani authorities are implementing comprehensive measures to address this environmental crisis. According to Pakistani media outlets, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority of Pakistan officially classified smog as a ""calamity"" and implemented emergency protocols.The pollution, mainly caused by industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and agricultural stubble burning, has triggered health emergencies. As a result, schools have been closed, outdoor activities banned, and significant health concerns are mounting. The hazardous air poses serious risks, especially to children, the elderly, and those with respiratory conditions.Also read: Pakistan restricts outdoor activities, market hours to curb air pollution-related illness The government's response includes a three-month ban on wedding celebrations and new transport department regulations to combat smog across the province.

Beijing is pushing Pakistan to allow its own security staff to provide protection to thousands of Chinese citizens working in the South Asian nation, during talks after a car bombing in Karachi that was seen as a major security breach, sources said.Last month’s airport bombing in the southern port city that killed two Chinese engineers returning to work on a project after a holiday in Thailand was the latest in a string of attacks on Beijing’s interests in Pakistan. The attacks, and Islamabad’s failure to deter them, have angered China, which has pushed Pakistan to begin formal negotiations for a joint security management system .Reuters spoke to five Pakistani security and govt sources with direct knowledge of the previously unreported negotiations, and reviewed a written proposal sent by Beijing to Islamabad. “They (Chinese) want to bring in their own security,” said one official, who sat in on a recent meeting, adding that Pa kistan had not so far agreed to such a step.A written proposal sent to Islamabad by Beijing, and forwarded to Pakistani security agencies for review, mentioned a clause allowing the dispatching of security agencies and military forces into each others’ territory to assist in counter-terrorism missions and conduct joint strikes. The dispatching would be done after discussions, but Pakistani agencies were averse to the proposal, one official said.Neither Beijing nor Islama bad confirmed the talks officially. The source, and two other officials, said there was a consensus on setting up a joint security management system, and that Pakistan was amenable to Chinese officials sitting in on security meetings and co-ordination. But there was no agreement on their participating in security arrangements on the ground. The first official said Pakistan had asked China for help in improving its intelligence and surveillance capabilities instead of direct involvement.The nature of the Karachi bombing has angered Beijing: A pick-up truck rigged with nearly 100 kg of explosives waited unchecked for 40 minutes near the outermost security cordon of the heavily guarded airport before its driver rammed it into the vehicle carrying Chinese engineers, officials said. “It was agrave security breach,” admitted one of the officials investigating the blast. Investigators believe the attackers had “inside help” in securing details of the itinerary and route.","Beijing is pushing Pakistan to allow its own security staff to provide protection to thousands of Chinese citizens working in the South Asian nation.

He urged the Pakistan government to take immediate action to curb the worsening air pollution and protect these vulnerable populations.Fadil, in a statement, said, ""I am extremely concerned about the well-being of young children who are forced to breathe polluted, toxic air. Over 11 million children under five years of age are exposed to this smog in the worst-affected districts.""He noted that even before this year’s record-breaking smog, 12% of deaths in children under five in Pakistan were attributed to air pollution—a number likely to increase with the ongoing crisis.Fadil warned of the additional risks to expectant mothers, stating that exposure to polluted air increases the likelihood of premature births, respiratory complications, and low birth weight. ""When pregnant women are exposed to polluted air, they are more likely to give birth prematurely, face respiratory issues, and their babies may have a low birth weight.

The recent amendment to the Pakistan Army Act, which extends the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) from three to five years, has sparked significant debate and concern regarding the implications for civil-military relations in Pakistan .This legislative change, hastily approved by the ruling coalition led by PM Shehbaz Sharif's PML-N, not only lengthens the term of the army chief but also removes the retirement age limit for four-star generals, effectively allowing military leaders to remain in power indefinitely.The amendment allows the current COAS, General Asim Munir , who was appointed in November 2022 and was set to retire in 2025, to potentially serve until 2027 or longer if further extensions are granted. This change is seen as a continuation of a trend where military leaders have managed to extend their tenures beyond traditional limits.The amendment was moved by defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif and received majority support despite strong opposition protests from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by former PM Imran Khan.The PTI lawmakers criticised the expedited process of passing such crucial legislation without adequate debate, arguing that it undermines democratic principles in a country already grappling with political instabilityThe removal of the retirement age limit for the army chief raises critical concerns about the balance of power between civilian governance and military authority in Pakistan.Critics argue that this move consolidates military power at a time when civilian institutions are already perceived as weak. The ability for an army chief to remain in power indefinitely could lead to a scenario where military influence over political affairs becomes even more pronounced, effectively sidelining elected representatives.Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, noted that such legislative actions transform the legislative into a ""rubber stamp"", thereby diminishing democratic governance.The Pakistan army has been a dominant force in the country's political landscape since its inception in 1947, often overshadowing elected governments.The military's involvement in politics began almost immediately, with its first significant intervention occurring in 1958 when General Muhammad Ayub Khan led a coup against the civilian government, citing corruption and inefficiency.Since that initial coup, the army has directly ruled the country for about 36 years, while also exerting considerable influence during periods of civilian rule.Major coups occurred under Ayub Khan (1958), Yahya Khan (1969), and Zia-ul-Haq (1977), each time justifying military rule as necessary for national stability.The military's rationale often centered around restoring order amid political chaos, which has led to a cycle of governance where elected officials frequently find themselves subordinate to military interests.The intertwining of military and political affairs has given rise to what analysts describe as the ""establishment"" or ""deep state"", where the military operates behind the scenes to influence policy decisions even when not in direct control.This dynamic has allowed the army to maintain significant control over key areas such as foreign policy, security, and economic management. For instance, during recent political upheavals, including the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022, the military played a crucial role in shaping political outcomes.Elected governments have often been compelled to align their policies with military interests.Political leaders are acutely aware that their tenure could be jeopardized by military intervention if they stray too far from the army's preferences. This has led to a pattern where civilian governments consult with military leaders on critical issues, particularly those involving national security and foreign relations. The recent amendments to extend the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff reflect this ongoing power dynamic, allowing military leadership to exert even greater influence over governance without the constraints of a retirement age.In defense of the amendments, government officials have argued that extending military tenures is essential for maintaining stability and continuity in Pakistan's security leadership amid regional tensions. They contend that allowing military chiefs to serve longer terms will enable them to address national security challenges without disruptions caused by frequent leadership changes.Supporters of the amendment also claim that aligning military leadership tenures with other constitutional offices—many of which have five-year terms—provides a rational framework for governance.The legislative change is not unprecedented in Pakistan's history.Previous army chiefs have also enjoyed extended tenures through similar amendments or political maneuvering.General Qamar Javed Bajwa had his term extended multiple times during his tenure from 2016 to 2022.The pattern of extending military leadership has become almost standard practice, raising questions about accountability and oversight within Pakistan's political system.Observers note that General Munir's potential extended tenure could mirror historical figures like General Zia-ul-Haq, whose prolonged rule led to widespread discontent among both military ranks and civilians due to perceived mismanagement and authoritarian practices.The removal of age limits and potential for indefinite extensions could lead to a scenario where future army chiefs similarly consolidate power.Moreover, there are concerns that these changes may pave the way for further legal amendments aimed at consolidating military power across other branches of government.For instance, recent discussions around increasing the number of Supreme Court judges could be interpreted as an attempt to ensure favorable judicial outcomes for military interests.","The Pakistan army has been a dominant force in the country's political landscape since its inception in 1947.

"Lahore Air Quality Index: Pakistan restricts outdoor activities, market hours to curb air pollution-related illness",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-restricts-outdoor-activities-market-hours-to-curb-air-pollution-related-illness/articleshow/115174509.cms,"Pakistan restricts outdoor activities, market hours to curb air pollution-related illness (Picture credit: Reuters)

Pakistan's Punjab province has introduced strict measures to combat rising illnesses caused by severe air pollution. Starting Monday, most outdoor activities are banned, and shops, markets, and malls in certain areas are required to close early.This move follows an earlier decision to shut down educational institutions and public spaces like parks and zoos in Lahore and nearby districts until November 17.Lahore, which has been ranked as the world's most polluted city by Swiss air quality monitor IQAir, recently recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of over 600, significantly lower than the alarming 1,900 it reached earlier in the month. For context, an AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good'.The worsening air quality has led to a sharp increase in cases of respiratory diseases, eye irritation, and conjunctivitis in districts like Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala.The Punjab government noted an unprecedented rise in patients suffering from these conditions, attributing the spread of pink eye disease to dust, smoke, and chemical exposure.As part of the new restrictions, outdoor sports events, exhibitions, and festivals have been prohibited, while essential religious activities remain exempt. Pharmacies, dairy shops, and vegetable outlets are allowed to operate until 8 pm (local time).The pollution crisis has been particularly severe in Lahore, where thick smog has caused reduced visibility, leading to road accidents. In one incident, nine people were injured on GT Road when a van collided with a parked truck due to the dense haze.Authorities in Multan are facing even more critical conditions, with the AQI reaching over 2,000 last Friday. The concentration of PM2.5 particles, a harmful pollutant known to cause severe respiratory issues, was recorded at 947 micrograms per cubic meter, which is nearly 190 times higher than World Health Organization guidelines.Critics have pointed out that the government has been slow to enforce preventive measures, with many residents seen without masks despite the hazardous air quality.Authorities have blamed cross-border winds from India for exacerbating the smog, claiming that pollutants drifting from across the border have worsened the air quality in Pakistan’s Punjab province. The Punjab government has expressed its intention to take up the issue with Indian authorities through diplomatic channels.","Pakistan's Punjab province has introduced strict measures to combat rising illnesses caused by severe air pollution.

LAHORE: Pakistan's Punjab province banned most outdoor activities and ordered shops, markets and malls in some areas to close early from Monday to curb illnesses caused by intense air pollution.The province has already closed educational institutions and public spaces like parks and zoos until Nov. 17 in places including Lahore, the world's most polluted city in terms of air quality according to Swiss group IQAir's live ratings.The districts of Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala have seen an unprecedented rise in patients with respiratory diseases, eye and throat irritation, and pink eye disease, the Punjab government said in an order issued late on Sunday.The new restrictions would also remain in force until Nov. 17, it said.""The spread of conjunctivitis/ pink eye disease due to bacterial or viral infection, smoke, dust or chemical exposure is posing a serious and imminent threat to public health,"" it said.While outdoor activities including outdoor sports events, exhibitions and festivals, and outdoor dining at restaurants have been prohibited, ""unavoidable religious rites"" are exempt from this direction, the order said.Some outlets like pharmacies, oil depots, dairy shops, and fruit and vegetable shops have similarly been exempted from the directions to close by 8 p.m. local time.Lahore's air quality remained hazardous on Monday, with an index score of more than 600, according to IQAir, but this was significantly lower than the 1,900 that it touched in some places earlier this month.A score of 0-50 is considered 'good'.Several parts of South Asia are engulfed by a toxic haze each winter as cold air traps dust, emissions, and smoke from farm fires.Punjab has blamed its particularly toxic air this year on pollution wafting in from India, where northern parts have also been battling hazardous air, and has said it will take the issue up with the neighbouring country through its foreign ministry.India's Supreme Court on Monday directed the Delhi government to decide by Nov. 25 on imposing a 'perpetual ban' on firecrackers, legal news portal Bar and Bench reported.Firecrackers set off by revellers on Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights that was celebrated on Oct. 31 this year despite a ban, has aggravated the region's pollution problem.","Pakistan's Punjab province has banned most outdoor activities and ordered shops, markets and malls in some areas to close early.

Internet users in Pakistan reported significant disruptions to Virtual Private Network (VPN) services over the weekend, with reports of “restricted access” and “throttled connectivity” affecting popular VPN providers, Dawn reported. This surge in access issues comes just days after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated former US President Donald Trump on social media platform X, a post which attracted scrutiny and sparked debate online.An outage-tracking website, issues were reported on VPN services such as VPN Unlimited and TunnelBear, Dawn reported quoting Downdetector. Users described difficulties connecting, with VPN Unlimited showing a peak of reported problems at around 6:15 pm and TunnelBear users noting connectivity issues into the evening.For many Pakistanis, VPNs are a vital tool for accessing blocked sites, including X (formerly Twitter), which has been restricted due to national security concerns. This recent wave of connectivity issues has reignited discussions over digital freedom and government policies limiting online access.Prime Minister Sharif's recent tweet congratulating Trump for his second term win garnered significant attention for both its content and the reaction it received. In his message, Sharif wrote, ""Congratulations to President-elect Donald Trump on his historic victory for a second term! I look forward to working closely with the incoming administration to further strengthen and broaden the Pakistan-US partnership.” However, X attached a community note to the tweet, pointing out that Sharif himself had banned X in Pakistan and was likely using a VPN to access the platform, which is “unlawful under Pakistani law.”This community note intensified debates over VPN usage in the country, with some citizens arguing that restrictive internet policies compel even government officials to bypass their own regulations. Another note was attached to a subsequent tweet by Sharif, congratulating Pakistan’s cricket team.In February, X was banned in Pakistan, with authorities citing “national security concerns” and non-compliance with local laws as justification. Despite the restrictions, X remains a key platform for official statements from the government.Last August, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) announced plans to scrutinise VPN services in the country, aiming to limit access to only those services that align with government regulations.

IMF's unscheduled visit to Pakistan to bridge $2.5 billion gap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imfs-unscheduled-visit-to-pakistan-to-bridge-2-5-billion-gap/articleshow/115143850.cms,"The International Monetary Fund is all set to hold performance review discussions in Pakistan next week, a sudden move made by the mission as the first formal review for the release of the second $1.1 billion tranche is scheduled to take place in March 2025, as per media reports.The main objective of the meeting will be to secure new foreign loans for the country in order to bridge an external financing gap of nearly $2.5 billion for this fiscal year.The IMF intends to carefully examine Pakistan's projections for its macroeconomic framework.The IMF Mission, led by Chief Nathan Porter, will hold the talk on Tuesday, with an opening session scheduled to include finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, as per The Express Tribune.During the review, the country’s external financing requirements would also be evaluated, as several planned loans have yet to be finalized.The Washington-based global lender had earlier estimated a total external financing gap of $5 billion for the 2024-2027 period, with $2.5 billion expected to be needed in the current financial year.Pakistan is facing difficulty in closing its external financing gap due to delays in securing loans from bilateral creditors.The Pakistani authorities have, however, claimed that the gap is now narrower than projected, because of the improvement in the external sector. However, loans are still necessary to service existing debts, most of which are owed to Western financial institutions.The country had anticipated raising $3.2 billion against the $2.5 billion in debt needs since IMF’s approval of a $7 billion package for Pakistan in September. This included a $1.2 billion Saudi oil facility.As per sources, no agreement has been reached regarding the Saudi oil facility, five months into the fiscal year.Each month of delay reduces available funds by $100 million within the fiscal year. Pakistani authorities remain optimistic about convincing Riyadh to extend the facility. However, finance ministry spokesperson Qumar Abbasi did not respond to queries regarding the status of the $1.2 billion oil facility.Apart from IMP, Pakistan is also seeking a $1 billion loan from Dubai Islamic Bank, while requesting China to reschedule $3.4 billion in debt from China's Export-Import (Exim) Bank.Out of this amount, approximately $750 million is due in the current fiscal year. The rescheduling of this debt has been included in the country's external financing plans, as per sources.Due to its weakened financial position and the constraints imposed by the IMF agreement, Pakistan lacks the flexibility to repay its debt to China.Around $3.9 billion, of the total $6.5 billion in Chinese commercial debt, is due in the current fiscal year. The government successfully rolled over a $200 million debt that matured in September. However, sources suggest that no progress has been made in arranging another rollover, with a $1 billion payment due in March 2025.As part of its $3.2 billion plan, the government also secured Pakistan's most expensive loan in history—a $600 million facility from Standard Chartered Bank. The finance minister stated that this facility would not be utilized, while the IMF distanced itself from the loan arrangement.IMF's unexpected visit comes just six weeks after the loan's approval and four months before the planned review, which will evaluate performance against the July-September targets and assess progress for the October-December 2024 quarter.Official figures show a tax collection shortfall of Rs 190 billion over the past four months, with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collecting Rs 3.440 trillion, against a target of Rs 3.632 trillion, despite record-high taxes this year.",IMF's unexpected visit comes just six weeks after the loan's approval and four months before the planned review.

A serious incident on GT Road near Kalashah Kako saw nine people injured when a van collided with a stationary truck, its driver unable to see the parked vehicle through the dense haze.The smog has also forced Lahore high court to mandate a shutdown of all trade activities by 8 pm and close markets on Sundays, aiming to minimize pollution-inducing activity.In Multan, conditions reached what experts called ""apocalyptic"" levels, with the AQI exceeding 2,000 on Friday morning.

Key issues and economic challenges

A divided opposition and the potential for change

Subdued elections

Sri Lanka is headed for a crucial parliamentary election on November 14, called by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake . His National People's Power (NPP) party seeks a majority in the 225-seat legislature to implement anti-poverty and reform initiatives. This vote occurs as Sri Lanka continues to recover from its severe financial crisis that resulted in the removal of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022.As Dissanayake triumphed in September, securing 42% of votes, the election became essential as Dissanayake had only three parliamentarians in the outgoing assembly, which was set to conclude in August 2025 and now needs 113 seats to implement his policies. The election involves 17.1 million eligible voters and over 8,800 candidates.The NPP, founded in 2019, is a newcomer among Sri Lanka's traditional parties, many of which have long been dominated by family dynasties. Dissanayake’s party competes against Sajith Premadasa’s United People's Power (Samagi Jana Balawegaya), which came second in the presidential race. The splintered opposition is reportedly struggling to regain ground following their losses, with many veteran politicians from the former ruling party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), choosing to sit out the election.The vote is being closely watched, not just for its political implications but also for its potential impact on Sri Lanka's fragile economic recovery. The country is implementing a $2.9 billion bailout program from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after defaulting on its external debt in 2022. This crisis, fueled by economic mismanagement, tax cuts, and the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in hyperinflation, foreign currency shortages, and a collapse in tourism, which is a major revenue source.President Dissanayake’s campaign focused on revisiting the IMF deal, though he has since committed to its terms. While he initially promised to reduce high income taxes imposed under the program, his focus has shifted to balancing economic stability with pro-poor policies aimed at reducing income inequality. Investors are watching closely, with concerns that renegotiating the IMF terms could stall future disbursements and disrupt the country’s progress toward a primary surplus target of 2.3% of GDP by 2025.If the NPP secures a parliamentary majority, it will mark the first time a leftist, Marxist-leaning coalition takes control of both the presidency and parliament in Sri Lanka. This outcome could lead to a dramatic shift in policy-making, potentially ushering in a more socialist approach to governance. Dissanayake’s stance against traditional political corruption and his focus on reforming welfare policies resonate with a public that is weary of the country’s long-standing political elites and recent economic hardships.On the other hand, a failure to secure a majority could leave Dissanayake relying on coalition partnerships, which may complicate his reform efforts and reduce the likelihood of swift policy changes. Opposition leader Premadasa has vowed to pressure Dissanayake to uphold promises of tax relief, while the conservative New Democratic Front, led by supporters of previous President Ranil Wickremesinghe, remains a contender.With a decisive cabinet expected to form as early as Friday, and the new parliament convening on November 21, Dissanayake will likely use the throne speech to outline his administration's core policy priorities. The election is expected to be less contentious and more subdued than previous ones, partly due to the opposition's weakened position and low enthusiasm for traditional parties.Dissanayake’s potential victory would also likely continue to realign Sri Lanka's international relationships. Given Sri Lanka’s recent reliance on foreign aid, Dissanayake’s administration may seek new avenues for economic partnership, potentially increasing cooperation with both China and India.","Sri Lanka is headed for a crucial parliamentary election on November 14, called by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

DHAKA: A cargo vessel from Karachi docked at Chattogram port Wednesday, marking the inaugural direct maritime connection between Pakistan and Bangladesh. This underscores the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt’s shift in regional approach as it has been working to strengthen ties with Pakistan — a country held responsible by many in Bangladesh for mass atrocities during the 1971 Liberation War.The ship arrived amid a politically sensitive environment in Bangladesh, where the govt’s recent moves have stirred both support and opposition. This comprises efforts to remove symbols of the 1971 war, including portraits of Bangladesh’s founding president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, since an uprising ousted PM Sheikh Hasina’s govt of 15 years in Aug.Pakistani high commissioner Syed Ahmed Maroof described the establishment of the shipping route as a “major step” forward in strengthening trade and business relations. “The initiative will accelerate existing trade flows and promote new opportunities for businesses on both sides, from small traders to large exporters,” he said.","A cargo vessel from Karachi docked at Chattogram port Wednesday, marking the inaugural direct maritime connection between Pakistan and Bangladesh.

BAKU: Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus said Wednesday that world leaders shouldn't be negotiating at United Nations climate talks this year, and countries responsible for warming up the planet should instead just simply provide the funds to deal with the climate crisis.""Why should there be a negotiation? You are causing the problem, then you solve it,"" he told The Associated Press in an interview in Baku, Azerbaijan. ""We will raise our voice and tell them it's your fault, like what we did with colonialism.""Yunus was chosen to head Bangladesh's interim government after the nation's longtime prime minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled abroad. Her resignation followed intense political turmoil earlier this year, with weeks of protests and clashes with security forces that killed nearly 300 people. Known as the ""banker to the poorest of the poor,"" Yunus was a longtime critic of Hasina.Yunus said the climate negotiations, known as COP29, can be ""humiliating"" for poor countries. Yunus likened the talks to a ""fish market"" packed with people trying to get the best bargains. ""That's a very wrong perception of the whole thing,"" he said.Bangladesh is among the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change.

BNP worried interim govt may extend tenure

DHAKA: Bangladesh’s newly appointed interim govt adviser Mahfuj Alam has removed the portrait of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from the Darbar Hall of Banga Bhaban, in what critics said was “complete and utter disrespect” of the country’s first president and the constitution.Banga Bhaban is the residence and main workplace of the President of Bangladesh.Posting a photo of himself at Darbar Hall after taking oath on Sunday, Mahfuj on Monday wrote on Facebook: “It is a shame for us that we couldn’t remove his pictures from Banga Bhaban after the 5th of August. Apologies.”A political activist, who wished to remain unnamed, suggested that the removal of Mujib’s portrait from Darbar Hall might be linked to a desire to alter the constitution and erase the spirit of 1971 Liberation War , “promoting a Pakistani ideology in Bangladesh”.The Bangladesh constitution mandates that the portrait of Mujibur be preserved and displayed at the offices of the president, PM, speaker, and chief justice, as well as at all govt and semi-govt offices.Mujibur is also the father of deposed PM Sheikh Hasina “No individual should change it (the constitution) with the stroke of a pen,” Kamal Hossain , one of the framers of the current constitution said, adding, “reforms should be carried out only after taking people’s opinions into account”.Suspecting that Bangladesh’s interim govt may be thinking of extending its tenure, the BNP has reminded the Muhammad Yunus-led dispensation that its primary duty is to promptly transfer power to elected representatives after conducting a fair election.On Monday, senior BNP politician Hafizuddin Ahmed claimed several individuals with pro-Awami League affiliations had been appointed to the interim govt’s advisory council.Two leading coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement have also criticised the new govt additions.The interim govt was expanded Sunday with the addition of three new advisers. Two of them — businessman Sk Bashir Uddin and popular filmmaker Mostofa Sarwar Farooki — are perceived to be linked to the deposed Sheikh Hasina govt.",Bangladesh’s newly appointed interim govt adviser Mahfuj Alam has removed the portrait of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from the Darbar Hall of Banga Bhaban. Critics said the move was “complete and utter disrespect” of the country”s first president and the constitution.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115197293,imgsize-245330,width-400,resizemode-4/115197293.jpg"

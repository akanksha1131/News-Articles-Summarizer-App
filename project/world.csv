From Biden to TikTok ban: Key takeaways from Donald Trump's first interview since his White House return,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-biden-to-tiktok-ban-key-takeaways-from-donald-trumps-first-interview-since-his-white-house-return/articleshow/117472653.cms,"Key takeaways from Donald Trump's first interview

Taking about the LA wildfire, Trump criticised Gavin Newsom for failing to handle the wildfires in California and said, ""Gavin's got one thing he can do. He can release the water that comes from the north.""

He further slammed (Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA), and vows to fix disaster response, ""FEMA is getting in the way of everything. On Friday, I’m stopping in North Carolina because those people were treated very badly, then I’m going to California.""

“I’d rather see the states take care of their own problems,” Trump said.

“I love Oklahoma. But you know what, if they get hit with a tornado or something, let Oklahoma fix it. And then the federal government can help them out with the money. FEMA is getting in the way of everything, and the Democrats actually used FEMA not to help North Carolina,"" he added.

Trump also hit out at Democrats and said they, ""can’t govern, and their policies are terrible. They don’t want to see a woman get pummeled by a man boxing. They don’t want a child to leave home as a boy and come back later as a girl.""

""Is it that important for China to be spying on young kids watching crazy videos? They make your computers, and your telephones, and other things. Isn’t that a bigger threat?,"" said Trump on TikTok.

During the discussion, Trump expressed regret, saying that it is ""sad"" that his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, did not issue a self-pardon. Trump said Biden made a huge mistake not pardoning himself hinting at going after him. ""This guy went around giving everybody pardons, and you know, the funny thing, maybe the sad thing, is he didn’t give himself a pardon.""

""We have terrorists in our country by the thousands.. We’re going to take care of it.""

""A gross miscarriage of common sense"", said Trump on Biden’s border crisis. ""21 million people let in—a large percentage are criminals. Prisons from all over the world have been emptied into our country by Biden,"" he added.

In his first interview after taking the Oval Office for the second time, US President Donald Trump on Wednesday talked on various topics ranging from TikTok to Los Angeles wildfires.While talking about getting back into the White House, the US president told Fox News' Sean Hannity, ""It showed us that the radical left, their philosophies and policies, are horrible. They don't work.""When asked if he ever had doubts about winning the US election (held last year), he said, ""It's something I don't think about. I just do it — I get it done. I get things done. I'm good at getting things done.""","US President Donald Trump gave his first interview after taking the Oval Office for the second time on Wednesday.

The mayor of Ma'ale Adumim , as Israeli town in Judea, announced on Wednesday that a significant area of municipal land has been renamed ""Trump One"" (T1) in honour of US President Donald Trump.""Trump’s second term is a unique opportunity to strengthen Jewish communities, especially in Judea and Samaria,"" said Mayor Guy Yifrach. ""We trust Trump and believe that he will promote construction in the region in the coming month.""The newly renamed 4,000-acre zone, previously known as E1 or Mevaseret Adumim, lies within Ma’ale Adumim’s municipal boundaries and is part of Area C, where Israel exercises full administrative and security control.Plans to build more than 3,000 homes in the area, aimed at addressing housing shortages, have been delayed for years due to international opposition, including resistance from the Biden administration.Mayor Yifrach pointed out the strategic importance of the area, now called T1, and urged Israeli leaders to create territorial continuity between Ma’ale Adumim and Jerusalem.This is not the first time Israel has honoured Trump. In 2019, after Trump recognised Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights , a new community in the region was named “Ramat Trump” in his honour.Israeli leaders have also applauded Trump’s recent policy shifts, including executive orders reversing sanctions imposed during the Biden administration on residents of Judea and Samaria accused of violence against Palestinians.Other moves include cutting funds to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and re-imposing sanctions on officials of the International Criminal Court.","Ma'ale Adumim, as Israeli town in Judea, announced on Wednesday that a significant area of municipal land has been renamed ""Trump One"" (T1) in honour of US President Donald Trump.

Major threat to life

Disrupted travel

The US Gulf Coast was wrapped in a historic winter storm that swept across Tuesday, bringing record-breaking snowfall to a region, which is usually sun soaked. The storm that stretched 1,500 miles from Texas to the Carolinas, left behind widespread travel chaos, stranded bikers, and thousands of cancelled flights.The snowy chaos has resulted in deadly conditions across the region with at least 11 casualties, as per news agency CNN.Many places in New Orleans received 25 centimeters, surpassing its record of 6.8 centimeters from 1963, the national weather service reported. There was also an unofficial report of 11.5 inches of snow in Saint Bernard Parish east of the city.The small town of Milton near Florida received 24.9 centimeters of snowfall, smashing the state's lifetime record from 1954, according to news agency AP.Houston city of Texas, experienced an unexpected snowfall of 10 centimetres, leaving the city unprepared being the region owning no snowplows. Furthermore, a preliminary report recorded 15 centimetres (6 inches) of snow in La Porte, southeast of Houston.Charleston experienced over 10 centimetres of snowfall, leading to closing the airport and the iconic Ravenel Bridge. Authorities explained the bridge was shut down due to ice forming on its cables, which could break off in large chunks and potentially damage vehicles.Mobile Regional Airport recorded 15.7 centimetres of snow, surpassing the city's previous one-day record of 12.7 centimetres set on 24 January 1881.Unofficial reports also noted over 23 centimetres of snow in Gulf Coast communities near Mobile. In southern Alabama, the small town of Babbie also reported a preliminary snowfall total of 28 centimetres, marking one of the highest.Fatal car accidents due to icy roads have been reported in Texas and Alabama. In Texas’ Zavala County, five people died after their vehicle skidded on a bridge, while in Alabama, another woman died in a collision on a snow-covered highway.Hypothermia is also suspected in several deaths, including one in Milwaukee and another in Georgia.The cold snap has further raised challenges for the homeless. In San Antonio, a woman was seen seeking refuge in their dog kennel, while New Orleans opened an additional warming centre after existing shelters reached capacity.Houston also reported over 1,300 people using warming centres, with officials ensuring no one was turned away.Air travel across the country was disrupted, with more than 1,800 cancelled flights.Airports in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida were forced to shut down, while others, like New Orleans’ Louis Armstrong Airport, cancelled all departing flights.Road conditions also remained hazardous in the regions. Louisiana shut down a 150-mile stretch of Interstate 10, and New Orleans brought in snow ploughs from Indiana to clear critical routes. In Alabama and Mississippi, roads were labeled “impassable,” where black ice remained a major threat.The NBA and multiple college basketball conferences also postponed games in response to winter weather.","The storm that stretched 1,500 miles from Texas to the Carolinas, left behind widespread travel chaos, stranded bikers, and thousands of cancelled flights.

Trump administration blocks many health agency reports and online content,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-blocks-many-health-agency-reports-and-online-content/articleshow/117472171.cms,"Donald Trump (File photo)

The Trump administration has implemented a temporary suspension on federal health agency communications with the public until the month's end.According to a memorandum accessed by The Associated Press, Dorothy Fink, acting secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services, instructed agency leaders to halt regulations, guidance, announcements, press releases, social media posts and website posts pending approval from a political appointee. ""As the new Administration considers its plan for managing the federal policy and public communications processes, it is important that the President’s appointees and designees have the opportunity to review and approve any regulations, guidance documents, and other public documents and communications (including social media),” said Fink.The pause, which is in effect through February 1, also applies to anything intended to be published in the Federal Register, where the executive branch communicates rules and regulations, and the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientific publication. Agencies subject to the directive from the department of health and human services include the CDC, the national institutes of health, and the food and drug administration.""The executive branch is a hierarchy,"" Steven Grossman, who now consults for food and drug companies, said in an email. ""Whether stated publicly or not, every new administration wants important commitments and positions to wait until new teams are in place and some semblance of hierarchy restored.""Ali Khan, a former CDC outbreak investigator who is now dean of the University of Nebraska's public health college, said that a pause is reasonable as a changing executive branch takes steps to become coordinated. ""The only concern would be is if this is a prelude to going back to a prior approach of silencing the agencies around a political narrative,"" he added.Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said that the communications pause could threaten public safety, as Americans depend on timely information from the CDC, the FDA, and other agencies to avoid foodborne illnesses and stay aware of other health issues. ""When it comes to stopping outbreaks, every second counts. Confusion around the vaguely worded gag order is likely to lead to unnecessary delay in publishing urgent public alerts during active outbreaks,"" Lurie said in a statement.Jeffrey Klausner, a University of Southern California public health expert, echoed these concerns. ""Local health officials and doctors depend on the CDC to get disease updates, timely prevention, testing and treatment guidelines and information about outbreaks,"" he wrote in an email. ""Shutting down public health communication stops a basic function of public health. Imagine if the government turned off fire sirens or other warning systems.""During his first term also, President Donald Trump 's political appointees tried to gain control over the CDC's MMWR journal, which had published information about the Covid-19 pandemic that conflicted with messaging from the White House.According to the current memo, some exceptions would be made for communications affecting ""critical health, safety, environmental, financial or nation security functions"", but those would still be subject to review. The FDA has posted notices about warning letters sent to companies and a drug safety notice on Tuesday and Wednesday.This comes after Trump signed an executive order on Day 1 of his presidency pulling US out of the WHO, citing the organization's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and China's influence over the body.","Trump administration has implemented a temporary suspension on federal health agency communications with the public until the month's end.

"'Can't whitewash blood, feces, and terror': Judge on Trump's pardons for capitol rioters",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cant-whitewash-blood-feces-and-terror-judge-on-trumps-pardons-for-capitol-rioters/articleshow/117472275.cms,"Capitol riot on January 6, 2020 (File photo)

Three federal judges on Wednesday delivered strong rebukes against US President Donald Trump's mass pardons of supporters, who stormed the Capitol Hill on January 6, 2021. The pardons, issued on Trump's first day back in office, have drawn criticism from several quarters.Trump, sworn in Monday after his re-election victory, pardoned over 1,500 individuals linked to the attack on the Capitol, including 14 members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers militia. The riot aimed to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden's 2020 presidential win.District Judge Tanya Chutkan dismissed charges against one Capitol riot defendant but issued a scathing statement. “No pardon can change the tragic truth of what happened on January 6, 2021,” Chutkan said. “It cannot whitewash the blood, feces, and terror that the mob left in its wake. And it cannot repair the jagged breach in America’s sacred tradition of peacefully transitioning power.”Chutkan also presided over the criminal case brought against Trump by special counsel Jack Smith, accusing Trump of attempting to overturn the 2020 election results.However, the case was dismissed after Trump's election victory, aligning with the Justice Department's policy against prosecuting sitting presidents.Two other federal judges similarly condemned the pardons. District Judge Beryl Howell dismissed charges against two defendants but expressed her disapproval of the reasoning behind the pardons. “No ‘national injustice’ occurred here, just as no outcome-determinative election fraud occurred in the 2020 presidential election,” Howell said.She added, “Poor losers cannot be allowed to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power with impunity. That merely raises the dangerous specter of future lawless conduct by other poor losers and undermines the rule of law.”District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly also criticised the pardons while dismissing charges. “What occurred that day is preserved for the future through thousands of contemporaneous videos, transcripts of trials, jury verdicts, and judicial opinions,” she said. “Those records are immutable and represent the truth, no matter how the events of January 6 are described by those charged or their allies.”The January 6 attack left more than 140 police officers injured as rioters, armed with flagpoles, bats, Tasers, and bear spray, stormed the Capitol. During his campaign, Trump had pledged to pardon those involved, describing them as “patriots” and “political prisoners.”Trump has repeatedly downplayed the violence of the Capitol attack, once calling it a “day of love.” The attack followed a speech by Trump to his supporters near the White House, where he repeated false claims of election fraud and encouraged them to march on Congress.","Three federal judges delivered strong rebukes against US President Donald Trump's mass pardons of supporters.

Hundreds to get married today as Thailand's same-sex marriage law comes into effect,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/hundreds-to-get-married-as-thailands-same-sex-marriage-law-comes-into-effect/articleshow/117472032.cms,"200 couples to tie knot

Pioneering equality in Asia

Looking ahead: Advocacy for trans rights

Hundreds of same-sex couples are set to tie the knot on Thursday as Thailand officially becomes the first Southeast Asian nation to recognise marriage equality. The landmark legislation, passed last year and now coming into effect, represents a monumental victory for the LGBTQ+ community after over a decade of relentless advocacy.""This could be a model for the world,"" said Kittinun Daramadhaj, president of the Rainbow Sky Association of Thailand. ""There is true marriage equality in Thailand.""Under the groundbreaking law, same-sex couples gain full legal, financial, and medical rights, including adoption and inheritance protections. For many, this legislation signals a new chapter of inclusion and progress in a country long celebrated for its vibrant LGBTQ+ culture.Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra praised the achievement during an event last week, where she welcomed LGBTQ+ couples and activists to the government's offices. ""This demonstrates that Thailand is ready to embrace diversity and accept love in all its forms,"" she said.Festivities to mark this historic occasion are set to unfold across the country. In Bangkok, at least 200 couples will tie the knot in a mass wedding at a bustling shopping mall, co-organised by Bangkok Pride and local authorities. A colourful ""pride carpet"" will be rolled out for the newlyweds, accompanied by performances from celebrities and drag queens.Celebrations will also ripple through other regions, from the coastal city of Pattaya to the mountainous city of Chiang Mai, with rainbow flags waving as symbols of love and resilience.""This is not just a victory for the LGBTQ+ community but for all of Thailand,"" said one participant in Bangkok. ""It shows that love truly knows no boundaries.""Thailand's achievement places it alongside Taiwan and Nepal as the only Asian jurisdictions recognising same-sex marriage. However, rights experts caution that Thailand may remain an outlier in the region, where progress on LGBTQ+ rights has been slow.Globally, more than 30 jurisdictions recognise same-sex marriage, primarily in Europe, the Americas, and Australasia, according to the Pew Research Center.While Thursday’s celebrations mark a significant milestone, advocates emphasise that the fight for equality is far from over. Activists are now pushing for the Thai government to allow transgender individuals to legally change their gender identity, a long-overdue recognition for the country's estimated 314,000 trans people.""There’s a misconception that trans people are fully embraced in Thailand, but there's still a lot of work to be done,"" said Hua Boonyapisomparn of the Foundation of Transgender Alliance for Human Rights.","Thailand becomes the first Southeast Asian nation to recognise marriage equality.

President Donald Trump announced the appointment of Sean Curran as the new director of the US Secret Service on Wednesday.The announcement was made via Trump's Truth Social platform, where he praised Curran as a ""Great Patriot"" who has protected his family over the past few years. ""It is my great honor to appoint Sean Curran as the next Director of the United States Secret Service. Sean is a Great Patriot, who has protected my family over the past few years, and that is why I trust him to lead the Brave Men and Women of the United States Secret Service,"" Trump said.further explaining the reasoning behind the appointment, Trump said, ""Sean has distinguished himself as a brilliant leader, who is capable of directing and leading operational security plans for some of the most complex Special Security Events in the History of our Country, and the World. He proved his fearless courage when he risked his own life to help save mine from an assassin’s bullet in Butler , Pennsylvania. I have complete and total confidence in Sean to make the United States Secret Service stronger than ever before.""Curran, who joined the Secret Service in September 2001, previously served as the special agent in charge of Trump's security detail for four years. In this role, he oversaw 85 personnel and notably protected Trump during the first assassination attempt against him on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania. An insider revealed to CNN that Curran actively advocated for enhanced security measures for Trump, and subsequently hurried towards the stage when shots rang out during the Butler event.On December 29, Curran was promoted to deputy special agent in charge of the Presidential Protective Detail, a unit consisting of hundreds of agents responsible for protecting the current president and the first family.Trump's decision to appoint Curran goes against the recommendations of two bipartisan commissions, which suggested in 2015 and earlier this year that the next president should choose someone outside the agency to serve as director. Unlike other cabinet positions or the FBI director, the appointment of the Secret Service director does not require Senate confirmation.Additionally, several official sources quoted by CNN have expressed reservations about Curran's administrative capabilities to lead an organisation as intricate and substantial as the Secret Service. Whilst Curran's experience includes overseeing approximately 85 personnel during his tenure on Trump's security detail, he has not previously handled the extensive operational responsibilities or financial management that the Secret Service position demands.Curran will replace Ron Rowe , who has been acting director since July, following the resignation of former Director Kimberly Cheatle. Cheatle stepped down amid criticism of the agency's failure to prevent an assassination attempt on Trump during a campaign rally in July last year, which resulted in the injury of two attendees and the death of 50-year-old Cory Comperatore.","Sean Curran will replace Ron Rowe, who has been acting director since July, following the resignation of former Director Kimberly Cheatle.

I love the Russian people, and always had a very good relationship with President Putin - and this despite the Radical Left's Russia, Russia, Russia HOAX.

""He should make a deal. I think he's destroying Russia by not making a deal,"" Trump said upon returning to the Oval Office. ""I think Russia's going to be in big trouble.""The US president also expressed his willingness to meet Putin, recalling their past summit during his first term. ""I got along with him great. I would hope he wants to make a deal,"" Trump added.Trump referenced conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who reportedly expressed support for a peace agreement to end the war, which began with Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. ""Most people thought that war would have been over in one week,"" Trump remarked. ""I think he’d be very well off to end that war.""Meanwhile, Putin indicated his readiness for dialogue with the new US administration, stating on Monday that Russia remains open to negotiations on the Ukrainian conflict. In televised remarks, Putin emphasised the need for a sustainable resolution. ""As for the settlement of the situation itself, I want to emphasise that its goal should not be a brief truce but a lasting peace based on respect for the legitimate interests of all people,"" he said, while congratulating Trump on his upcoming inauguration.Reiterating his commitment to Russian interests, Putin stated, ""We will, of course, fight for the interests of Russia, for the interests of the Russian people."" He also welcomed Trump's determination to prevent the Ukraine war from escalating into ""World War III,"" a scenario the US president warned about during his campaign.Both leaders have signaled openness to addressing the conflict, with Trump repeatedly highlighting his ability to mediate and describing the war as ""dying to be settled.""

US President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of an additional 1,500 military personnel to the border with Mexico as part of a series of measures to address immigration, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.This deployment will increase the total number of active-duty troops at the border to approximately 4,000, with border security being a top priority for the president since declaring a national emergency at the US-Mexico border on his first day in office.The reinforcements comprise 1,000 Army personnel and 500 Marines, according to a senior US military official at the Pentagon, as reported by AFP. The Marines, previously designated for California wildfire support but not utilised, have been reassigned to the border operation.""These forces will work on the placement of physical barriers and other border missions. First operations for them should commence within the next 24 to 48 hours; they're moving right now,"" the senior military official said.The official also anticipates the deployment of additional airborne intelligence, surveillance, and support assets to enhance situational awareness at the border. Acting defense secretary Robert Salesses stated that the US military will assist with flights to deport migrants out of the country.""The department will provide military airlift to support DHS (Department of Homeland Security) deportation flights of more than five thousand illegal aliens from the San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas sectors,"" Salesses said in a statement.The senior military official confirmed that the deportation effort will involve approximately 100 US military personnel. The deployment of additional troops is considered an initial effort, with many additional missions expected to follow, according to a senior defense official.From Day 1 in office, Trump has remained firm with crackdown on illegal immigration.

Trump faces criticism

A fresh wildfire broke out north of Los Angeles on Wednesday, rapidly growing and prompting evacuation orders for tens of thousands of residents in an area already struggling with massive fire damage.According to official, over 50,000 people are under evacuation orders or warnings from the fire burning north of Los Angeles.Near Castaic Lake, intense flames consumed hillsides, quickly spreading across more than 5,000 acres (2,000 hectares) within hours. Strong, dry Santa Ana winds propelled the fire, pushing smoke and dangerous embers ahead of the flames. Authorities ordered 31,000 people to evacuate around the lake, situated 35 miles (56 kilometres) north of Los Angeles, near Santa Clarita.""I'm just praying that our house doesn't burn down,"" one resident told broadcaster KTLA whilst loading his vehicle.The incident occurred whilst the greater Los Angeles area was still recovering from two massive fires that claimed over two dozen lives and destroyed numerous structures.Robert Jensen from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department urged immediate evacuation for all residents in the affected area of the new fire, called the Hughes Fire . ""We've seen the devastation caused by people failing to follow those orders in the Palisades and Eaton fires,"" he said. ""I don't want to see that here in our community as well. If you've been issued an evacuation order, please get out.""Police were observed driving through neighbourhoods instructing residents to evacuate.Sheriff Robert Luna confirmed the evacuation of Pitchess Detention Centre in Castaic, with 500 inmates being transferred to a nearby facility. Approximately 4,600 inmates at other local jails were sheltering in place, with transport ready if needed.Melissa Camacho, an ACLU attorney, expressed concern about ""the expansion of the jail system especially in dangerous fire zones,"" saying they were ""gravely concerned for the safety of people incarcerated in those jails.""The fire affected I5 freeway traffic, causing the closure of a section of this major West Coast route. Aerial firefighting efforts included water and retardant drops from helicopters, planes, and two Super Scoopers.Ground crews from Los Angeles County fire department and Angeles National Forest joined the firefighting effort.Governor Gavin Newsom , previously criticised by President Donald Trump over Los Angeles fire management, announced state resource deployment to assist federal response to the Hughes Fire.The fire's cause remained unknown, but it started during red flag conditions, characterised by strong winds and low humidity conducive to rapid fire spread.Human-induced climate change, including unrestricted fossil fuel use, is altering global temperatures and weather patterns. Despite being in the rainy season, Southern California had experienced no significant rainfall for about eight months, leaving vegetation extremely dry.","A fresh wildfire broke out north of Los Angeles on Wednesday, rapidly growing and prompting evacuation orders for tens of thousands of residents.

House passes Laken Riley Act in move targeting illegal immigrants – Trump set to sign marking first major act of second term,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/house-passes-laken-riley-act-targeting-immigrant-detention-set-to-become-trumps-first-signed-bill-in-second-term/articleshow/117471010.cms,"Representative image

The House of Representatives, under Republican leadership, approved the Laken Riley Act on Wednesday, a stringent immigration detention law named after a 22-year-old nursing student from Georgia who was killed by an undocumented immigrant in the previous year.The bill, which focuses on detaining individuals illegally present in the US who commit nonviolent offences such as theft, is set to become the first legislation President Donald Trump will sign upon his return to the White House this week.The legislation passed with a 263-156 vote, gaining support from 46 Democrats alongside all Republican members. Earlier in the week, the Senate approved it 64-35, with 12 Democrats voting in favour, including Sens. Gary Peters, Jon Ossoff, Jeanne Shaheen, and Mark Warner, who face re-election in 2026.In November, Jose Ibarra, a 26-year-old Venezuelan citizen who was in the United States illegally, was found guilty of kidnapping, assaulting, and murdering Riley while she was jogging near the University of Georgia campus in Athens. Ibarra received a life sentence without the possibility of parole.During the 2024 campaign, Trump and Republicans emphasised that Ibarra had been cited for shoplifting by a Georgia police department, but Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) did not issue a detainer for him, and he was not taken into custody.The Laken Riley Act, authored by Rep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.), would require ICE to take custody of and detain undocumented immigrants who are charged, arrested, or convicted of committing acts of ""burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting.""""It's bittersweet,"" Collins said after the vote, adding that he had spoken to Riley's family earlier in the day. ""For a young lady that wanted to dedicate her career and her life to saving lives, now her name will live on forever and it will save lives.""Last year, the GOP-controlled House passed an earlier version of the bill with a vote of 264-159, including support from 48 Democrats. However, the Democratic-led Senate ignored the bill, and President Joe Biden never indicated whether he supported it.The Senate adopted two amendments to expand the list of acts that trigger mandatory detention of unauthorized migrants: one from Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) that includes assault of a police officer, and another from Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) that includes acts causing death or bodily harm to an individual.The passage of the Laken Riley Act occurs amidst a heated debate among Democrats about how to address immigration issues following their significant defeat in the 2024 election and how to respond to Trump's plans for mass deportation.Pro-immigration activists have criticized the bill as a scheme to strip away due process for migrants and disrupt the system, while some Democrats have called it an unfunded mandate that will cost billions. Other Democrats in competitive districts and states supported the bill, seeking to demonstrate their commitment to strict immigration enforcement.According to NBC News exit polls, immigration was the fourth-biggest concern among voters in the 2024 election, with those Americans voting for Trump over Democratic rival Kamala Harris by a margin of 89% to 9%. Trump also made significant gains among Latino voters and won Latino men outright, according to exit polls.House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) addressed the divide within the party over the bill, stating, ""Members will vote their districts. Members have to balance ... their love for this country with the job that they have to do for their constituents. We expect them to do both in the votes that they make.""""The Democratic Caucus believes in a safe and secure border,"" Aguilar continued. ""We believe in order at the border and a fix to our broken immigration system. We also believe in ensuring the public safety of our communities.""Democrats who opposed the Laken Riley Act argued that the legislation was too draconian. Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-NY), the new chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told NBC News, ""Laken Riley casts out a net to cuff, arrest and deport people who have committed minor offenses. In that sense, it is not a good thing."" ""Any discussion that should be had here around the issue of border security, around the issue of immigration,"" he said, ""should include something on Dreamers, farm workers and families.""In an interview with NBC News, Laken Riley's father, Jason Riley, expressed gratitude for the lawmakers who supported the legislation, which he believed has ""helped change things politically.""""I think it turned out to be a good thing,"" he said Wednesday. He added that he hates that her killing ""became such a national story"" and put the family in the spotlight, but that he understood ""why it became so politically charged.""""We're very happy with the way things have turned out,"" he said.","The Laken Riley Act is a stringent immigration detention law named after a 22-year-old nursing student from Georgia who was killed by an undocumented immigrant in the previous year.

Poll What Do You Think About Pregnant Women Opting for Preterm C-Sections Due to Citizenship Concerns? A Risky Decision for Both Mother and Child A Desperate Measure for Stability

HYDERABAD: C-section in the US has a new trigger: citizenship pangs.At a maternity clinic in New Jersey, Dr S D Rama has been fielding an unusually high number of requests for pre-term delivery since President Donald Trump’s Jan 20 proclamation about termination of birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment.The majority of those dialling Rama or queuing up at her clinic are Indian women in their eighth or ninth month of pregnancy, all asking for C-sections to be scheduled before Feb 20. A few are still a couple of months away from full term.“A seven months pregnant woman came with her husband to sign up for a preterm delivery. She isn’t due until sometime in March,” Rama told TOI from New Jersey on Wednesday.The desperation to beat the birthright citizenship deadline — babies born Feb 20 onwards to those who aren’t permanent residents won’t be automatically entitled to citizenship — is apparently widespread.“I am trying to tell couples that even if it is possible, a preterm birth poses significant risk to mother and child. Complications include underdeveloped lungs, feeding problems, low birth weight, neurological complications and more,” said Dr S G Mukkala, an obstetrician and gynaecologist in Texas. “In the past two days, I have spoken to 15 to 20 couples regarding this.”With the backlog for green cards stretching to over a century now, birthright citizenship was a safety net for many expectant couples, especially Indians working in the US.“We were counting on our child being born here,” said Varun, who along with his wife Priya (names changed) moved to the US eight years ago on H-1B visas. “We’ve been waiting for our green cards for six years. This was the only way to ensure stability for our family. We are terrified of the uncertainty.” Priya, 34, is due to give birth in early March.A 28-year-old finance professional said his plans would go haywire if his dependant wife were to give birth to their first child after the deadline. “We sacrificed so much to come here. Now, it feels like the door is closing on us,” the H-1B holder said, still a few months away from parenthood.For illegal immigrants, the change in policy has even stronger ramifications.California-based Vijay (name changed), who has been living in the US for eight years since entering the country illegally, said he and his seven months pregnant wife were “crushed” by the news of the Trump administration enforcing the deadline so soon. “We thought of seeking asylum, but then my wife got pregnant and our lawyer suggested that we get direct citizenship through our child. Now, we are all at sea.”",President Donald Trump's Jan 20 proclamation about termination of birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment.

Elon Musk: How long will Elon Musk last in Trump's good book after Vivek Ramaswamy's DOGE exit? 'Longer than many but...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-long-will-elon-musk-last-in-trumps-good-book-after-vivek-ramaswamys-doge-exit-longer-than-many-but-/articleshow/117467770.cms,"Anthony Scaramucci said Elon Musk would last around a year in Trump's good book.

What happened to Vivek Ramaswamy?

As Vivek Ramaswamy is believed to have fallen out of Donald Trump's grace now that he is out of the Department of Government Efficiency leaving Elon Musk alone at the helm, speculations are rife as to how long Elon Musk will survive in Donald Trump's good books. Trump's former aide Anthony Scaramucci who was fired as his communications director in 11 days during his first term said Elon musk will outlast most of the new crowd as he brings in a lot of money. But he will not last more than a year, Scaramucci said.MAGA 2,0 will being about big-name firings and fallout, he said adding that Musk will be out of Trump's orbit in a year's time and Secretary of State Marco Rubio won't survive that much longer.“A lot of these guys will get blown out,” Scaramucci said. “I don’t see how Marco Rubio can last more than a year. Marco Rubio is philosophically antithetical to what Trump wants to do in society from a geopolitical perspective. So he’s gonna switch on a dime and just embrace all of the Trump stuff? Come on, it’s not gonna happen.”Scaramucci said Trump is a “maniac” and suggested it is only a matter of a time before infighting erupts inside the West Wing.“So now, all of a sudden, this new group of people is going to come in and everything’s going to work out hunky dory?” he said. “It’s not going to happen. So will Elon last longer than other people? Sure, because he’s worth $250, $400 billion and Trump is a little afraid of him. So yes, he’ll last longer than other people, but he’s already out to pasture.”Amid speculations that Ramaswamy fell out of the inner MAGA circle because of his post criticizing American culture, it is not exactly know what went wrong for Ramaswamy who will now be focusing on Ohio governor election.","Anthony Scaramucci said Elon Musk will outlast most of the new crowd as he brings in a lot of money.

Anthony Scaramucci who worked as Donald Trump's adviser for 11 days now has someone to make fun of as according to him Vivek Ramaswamy lasted minus one day in the Department of Government Efficiency. Scaramucci joked that Vivek Ramaswamy's tenure can't be measured in 'Scaramuccis' which stands for 11 days after his infamous exit in Donald Trump's first term. By removing himself from co-leading the DOGE the night before Trump could officially create it on inauguration day, Ramaswamy lasted minus one day, even shorter than him, Scaramucci said on Politico's PowerPlay podcast.“Ramaswamy lasted minus one day, OK? He got blown out on Jan. 19, so he’s not even—you can’t even measure him by Scaramuccis, which are 11-day time units."" Scaramucci was fired by Trump as White House director after a week and a half but Scaramucci used that fame to appear on media regularly and then he created a super PAC that supported Joe Biden in 2020.“You know, like Liz Truss lasted 4.1 Scaramuccis, right? This guy didn’t even make it, right? He was minus a day,"" Scaramucci said referring to former British PM who remained the PM for only 49 days.Scaramuccia's joke is part of an intense debate going on inside and outside MAGA circles about what went wrong with Vivek Ramaswamy that he attended DOGE's all-hands meeting on Saturday but was out of the agency a day later. The decision was not announced until Donald Trump's inauguration where Ramaswamy posted a photo with Elon Musk -- the man believed to be the force behind Ramaswamy's exit.After Trump's inauguration, Ramaswamy said he would soon announce more about his upcoming role in Ohio -- the governor election in 2026, and also expressed confidence in Elon Musk's leadership for DOGE.According to insiders, Vivek Ramaswamy's long post in which he denigrated the American culture for worshipping mediocrity sealed his exit from DOGE as Republicans did not like Vivek's sermonizing about American culture. Everyone wanted him out and then he also burned Elon Musk, insiders claimed that initially Vivek Ramaswamy was looking to contest for Ohio Governor simultaneously with his DOGE role but Elon Musk objected to it.",Anthony Scaramucci joked that Vivek Ramaswamy's tenure can't be measured in 'Scaramuccis' which stands for 11 days after his infamous exit in Donald Trump's first term.

Donald Trump sought an apology from her as he called her a radical left hard line Trump hater.“The so-called Bishop who spoke at the National Prayer Service on Tuesday morning was a Radical Left hard line Trump hater,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “She brought her church into the World of politics in a very ungracious way,” he said — saying she did so in a “nasty” tone that was “not compelling or smart.”Referring to the bishop's 'have mercy' on immigrant families appeal, Trump said the bishop failed to mention the large number of illegal migrants that came into the US and killed people. “She is not very good at her job! She and her church owe the public an apology!” he wrote.Reacting to the controversy, the bishop said her message was politicized but it was kind of a given that her message would be politicized, she said. ""I think if you read what I said, I mean how could it not be politicized, right? We are in a hyper-political climate.

Former US Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad Backs Afghan Minister’s Call for Girls’ Education,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/former-us-envoy-to-kabul-backs-minister-on-girls-education/articleshow/117407227.cms,"Representative photo

ISLAMABAD: Zalmay Khalilzad , the former US special envoy for Afghanistan during Donald Trump’s first term as president, said on Monday that Afghan deputy foreign minister Shir Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai ’s remarks calling upon his government to scrap the ban on education for women was a “promising development”.Stanikzai’s rare public criticism coincided with ongoing international pressure on Afghanistan ’s leaders to lift restrictions on women’s access to public life in general and to allow girls to attend secondary schools and beyond. He made a direct public appeal to the country’s reclusive leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, to lift the ban and called the exclusion of girls from education an “injustice” on part of the Islamic Emirate against half of Afghanistan’s 40-mn population.“The whole world has a problem with us on this issue. They criticise us for it. But the path we have taken is a matter of our own liking, not the Sharia,” Stanikzai said.Welcoming the stance, Khalilzad highlighted that Stanikzai is an important IEA official who played a key role in the Doha negotiations . As special envoy for Afghanistan, Khalilzad was lead negotiator during the Doha talks.He also asked Afghan religious scholars and leaders of the Islamic Emirate who privately oppose the ban on girls’ education to make their opposition public. Further, he emphasised that schools and universities should be reopened by the beginning of the new solar year, in late March.After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021, Akhundzada had imposed his strict interpretation of Sharia law through dozens of decrees, mainly restricting girls’ access to education beyond the sixth grade and banning the majority of women from working or participating in public life.Last August, the Taliban announced a new law on the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice, which bars women from traveling or using public transportation without a male guardian. The law requires women and girls to cover their faces in public and prohibits them from singing in public or letting their voices be heard outside the house.","Afghan deputy foreign minister Shir Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai called upon his government to scrap the ban on education for women. He made a direct public appeal to the country’s reclusive leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, to lift the ban.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117407226,imgsize-538413,width-400,resizemode-4/117407226.jpg"
China-Built Gwadar International Airport Opens for Operations in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/china-built-airport-in-paks-gwadar-starts-operations/articleshow/117407210.cms,"File photo

ISLAMABAD: The first commercial flight landed at Pakistan’s new Gwadar International Airport on Monday following a months-long delay in the opening of the Beijing-funded facility in volatile Balochistan province.The airport’s opening was postponed from Aug 14 to the end of 2024 due to a security review sparked by a series of deadly attacks by separatist militants in Balochistan, in Pakistan’s southwest. Then, on Jan 10, the airport was due to open, but this was again delayed.“The $246-million Chinese-backed project is expected to grow into one of Pakistan’s biggest airports and serve both domestic and international travel,” the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA) said in a statement.“Pakistan achieved a landmark moment in its aviation history on Monday as the first commercial flight successfully landed at the new Gwadar International Airport,” the statement read, adding the new airport is poised to play a pivotal role in connecting Pakistan to global markets and facilitating trade, tourism, and economic development.PIA Flight PK-503 departed from Karachi at 9.50 am and touched down at the airport at 11.15 am, carrying 46 passengers. In a video shared by PAA, the PIA flight was seen being greeted by a traditional water salute by water bowsers as it landed.China has pledged more than $65 billion for infrastructure, energy, and other projects in Pakistan under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ). As part of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Pakistan is also creating a deep-water port near the new Gwadar airport, a joint venture between Pakistan, Oman, and China that is nearing completion. Chinese people and projects have been frequently attacked in the past by separatists who view Beijing as a foreign invader trying to gain control of impoverished but mineral-rich Balochistan, the site of a decades-long insurgency.Recent attacks, including one in Oct 2024 in which two Chinese workers were killed in a suicide bombing in Karachi, have forced Beijing to publicly criticise Pakistan for security lapses. In recent months, the media has widely reported that China wants its own security forces on the ground to protect its nationals and projects, a demand Islamabad has long resisted.","PIA Flight PK-503 departed from Karachi at 9.50 am and touched down at the airport at 11.15 am, carrying 46 passengers.

Inauguration ceremony

Economic and strategic significance

Challenges in Balochistan

Future prospects

Pakistan’s largest airport, funded and constructed by China in the restive Balochistan province , officially became operational on Monday, marking a significant milestone in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative.The inaugural ceremony at Gwadar International Airport witnessed the arrival of a Pakistan International Airlines flight from Karachi. Defense Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif and Chinese officials were present, celebrating the $230 million project, which has a capacity to handle 400,000 passengers annually.The event followed the virtual inauguration of the airport earlier this year by Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.Built under Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the airport aims to bolster trade and attract international investment. It complements the deep-sea port in Gwadar, positioning the coastal city as a key regional trade hub.“The airport will play a crucial role in improving the economy, fostering international investment, and bringing prosperity to Balochistan,” Asif stated during the ceremony.The airport, spanning 4,300 acres, can accommodate various aircraft, including ATR 72, Airbus A-300, and Boeing 747, for both domestic and international routes, according to the Ministry of Planning and Development.The project’s completion faced delays due to increased attacks by separatists in Balochistan, who oppose Chinese investments and accuse them of economic exploitation. The region has long been plagued by an insurgency demanding greater autonomy or independence.Ethnic Baloch groups have criticized the development projects, claiming they benefit outsiders while leaving local communities marginalized.Despite the challenges, Gwadar International Airport symbolizes deeper Pakistan-China ties and reflects China’s strategic interest in the region. The airport is expected to enhance connectivity, trade, and tourism while contributing to the broader goals of the Belt and Road Initiative.As the largest airport in Pakistan by area, the Gwadar facility is set to become a vital link in regional and international trade, though its success depends on addressing ongoing security and political concerns in the province.","Gwadar International Airport is Pakistan’s largest airport, funded and constructed by China in the restive Balochistan province.

Pak authorities demolish pre-Partition Ahmadi worship place,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-authorities-demolish-pre-partition-ahmadi-worship-place/articleshow/117361970.cms,"File photo

ISLAMABAD: A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab’s Sialkot district, Pakistani media reported on Saturday.The place was built by Chaudhry Zafarullah Khan , Pakistan’s first foreign minister and an Ahmadi by faith, in his native town of Daska, Sialkot. A renowned lawyer in British India, he was a crucial champion for the Ahmadi cause in significant trials.This historical structure was razed on Jan 16, two days after local authorities claimed that an extension of the structure was illegal as it encroached 13 feet onto a public road, a claim rejected by community members.Despite this, Amir Mahmood, spokesperson for the marginalised community, said they had complied with the govt notice and a wall was constructed on the inner side on Jan 15, but the area’s assistant commissioner, accompanied by police, proceeded with the demolition the next day and flattened the entire structure. “It is clear that using the illegal encroachments as an excuse, the administration targeted and demolished the Ahmadi community’s place of worship,” Mahmood said, adding the structure had not been altered or extended since its original construction by Khan’s family before Partition. He blamed the local administration for continuously targeting the community’s properties and ignoring their grievances.The operation lasted from 7pm until 11pm, and electricity to the place of worship and neighbouring areas was also cut off. The action was not strictly administrative as during the entire time, locals said, a number of people had gathered chanting provocative slogans against the persecuted community. This was the latest in a series of actions targeting Ahmadis. According to data, at least 22 of their places of worship were destroyed across Punjab in 2024.","A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan condemned the court's verdict in the Al Qadir Trust case, calling it a ""mockery"" of justice and pledged to fight till the last ball and refuse any deals, The Express Tribune reported.In a statement shared on social media platforms Facebook and X, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan condemned the court's decision in the Al Qadir Trust case, calling it a premeditated move with the verdict and sentencing already leaked to the media before the official announcement.Khan called the judicial process a ""mockery"" of justice and said that the individuals who wrote the judgement leaked it to the media, undermining the integrity of the legal system, according to The Express Tribune report. PTI founder reiterated his stance against the "" military-backed regime "" and vowed to never accept it.He said, ""I will continue my struggle for true freedom and democracy, even if it means spending more time in jail,"" while emphasising that he will make no compromise on his principles or the fight for Pakistan's true independence, The Express Tribune reported.Imran Khan pledged to continue fighting for democracy, the rule of law, and true freedom for the people of Pakistan. He said, ""We will fight till the last ball, and I will not make any deals. I will face all the false cases brought against me.""He called on the people of Pakistan to read the Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report and compare it to the actions of General Yahya Khan, who he claimed similarly caused the downfall of Pakistan. He said that the current rulers were following the same path, acting in their personal interests and pushing Pakistan towards destruction.On Al-Qadir Trust case , PTI founder accused the judiciary of causing further damaging to its credibility and added that judges who backed ""military rule"" and acted as per their instructions were given rewards. He said that the case should have been focused on Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif and his son for allegedly selling their property worth 9 billion pound to a business tycoon for 18 billion pound, raising questions on the source of their wealth and why they had not given the requested receipts in the Panama Papers case.He accused Pakistan's former chief justice Qazi Faez Isa of facilitating money laundering in the Hudaibiya Paper Mills case , where billions of rupees were forgiven. On Al-Qadir University, Khan called the institution as non-profit, welfare-focused project like other educational ventures like Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Namal University.PTI founder said that he and his wife, Bushra Bibi , did not gain any financial benefit from the university. He called the decision a deliberate attempt to target his wife, Bushra Bibi, who he said has faced repeated false charges and her punishment was part of a broader attempt to pressure him by hurting his family, The Express Tribune reported.He said, ""My wife is a housewife with no connection to politics. She has always stood by me, considering these challenges as tests from Allah.""On negotiations with government, Khan warned that if no progress was made on establishing a judicial commission for May 9 and November 26 incidents, the discussions would be pointless and accused the government of evading accountability.Imran Khan made the remarks after an accountability court in Rawalpindi sentenced Imran Khan to 14 years in prison and Bushra Bibi to 7 years in the 190 million pound Al-Qadir Trust case. After the verdict, Imran Khan's wife was arrested in the court.In addition, Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were asked to pay a fine of PakistRupees (PKR) 1 million and PKR 500,000 respectively. Failure to pay the fines would result in additional six months jail time for Khan and three months for his wife.","Imran Khan condemned court's verdict in Al-Qadir Trust case, vows to 'fight till last ball' Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder called the judicial process a ""mockery"" of justice.

"Imran, wife sentenced to jail in corruption case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-wife-sentenced-to-jail-in-corruption-case/articleshow/117340821.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Jailed Pakistani former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively, after an accountability court found the couple guilty of corruption by receiving land as a bribe from a Pakistani real-estate czar.The makeshift court operating from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where Khan has been incarcerated since Aug 2023, had reserved its verdict three times in the £190-million (about Rs 2,003 crore in Indian currency) Al-Qadir Trust case since Dec last year. Following the ruling, Bushra was arrested from the courtroom.Accountability court judge Nasir Javed Rana also fined Khan Pakistani Rs 1 million ($3,500), while Bibi was fined half that amount.Failure to pay the fines would result in an additional six months in jail for Imran and three months for Bushra, the judge said.According to the verdict, the property of the “sham trust Al-Qadir University Project Trust is hereby forfeited to the federal govt”.“Both convicts are present before the court; they be taken into custody in this case and be handed over to the jail superintendent along with the committal warrant to serve the sentences so awarded,” it added.The couple were indicted in the case on Feb 27, 2024, shortly after the general elections.The case alleges that Khan and his wife had acquired land worth billions of rupees (millions of US dollars) for the Al-Qadir Trust from Malik Riaz Hussain, a prominent property tycoon in Pakistan, to establish a nonprofit educational institute for the poor. In return, Pakistan’s anti-corruption watchdog alleged, Khan’s govt from Aug 2018 to April 2022 had provided legal cover to Riaz’s black money (£130 million), which Britain’s National Crime Agency had recovered and handed over to the Pakistan govt.This has been the fourth major case in which the former cricket star has been convicted. Last year, Khan was convicted in cases related to selling state gifts, leaking state secrets, and unlawful marriage, all of which were later overturned or suspended by the Islamabad high court. Despite this, Khan remains behind bars, with dozens of cases pending against him. He describes the cases as a political witch-hunt.Khan was first arrested in connection with the Al-Qadir Trust case on May 9, 2023, spending just two days in detention. However, the arrest had sparked nationwide protests during which Khan’s supporters had stormed govt buildings and military installations in multiple cities.Speaking to reporters inside the courtroom after his conviction, Imran rejected the notion of striking a deal with anyone to get himself freed from prison. “I will neither make any deal nor seek any relief,” he told reporters, adding that those who stand against dictatorship are punished.His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI)condemned the conviction as a continuation of “bogus persecution” against Khan and his wife. “While the party awaits the detailed decision, it is important to note that the Al Qadir Trust case against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi lacks any solid foundation and is bound to collapse,” the PTI said. “All evidence and witness testimonies confirm that there has been no mismanagement or wrongdoing. Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi are merely trustees, with no further involvement in the matter,” it added.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively.

Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan by US forces in 2011, and a Pakistani militant, currently detained in Guantanamo Bay, is believed to have been the chief mastermind of those attacks.Critics were quick to voice their concerns online.

In June 2020, the airline was banned from flying to the European Union, UK, and US after one of its Airbus A-320 planes crashed in Karachi, killing nearly 100 people. The disaster was blamed on human error by the pilots and air traffic control, and it was later revealed that a significant number of pilots had dubious or fake licences.In 2016, a PIA plane caught fire after one of its engines failed during a flight from the remote north to Islamabad, killing over 40 people.In November, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency lifted the ban on PIA, citing “sufficient confidence” in the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority’s oversight. However, the airline remains barred from flying in the UK and the US.PIA continues to fly to multiple cities across Pakistan, including in the mountainous north, and also serves destinations in the Gulf and Southeast Asia.Despite the backlash, Khan noted that the airline’s return to Europe has been welcomed with positive feedback.

He provided no further details.The attack came weeks after the government secured a ceasefire deal between tribal leaders.It also came days after the first aid convoy reached Kurram, where violence flared on Nov. 21 when gunmen ambushed a convoy of vehicles and killed 52 people, mostly Shiite Muslims, in a dispute over land.Shiite Muslims dominate parts of Kurram, although they are a minority in the rest of Pakistan, which is majority Sunni.

DHAKA: A Bangladeshi education ministry order demanding officers report institutions and pupils involved in anti-government ""provocative activities"" has been condemned by lawyers for challenging the spirit of last year's student-led revolution.The mass uprising spearheaded by students toppled long-time autocrat Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, with an interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus taking charge.The order, signed by the ministry's director of its ""monitoring and evaluation"" for secondary education, Abed Nomani , was issued on January 2 but shot to attention after it circulated on social media and in newspapers.It ordered officials to ""remain vigilant and proactive in preventing students from engaging in provocative actions, driven by propaganda, misinformation, or disinformation against the government or the country"".It did not provide clarification on what those actions might include.""Officials must notify the authorities if any educational institution or student is involved in provocative activities so that necessary measures can be taken,"" it added.Supreme Court lawyer Snehadri Chakravarty said it was a clear violation of constitutional rights.""Student-led protests once toppled former prime minister Sheikh Hasina because people's freedom of speech and expression was being curtailed,"" Chakravarty told AFP.""Within five months, some factions of the government appear to be echoing her actions"", he added.""This type of notification is not in line with the spirit of the mass uprising, which claimed so many lives"".More than 800 people died in the months of protests that culminated in the ouster of Hasina's government on August 5, according to the interim government.The ministry official who signed the order, Nomani, confirmed it had been circulated, but told AFP that he had only ""complied"" with orders issued to him by more senior officials.","Bangladeshi education ministry order demands officers report institutions and pupils involved in anti-government ""provocative activities"" Order condemned by lawyers for challenging spirit of last year's student-led revolution.

Sri Lanka orders ex-leaders to move out of deluxe mansions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sri-lanka-orders-ex-leaders-to-move-out-of-deluxe-mansions/articleshow/117429022.cms,"Representative Image

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's leftist government asked former presidents, including the once-powerful Rajapaksa brothers, on Tuesday to immediately vacate luxury government bungalows as part of a new austerity drive.The government has decided to convert the stately homes into upmarket boutique hotels or museums, Information Minister Nalinda Jayatissa told reporters in Colombo.He said the state would pay former leaders rent totaling $107 a month, as they are entitled to under a 1986 law, instead of providing government housing.Jayatissa noted that former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was occupying a government house with a monthly rental value of $16,500 (4.6 million rupees), which is more than 150 times his official entitlement.""The government will not provide housing for ex-presidents or their widows in future,"" Jayatissa said.""They will only receive a rent allowance equivalent to one-third of their pension, which is 30,000 rupees.""There was no immediate comment from Mahinda Rajapaksa, but a local media report said he was willing to vacate if given written notice.Jayatissa said the former leader could take Tuesday's public statement as his notice and vacate the premises immediately.Media reports said Rajapaksa, as prime minister in 2021, had spent some 800 million rupees of government money refurbishing the house he currently occupies as a former president.His younger brother Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was forced to step down from the presidency in July 2022 over allegations of economic mismanagement and corruption, is also occupying a state mansion.Two other former presidents, Chandrika Kumaratunga and Maithripala Sirisena, are living in government housing in Colombo's fashionable diplomatic quarters.Many of the houses were built during British colonial rule for top civil servants from London.Current President Anura Kumara Dissanayake came to power in September on a pledge to fight corruption and tightened his grip after his party won a landslide in snap parliamentary polls.The new government drastically reduced the number of security personnel assigned to former leaders last month, a move that authorities said saved more than 1,200 million rupees ($4.3 million) annually for taxpayers.The security of the two Rajapaksa brothers cost the state more than 1,017 million rupees ($3.63 million) last year, the government said.They ruled Sri Lanka for a decade until 2015 and again from November 2019 to July 2022.Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced to step down in 2022 as Sri Lanka faced its worst economic meltdown, with foreign reserves plummeting and the nation running out of dollars to finance imports of essentials such as food, fuel and medicines.The number of bodyguards allocated to all former leaders has been reduced to a maximum of 60 since late December.","Sri Lanka's leftist government has asked former presidents to vacate luxury bungalows.

ISLAMABAD: The future of negotiations between the government and the opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), remains uncertain due to disagreements over the formation of judicial commissions to investigate the events of May 9, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024. Formal talks between the two sides commenced on December 23 of last year, aiming to ease the ongoing political tension and instability caused by PTI's protests against alleged electoral rigging and the arrests of its members and leaders.PTI presented its charter of demands during the third round of talks held on Jan 16, giving the government a seven-day timeline to set up two judicial commissions to probe the incidents of May 9, 2023 and Nov 26, 2024.The key demand has become a sticking point, as the government has yet to agree to form the commissions. In response, PTI's incarcerated leader Imran Khan has instructed his party to withdraw from the talks if the demand is not fulfilled.PTI chief Gohar Ali Khan told the media on Monday outside Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail that Khan had directed the negotiating team to withdraw from talks if the judicial commission was not formed within seven days.Khan, 72, has been lodged at the Adiala Jail since mid-2023 in multiple cases.Emphasising that the establishment of the judicial commission was critical for a meaningful dialogue, Gohar said if the government did not move forward on forming the commissions, there was no point in continuing the negotiations.Gohar said there wouldn't be a fourth round of talks if the commissions were not constituted. However, he added that the PTI team would wait for seven days for a response from the government side.On May 9, 2023, violent protests erupted after the arrest of Khan by paramilitary Rangers from the premises of the Islamabad high court. His party workers vandalised a dozen military installations, including the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander house), and the ISI building in Faisalabad. Khan had said he was implicated in the May 9 cases as a result of a ""well-orchestrated plan"" to ""harass"" him for political reasons.On November 13 last year, Khan issued a ""final call"" for nationwide protests on November 26, demanding the restoration of the PTI's electoral mandate, the release of detained party members, and the reversal of the 26th constitutional amendment. Responding to his call, thousands of PTI workers reached Islamabad but faced a crackdown by police, which forcibly dispersed them while arresting more than 1,400.Meanwhile, the government's negotiation committee was mulling over extending its seven-day deadline by another week to submit its response to the PTI demands, said senator Irfan Siddiqui , the spokesperson for the government's negotiation committee.""Currently, the seven parties, included in the government committee, are in the process of mutual consultation and seeking guidance from their respective leaderships,"" Senator Siddiqui posted on X on Monday, adding that ""it may take another week to prepare the final response"".His statement came against the backdrop of several reports that claimed that the government side's response was ready and it had decided not to constitute a judicial commission on the May 9 incident.Siddiqui refuted the reports, terming them ""baseless"" and asserting that there was no truth in the news.PTI has earlier announced to conclude the talks by January 31, however, the deadline is unlikely to be met due to the current differences over the core demands.","The future of negotiations between the government and the opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), remains uncertain due to disagreements over the formation of judicial commissions.

ISLAMABAD: A prisoner swap between the United States and Afghanistan's Taliban freed two Americans in exchange for a Taliban figure imprisoned for life in California on drug trafficking and terrorism charges, officials said Tuesday.The deal came as Joe Biden, who oversaw the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, handed power over to returning President Donald Trump. The Taliban praised the swap as a step toward the ""normalization"" of ties between the US and Afghanistan, but that likely remains a tall order as most countries in the world still don't recognize their rule.The Taliban's foreign ministry in Kabul confirmed the swap, saying two unidentified US citizens had been exchanged for Khan Mohammed, who was sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment in 2008.The family of Ryan Corbett, one American held by the Taliban, confirmed he had been released in a statement. Corbett, who had lived in Afghanistan with his family at the time of the 2021 collapse of the US-backed government, was detained by the Taliban in August 2022 while on a business trip.""Our hearts are filled with overwhelming gratitude and praise to God for sustaining Ryan's life and bringing him back home after what has been the most challenging and uncertain 894 days of our lives,"" the family's statement said. They thanked both Trump and Biden, as well as many government officials, for their efforts in freeing him.Corbett's family also praised the Middle Eastern nation of Qatar ""for their vital role in facilitating Ryan's release, and for their visits to Ryan as the United States' protecting power in Afghanistan."" Energy-rich Qatar, which hosted negotiations between the US and the Taliban over the years, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Both CNN and The New York Times, relying on anonymous US officials, identified the second American released as William McKenty, though no other details have emerged about his identity or what he was doing in Afghanistan.Mohammed, 55, was a prisoner in California after his 2008 conviction. The bureau of prisons early Tuesday listed Mohammed as not being in their custody.Hafiz Zia Ahmad Takal, deputy spokesperson for the foreign ministry, said Mohammed had arrived in Afghanistan and was with his family. There were no immediate plans to celebrate or mark his freedom, Takal added.Mohammed was detained on the battlefield in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province and later taken to the US. A federal jury convicted him on charges of securing heroin and opium that he knew were bound for the United States and, in doing so, assisting terrorism activity.The Justice Department at the time referred to Mohammed as ""a violent jihadist and narcotics trafficker"" who ""sought to kill US soldiers in Afghanistan using rockets."" He was the first person to be convicted on US narco-terrorism laws.Before Biden left office, his administration had been trying to work out a deal to free Corbett as well as George Glezmann and Mahmood Habibi in exchange for Muhammad Rahim, one of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo Bay.Glezmann, an airline mechanic from Atlanta, was taken by the Taliban's intelligence services in December 2022 while traveling through the country. Habibi, an Afghan-American businessman who worked as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecommunications company, also went missing in 2022. The Taliban have denied they have Habibi.Habibi's family welcomed the exchange and said they were confident the Trump administration would make a ""greater effort"" to free him, expressing their frustration with the Biden team.""We know they have evidence my brother is alive and in Taliban hands and it could have been influential in encouraging the Taliban to admit they have him,"" Habibi's brother Ahmed said in a statement shared by the nonprofit Global Reach. ""The Biden NSC (National Security Council) refused to use it. We know Trump is about results and we have faith he will use every tool available to get Mahmood home.""Officials in Washington did not respond to requests for comment early Tuesday after Trump's inauguration the day before.The Taliban called the exchange the result of ""long and fruitful negotiations"" with the US and said it was a good example of solving problems through dialogue.""The Islamic Emirate looks positively at the actions of the United States of America that help the normalization and development of relations between the two countries,"" it said.The Taliban have been trying to make inroads in being recognized, in part to escape the economic tailspin caused by their takeover. Billions in international funds were frozen, and tens of thousands of highly skilled Afghans fled the country and took their money with them.","The Taliban's foreign ministry in Kabul confirmed the swap, saying two unidentified US citizens had been exchanged for Khan Mohammed.

The rest came from around 25 other countries, according to the Global New Light of Myanmar.The article added those responsible were not Myanmar nationals or ordinary foreign civilians but ""fugitive offenders"" who illegally entered Myanmar from neighbouring countries.The junta called on its neighbours to ""participate in combating online scams and online gambling"".AFP has contacted Thai and Chinese authorities for comment.Myanmar's northern border with China was previously a hotbed for online scam centres often run by militias aligned with the ruling junta.But a sweeping offensive by an alliance of ethnic rebels cleared many of the scam centres out.Local Myanmar media have reported that scam bosses who escaped the offensive have since set up shop further south along the border with Thailand.Myanmar's junta and Thai military officials have agreed to ""jointly eradicate online gambling and online scams"", according to Myanmar state media.Bryony Lau, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, on Friday called the compounds ""one of the most pressing regional crises the region is facing"".The Southeast Asian nation has been in turmoil since the military junta ousted democratically elected civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi from office in a 2021 coup.","Myanmar's ruling junta deported to China more than 50,000 people suspected of involvement in online scam operations.

The Taliban government announced on Tuesday the release of Afghan prisoner Khan Mohammad, who had been detained in the United Stated, in exchange for American detainees.

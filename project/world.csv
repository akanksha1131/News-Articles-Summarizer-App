Two separate shootings along a parade route in New Orleans, a city in the US state of Louisiana, on Monday, left two people dead and nine others injured, according to a press release by New Orleans Police Department. The incidents occurred during a ""second line"" celebration in the St Roch neighborhood .""There are two different scenes here. There are two different shooting events. They are 45 minutes apart from each other,"" superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said in a news conference, CNN reported.The first shooting took place shortly after 3:30 pm (local time) on an avenue in the area, where officers found eight victims suffering from gunshot wounds. All were transported to hospitals for treatment, the New Orleans Police Department said in the news release.About 45 minutes later, another report of gunfire came in from the same avenue, approximately one kilometer to the north. One person was pronounced dead at the scene, while another succumbed to injuries at a hospital. A third victim was transported to a hospital and is currently in stable condition.The shootings occurred in the midst of the ""second line"" festivities, which are traditional celebratory parades in New Orleans.","Two separate shootings along a parade route in New Orleans, a city in the US state of Louisiana, left two people dead.

8 killed as Russia launches one of its fiercest missile and drone attacks at Ukraine's infrastructure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/8-killed-blackouts-in-ukraine-as-russia-hits-power-grid-with-120-missiles-90-drones/articleshow/115398674.cms,"KYIV: A Russian strike on a nine-story building in the city of Sumy in northern Ukraine killed eight people and wounded dozens, an official said Sunday, as Russia launched a massive drone and missile attack described by officials as the largest in recent months.Among the eight killed in Sumy, 40 kilometers (24 miles) from the border with Russia, were two children, said Ukraine's Minister of Internal Affairs Ihor Klymenko. More than 400 people were evacuated from the building.The rescuers were checking every apartment looking for people who might be still in the damaged building.""Every life destroyed by Russia is a big tragedy,"" said Klymenko.The drone and missile attack, which targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, came as fears are mounting about Moscow's intentions to devastate Ukraine's power generation capacity ahead of the winter.Also Sunday, President Joe Biden authorized for the first time the use of US-supplied long-range missiles by Ukraine to strike inside Russia, after extensive lobbying by Ukrainian officials.The weapons are likely to be used in response to North Korea's decision to send thousands of troops to support Russia in the Kursk region where Ukraine mounted a military incursion over the summer.It is the second time the US has permitted the use of Western weapons inside Russian territory within limits after permitting the use of HIMARS systems, a shorter-range weapon, to stem Russia's advance in Kharkiv region in May.The first reaction from Ukraine to the long-awaited decision from the US was notably restrained.""Today, much is being said in the media about us receiving permission for the relevant actions. But strikes are not made with words. Such things are not announced. The missiles will speak for themselves,"" said Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his nightly video address.Earlier, Zelenskyy said that Russia had launched a total of 120 missiles and 90 drones in a large-scale attack across Ukraine. Various types of drones were deployed, he said, including Iranian-made Shaheds, as well as cruise, ballistic and aircraft-launched ballistic missiles.Ukrainian defenses shot down 144 out of a total of 210 air targets, Ukraine's air force reported later on Sunday.""The enemy's target was our energy infrastructure throughout Ukraine. Unfortunately, there is damage to objects from hits and falling debris. In Mykolaiv, as a result of a drone attack, two people were killed and six others were injured, including two children,"" Zelenskyy said.Two more people were killed in the Odesa region, where the attack damaged energy infrastructure and disrupted power and water supplies, said local governor Oleh Kiper. Both victims were employees of Ukraine's state-owned power grid operator, Ukrenergo, the company said hours later.The combined drone and missile attack was the most powerful in three months, according to the head of Kyiv's City Military Administration, Serhii Popko.One person was injured after the roof of a five-story residential building caught fire in Kyiv's historic center, according to Popko.A thermal power plant operated by private energy company DTEK was ""seriously damaged,"" the company said.Russian strikes have hammered Ukraine's power infrastructure since Moscow's all-out invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, prompting repeated emergency power shutdowns and nationwide rolling blackouts. Ukrainian officials have routinely urged Western allies to bolster the country's air defenses to counter assaults and allow for repairs.Explosions were heard across Ukraine on Sunday, including in the capital, Kyiv, the key southern port of Odesa, as well as the country's west and central regions, according to local reports.The operational command of Poland's armed forces wrote on X that Polish and allied aircraft, including fighter jets, have been mobilized in Polish airspace because of the ""massive"" Russian attack on neighboring Ukraine. The steps were aimed to provide safety in Poland's border areas, it said.Russia's Defense Ministry on Sunday acknowledged carrying out a ""mass"" missile and drone attack on ""critical energy infrastructure"" in Ukraine, but claimed all targeted facilities were tied to Kyiv's military industry.Although Ukraine's nuclear plants were not directly impacted, several electrical substations on which they depend suffered further damage, the UN's nuclear energy watchdog said in a statement Sunday. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, only two of Ukraine's nine operational reactors continue to generate power at full capacity.Ukrainian drones strike Russia A local journalist died Sunday as Ukrainian drones struck Russia's embattled Kursk region, its Gov. Aleksei Smirnov reported.Moscow's forces have for months strained to dislodge Ukrainian troops from the southern province after a bold incursion in August that constituted the largest attack on Russia since World War II and saw battle-hardened Ukrainian units swiftly take hundreds of square miles (kilometers) of territory.In Russia's Belgorod province, near Ukraine, a man died on the spot after a Ukrainian drone dropped explosives on his car, local Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov reported.Another Ukrainian drone on Sunday targeted a drone factory in Izhevsk, deep inside Russia, according to anti-Kremlin Russian news channels on the Telegram messaging app. The regional leader, Aleksandr Brechalov, reported that a drone exploded near a factory in the city, blowing out windows but causing no serious damage. A man was briefly hospitalized with a head injury, Brechalov said.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says 120 missiles and 90 drones were used in the attack.

""Mr Hegseth is completely innocent,"" he said. ""Not only did she take advantage of him, but we believe she then extorted him knowing that at the height of the #MeToo movement the mere public allegation would likely result in his immediate termination from Fox News.""Parlatore said the woman began making statements about Hegseth that he said were false about two years after the alleged incident and that she had suggested to people that she might file a lawsuit against Hegseth.

The settlement came months after that letter, although the amount was unclear.The Trump team was rocked this past week when a woman sent a memo to the transition claiming her friend had been sexually assaulted by Hegseth. Late on Thursday the Monterey police department in California said it had investigated an allegation of sexual assault involving Hegseth in 2017. No charges were filed.Hegseth was a speaker at a conference of the California Federation of Republican Women at the Monterey hotel in early October 2017 when the encounter occurred.

"Thomas E Kurtz, a creator of BASIC computer language, dies at 96",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/thomas-e-kurtz-a-creator-of-basic-computer-language-dies-at-96/articleshow/115398534.cms,"Thomas E Kurtz , a pioneering mathematician at Dartmouth College and an inventor of the simplified computer programming language known as BASIC, which allowed students to easily operate early computers and eventually propelled generations into the world of personal computing , died Tuesday in Lebanon, New Hampshire. He was 96.The cause of his death, in a hospice, was multiple organ failure from sepsis, said Agnes Kurtz, his wife.In the early 1960s, before the days of laptops and smartphones, a computer was the size of a small car and an institution like Dartmouth, where Kurtz taught, had just one. Programming one was the province of scientists and mathematicians and specialists. Kurtz and John G Kemeny , then the chair of Dartmouth's maths department, believed that students would increasingly come to depend on computers and would benefit from understanding how to use them. ""We had the crazy idea that our students, our undergraduate students who are not going to be technically employed later on, social sciences and humanities students, should learn how to use the computer,"" Kurtz said in an interview in 2014. ""Completely nutty idea.""The two mathematicians created the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System, which allowed multiple users to share the processing power of a single computer simultaneously.But the architecture of a system for sharing resources was not enough. Kurtz and Kemeny also wanted to give students an easier platform for understanding how the computers worked and functioned, and to allow them to code and run their own programs. ""I think we could design a completely different way of using computers that would make it possible to give computer instruction to hundreds of students,"" Kemeny recalled Kurtz saying.Kemeny worked with Kurtz and undergraduate students to develop a novice-friendly and intuitive computer language called BASIC (the name was an acronym for Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code). It was a high-level programming language designed for ease of use, which could be used with the time-sharing system. The language was simple. Typing the command ""RUN"" would start a program. ""PRINT"" printed a word or string of letters. ""STOP"" told program to stop.At 4am on May 1, 1964, in the basement of College Hall on the Dartmouth campus, the time-sharing system and BASIC were put to a test. A professor and a student programmer typed a simple command - ""RUN"" - into neighboring Teletype terminals and watched as both received the same answer simultaneously. It worked.BASIC became the language of choice for students learning programming around the globe. The ability to access a computer and have it process data from multiple users at a single time was revolutionary. Allowing those same computer users to easily write their own programs was even bolder.BASIC would provide the intellectual building blocks for later software and is still a fundamental tool in teaching computer programming. One student who later benefited from BASIC was Bill Gates, who used a variation of it as the foundation for the first Microsoft operating systems. Versions of BASIC still power computer operating systems today.","Thomas E Kurtz, a pioneering mathematician at Dartmouth College, died Tuesday.

The 60-member assembly allegedly faced significant pressure to reach a unanimous decision, including threats from Khamenei and his representatives.Mojtaba Khamenei’s growing influence within the regime has been evident over the past two years. While he has rarely appeared in public, he is recognized for his alleged role in suppressing the 2009 post-election protests. In 2021, he was granted the title of ayatollah, fulfilling the constitutional requirements for the role of Supreme Leader.The Iran International report suggests the decision was kept secret to avoid public backlash. ""The assembly resolved to maintain maximum secrecy over the decision due to fears of widespread public protests,"" it stated, adding that members were warned of severe consequences for any leaks.The reported decision highlights the regime's attempts to strengthen its control as it faces increasing internal and external pressures. The Iranian government has yet to respond to these claims.Sources cited in the report claim Khamenei plans to transfer power to his son while still alive to ensure a smooth transition and avoid opposition.Numerous social media posts circulated on Saturday, alleging that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has fallen into a coma. These claims gained traction shortly after a report by The New York Times in October stated that Khamenei is ""seriously ill.""

It says they had ""intentionally removed their officers from inside the ballroom"" before he was shot and left him even more exposed by arresting his security detail in the days before the event.The family also claims that the agencies engaged in ""fraudulent concealment and cover-up"" after Malcolm X's death by keeping information from his family and hamstringing efforts to identify his killers. Three men were arrested and convicted in the killing. But after spending more than 20 years in prison, two of them - Muhammad A. Aziz and Khalil Islam - were exonerated. (The third, Thomas Hagan, was parolled in 2010.)Malcolm X rose to prominence in the Nation of Islam, the black nationalist group, and became an at times controversial but fiery leader. A year before his killing, he had left the Nation of Islam and started Organisation of Afro-American Unity.On February 21, 1965, as he began to speak about the new group, 3 gunmen rushed the stage and shot him in front of his pregnant wife and three of his daughters. He was 39. For decades, historians cast doubt on official accounts and on guilt of Aziz and Islam. A probe found in 2021 that prosecutors, police and FBI had withheld key evidence at the time.","Malcolm X was shot dead in front of his pregnant wife and three of his daughters in 1965.

"In a policy shift, Biden allows Ukraine to hit Russia with long-range US missiles",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/in-a-policy-shift-biden-allows-ukraine-to-hit-russia-with-long-range-us-missiles/articleshow/115398434.cms,"President Joe Biden has authorised the first use of US-supplied long-range missiles by Ukraine for strikes inside Russia, US officials said.The weapons are likely to be initially employed against Russian and North Korean troops in defence of Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region of western Russia, the officials said.Biden's decision is a major change in US policy. The choice has divided his advisers, and his shift comes two months before President-elect Trump takes office, having vowed to limit further support for Ukraine.Allowing the Ukrainians to use the long-range missiles, known as the Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, came in response to Russia's surprise decision to bring North Korean troops into the fight, officials said. Biden began to ease curbs on the use of US-supplied weapons on Russian soil after Russia launched a cross-border assault in May in the direction of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city.To help the Ukrainians defend Kharkiv, Biden allowed them to use the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, which have a range of about 50 miles (80km), against Russian forces directly across the border. But Biden did not allow the Ukrainians to use longer-range ATACMS, which have a range of about 190 miles (145km), in defence of Kharkiv.While the officials said they do not expect the shift to fundamentally alter the course of the war, one of the goals of the policy change, they said, is to send a message to the North Koreans that their forces are vulnerable and that they should not send more of them. The officials said that while the Ukrainians were likely to use the missiles first against Russian and North Korean troops that threaten Ukrainian forces in Kursk, Biden could authorise them to use the weapons elsewhere.Some US officials said they feared that Ukraine's use of the missiles across the border could prompt President Putin to retaliate with force against the US and its coalition partners. But other US officials said they thought those fears were overblown.The Russian military is set to launch a major assault by an estimated 50,000 soldiers, including North Korean troops, on dug-in Ukrainian positions in Kursk with the goal of retaking all of the Russian territory that the Ukrainians seized in Aug. The Ukrainians could use the ATACMS missiles to strike Russian and North Korean troop concentrations, key pieces of military equipment, logistics nodes, ammunition depots and supply lines deep inside Russia. Doing so could help the Ukrainians blunt the effectiveness of Russian-North Korean assault.Earlier, some Pentagon officials opposed giving ATACMS to the Ukrainians because they said the US army had limited supplies. Some White House officials feared that Putin would widen the war if they gave the missiles to the Ukrainians. Supporters of a more aggressive posture toward Moscow say Biden and his advisers have been too easily intimidated by Putin's hostile rhetoric.","Biden's decision is a major change in US policy.

Trump previously expressed interest in revoking licences of broadcasters like NBC and CBS for what he deemed unfair coverage.At age 45, Carr authored an FCC chapter in the conservative Project 2025 blueprint, advocating for oversight of major technology firms including Apple, Meta, Google and Microsoft.""The censorship cartel must be dismantled,"" Carr said recently on X.Legal experts suggest Carr could significantly alter the independent agency's scope, potentially using it as a conservative policy instrument. They anticipate he will explore regulatory boundaries by attempting to oversee social media companies, likely sparking conflict with Silicon Valley.Jessica Gonzalez of Free Press criticised Carr's approach, ""He's proposed to do a lot of things he has no jurisdiction to do and in other cases he's blatantly misreading the rules.""Trump praised Carr, ""Commissioner Carr is a warrior for free speech, and has fought against the regulatory lawfare that has stifled Americans' freedoms, and held back our economy.""Carr's authority will face limitations. The FTC and justice department maintain primary oversight of technology regulation through antitrust enforcement and consumer protection measures.Congressional approval would likely be necessary to expand FCC jurisdiction over social media platforms, as they aren't classified as communications services. The commission would comprise three Republicans and two Democrats under Trump.The FCC cannot penalise broadcasters for editorial decisions, except regarding obscenity and children's programming violations.Nevertheless, experts note Carr could influence companies through his position, potentially scrutinising mergers and investigating regulatory breaches.Blair Levin, former FCC chief of staff, observed, ""Brendan is by far the most talented politician on the commission right now. But the real question is what can he actually do with the authorities the FCC has now.""A telecommunications lawyer, Carr earned his law degree from Catholic University in Washington. He joined the FCC as legal adviser in 2012, becoming general counsel five years later.Trump appointed him to a Republican commission seat in 2017. Carr championed rural high-speed wireless internet and supported deregulation, including net neutrality rollbacks under Ajit Pai. Democrats recently reinstated these rules, now facing legal challenges.Post-election, Carr said, ""When the transition is complete, the FCC will have an important role to play reining in Big Tech, ensuring that broadcasters operate in the public interest, and unleashing economic growth while advancing our national security interests and supporting law enforcement.""Carr has demonstrated support for Elon Musk, a Trump ally. Musk's Starlink received an $885 million FCC rural internet grant in 2020, later revoked by Democrats in 2022 for failing to meet requirements.Carr opposed this decision, writing in The Wall Street Journal: ""In my view, it amounted to nothing more than regulatory lawfare against one of the left's top targets: Mr. Musk.""","Brendan Carr, a current commissioner, is anticipated to transform the traditionally reserved agency.

A top education official in the US state of Oklahoma is facing criticism after ordering public schools to show students a video promoting a new department of religious freedom and patriotism .State superintendent Ryan Walters , a Republican, announced the department on Wednesday, claiming it will address attacks on religious liberty and patriotism by “woke teachers' unions.” The new office will operate under the state's department of education.On Thursday, Walters emailed school superintendents demanding they show his video announcement to all students and send it to parents.“In one of the first steps of the newly created department, we are requiring all of Oklahoma schools to play the attached video to all kids that are enrolled,” the email read.In the video, Walters claims that religious liberty has been attacked and patriotism mocked ""by woke teachers unions ,"" before praying for US leaders.“In particular, I pray for President Donald Trump and his team as they continue to bring about change to the country,” Walters said in the video.He further said that students are not required to participate in the prayer.According to Walters , the new department will “oversee the investigation of abuses to individual religious freedom or displays of patriotism.”Two of Oklahoma's largest school districts, Edmond and Bixby, have said they will not show the video. Oklahoma City Public Schools is reviewing the matter.Oklahoma attorney general Gentner Drummond’s office declared Walters’ mandate unlawful.“Not only is this edict unenforceable, it is contrary to parents’ rights, local control, and individual free-exercise rights,” the statement read.This is not the first time Walters' actions have drawn legal challenges.

The Archdiocese of New York has announced layoffs affecting 18 administrative staff members as part of efforts to address financial difficulties, partly due to the ongoing sex abuse scandal within the Catholic Church. The job cuts represent a 4% reduction in the workforce.Cardinal Timothy Dolan , in a letter to the archdiocese, said, as quoted by the New York Post, “Such decisions are never easy, but the current financial crunch the archdiocese faces, and the upcoming move to our new offices in 2025, make this the appropriate time to make some tough decisions.”The layoffs are expected to save the archdiocese over $1.5 million annually. This comes after the recent sale of the Cardinal Cooke headquarters building in Midtown Manhattan for over $100 million. The archdiocese plans to relocate its administrative offices to a smaller building on Madison Avenue.Dolan acknowledged that the staff reduction ""is not a one-time event,"" indicating the possibility of further job cuts. He stressed that the archdiocese aims to prioritize resources for its parishes, saying, “Our goal in all of this is to ensure that we are responding as effectively as possible to the needs of the people we are called upon to serve in the ten counties and nearly 300 parishes that make up this archdiocese.""The financial strain from numerous sex abuse lawsuits against the Church remains a significant concern, according to Dolan. The archdiocese is currently in a legal dispute with its insurer over the coverage of some claims.“We have worked hard to settle meritorious cases not covered by insurance, in justice to the victims of years past,” wrote Dolan. He stressed the ongoing financial burden of addressing over 400 cases through an independent compensation program, along with an additional 123 cases stemming from the Child Victims Act of 2019.Dolan indicated that proceeds from the headquarters sale will help ease the financial strain from the sex abuse crisis, with the potential sale of other properties also being considered. He stressed the need for ""strategy and sacrifice,"" along with support from parishes and the community, to ensure long-term financial stability.Despite these challenges, the archdiocese plans to use some of the savings to provide grants to parishes, especially for initiatives such as special masses for immigrant communities, according to the New York Post.",The Archdiocese of New York has announced layoffs affecting 18 administrative staff members.

I actually think the final margin would have gotten worse, not better. There would have been another debate and further campaign stumbles. Biden’s fundraising was completely drying up. And like Harris, Biden might have slightly underperformed his polls on Election Day.

The firewall was deployed as Pakistani military faced severe online criticism for its alleged role in keeping former PM Imran Khan behind bars, while his party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, continued to face a harsh crackdown. The military, which denies interference in politics, has recently begun using the term ""digital terrorists"" to describe online critics.VPN usage has surged in Pakistan as users seek access to X (formerly Twitter), a platform blocked since February, along with numerous other websites. Authorities also claim that VPN software is being used to bypass restrictions on pornographic content.PTA said it had streamlined the VPN registration process for organizations and freelancers. Entities such as software houses, call centres, banks, embassies, and freelancers can now register their VPNs online through the PTA’s official website. The registration process is divided into four distinct categories: companies, freelancers, call centres, and video conferencing.""To date, more than 20,000 companies and freelancers have successfully registered their VPNs through this efficient process,"" PTA said in a statement on Saturday.According to PTA, the registration process involves completing an online form and providing basic details, including the national identity card number, company registration details, and taxpayer status. Freelancers must also submit proof of their association with a project or company, such as a letter or email confirmation.Also, applicants will need to provide an IP address for VPN connectivity. A fixed IP address can be obtained through internet service providers.After interior ministry circulated its letter calling for the VPN ban, Council of Islamic Ideology, a constitutional advisory body tasked with ensuring laws align with Islamic principles, declared VPN usage to be ""un-Islamic"" in a statement issued the same day.“The government and the state have the authority, from an Islamic perspective, to prevent all actions that lead to wrongdoing or facilitate it,” council’s chairman, Raghib Hussain Naeemi, was quoted as saying.

This information was shared by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf ( PTI ) American Wing on X platform, highlighting that representatives from both Republican and Democratic parties participated in this initiative, jointly led by Susan Wild and John James.PTI highlighted that the letter criticised US Ambassador Donald Blome 's performance, particularly his inability to address Pakistani American community's concerns regarding political prisoners' release, human rights restoration, and democratic principles.According to Geo News, Pakistan rejected the resolution, stating it demonstrated an incomplete grasp of Pakistan's political situation and electoral process. The lawmakers referenced H. Res. 901 , emphasising bipartisan support for policy change regarding human rights violations in Pakistan following the February 2024 elections, which they described as flawed.The American legislators expressed concerns about widespread electoral irregularities, including PTI's disenfranchisement and result manipulation. They criticised the mass arrests, arbitrary detentions, and social media restrictions, including internet speed reduction.The lawmakers particularly highlighted Khan's detention since August 2023, noting his status as ""widely perceived to be Pakistan's most popular political figure"". They also mentioned the prolonged detention of PTI leaders like Yasmin Rashid and Shah Mehmood Qureshi.This congressional letter follows a previous appeal by 60 US House Representatives seeking Khan's release.

Pakistan air pollution: Toxic smog sends over 1.9 million to hospitals in a month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-air-pollution-toxic-smog-sends-over-1-9-million-to-hospitals-in-a-month/articleshow/115383474.cms,"Over 1.91 million people with respiratory illnesses have been admitted to government hospitals in Pakistan over the past month, highlighting the devastating impact of toxic air pollution in the country. The crisis has particularly affected Pakistan's Punjab province, where smog and hazardous air quality levels have created a public health emergency.Hospitals across Punjab have been overwhelmed, with Lahore recording the highest number of cases. Toxic smog forced over 75,000 people to seek medical help on a single day, further straining the healthcare system. Over the past month, Lahore alone reported 133,429 respiratory disease cases, including 5,577 asthma patients. Additionally, 5,455 of the 13,862 heart disease cases and 491 of the 5,141 stroke cases in the province were treated in Lahore. The crisis escalated in the past week, with 449,045 respiratory cases reported, along with 30,146 asthma cases, 2,225 heart disease patients, and 1,400 stroke victims.The government has taken several emergency measures, including closing schools, colleges, and parks, limiting market hours, and imposing bans on polluting vehicles and industrial activities. Despite these steps, air quality in cities like Lahore and Multan continues to deteriorate. Lahore’s Air Quality Index (AQI) consistently exceeds hazardous levels, often surpassing 1,000, while Multan recently recorded an alarming AQI of over 2,000.Residents are struggling to cope with the smog’s health impacts. For many, staying indoors offers little relief, and air purifiers remain unaffordable luxuries. Public and private schools have been ordered to close until November 24, with authorities also enforcing a three-day lockdown in Lahore and Multan to mitigate pollution. However, these measures have brought limited respite.Healthcare workers are stretched to their limits. Doctors report a significant increase in patients, particularly children and the elderly, suffering from breathing difficulties, coughing fits, and eye irritation. “This year, smog levels are much worse, and the number of affected patients is far greater,” said Dr Qurat ul Ain, a medical practitioner in Lahore. She advises residents to wear masks and avoid outdoor exposure.The smog’s primary causes include industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and seasonal agricultural stubble burning, exacerbated by stagnant weather conditions. Climate activist Alia Haider described the city as “stuck in its own poison” and criticised the lack of effective long-term solutions. As smog continues to blanket Pakistan’s major cities, millions remain at risk, awaiting meaningful action to address the worsening environmental crisis.","Over 1.91 million people with respiratory illnesses have been admitted to government hospitals in Pakistan over the past month.

While it has revolutionised access to information, it has also facilitated the proliferation of disinformation and hate speech. He warned that without robust laws to regulate online content, the consequences could be dire.“False and misleading information poses a major challenge. Without comprehensive laws, hate speech and misinformation will continue to destabilise societies,” he said.The general’s comments come as Pakistan grapples with increasing misuse of social media platforms.

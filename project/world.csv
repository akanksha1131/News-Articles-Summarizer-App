‘Digital tokens’ to tourist resorts: What is US planning for post-war Gaza?

The proposed plan







US President Donald Trump’s administration is considering a post-war Gaza plan under which the US would oversee the enclave for at least a decade, relocate its residents, and redevelop the area into a tourist destination and manufacturing hub, the Washington Post reported on Sunday.The proposal is named the “Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration, and Transformation Trust (GREAT Trust) and was drafted by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).The GHF works with the Israeli forces and private US security and logistics firms to deliver food into the beseiged Gaza Strip. GHF is backed by both the Trump administration and Israel and is preferred over the UN-led system that Israel claims allows militants to divert supplies, as per Reuters.As per a 38-page prospectus, Gaza’s 2 million residents would be required to leave temporarily, either through “voluntary” relocation abroad or by moving into designated restricted zones within the territory during reconstruction, reported the Post.The landowners would reportedly receive “digital tokens” granting rights to redevelop their property, while Palestinians who left would be given $5,000 in cash, rent subsidies for four years, and food support for one year.The report noted that financial planning for the project was handled by a team from the Boston Consulting Group.Under the administration’s vision, Gaza would be redeveloped into a tourist resort as well as a hub for high-tech manufacturing and technology. Two sources who are familiar with the planning said that the key aspects of the proposal were curated to realize Trump’s vision of a “Rivera of the Middle East.”Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff expressed confidence that the war in Gaza could be resolved in four months.""We're going to settle this one way or another, certainly before the end of this year,"" he said in an interview with Fox News last week.When asked about a “post-war plan” in the war-battered Gaza Strip, Witkoff said, ""It's a very comprehensive plan we're putting together on the next day that I think many people are going to... see how robust it is and how it's how well meaning it is, and it reflects President Trump's humanitarian motives here.""A proposal to establish large-scale camps, called ""Humanitarian Transit Areas,"" within Gaza, and potentially outside, to accommodate the Palestinian population, was previously reported on by Reuters.No Arab state has so far agreed to take part in governing Gaza after the war. The Israeli army says it currently controls roughly 75 percent of Gaza, though most of the territory’s 2 million residents have been displaced repeatedly over the past 22 months.Meanwhile, in the West Bank, the Israeli government has approved 3,400 settlement homes in a project that finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, a hard-line coalition partner, described as proof that the “idea of a Palestinian state is being erased from the table.”","US President Donald Trump’s administration is considering a post-war Gaza plan under which the US would oversee the enclave for at least a decade.

CAIRNS: Three Scottish brothers stepped ashore in Australia on Saturday after claiming a new record for rowing non-stop and unsupported across the Pacific Ocean, ""over the moon"" to be back on dry land.Ewan, Jamie and Lachlan MacLean set off in a carbon fibre dinghy from Lima in Peru in April for the 14,500 kilometres journey, enduring violent storms and sickness during their 139 days at sea.At one point Ewan was swept overboard before being pulled back into the boat, while they battled exhaustion and feared running out of food. ""The fastest human-powered crossing of the full Pacific Ocean, non-stop and unsupported,"" they said on social media after arriving in Cairns. ""After 139 days at sea, we are over the moon to be back on land with our friends and family,"" they added.The brothers, from Edinburgh, were given a bagpipe welcome in front of family and friends after the treacherous ordeal, which garnered support from celebrities including Mark Wahlberg and Ewan McGregor. ""Things got tough towards the end and we seriously thought we might run out of food,"" said middle brother Jamie.""Despite how exhausted we were, we had to step up a gear and make it before supplies ran out, but now we get to eat proper food. ""While the mid-Pacific - from California to Hawaii - is well travelled, relatively few have attempted the full Pacific from South America to Australia. Lithuanian solo rower Aurimas Mockus had to abandon his crossing attempt this year due to Tropical Cyclone Alfred. ""This has been the hardest thing I've ever done, and I couldn't have even contemplated it without my brothers,"" said Ewan. ""There have been countless setbacks to overcome, some leaving us lost, but we've always lifted each other up. ""Days before landing in Cairns, brothers said they had to battle currents off the coast. ""We're going to be rowing three up as we navigate through the Great Barrier Reef and away from shipping lanes, all while fighting against horrendous winds,"" they said.The brothers were raising money for clean water projects in Madagascar.

Haunting Yearbook Photo Emerges of Minnesota Mass Shooter Robin Westman Living as a Woman





Weeks before a gunman opened fire at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, killing two children and injuring 18 others, the Trump administration cut funding for a Minnesota program intended to prevent acts of mass violence, according to documents cited by the New York Times.In July, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced $18.5 million in spending cuts from the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3).About $700,000 of that funding had been allocated to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety (DPS) for roles aimed at preventing targeted violence and terrorism.DPS Commissioner Bob Jacobson wrote to the state’s congressional delegation at the time that “without this funding, our capacity to protect our communities from targeted violence and terrorism will be significantly diminished.”DPS spokesperson Jill Oliveira was quoted as saying by the New York Times that since the cuts, the agency had cancelled a statewide training conference and redirected resources to cover costs.Previous CP3 funding, she said, supported training for law enforcement, schools, and faith institutions in threat prevention.The Trump administration argued the program was misused. In its letter to Minnesota authorities, DHS said CP3 grants were “no longer in line” with its priorities, citing immigration enforcement, border security and combating antisemitism.A Homeland Security official said in a statement that CP3 had been used for “left-wing ideologies and did next to nothing to combat actual threats.” The official also said that many grants had gone to groups that “celebrated and encouraged transgenderism in children,” a remark that drew criticism from Democrats.The cuts also impacted the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office, which had received about $100,000 for multidisciplinary threat-assessment work, according to CNN. A former DHS employee told the outlet the Minneapolis attack was “100% preventable. This was exactly the kind of event we could have stopped.”The assailant, Robin Westman, left behind journals expressing surprise at evading detection. “Should be harder for people like me to carry out these attacks,” he wrote, as reported by CNN.In one journal entry, he wrote, “I have been showing signs for a while. I need to be stopped! … If I did something, they would say it was obvious in hindsight.”Jacob Ware, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, was quoted as saying by CNN that “the capacity to combat domestic terrorism is eroding. It seems like the focus on prevention has slipped in this country.”Minnesota lawmakers criticised the decision. Sen. Tina Smith said, “This shooting was horrific, and to think we had a strategy in place aimed at preventing this type of violence is tragic.”Rep. Betty McCollum added that cancelling the grant “limits our state law enforcement from access to vital federal counterterrorism partners and resources and leaves Minnesota communities more vulnerable.”The attack followed an earlier June assassination plot that killed a state representative and her husband and wounded a senator and his wife, events that further fuel concerns about weakened prevention efforts.After the shooting, US First Lady Melania Trump urged more proactive measures, posting on X, “To prevent future tragedies, it is crucial we look into behavioural threat assessments across all levels of society … Being aware of these warning signs and acting quickly can save lives and make American communities safer.”","In July, the Department of Homeland Security announced $18.5 million in spending cuts from the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3) About $700,000 of that funding had been allocated to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety for roles aimed at preventing targeted violence and terrorism.

The bruise that wouldn’t fade

Makeup, cameras, and awkward excuses

The ankle twist

Experts weigh in





A bruise on the hand of a 79-year-old man wouldn’t normally make headlines, unless that man is Donald Trump, the president who campaigned in 2024 on being sharper, stronger, and healthier than Joe Biden What began as a curious blotch on his hand has spiraled into months of speculation, with the White House offering shifting explanations that have only deepened doubts about Trump’s health.The saga began on February 24, 2025, when a Getty photographer snapped Trump greeting French President Emmanuel Macron.The close-up revealed a dark bruise smeared with makeup, clumsily concealed but unmistakable.Observers soon realized the mark had been visible as far back as spring 2024, when Trump himself dismissed it as the byproduct of “overzealous handshakes.”“A woman gripped my hand so hard, the Secret Service had to step in,” Trump told the Washington Examiner in 2024. He repeated the story to Time magazine later that year.But as the bruise lingered into 2025, the explanation began to unravel.By summer, Trump was regularly spotted with mismatched concealer caked on his hand.A C-SPAN cameraman zoomed in on the blotchy makeup during a July press event, sparking fresh scrutiny.The White House doubled down, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling the bruise nothing more than “soft tissue irritation” from endless handshakes and daily aspirin.Then came the curveball. At the FIFA Club World Cup Final in New Jersey on July 13, Trump was photographed with swollen ankles. Days later, the White House abandoned the handshake defense and admitted the president had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a vascular condition common in older adults that hampers blood flow from the legs to the heart.Trump’s doctor, Sean Barbabella, assured reporters there was “no evidence of heart failure or serious illness.” But crucial details about treatment remain undisclosed, with Leavitt insisting, “You see the president every day, he’s working, he’s moving, he’s continuing.”Not everyone is convinced the story adds up. Dr Peter Henke, a former chair of the American Heart Association’s vascular council, told New York Magazine that the bruising on Trump’s hand is “unrelated to venous insufficiency.” Instead, Henke suggested, aspirin use could explain the unusual bruising.The White House has not allowed Dr Barbabella to face questions directly, despite earlier promising transparency.","Donald Trump, 79, was photographed with a bruise on his hand in February 2025.

US President Donald Trump announced plans on late Saturday to issue an executive order that would make voter identification mandatory and restrict mail-in voting.“Voter ID must be part of every single vote. No exceptions! I will be doing an executive order to that end!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.He added, “Also, No Mail-In Voting, except for those that are very ill, and the far away military. Use paper ballots only!!!”.The post builds on Trump’s repeated pledges to overhaul US voting systems. A few days ago, he said the order was being prepared “by the best lawyers in the country” to eliminate mail-in ballots, reported The New York Times.Trump argued that Republicans needed to “get tough and stop it” because, in his view, Democrats benefited disproportionately from the practice.Mail-in and absentee voting accounted for just over 30 per cent of ballots in the 2024 elections, according to news agency AFP. Although Trump and his allies have repeatedly claimed the system is open to fraud, experts and officials have stressed there is no evidence postal voting is less secure than in-person voting.Pro-democracy groups have also warned that scrapping it could disenfranchise millions of Americans, particularly those with disabilities or other barriers to reaching polling places.Constitutionally, the president does not have the authority to unilaterally change election rules. The power to regulate the “times, places and manner” of elections lies with state legislatures, and only Congress can override those laws. As The New York Times noted, any executive order targeting mail-in ballots or voting procedures would face immediate legal challenges.Trump has previously relied on absentee voting himself, including during Florida’s 2020 primaries. His critics argue the push to end mail-in voting is politically motivated, pointing out that Democrats have historically outnumbered Republicans in using postal ballots.","US President Donald Trump announced plans on late Saturday to issue an executive order that would make voter ID mandatory and restrict mail-in voting.

WASHINGTON: The Trump administration is advancing plans to rename the department of defence as the department of war, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday, citing a White House official, after President Donald Trump raised the prospect on Monday. Restoring the department of war name for the govt’s largest department would likely require congressional action, but the White House is exploring alternative methods to implement the change, the report said.Republican Representative Greg Steube of Florida filed an amendment to the annual defence policy bill that would change the name of the department, indicating some Republican support in Congress for the change.The White House gave no details. “As President Trump said, our military should be focused on offence – not just defence – which is why he has prioritized warfighters at the Pentagon instead of DEI and woke ideology. Stay tuned!” said White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly.Trump raised the idea of rebranding while speaking with reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, saying it “just sounded to me better.” “It used to be called the department of war and it had a stronger sound,” Trump said.The war department became the department of defence through a gradual process, beginning with the National Security Act of 1947, which unified the Army, Navy, and Air Force under a single organization called the National Military Establishment. An amendment to the law passed in 1949 officially introduced the name “department of defence.”","Wall Street Journal: Trump administration advancing plans to rename department of defence as department of war.

WASHINGTON: The 22-year-old philosophy student from China did not expect any problems after his 29-hour flight arrived at a Texas airport this month as he was on his way to study at the University of Houston.His paperwork was in order. He was going to study humanities - not a tech field that might raise suspicions. He had a full scholarship from a US school and had previously spent a semester at Cornell University for an exchange program with no issues.But the student, who asked to be identified only by his family name, Gu, because of the political sensitivities of the matter, was stopped, interrogated and 36 hours later, put on a plane back to China. He was also banned from coming back for five years, abruptly halting his dream for an academic career in the US. ""There is no opportunity for the life I had expected,"" Gu said.He is one of an unknown number of Chinese students with permission to enter the US who have been sent back to China or faced intense questioning after their arrival, drawing strong protests from Beijing and showing the uncertainty from President Donald Trump's shifting policies.His administration has quickly pivoted from a plan to revoke visas for Chinese students to Trump himself saying he would welcome hundreds of thousands of them, partly to help keep some American schools afloat. The US has put restrictions on Chinese students.Even so, some officials and lawmakers have expressed suspicions about Chinese students, especially those who study advanced technologies and their possible links to the Chinese govt and military. Some lawmakers want to ban Chinese students altogether.The Chinese embassy said it has received reports involving more than 10 Chinese students and scholars being interrogated, harassed and repatriated when entering the US.

Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday that the Trump administration is considering expanding immigration enforcement operations to more US cities.""We haven't taken anything off the table,"" Noem said on CBS News’ Face the Nation when asked about the possibility of widening immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) activities.""I think there's a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now. And so, we haven't taken anything off the table. We've been making sure that we have the resources and the equipment to go in.""According to CBS News, ICE is planning to expand its operations to Chicago in the coming days, mirroring immigration arrest drives earlier this year in Los Angeles.Noem confirmed there have been ""ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states,"" and added, ""we do intend to add more resources to those operations.""While she declined to share details for security reasons, Noem stressed: ""We will continue to go after the worst of the worst across the country, like President Trump has told us to do.""The Trump administration has recently intensified its focus on cities with ""sanctuary"" policies, filing lawsuits against jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration agents. The White House has also linked immigration enforcement to its broader push to reduce violent crime in major cities.Earlier this month, Trump federalized Washington DC’s metropolitan police department and deployed the national guard there. A similar deployment in Los Angeles in June had sparked a legal challenge from California’s Democratic governor.On the question of whether the national guard could also be used in Chicago, Noem said the decision rests solely with the President. CBS News reported that current immigration enforcement plans are separate from Trump’s threat to deploy the Guard to Chicago to tackle crime.Illinois Governor JB Pritzker criticised the administration’s approach, calling it “dangerous” and “un-American.”""We have people that have lived, yes in the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago for decades, working here, paying taxes,"" Pritzker said. ""They're law abiding members of our communities, friends, neighbors, and why are we arresting them?

Was never ‘stranded’ on ISS: Sunita Williams,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/was-never-stranded-on-iss-sunita-williams/articleshow/123622130.cms,"



MUMBAI: Indian-American astronaut Sunita Williams , who returned to Earth on March 18 this year after an extended nine-month stay at the International Space Station (ISS), denied she and fellow astronaut Butch Wilmore were ever “stranded” up there.None other than US President Donald Trump had said that the duo was stranded.In a Nasa podcast recorded Aug 5 and posted on the agency website on Saturday, Williams also joked about holding the ""world record for peeing in 10 different spacecraft"" — including the space shuttle, two Soyuz spacecraft, the Boeing Starliner and SpaceX’s Dragon.While at the ISS, Williams said she and Wilmore had faith in the system and were confident about returning, not once feeling abandoned.“No, we weren’t stranded... It wasn’t like people forgot about us at all...” she said, attributing the duo’s safe homecoming to several people working diligently on the ground, “trying to understand the problem... and give us seats in the meantime... and figure out the final solution to get us back”.Speaking about the future scenario, Williams said Nasa was focused on going back to the moon. “Part of going to the moon is vertical landing, and you want to control it... We are bringing in helicopters here at Johnson Space Centre for this vertical perception landing training,” she said, confirming her involvement in the project.","Indian-American astronaut Sunita Williams denied she and fellow astronaut Butch Wilmore were ever “stranded” up there.

Minneapolis shooting: Omar rebukes Gorka over transgender focus; 'Not moment to point fingers',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/minneapolis-shooting-omar-rebukes-gorka-over-transgender-focus-not-moment-to-point-fingers/articleshow/123618245.cms,"



Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) on Sunday accused White House official Sebastian Gorka of trying to “deflect from the reality” of the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting by highlighting the transgender identity of gunman Robin Westman.Appearing on CNN, Gorka, who serves as President Trump’s deputy assistant and senior director for counterterrorism, called the mass shooting “terrorism,” citing Westman’s antisemitic, anti-Israel manifesto and threats against Trump, New York Post reported.He argued the massacre fit into a troubling “pattern” of mass shootings involving transgender or nonbinary perpetrators, pointing to several high-profile cases in recent years.In Minneapolis school mass shooting, Westman opened gunfire at the Annunciation Catholic School earlier this week — where two students were killed and more than a dozen other children and adults were injured while they prayed at Mass.The White House official argued that the massacre perpetrated by Westman, who confessed he was “‘tired of being trans,” is part of a disturbing trend of mass shootings committed by people struggling with their gender identity.“In just a couple of years, we have seen seven mass shootings involving people of transgender nature or who are confused in their gender identity,” Gorka claimed. “That is inordinately high.” “It’s not about the sexual proclivities of the individual. It’s the fact that nobody seems to notice a very disturbing pattern towards violence,” he later added.Gorka claimed at least seven recent mass shootings have been committed by people who are transgender or struggling with their gender identity.Additionally, a 2019 shooting at a Denver-area high school involved one transgender attacker, and a 2018 shooting at a Rite Aid distribution centre in Aberdeen, Maryland, also involved a transgender gunman.Omar, who followed Gorka on CNN’s Sunday show, criticised the White House official for bringing up Westman’s gender identity. “It’s really unfortunate that we have people, you know, like him, speaking on this,” the far-left congresswoman told host Brianna Keilar.“He talked about their transgenderness, and then he says that shouldn’t really matter,” Omar continued. “These people are all over the place because they want to deflect from the reality.” She continued, “which is that, there was, someone who came into that school, through the window, and assassinated two beautiful angels, as they prayed.”“This is not the moment to point fingers,” Omar argued, as she called for banning assault weapons and more resources to address mental health issues in response to the shooting.When asked if Westman’s transgender identity should be investigated as a potential motive for the shooting, the “Squad” rep said it should, along with everything else. “I’ve always said it’s really important for us to look at every factor, so that we can understand what happened, what signs were missed and have the ability in the future to prevent these kinds of senseless deaths,” Omar responded.","Rep.

Trump's federal job cuts: Black women hit hardest; experts say 'this is stark warning',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-federal-job-cuts-black-women-hit-hardest-experts-say-this-is-stark-warning/articleshow/123618299.cms,"Representative AI image

'It was like being prosecuted'



'Reversing years of strides' says White House



'This is a stark warning'



Targeted cuts in key agencies







When US President Donald Trump began dismantling federal agencies and removing civil servants earlier this year, many thought their position would be safe.Black women make up about 12% of the federal workforce, nearly double their share in the overall US labor force. For generations, federal jobs provided a path to the middle class for Black Americans who faced widespread discrimination in the private sector, the New York Times reported.After the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the federal government aggressively pursued affirmative action and enforced anti-discrimination laws. These measures opened doors to stable careers, fairer pay, and advancement opportunities.Now, economists and advocates warn, those gains are being rolled back.Peggy Carr, a veteran of 35 years at the Department of Education, had risen to become commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, the first Black woman to hold the post.Her career had stretched across six administrations, including Trump’s first term, earning her respect from Republicans and Democrats alike.Surely, she thought, her office, responsible for tracking the nation’s student achievement would not be considered, in Trump’s words, ""divisive and harmful"" or ""woke.""But she was wrong. One February afternoon, a security guard appeared at her office just as she prepared to lead a staff meeting. Within minutes, her stunned colleagues watched in tears as she was escorted out of the building.""It was like being prosecuted in front of my family -- my work family,"" Carr recalled in an interview, the New York Times reported.""It was like I was being taken out like the trash, the only difference is I was being taken out the front door rather than the back door,"" she added.Her dismissal was part of a sweeping drive by Trump to shrink the federal workforce. Tens of thousands have already lost their jobs under his approach.But experts say Black employees and Black women in particular, are bearing the brunt.The White House defends Trump’s overhaul as necessary reform. In July, the Supreme Court cleared the way for mass dismissals across federal agencies.Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, framed the changes as part of a return to merit. ""President Trump is ushering in an economy that will empower all Americans, just as it did during his first term,"" Fields said.He stated that ""the obsession with divisive DEI initiatives reverses years of strides toward genuine equality."" ""The policies of the past that artificially bloated the public sector with wasteful jobs are over,"" he noted.""The Trump administration is committed to advancing policies that improve the lives of all Americans,"" he added.But labour economists paint a very different picture.Between February and July, Black women lost 319,000 jobs across the public and private sectors, according to an analysis by gender economist Katica Roy.They were the only major female demographic to experience steep losses during the five-month period.By contrast, white women gained 142,000 jobs, Hispanic women added 176,000, and white men saw the largest increase at 365,000.""Black women are the canaries in the coal mine, the exclusion happens to them first,"" Roy said.""And if any other cohort thinks it's not coming for them, they're wrong. This is a warning, and it's a stark one,"" Roy added.The trend has extended beyond government jobs. With Trump’s vocal opposition to diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, many corporations have rolled back their DEI initiatives and eliminated related roles — positions where Black women were heavily represented.According to NYT, the Education Department, where Carr worked, was among the first agencies to feel the squeeze in Trump’s second term.More than a quarter of its workforce was Black women. In the initial wave of firings, dozens lost jobs, even those with no connection to DEI programs.Their only exposure to such initiatives came through trainings encouraged by their managers, including Trump’s former education secretary, Betsy DeVos.A report by the National Women’s Law Center, using Office of Personnel Management data later deleted from public records, found that the hardest-hit agencies were those employing high percentages of women and people of color. Independent agencies such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission also faced deep reductions.According to a New York Times analysis, agencies where minorities and women formed the majority, including the Department of Education and USAID, were targeted for either the largest workforce cuts or elimination. At the IRS, where Black women made up nearly a quarter of the workforce, reductions were also severe.Beyond the rank and file, Trump has also moved aggressively to remove high-profile Black leaders. Many have been disparaged by the administration as ""incompetent,"" ""corrupt,"" or DEI appointees.","Black women make up about 12% of the federal workforce, nearly double their share in the overall US labor force.

Pakistan’s flagship social safety programme, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), is once again under fire for corruption, with the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) uncovering large-scale graft involving its own employees. According to audit findings, as many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million, local media reported on Sunday.Citing the AGP’s revelations,said the rot runs through every level of the bureaucracy. What was envisioned as a lifeline for the country’s poorest has been consistently hollowed out by systemic fraud and abuse. And the Rs 37 million loss, auditors warn, may only scratch the surface.Just months earlier, audit reports for FY24 exposed irregularities worth Rs 141 billion in BISP, ranging from payments to ineligible beneficiaries to bogus biometric verifications and even funds being transferred to the accounts of deceased individuals.“In effect, those entrusted with administering aid to the poor are instead perpetuating poverty,” the report noted.The AGP findings also highlight the involvement of not just BISP employees but also banks and retailers, some of whom were caught illegally skimming fees from beneficiaries using BISP cards. Despite being identified, several perpetrators reportedly “escaped criminal charges despite being caught red-handed and named publicly,”reported.The culture of impunity, it added, remains entrenched. “Even if guilty officials are prosecuted and terminated, recent history has shown that the fear of consequences has not particularly slowed corruption in most government departments, and BISP is no different.”The report stressed that the system’s checks must be tightened: “Controls need to be more proactive, including transparent biometric systems, stricter verification processes and independent monitoring mechanisms.”With BISP catering to roughly 58 million people—nearly a quarter of Pakistan’s population—its credibility carries enormous weight. “Allowing it to become a corrupt and untrusted institution is not just a betrayal of honest and deserving beneficiaries, but of every single taxpayer and international donor supporting the programme,” the report warned.","As many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million, local media reported.

Monsoon rains continue to cause severe flooding in Pakistan’s Punjab province, which is facing the biggest flood in its history, Associated Press reported.Experts say global warming has made this year’s monsoon worse in Pakistan, which is highly exposed to climate change. In recent months, heavy rains and cloudbursts have led to flash floods and landslides in the northern and northwestern mountains.According to ARY News, cited by ANI, flooding and rains have killed 33 people, hit 2,200 villages, and forced over 700,000 residents to evacuate in Pakistan's Punjab province.Punjab’s senior minister Maryam Aurangzeb said at a press conference on Sunday: ""This is the biggest flood in the history of the Punjab. The flood has affected two million people. It’s the first time that the three rivers — Sutlej, Chenab, and Ravi — have carried such high levels of water.""Punjab, with about 150 million people, is a key farming area and Pakistan’s main wheat producer.

Flood Threat For Pakistan As India Releases Water From Swollen Rivers Day After Alerting Islamabad





AMRITSAR: Embarrassed by a viral video showing its side of the parade path at Wagah border badly waterlogged - and its Rangers standing in knee-deep water - while the Indian side looks clean, Pakistan has blamed the elevation of Grand Trunk Road on the Indian side for the mess.The fact is India has already implemented a rainwater harvesting system and improved drainage management to prevent waterlogging.Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days. Its side of the parade area at the site of the daily flag ceremony at the Wagah joint checkpost is wallowing in muddy knee-deep water. Sandbags are seen piled up at a few places on the Pakistani side ahead of the ceremony. In contrast, the Indian side is free of water, except for a small area near the international border gates.Sources say Pakistan has raised the elevation of GT Road with Indian authorities. Pakistan also hastily constructed drainage channels and elevated a portion of the road to facilitate water outflow. BSF IG, Punjab Frontier, Atul Fulzele said there was incessant and heavy rainfall on Aug 8-9, and the video was likely from that period.""There has been no waterlogging at any of the three sites of the ceremonial flag-lowering ceremonies - Attari, Hussainiwala, and Sadqi.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Big Op Sindoor Lie Claims India Begged For Ceasefire, Trump Stepped In





ISLAMABAD: Nearly 100 days after Indian fighter jets pounded “terror bases” in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque that was among those hit.The May 6 raids had left the Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad badly damaged, with three fatalities reported. Now, PoK police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot “sold out” by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.Obaid has been booked under the draconian Official Secrets Act, 1923, with police claiming they had recovered “hard evidence” of espionage. “He passed on sensitive images and the mosque’s coordinates in exchange for hefty payments,” claimed SSP Riaz Mughal of PoK police’s counter-terrorism department (CTD).But the case is already mired in conflicting narratives. Another senior CTD officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, went further, alleging Jahangir had a past with a banned outfit before joining a so-called relief organisation.

His uncle admitted the 30-something may have “fallen into a money trap” but stressed he was only associated with the Jammu Kashmir United Movement, a relief body.“If he is guilty, he should face the law, but he has never been part of any militant outfit,” the uncle maintained.His lawyer, Abdul Samad, pointed out that the sections invoked against him cover trespassing into restricted areas and passing on information “prejudicial to national security”.

Pakistan blaze: Fireworks warehouse explosion injures at least 25; fire triggers road closures in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-blaze-fireworks-warehouse-explosion-injures-at-least-25-fire-triggers-road-closures-in-karachi/articleshow/123434002.cms,"



At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, were injured after an explosion took place at a fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.Thick smoke could be seen billowing into the sky from the building where firecrackers were stored, according to television footage.Witnesses cited by AP said that broken glass from nearby shops covered the road and panicked residents fled the scene.Firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze while ambulances ferried the injured, including passers-by, to hospitals.Senior police official Asad Raza said several shops and vehicles on Jinnah Road were damaged in the blast. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.The fire was reported in a warehouse near Taj Complex on MA Jinnah Road, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding,“as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the Fire and Rescue team reached the scene along with an ambulance and two fire brigade trucks.”Police surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “Sixteen injured at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [with] two critical. Fourteen at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre,” adding that the warehouse had been storing firecrackers.Karachi traffic police said MA Jinnah Road had been closed due to the fire, with traffic from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.Citizens were advised to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate routes “to avoid inconvenience,” the Dawn reported.Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed officials to control the blaze and ensure no lives were lost. According to a statement, he also ordered the Karachi Commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report. “There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.The Sindh home ministry later issued a statement saying 20 people had been injured in the blaze.Home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to the scene, saying, “Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital. An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”Lanjar also instructed investigators to include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene, Dawn furthed added.Explosions at fireworks facilities are not uncommon in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab province. Fires in commercial and residential buildings are also frequent, largely blamed on poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety rules, and negligence.","At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, injured after explosion at fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.

Targeting Ahmadiyya community



Blasphemy accusations







The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.HRCP on Thursday released its latest report, Streets of Fear: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2024/25, documenting violations of freedom of religion or belief (FORB) between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025.The report painted a picture as grim as in previous years, recording targeted killings, forced conversions, mob lynchings, hate speech, desecration of places of worship and extrajudicial killings. It also warned that religious freedom in Pakistan is facing an unprecedented threat.The HRCP highlighted several cases where individuals were killed over blasphemy accusations, describing the trend as deeply troubling in a country that has already witnessed the assassination of a provincial governor by his own security guard.The HRCP report noted that the pattern of minor non-Muslim girls disappearing and later resurfacing after allegedly converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men persisted in 2024/25.Hindus in Sindh, who form 8.8% of the population, and Christians in Punjab (1.9%), have raised repeated concerns. A fact-finding study found that forced conversions and coerced marriages remain most prevalent among Scheduled Caste Hindus due to poverty and limited social mobility.The report highlighted the role of cleric-politician Mian Abdul Haq, or Mian Mithu, accused of using his influence to facilitate conversions at his seminary in Ghotki. He was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.The report also cited cases where police were seen siding with abductors, often claiming it would be “haram” to return a girl after conversion.In July 2024, Faisalabad police recovered Christian minor Laiba Suhail, abducted in February and forcibly converted before being married off illegally. Another girl, Alina, is still missing. In January 2025, a Mirpurkhas court heard a plea from a couple accused of forcing an underage Hindu girl to convert and marry.Other cases were reported across provinces: in April 2025, 14-year-old a Hindu girl, Chahat disappeared in Quetta and later claimed in a video to have converted, though her parents produced documents proving she was underage.In May, Hindu Panchayats in Ghotki and Rohri protested the disappearance of a Meghwar teenager in Rohri, fearing abduction for forced conversion. In June, civil society groups and Hindu Panchayats in Larkana expressed concern over three minor girls and a teenage boy from Shahdadpur allegedly being forced to convert.The HRCP stressed that such cases continue to deepen insecurity among religious minorities and called for protective measures to safeguard vulnerable children and their families.The report listed multiple killings of Ahmadis: dentist Zakaur Rahman in Lalamusa (July 2024), Tayyab Ahmad in Rawalpindi (December 2024), Amir Hasan in Naukot (December 2024), Laeeq Cheema lynched in Karachi (April 2025), Muhammad Asif in Kasur (April 2025), and senior doctor Mahmood Sheikh in Sargodha (May 2025).The UN warned, “We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan.”“According to the data provided by the Ahmadiyya community, 29 Ahmadi places of worship were attacked and damaged during the review period,” the report said.It further added that in 26 cases, the demolition was carried out by law enforcement agencies.“These incidents occurred in Okara, Khanewal, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, and Sargodha, among other locations Back in January, a historic Sialkot site linked to Pakistan’s first foreign minister Zafarullah Khan was “reduced to rubble”.The report said that the blasphemy law has been often misused to settle personal scores or seek financial gain in Pakistan, where, a ‘mere accusation of blasphemy can be a death sentence.’In September, last year, two men accused of blasphemy were killed while in police custody less than a week apart. One was inexplicably shot and killed in Mirpurkhas during an alleged police encounter, and the other was killed by a police constable inside a police station in Quetta.On 12 September 2024, constable Saad Khan Sarhadi shot dead Abdul Ali, a blasphemy suspect, inside Quetta’s Cantonment Police Station after mobs from religious parties gathered outside demanding his custody. It marked the first such incident in the city where a serving officer killed a suspect in custody. Days later, Ali’s family pardoned Sarhadi, while lawyers and a JUI-F senator pledged legal support for him.Later, on 17 September 2024, Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a civil hospital employee from Umerkot, fled to Karachi after a cleric accused him of posting blasphemous content. He denied the charge in a video message before being arrested by police, who assured his family of protection. Two days later, police claimed he was killed in an encounter, with officers celebrated as heroes.His family was prevented from burying him by armed mobs, and the body was desecrated. Following outrage from rights groups, a Sindh police inquiry declared the encounter “fake.”The report also showed that the mainstream media largely ignored issues of religious freedom under the period covered. Even the Islamabad High Court’s hearings into the “blasphemy business group,” affecting nearly 400 households and livestreamed for four months, drew little coverage. Likewise, cases of coerced marriages, forced conversions and violence against minorities rarely made headlines.A worrying trend has emerged in Pakistan, where ultra-right-wing groups are exerting growing pressure on the judiciary and elected officials through propaganda and intimidation, it added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.

Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has called off a planned visit to China after days of unrest spread beyond Jakarta, with parliament buildings in several regions torched and lives lost in violent clashes.Prabowo had been scheduled to attend a “Victory Day” parade in China on September 3, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. But with demonstrations intensifying at home, the president chose to remain in Indonesia.“The president wants to continue monitoring (the situation in Indonesia) directly…and seek the best solutions,” presidential spokesperson Prasetyo Hadi said in a video message on Saturday.“Therefore, the president apologizes to the Chinese government that he could not attend the invitation.” He added that preparations for the United Nations General Assembly in September were also a factor in the decision, according to CNN.The protests, the most serious challenge to Prabowo’s government since he took office nearly a year ago, began in Jakarta this week over lawmakers’ pay. Tensions escalated after a police vehicle fatally struck a motorcyclist.Anger has spilled over into the provinces. Local media reported that parliament buildings in West Nusa Tenggara, Pekalongan in Central Java and Cirebon in West Java were set on fire on Saturday. In Cirebon, demonstrators looted parliamentary equipment, while police deployed teargas to disperse crowds in Pekalongan and West Nusa Tenggara, CNN reported.In Makassar, South Sulawesi’s capital, three people died when a parliament building was torched, Indonesia’s disaster management agency confirmed. State news agency Antara said the victims were trapped inside, while two others were injured after jumping from the building to escape the blaze. Local outlet metrotvnews.com reported one more death linked to the fire, though this could not be independently verified.Protests also erupted on Bali, where police used tear gas against crowds.The unrest has been amplified online, prompting the government to summon major social media companies including Meta and TikTok, demanding tighter content moderation. Authorities accuse disinformation of fuelling anger on the streets.On Saturday, TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance, announced it had suspended its live-streaming feature in Indonesia for several days.Meanwhile, demonstrators in Jakarta looted the home of NasDem party lawmaker Ahmad Sahroni, carrying away household furniture and other belongings. Sahroni has faced heavy criticism for comments made in response to calls for parliament to be dissolved. He has dismissed those critics as “the stupidest people in the world.”","Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has called off a planned visit to China.

DHAKA: Bangladesh's Election Commission (EC) on Friday described the national election scheduled for February next year as the ""most risky” in the country's electoral history, urging officials to brace for unpredictable challenges amid political uncertainty and social unrest.The remarks came a day after it unveiled a roadmap for the election, which has drawn mixed reactions from political parties.""The upcoming general election will undoubtedly be the most risky in Bangladesh's electoral history,” Election Commissioner M Anwarul Islam Sarker said at a training programme for election officials, which was also attended by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) AMM Nasir Uddin.""We may have to confront challenges that we do not yet know,” he said. Unveiling the roadmap for the general election, Bangladesh's top electoral body had said the poll schedule would be announced at least 60 days before the voting date.Another election commissioner, Abdur Rahmanel Masud, echoed Sarker's concern, saying that the upcoming election ""will be risky but the matter does not end there”.“A former CEC was recently garlanded with shoes (by a mob), while another is currently in jail,"" he said, urging officials to “just follow the law” and not to look to anyone else.CEC Uddin stressed professionalism and neutrality, directing officials to prepare for possible threats to law and order as well as the spread of misinformation and disinformation through social media.The commission “wants 100 per cent neutral behaviour from election officials in the upcoming polls”, he said.The upcoming polls will be the first since the ouster of Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League government in August 2024, following the violent protest led by Students Against Discrimination (SAD).Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has since been heading the interim government as Chief Adviser, with the Awami League barred from contesting the election pending trials of Hasina and her colleagues on charges, including crimes against humanity.While former prime minister Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and several left-leaning groups have welcomed the election roadmap, Jamaat-e-Islami on Friday rejected it as a “blueprint” to ""undermine free, fair election”.Jamaat leader Syed Abdullah Mohammad Taher, in a meeting with election officials in Cumilla district, accused Yunus of breaking his “promise"" by prematurely announcing the election deadline.The Islamist party was demanding the introduction of a proportional representation (PR) system in the polls, apparently to enhance its possible stake in the future parliament.Taher said the deadline was announced without taking a decision on the matter and other reform issues.The newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP) -- an offshoot of the SAD seen as sympathetic to Yunus -- has also expressed reservations against the planned polls under the existing system and scenario.The party, which is yet to get the EC registration, described the roadmap as a “breach of promise”.NCP Joint Convener Ariful Islam Adeeb, in a press conference, warned that “this misstep” could create future crises for which “the government must bear responsibility"".The party is pushing for a new constitution to replace the 1972 charter through a Constituent Assembly. It is demanding that the “July Charter” announced by Yunus earlier this month, acknowledging last year’s “revolution”, be implemented through the new constitution.Analysts have voiced concerns over whether a credible election can be held in the absence of the Awami League. They also warned that escalating mob violence and the current fragile law and order situation could also jeopardise the process.However, BNP, which has emerged as the single major party in Awami League's absence, sounded upbeat.“Everything has been done according to public expectations. I hope there will be no more irrelevant questions about the election now,” BNP standing committee member Salahuddin Ahmed was quoted as saying by the Daily Star newspaper.Yunus had earlier said the polls under his administration would be “the best” Bangladesh had “ever witnessed” in its history.","Bangladesh's Election Commission urges officials to brace for unpredictable challenges.

South Korea Phone Ban: ‘No more phones in classrooms’ South Korea announces nationwide ban; to be implemented in 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/no-more-phones-in-classrooms-south-korea-announces-nationwide-ban-to-be-implemented-in-2026/articleshow/123542944.cms,".

South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms, with lawmakers passing the bill on Wednesday, August 26, 2025, to address growing concerns about smartphone addiction among students, as per a report by BBC. The measure, approved by 115 out of 163 lawmakers present, aims to improve academic performance and social interactions among children and teenagers, with implementation scheduled for the next school year beginning March 2026.The new legislation comes as South Korean educators, parents, and lawmakers have observed declining academic progress and performance linked to excessive smartphone use in educational settings. The ban encompasses mobile phones and other smart devices within classroom environments.The initiative aligns South Korea with several other nations that have implemented similar restrictions. Countries including Finland and France have established phone bans specifically for younger students, while Italy, the Netherlands, and China have implemented broader restrictions across all school levels.Many South Korean schools had already implemented various forms of smartphone restrictions prior to this nationwide mandate.The new law formalizes these practices and establishes consistent standards across the country's educational institutions.The implementation timeline provides schools and educational authorities several months to prepare for the transition and establish necessary protocols before the law takes effect in March 2026.The ban reflects growing global awareness of smartphone addiction among youngsters and its potential impact on educational outcomes. Educational institutions worldwide are increasingly examining their policies regarding mobile device use in academic settings.","South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms.

Saffron flag branded ‘extremist’; Hindu group lodges complaint,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/saffron-flag-branded-extremist-hindu-group-lodges-complaint/articleshow/123622055.cms,"



LONDON: A group of Hindu organisations in Leicester has filed a police complaint against Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), UK’s largest Muslim umbrella organisation, for allegedly stoking religious disharmony by claiming that saffron flags are “extremist”. Ganesh Chaturthi car procession in Leicester last week featured two cars bearing saffron flags.In a statement issued on Aug 28, MCB sought “urgent action” from authorities, claiming the flags associated with “Hindutva” at the celebration had sparked “concern” among local communities as they are allegedly tied to an extremist movement.In its complaint to Leicester Police, Hindu Community Organisations Group (HCOG) — which represents 40 Hindu organisations across Leicester — termed MCB’s statement about the saffron flags as “factually incorrect, inflammatory and offensive to the Hindu community” and a gross misrepresentation of one of Hinduism’s most sacred religious symbols.The complaint claimed MCB’s statement could lead to hostility towards Hindus and undermine community cohesion.“The saffron flag (Bhagwa Dhwaj) is a sacred emblem of Hinduism, revered for centuries. It represents peace, sacrifice, courage, and the pursuit of truth. To equate this sacred religious symbol with extremism is not only inaccurate but also a direct affront to religious freedoms enshrined in UK law,” HCOG convenor Vinod Popat said.",Hindu organisations in Leicester have filed a police complaint against Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) MCB claimed that saffron flags are “extremist’ and sought “urgent action” from authorities.

Fire guts Hindu community centre in London,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/fire-guts-hindu-community-centre-in-london/articleshow/123621892.cms,"



LONDON: A fire broke out at a Hindu community centre in east London’s Ilford on Saturday night, completely gutting the building. No one was injured.The devotees were in a Ganesh Chaturthi procession, and nobody was inside Shree Sorathia Prajapati Community Centre on Cleveland Road when the blaze erupted, thus avoiding a major tragedy.Flames reduced the centre — used by UK-based Hindus belonging to a community of potters from Gujarat’s Sorath region — to ashes. The roof collapsed, and the interiors, believed to have contained idols of deities, were completely charred. However, a 3m Ganesh neon sign on the exterior remained intact.Videos captured by onlookers at Oxford Islamic Centre opposite the building showed towering flames reaching high into the sky and plumes of black smoke billowing out, even as firefighters battled to douse the blaze. Neighbouring homes had to be evacuated.A police patrolling team first noticed the fire around 8pm. The fire brigade received around 14 calls and sent six fire engines and 40 firefighters to the spot, along with a 32m turntable ladder used as a water tower to help extinguish the flames from above.A London Fire Brigade spokesperson said the building was “fully alight” and had “sustained a significant amount of damage” when they arrived.The fire was under control by 9.20pm.“The cause of the fire is under investigation, although at this stage, information suggests that it is not believed to have been started deliberately,” a Metropolitan Police spokesperson said.“The procession set off at 6.30pm, and the centre was locked. We don’t know what caused it, but around 8pm, there was a blast from within. The community is very distraught, especially since a havan was due to take place there on Sunday,” Ravi Bhanot, a community member, said.Ilford South MP Jas Athwal, who was at the spot, told TOI that the building may need to be demolished as it had suffered extensive structural damage. “Thankfully, police were patrolling at the right time,” he said.The fire came exactly a week after Indian Aroma, a desi restaurant, went up in flames in a suspected arson attack, leaving five people hospitalised.","A fire broke out at a Hindu community centre in east London’s Ilford on Saturday night, completely gutting the building.

UK tax fraud crackdown: Indian-origin Arif Patel ordered to pay 90 million pounds; fake clothing mastermind exposed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-tax-fraud-crackdown-indian-origin-arif-patel-ordered-to-pay-90-million-pounds-fake-clothing-mastermind-exposed/articleshow/123614457.cms,"Representative image





Arif Patel, an Indian-origin businessman and the mastermind behind one of the UK’s largest fake designer clothing and VAT frauds, has been ordered to repay over £90 million following his 2023 conviction.The 57-year-old, from Preston in north-west England and now residing in Dubai, was found guilty of false accounting, conspiracy to cheat the public revenue, and money laundering.On Thursday, the crown prosecution service (CPS) announced that Chester crown court granted a confiscation order against Patel, allowing authorities to sell his assets to recover the stolen funds.“The CPS has worked robustly with HMRC [His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs] and Lancashire Police to ensure that Arif Patel could not keep the benefit from his fake counterfeit designer clothes scam and fraudulent VAT claims,” said Adrian Foster, Chief Crown Prosecutor of the CPS Proceeds of Crime Division, as reported by PTI.Foster added, “In total, he must pay back more than 90 million pounds or have more prison time added to his original sentence. In the last five years, 478 million pounds have been recovered from CPS-obtained confiscation orders, ensuring that thousands of convicted criminals cannot profit from their offending. Over 95 million pounds of that amount has been returned to victims of crime, by way of compensation.”According to UK prosecutors, Patel and his criminal network stole £33.4 million from the British government through false VAT repayment claims on fake exports of textiles and mobile phones.They also imported and sold counterfeit designer clothes valued at over £19.19 million, using a “sophisticated chain of sham companies to cover their tracks.”Proceeds from the fraud were used to purchase properties across Preston and London through offshore bank accounts.“Arif Patel lived a lavish lifestyle at the expense of the law-abiding majority, but he will now lose the property empire he amassed from the proceeds of crime,” said Richard Las, director of HMRC’s fraud investigation service. “Our work never stops at conviction. For the last two years, we’ve worked with police and CPS partners to secure one of the biggest criminal confiscations we’ve ever recovered. Tens of millions of pounds of stolen money will now go back to directly fund public services. ”Patel was sentenced in absentia to 20 years’ imprisonment for tax fraud following a trial in April 2023. In total, 26 members of his criminal network were convicted over six trials between 2011 and 2023, receiving prison sentences totaling 147 years and seven months.“Arif Patel was the head of a Preston-based organised crime group responsible for causing millions of pounds worth of losses to multiple companies. His actions, motivated by greed, directly impacted the taxpayer,” said Mark Winstanley, assistant chief constable from Lancashire Police, reported PTI.According to HMRC, Patel fled to Dubai in July 2011 and has not returned to the UK since before his conviction and sentencing.","Arif Patel, 57, was found guilty of false accounting, conspiracy to cheat the public revenue, and money laundering.

Canada’s first Indian-origin police chief retires: Victoria declares ‘Del Manak Day’; 35 years of service remembered,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/canadas-first-indian-origin-police-chief-retires-victoria-declares-del-manak-day-35-years-of-service-remembered/articleshow/123614492.cms,".





Victoria police chief Del Manak retired on August 27 after serving 35 years with the Vancouver police department, marking a historic milestone as the first Indian-origin officer to become police chief in Canada. The City of Victoria commemorated his retirement by declaring August 27 as 'Del Manak Day' in recognition of his contributions to law enforcement and breaking barriers as the first person of color to lead the Victoria Police in its 168-year history.Manak began his law enforcement career with the Vancouver Police Department in 1990, steadily advancing through the ranks before assuming the role of Victoria's police chief in 2017. His appointment as chief marked a significant achievement for diversity in Canadian law enforcement.""When I joined the force, it wasn't easy. I had to struggle a lot, but I kept going and worked hard,"" Manak reflected on his journey in law enforcement.Born in 1964 in Vancouver, Manak's family history traces back to Punjab, India. He shared his family's migration story, connecting his roots to the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district.""My father hailed from Banga, a historic town in the district. He migrated to Singapore, and later our family settled in Canada,"" Manak said, describing his family's journey to Canada.Throughout his career, Manak faced numerous challenges and memorable experiences in law enforcement. One significant incident occurred during his early days on the force.""There were also high-speed chases that tested us,"" he noted, recalling his experiences. He specifically mentioned one of his first assignments in 1992, responding to a nightclub shooting in Vancouver, where he secured the crime scene and coordinated with senior officers.During his tenure, Manak consistently advocated for improvements in the justice system, expressing concerns about repeat offenders.""It's disheartening when police arrest a criminal and within a month, they're out on bail, committing crimes again,"" he remarked, highlighting challenges within the criminal justice system.Manak emphasized the importance of addressing contemporary law enforcement challenges, particularly focusing on crime prevention and substance abuse issues. He stressed the necessity of enhanced rehabilitation programs to reduce repeat offenses.As for his retirement plans, Manak is taking time to consider his next steps. ""I have some job offers, but for now, I'm going to Europe for a month,"" he revealed, indicating his immediate post-retirement plans.",Del Manak is the first person of color to lead the Victoria Police in its 168-year history.

"Old tech, new power? Why Britain is turning to flywheels for grid stability",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/old-tech-new-power-why-britain-is-turning-to-flywheels-for-grid-stability-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-system/articleshow/123611558.cms,"Representative AI image generated by Denny





Britain is turning to an age-old technology to stabilise its power grid as coal and gas plants are phased out and replaced with renewable energy. Grid operators are increasingly relying on heavy spinning devices called flywheels to provide the inertia once supplied by fossil-fuel power stations, in order to prevent large-scale blackouts.Flywheels, used for centuries in machinery from potters’ wheels to steam engines, can mimic the stabilising effect of turbines in coal and gas plants by responding to sudden fluctuations in electricity supply and demand. Without such rotating systems, ""the system is more prone to fluctuations than it would be otherwise,"" said David Brayshaw, professor of climate science at the University of Reading. ""As we get to ever higher levels of renewables, we're going to have to think about this more carefully,"" he told AFP.The challenge was underscored in April, when Spain and Portugal were hit by a major outage after their renewable-heavy grid failed to absorb a sudden surge in voltage. A similar incident in 2019 plunged parts of Britain into darkness and prompted the National Energy System Operator (NESO) to begin contracting grid-stabilising projects.Among the solutions, flywheels and batteries are being deployed to create “synthetic inertia”.According to engineering professor Keith Pullen of City St George's, University of London, steel flywheels could prove more cost-effective and longer-lasting than lithium-ion batteries. ""I'm not saying that flywheels are the only technology, but they could be a very, very important one,"" said Pullen, who also leads the startup Levistor.One of the flagship projects is Statkraft’s “Greener Grid Park” in Liverpool, operational since 2023. It uses two 40-ton flywheels attached to synchronous compensators to supply about one percent of Britain’s total grid inertia. ""We are providing that inertia without burning any fossil fuels, without creating any carbon emissions,"" said Guy Nicholson, Statkraft’s head of zero-carbon grid solutions. NESO reports that at least 11 similar projects are already operational across the UK, with more on the way.Despite this progress, concerns remain. ""We aren't building them fast enough to decarbonise the grid,"" Nicholson warned, noting Britain’s target of 95 percent clean energy by 2030. ""At the moment... we can't even do it for one hour,"" he added, pointing out that gas turbines are still required to keep the grid stable.The government insists it is working with industry to scale up new stabilisation technologies. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said the UK is collaborating with partners to roll out “world-leading technology, including flywheels, static and synchronous compensators, as we overhaul the energy system.”Still, experts say Britain and Ireland remain ahead of continental Europe in adopting such measures. ""In GB and Ireland, the system operators are leading by contracting these services,"" Nicholson said. ""On the continent, there hasn't been the same drive for that. I think these things are driven by events. So, the Spanish blackout will drive change.""","Britain is turning to an age-old technology to stabilise its power grid as coal and gas plants are phased out.

"'Hostile environment': UK nurse, bullied by colleague, wins Rs 30 lakh compensation; suffered panic attacks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/hostile-environment-uk-nurse-wins-rs-30-lakh-compensation-for-workplace-bullying-suffered-panic-attacks/articleshow/123610770.cms,"AI-generated image

How the relationship soured





A dental nurse in Scotland has been awarded £25,000 (around Rs 30 lakh) in compensation after an employment tribunal ruled that she was forced to quit her job due to ""bullying"" and ""rude"" behaviour from a colleague.At a dental clinic in Edinburgh, Scotland, tensions between Maureen Howieson, 64, and her colleague Jisna Iqbal escalated due to what the tribunal described as a ""strained"" working relationship.According to the panel's findings, Howieson was subjected to ""rude, isolating, bullying, and belittling"" behavior by Iqbal. The panel noted that Iqbal's conduct included repeated eye-rolling during conversations, among other demeaning gestures, which contributed to a hostile work environment.Judge Ronald Mackay criticized the employer's inaction, stating that the failure to address clear concerns raised by Howieson was an ""unacceptable omission."" He added that the assurances made to her were not upheld, which resulted in a continued hostile work environment.According to Howieson, tensions began after Iqbal took over reception duties from her while she was on sick leave, which she believes marked the beginning of their deteriorating relationship.The situation escalated further in September 2024 when Howieson was ""brought to tears"" at work, prompting her to have a meeting with the clinic owner, Dr Fary Johnson Vithayathil.She was told that Dr Vithayathil’s wife, who is also the clinic's business manager, would speak with Iqbal, which didn’t happen.Howieson ended up having a panic attack due to stress.She resigned in October last year after being incorrectly underpaid, describing it as a ""final straw.""","A dental nurse in Scotland has been awarded £25,000 (around Rs 30 lakh) in compensation after an employment tribunal ruled that she was forced to quit her job due to ""bullying"" and ""rude"" behaviour from a colleague.

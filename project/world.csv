"Putin Praises Elon Musk: ‘Such people rarely appear’: Putin praises Elon Musk, compares him to Soviet space icon Korolev",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/such-people-rarely-appear-putin-praises-elon-musk-compares-him-to-soviet-space-icon-korolev/articleshow/120365752.cms,"Putin praises Elon Musk, compares him to Soviet space icon Korolev (Picture credit: AP)

Russian President Vladimir Putin has once again heaped praise on Elon Musk, calling him a visionary with ideas as bold as those of famed Soviet rocket engineer Sergei Korolev.Speaking to students during a visit to Moscow’s Bauman University on Wednesday, Putin said Musk is among the rare individuals “charged-up with a certain idea,” comparing his obsession with Mars to the early ambitions of Soviet space pioneers.“You know, there’s a man, he lives in the States, Musk, who, you could say, raves about Mars,” Putin told the students. “These are the kind of people who don’t often appear in the human population,” he added, highlighting that while such ideas may seem incredible now, “they often come to fruition after a while”.“Such people rarely appear… even though it may seem incredible to me today, after a time such ideas are often realised”, the Russian President further said.Sergei Korolev, to whom Musk was compared, is credited with launching the Soviet space programme, including the world’s first satellite, Sputnik and Vostok 1, which carried Yuri Gagarin into orbit in 1961.Putin’s remarks also likely reflect the warmer ties developing between Moscow and Washington under US President Donald Trump, who has appointed Musk as a top advisor.This isn’t the first time Putin has expressed admiration for Musk. During a widely watched interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson, he said, “There’s no stopping Elon Musk.He will do as he sees fit.” Referring to Neuralink, Musk’s brain-chip venture, the Russian leader added, “You’ll need to find some common ground with him… persuade him,” and called Musk a “smart person” with whom it is essential to reach an agreement due to the far-reaching implications of AI and human enhancement.At the 2023 Eastern Economic Forum, Putin had similarly called Musk “an extraordinary person” and a “talented businessman,” recognising his global influence and entrepreneurial success. “This is also recognised all over the world,” he remarked.Meanwhile, Musk continues to stir controversy over his views on the war in Ukraine. The SpaceX chief, who operates the Starlink satellite network used in conflict zones, recently accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of seeking a “forever war” and said Kyiv had gone “too far” in the conflict.",Vladimir Putin compares Elon Musk to Soviet space pioneer Sergei Korolev.

"North Korea Threats: ‘Grave provocation’: North Korea on US bombers' drill with South Korea, vows ‘powerful force’ in response",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/grave-provocation-north-korea-on-us-bombers-drill-with-south-korea-vows-powerful-force-in-response/articleshow/120364241.cms,"Two US Air Force B-1B bomber (top left), fly over the Korean Peninsula with South Korean Air Force F-35A fighter jet, F-16 fighter jets and US Air Force F-16 fighter jets in South Korea during the joint aerial drills.

North Korea on Thursday threatened to respond after the US sent B-1B bombers over the Korean Peninsula earlier this week. This deployment happened during joint exercises with South Korean aircraft, which Pyongyang sees as a direct military threat.The long-range bombers took part in aerial exercises with South Korea on Tuesday to demonstrate deterrence against North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, according to Seoul’s defence ministry.South Korean F-35 and F-16 fighter jets, along with American F-16s, participated in the drill. The ministry stated that the allies would continue strengthening their operational readiness in response to North Korea’s advancing arsenal, according to CBS News.Responding to the flyover, an unnamed spokesperson from North Korea’s defence ministry, quoted by state media, called it “an open threat to the security of our state and a grave provocation that raises the military tension in the region to an extreme dangerous level.”The official warned that Pyongyang would “deter by dint of powerful force the US aggressive attempt to permanently fix the malignant instability element in the security environment of the region,” as per news agency AP.The flyover coincided with the 113th birth anniversary of North Korea’s founder, Kim Il Sung—a date known as the “Day of Sun” and one of the most sacred holidays in the country. The timing is likely to further provoke Pyongyang, which has reacted strongly in the past to similar displays by the US, including with missile launches and fiery rhetoric, as per CBS News.Later on Thursday, South Korea’s Air Force announced the start of its biannual “Freedom Flag” exercises with the US, featuring 90 aircraft and other assets. The drills will continue for two weeks and are expected to intensify North Korea’s anger.Tensions have already been running high on the peninsula. Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of Kim Jong Un, recently dismissed US-led efforts to denuclearise North Korea as a “daydream” and reaffirmed Pyongyang's refusal to abandon its nuclear weapons programme. Her remarks came after a meeting among US, South Korean and Japanese diplomats who pledged to push forward denuclearisation talks.This week’s B-1B deployment marks the second such exercise since US President Donald Trump began his second term.In February, North Korea denounced a similar flyover as evidence of growing US-led hostility and responded with cruise missile tests. Trump has maintained that he has a “great relationship” with Kim Jong Un and has repeatedly expressed willingness to resume diplomacy, though North Korea has yet to publicly respond to his outreach.","US sent B-1B bombers over the Korean Peninsula earlier this week.

Canada Election 2025: Trump becomes key focus in French-language debate between Mark Carney and Pierre Poilievre,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/canada-election-2025-trump-becomes-key-focus-in-french-language-debate-between-mark-carney-and-pierre-poilievre/articleshow/120364042.cms,"(L-R) Liberal leader Mark Carney, Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-Francois Blanchet, New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre (AP photo)

'I'm not Justin Trudeau,' Carney says after jab from Poilievre

The first French-language leaders’ debate of the 2025 Canadian election saw prime minister Mark Carney and conservative leader Pierre Poilievre face off over the pressing issue of how best to deal with US president Donald Trump Carney, who took over the Liberal party leadership in March, countered Poilievre’s claims about the need for change, by arguing that the central question of the upcoming election was who could best handle Trump, in the face of Trump’s aggressive tactics, including his trade war and his threats to make Canada the 51st state.Poilievre, in his criticism of Carney’s leadership, argued that the Liberals had been in power too long and that Carney, much like his predecessor Justin Trudeau, represented continuity rather than change.Responding to this, Carney said, ""Mr Poilievre is not Justin Trudeau. I’m not Justin Trudeau either. In this election the question is who is going to face Mr Trump.""When asked about Justin Trudeau during a news conference after the debate, Mark Carney said one key difference between them is his stronger focus on the economy. “There are many differences, but one of them is that I place much more emphasis on growing the economy,” he said.Trump’s threat has led to a rise in Canadian nationalism, which has given Carney’s Liberal party a boost in the polls ahead of the 28 April vote. The poll shift shows a clear change from earlier in the year, where the Conservatives held a significant lead. In January, a Nanos poll showed the Liberals trailing by 47% to 20%, but the most recent poll indicates that the Liberals now lead by 8 percentage points.The debate, held in Montreal—Canada’s second-largest city—was strategically important, as the French-speaking province of Quebec has 78 seats in the 343-seat House of Commons.The debate was moved up by two hours to avoid a scheduling conflict with a Montreal Canadiens hockey game, a sign of the cultural importance of the sport in Canada. The decision was reminiscent of the 2011 election when a similar request was made due to the same team’s playoff schedule.The English-language debate, scheduled for Thursday evening, will further clarify the stance of each leader as Canadians prepare to vote in one of the most consequential elections in recent years.","First French-language leaders' debate of the 2025 Canadian election saw prime minister Mark Carney and conservative leader Pierre Poilievre face off.

‘Karma’: Letitia James facing potential prosecution over alleged mortgage fraud

Who is Letitia James?

Letitia James is a Democrat and has served as New York’s attorney general since 2019, according to PBS.

She is the first Black woman elected to statewide office in New York.

Known for her aggressive legal stance, James gained national attention after filing a civil fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump, the Trump Organisation, and several of its executives in 2022.

That case led to a $454 million judgment, which Trump is currently appealing. James has remained a visible figure in the courtroom and the media throughout the proceedings.

This year, she has launched at least five legal challenges against the Trump administration, including a coalition-led lawsuit opposing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)’s access to Treasury systems and a separate suit against federal funding cuts to universities.

(This is a top Google Trends topic)

The Trump administration has accused New York Attorney General Letitia James of mortgage fraud, escalating tensions between the two sides. The allegations were revealed in documents obtained by Fox News, showing that the FHFA has referred the matter to the department of justice for possible criminal investigation.The referral, signed by FHFA director William Pulte, highlights two key claims. First, that James falsely listed a Virginia property as her principal residence. Second, she misrepresented a New York property as a four-unit structure instead of five — which may have qualified her for different loan terms. There is also an allegation that she listed her father as her husband on past documents.","The FHFA has referred the matter to the department of justice for possible criminal investigation.

'Investment is not an entitlement': Trump admin freezes $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard University,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-freezes-2-2-billion-federal-funding-over-white-houses-campus-anti-semitism-mandate/articleshow/120294516.cms,"Harvard University in Cambridge (File photo)

Poll Do you agree with the Trump administration's decision to freeze funding for Harvard? No, it undermines academic independence. Yes, it's necessary for accountability.

What the Trump administration wanted from Harvard?

Harvard's response the demands

The Trump administration announced Monday it will freeze $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts for Harvard after the university refused to comply with its policy demands concerning changes in its policies.The mandates, issued in an April 3 directive, required changes to university governance, hiring and admissions processes, the closure of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) offices, and cooperation with federal immigration screenings for international students.The Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism that suspended the fundings and grants cited concerns about elite universities’ commitment to civil rights and responsible use of taxpayer funds. ""Harvard's statement today reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges - that federal investment does not come with the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws,"" it said.""The disruption of learning that has plagued campuses in recent years is unacceptable. The harassment of Jewish students is intolerable. It is time for elite universities to take the problem seriously and commit to meaningful change if they wish to continue receiving taxpayer support,"" it added to it statement.In a letter dated April 11 to Harvard President Alan Garber, US officials accused Harvard of failing to uphold federal civil rights laws and academic standards that justify continued federal investment. The letter outlined a set of strict reforms the university must implement by August 2025. ""The United States has invested in Harvard University’s operations because of the value to the country of scholarly discovery and academic excellence. But an investment is not an entitlement. It depends on Harvard upholding federal civil rights laws, and it only makes sense if Harvard fosters the kind of environment that produces intellectual creativity and scholarly rigor, both of which are antithetical to ideological capture."" it said.""Harvard has in recent years failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment. But we appreciate your expression of commitment to repairing those failures and welcome your collaboration in restoring the University to its promise. We therefore present the below provisions as the basis for an agreement in principle that will maintain Harvard’s financial relationship with the federal government,"" it added while listing out the demands for the ivy league university which included governance and leadership demands, merit-based hiring reforms, international admissions reforms, discontinuation of DEI, whistleblower reporting and ensuring transparency.In its response, Harvard President Alan Garber declared the university would not “negotiate over its independence or its constitutional rights.” Garber claimed that while the university is committed to addressing discrimination, it rejects federal overreach into academic autonomy. “The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” Garber wrote in a message to the community, as per the Harvard Gazette. “No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,"" he added.Garber's response came after the government issued a list of requirements prior to announcing the funding freeze. These included detailed assessments of academic divisions and departments, evaluations of perspectives from students, faculty, and staff, as well as proposed changes to Harvard's administrative structure and recruitment procedures.Following the order, Harvard Law School professor Nikolas Bowie gave a statement to CNN’s News Central saying, “What the President of the United States is demanding of universities is nothing short of authoritarian."" “He is violating the First Amendment rights of universities and faculty by demanding that if universities want to keep this money, they have to suppress our speech and change what we teach and how we study,” he added.This action follows heightened tensions on campuses nationwide, particularly after pro-Palestinian protests erupted in response to Israel’s military operations in Gaza. Some demonstrations led to confrontations with law enforcement and pro-Israel counter-protesters.Republican leaders, including President Donald Trump, have equated certain activist groups with Hamas—the US-designated terrorist organization whose October 7, 2023 attack on Israel sparked the current conflict.In March, the US Department of Education launched investigations into 60 academic institutions over reports of anti-Semitic incidents.Despite revealing a £45 million operating surplus from £6.5 billion in revenue last fiscal year, Harvard firmly rejected demands it deemed excessive and outside federal authority. Garber reiterated that political interference in academic decisions is unacceptable, regardless of party affiliation.Representative Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican known for her staunch support of Jewish and Israeli causes, has been a vocal critic of Harvard’s leadership. She praised the funding freeze, calling Harvard emblematic of higher education’s decline.Unlike Harvard, Columbia University chose to comply with similar White House mandates, forfeiting $400 million in federal grants after failing to adequately protect Jewish students during protests. Columbia has since implemented new disciplinary policies and increased security measures.Meanwhile, immigration authorities have pursued action against Columbia-based pro-Palestinian organizers. Mahmoud Khalil is undergoing deportation proceedings, and Mohsen Mahdawi was detained during his US citizenship interview.","The Trump administration announced Monday it will freeze $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts for Harvard.

Dan Caldwell , a senior adviser to US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth , was escorted out of the Pentagon on April 15, 2025, following his suspension amid an ongoing probe into multiple unauthorised disclosures of sensitive information. The removal, part of a broader crackdown inside the Department of Defense, signals a deepening crisis for the Trump administration’s national security leadership—and brings renewed scrutiny to the now-infamous “SignalGate” scandal.Caldwell wasn’t the only casualty. Darin Selnick, the Pentagon’s Deputy Chief of Staff and another political appointee, was also placed on administrative leave and removed from the building. According to defense officials, both men had their security credentials suspended pending the outcome of the investigation.At the centre of the investigation is a string of unauthorised disclosures that include highly sensitive operational information. Among the leaks under scrutiny:While the exact details of each leak are still classified, sources familiar with the probe say the information appeared across both encrypted group chats and informal communications shared with Trump-aligned media outlets. One such Signal chat — the focus of SignalGate — included top-level officials like Vice President JD Vance , National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.The group accidentally included a journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, who had been added by mistake during a group update. Unaware of the breach, members of the chat freely discussed targeting timelines for US strikes on the Houthis in Yemen, drone launch windows, and even posted celebration messages after successful missions. Goldberg would later publish excerpts in The Atlantic, triggering a national firestorm over operational security.Caldwell, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq, was a well-known figure in conservative national security circles. Before joining the Pentagon, he worked at Defense Priorities, a think tank sceptical of US interventionism, and held a senior role at Concerned Veterans for America — an organisation previously headed by Hegseth.He was brought into the Pentagon as a senior adviser shortly after Hegseth’s confirmation in early 2025 and quickly became one of the most influential figures in the department. He advised on Ukraine policy and, according to several defense officials, was the point person for Yemen-related military coordination.But his influence was matched by his ideological zeal. Known for his hardline stance against the so-called “deep state,” Caldwell frequently clashed with career officials and intelligence officers, particularly those advocating for more cautious engagement in global conflicts.According to Politico and Reuters, Hegseth himself named Caldwell in the Signal chat as the Pentagon’s go-to contact for the US’s Yemen campaign. The chat logs allegedly show Caldwell confirming target coordinates, celebrating confirmed kills, and—critically—forwarding operational documents that may not have been properly cleared.Though Signal is end-to-end encrypted, the group chat proved vulnerable not because of technology, but human error. Goldberg’s inclusion gave a real-time journalist access to a high-level, unfiltered war room—one that believed it was talking among trusted peers.Hegseth’s office had signed a memo in March authorising the Pentagon’s Director of Defense Intelligence to probe leaks and even conduct polygraphs. Ironically, the biggest breach came from within Hegseth’s own circle.Selnick’s departure, though less publicised, is just as significant. Like Caldwell, he was a Trump loyalist with previous experience in the first Trump administration, where he served in the Department of Veterans Affairs and the White House.He had also worked at Concerned Veterans for America and briefly carried out the responsibilities of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness — giving him considerable influence over military staffing and policy implementation.Defense officials have not confirmed the precise role Selnick played in the SignalGate debacle, but his removal on the same day suggests that he too was entangled in the unauthorised disclosure network—if not the chat itself, then parallel channels of communication.The SignalGate scandal lays bare the operational dysfunction inside Trump’s Pentagon. It has raised alarms about the use of encrypted messaging apps for real-time military coordination without adequate safeguards. That an accidental chat inclusion could compromise classified strike plans speaks to a failure not of technology but of judgment.It also underlines the blurred boundaries between media, government, and political activism in the Trump administration’s second term. Caldwell and Selnick are part of a generation of ideologically driven appointees who view bureaucracy with suspicion and traditional protocols as obstacles to be bypassed, not rules to be followed.The Pentagon’s Inspector General has launched a formal investigation, and watchdog groups such as American Oversight have filed lawsuits alleging violations of the Federal Records Act and Administrative Procedure Act. Legal experts warn that criminal charges are not off the table if it’s found that classified material was knowingly disseminated.Neither Caldwell nor Selnick has commented publicly, and the Pentagon has declined to offer further details while the investigation is ongoing.But their removal signals a likely housecleaning within Hegseth’s inner circle, especially as Congress prepares hearings into the leak and the broader question of how military secrets are handled in the age of encrypted group chats and political warfare.SignalGate is already being called the Trump Pentagon’s biggest internal scandal since the Iraq intelligence debacles of the early 2000s — only this time, the threat didn’t come from a foreign mole or a rogue general. It came from a chat bubble with too many “read” receipts.","Dan Caldwell, a senior adviser to US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, was escorted out of the Pentagon on April 15, 2025, following his suspension amid an ongoing probe.

Vice President JD Vance ’s upcoming trip to India may be billed in Washington as another high-level diplomatic tour—strengthening economic ties , exploring strategic partnerships, and affirming the US-India bond in an age of global flux. But for many Indians, especially the Telugu-speaking community, this visit carries a deeper emotional significance.Because JD Vance is not just America’s Vice President. He’s also a Telugu damaad—India’s son-in-law.And in India, that’s not just a sentimental detail. It’s a cultural status.JD Vance is married to Usha Chilukuri Vance, a Yale Law graduate and accomplished attorney whose family hails from Andhra Pradesh. Fluent in Telugu and deeply connected to her cultural heritage, Usha is one of the most prominent Indian-American women in conservative legal circles. She’s also been a transformative influence in JD’s life—not just personally, but spiritually.For many Telugu families across India and the diaspora, the Vice President’s visit feels personal. He is family, by marriage and by sentiment. In a culture where familial relationships often eclipse formal titles, the idea that the second-most powerful man in America is married into a Telugu household brings with it a rare warmth—and a unique kind of pride.When JD Vance arrived at Yale Law School , he was a self-described atheist. Raised in a working-class Christian home in Middletown, Ohio, he had long drifted from faith—his worldview shaped more by hardship than hope. But meeting Usha changed that.Usha’s upbringing in a devout Hindu household introduced JD to a kind of spirituality he hadn’t previously encountered. Her daily rituals, emphasis on introspection, and deep respect for dharma (moral duty) began to shape his thinking. Hinduism ’s focus on inner discipline, service, and balance resonated with a man who had spent much of his youth searching for meaning amid chaos.Over time, Usha’s quiet influence helped JD reframe his understanding of faith—not as dogma, but as a personal path toward resilience and purpose. The transformation was gradual. But by 2018, JD Vance had returned to Christianity, formally converting to Catholicism. He has since described his renewed faith as foundational to his identity and political worldview. And while he returned to church, the spiritual shift began in a home that lit oil lamps during Diwali and chanted Sanskrit shlokas during prayer.It was Hinduism that opened the door to his rediscovery of Christianity.When JD and Usha married in 2014, their wedding included both Hindu and Christian elements—symbolising not just cultural harmony, but spiritual openness. It was a quiet but powerful statement: that interfaith and intercultural marriages can be deeply respectful, even transformative.For JD, the union marked more than the beginning of a family—it marked a new moral compass. Usha’s influence helped anchor his public life in a sense of service, community, and humility. Hindu values such as seva (selfless service) and karma yoga (duty without attachment to reward) have subtly shaped his approach to politics—especially his focus on rural America, working-class dignity, and economic justice.As Vance visits India—accompanied by his wife and children—the trip will inevitably be filled with state meetings, bilateral statements, and tightly scheduled photo-ops. But the undercurrent of the visit will be far more human. In Delhi, Jaipur, and Agra, the cultural engagements—visiting historic sites, participating in traditional ceremonies, and meeting Indian families—will allow the Second Family to connect not just as officials, but as relatives.In India, the son-in-law occupies a cherished role. He is pampered, praised, and presented with the best the family can offer. For many, Vance’s visit will be seen not as a state function, but as a homecoming of sorts. And the fact that he has celebrated Hindu festivals, participated in pujas, and honoured Telugu traditions in his own home lends authenticity to that image.This isn’t political theatre—it’s lived reality.Beyond the symbolism, Vance’s journey also reflects a changing America—one where the Vice President can be Catholic, raised by a single mother in working-class Ohio, and yet deeply connected to Indian culture through marriage. It’s a quiet but powerful reflection of pluralism: a nation not built on sameness, but on the ability to hold difference with dignity.Usha’s role in this story is central. She has not only influenced JD’s personal faith journey but also brought her Telugu heritage into the heart of American political life. Her presence in the White House—rooted in both Hindu values and American legal excellence—adds a rare texture to global diplomacy. She is fluent in the culture and nuance of two worlds, and that makes her more than just a First Lady-in-waiting. She is, in many ways, a bridge.In the days ahead, Indian media will no doubt delight in covering every detail of the Second Family’s tour: the temples, the outfits, the bilingual greetings, the smiles exchanged with schoolchildren. But beneath the coverage lies something deeper—a sense that this visit is not just a matter of statecraft, but of shared spirit.Because when JD Vance steps onto Indian soil, he will be met not just as Vice President of the United States , but as a Telugu damaad—a man who, through love, learning, and faith, has found a second home in a culture far from his own.And in a world fractured by difference, that quiet intimacy might just be the strongest diplomatic message of all.","JD Vance is married to Usha Chilukuri Vance, a Yale Law graduate and accomplished attorney whose family hails from Andhra Pradesh. Usha’s upbringing in a devout Hindu household introduced JD to a kind of spirituality he hadn’t previously encountered.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120349213,imgsize-875632,width-400,resizemode-4/JD-Vance-and-Usha-Vance-AP-photo.jpg"

Final Thought: Musk's Mars Needs Mommies

If you thought Elon Musk was just the bloke sending Teslas into orbit and Doge memes into your timeline, think again. Behind the code, rockets, and Twitter tantrums lies a full-blown sci-fi fertility cult, with a plot that makes Handmaid’s Tale look like a parenting blog. From hush money to hush babies, Musk isn’t just building rockets—he’s building a legion. Literally. Here are ten jaw-dropping revelations from the Wall Street Journal’s expose that reads less like journalism and more like leaked notes from a Vatican fertility summit hosted by Trump.Elon Musk doesn’t have children. He has a legion. That’s what he calls his sprawling brood, borrowing the term from Roman military units known for conquest and expansion. The mission? To out-breed the collapse of Western civilisation. The method? Unclear. But one text from Musk to a baby mama suggests “we will need to use surrogates” to “reach legion-level before the apocalypse.” As you do.Every superhero needs a sidekick. Batman had Alfred. Elon has Jared Birchall, a devout Mormon who also plays financial consigliere, emotional midwife, and non-disclosure agreement enforcer. Birchall once warned a mother, “when a woman goes the legal route, that always, always leads to a worse outcome for that woman.” The man isn’t just protecting Musk—he’s doing fertility triage for MAGA Mars.Ashley St. Clair, a right-wing influencer, claimed Musk is the father of her baby—named Romulus, because Spartacus was taken. Musk offered her $15 million and $100K/month to keep mum. She wanted legitimacy. He wanted NDAs. When she declined the gag order, her support payments mysteriously began to...decline. Coincidence? Musk says, “Only the paranoid survive.” Also: “No comment.”Grimes, mother of three Musk-spawn, had to sue him for custody after he allegedly kept one child away from her for five months. The courtroom drama was brutal, with Musk’s team apparently dredging up her past to discredit her. Meanwhile, Musk offered his sperm to Shivon Zilis , his Neuralink executive, in what appears to be a corporate insemination strategy. And they say startups don’t have benefits.If Musk’s baby mothers were Hogwarts houses, Zilis would be Gryffindor. She has “special status,” attends black-tie dinners with Bezos and Ivanka, and meets Narendra Modi at Blair House with babies in tow. A Yale-educated AI expert and Musk’s Neuralink lieutenant, she may also be the real-life inspiration for whatever dystopian dating app Silicon Valley launches next.Somewhere in Austin lies Musk’s answer to population collapse: a gated compound where his children and their mothers can all reside. Yes, really. Zilis is already living there. Musk wanted St. Clair and Grimes to join the baby biodome too, presumably to coordinate diaper schedules and indoctrinate the legion. The others, it seems, weren’t so enthusiastic about the Mars Mommune.Musk’s method of meeting mothers is...very on-brand. He slides into the DMs of influencers on X, boosts their engagement, and sometimes asks them if they’d like to help him save humanity—by bearing his children. Tiffany Fong, a crypto influencer, was one such candidate. Her crime? Telling friends he asked. Result? Unfollowed, engagement tanked, earnings fell. Musk giveth, Musk taketh away.Musk once bragged about donating sperm to a high-profile Japanese woman after being approached by “Japanese officials.” No romance, he clarified. Just sperm. In another instance, he discouraged St. Clair from vaginal birth, citing concerns about brain size, and asked she not circumcise the baby—despite her being Jewish. Musk, it appears, doesn’t just believe in designing cars. He believes in designing babies.Musk’s romantic arc with St. Clair began on a private jet and climaxed with him wearing a custom black MAGA hat she made. During their relationship, he texted her policy ideas for Trump, asked her thoughts on Tulsi Gabbard as VP, and discussed how ""real men are made for war."" By the time Romulus was born, Musk was ghosting her texts and negotiating paternity tests through proxies.After St. Clair revealed the baby’s identity online to beat tabloid leaks, Musk cut her payment from $100K/month to $40K, then $20K. The timing coincided with her legal pushback. According to her lawyers, “money is being weaponized.” For a man who tweets about free speech and liberty, Musk seems very comfortable using his billions to enforce silence. Democracy may die in darkness, but paternity lives in litigation.Musk says he’s doing all this for the species. To save humanity. To ensure we’re “multiplanetary.” But one can’t help but notice that his ideal future involves rich, white, intelligent people—preferably conservative and under NDA—carrying out a eugenic mission under his oversight. It’s part Ayn Rand, part Handmaid’s Tale, part SpaceX baby bootcamp.He wants a Mars colony with crypto accounts, AI nannies, and fertility-by-algorithm. But Earth isn’t quite done watching the drama unfold. Whether Musk is remembered as the father of multiplanetary civilisation or just the world's richest sperm donor with a control complex remains to be seen.Either way, buckle up. The baby legion is just getting started.",The Wall Street Journal exposed Elon Musk's secret fertility cult. He offered Ashley St. Clair $15 million and $100K/month to keep mum. He also offered his sperm to Shivon Zilis in what appears to be a corporate insemination strategy.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120346068,imgsize-1849557,width-400,resizemode-4/Elon-Musk-and-his-Baby-Mamas.jpg"

Van Hollen speaks to members of El Salvador's press after meeting with Vice President Félix Ulloa

US senator and democrat Chris Van Hollen travelled to El Salvador this week and met its vice president Felix Ulloa on Wednesday in a bid to secure the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia , a Maryland resident mistakenly deported under the Trump administration.The senator, however, was denied access to Garcia , who remains imprisoned in a notorious facility in his home country. CECOT, a high-security prison is known for human rights violations. Attempts to involve the US embassy also failed to secure family contact or visitation.Speaking with reporters, Hollen said he declined a tour of the prison, stressing he was only interested in seeing the man held inside.“I asked the vice-president if I could meet with Mr Abrego Garcia. And he said, well, you need to make earlier provisions to go visit Cecot,” Van Hollen said. “I’m asking president Bukele under his authority as president of El Salvador to do the right thing and allow Mr Abrego Garcia to walk out of a prison — a man who’s charged with no crime, convicted of no crime,"" he added.Van Hollen said he offered to return next week to meet Garcia, but vice-president Ulloa told him he could not promise that either. Ulloa also said he could not arrange a phone call between Garcia and his family. When the senator asked if he could speak to him himself, Ulloa replied that the request would have to come from the US embassy.Hollen also claimed the Salvadoran government is being paid to hold deportees like Abrego Garcia, while criticising the Trump administration for falsely labelling Garcia as a gang member, saying, “He’s charged with no crime and convicted of no crime.”The US supreme court has already directed the federal government to arrange Abrego Garcia’s return, but no action has been taken by either American or Salvadoran officials.Hollen's trip follows El Salvador's president Bukele’s recent visit to Washington, where he stood with US president Trump and refused to release Abrego Garcia.Garcia, 29, was living in Maryland with his wife and child under a special immigration status that protected him from being deported. But despite a judge’s order allowing him to remain in the United States due to fears of gang persecution in El Salvador, he was deported last month.The Trump administration later admitted the removal was the result of an “administrative error”, but has since refused to comply with the supreme court directive to bring him back.","US senator Chris Van Hollen travelled to El Salvador this week.

'Real chance': President Trump claims tariff revenue may eliminate the need for income tax,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/real-chance-president-trump-claims-tariff-revenue-may-eliminate-the-need-for-income-tax/articleshow/120366492.cms,"Trump suggests tariffs could replace income tax: 'There's a chance'

US President Donald Trump said in a Fox News interview that revenue from sweeping tariffs might be enough to replace the federal income tax, calling it a “real chance” to overhaul the tax system. He cited historical examples from the late 1800s, when tariffs were the government’s primary source of income.“There is a chance that the money is so great that it could replace [income tax],” Trump said, adding, “In the old days, about 1870 to 1913, the tariffs were the only form of money. And that’s when our nation was relatively the richest. We were the richest.”Trump has pushed for Congress to remove taxes on tips and Social Security, and said tariffs could help fund such initiatives. “We were making two billion and three billion dollars a day. We never made money like that,” he claimed, noting a temporary reduction in rates to ease economic transitions.He dismissed the argument that tariffs caused the Great Depression, saying, “The Great Depression came before they put the tariffs on.”In the same interview, Trump praised El Salvador’s anti-crime crackdown under President Nayib Bukele and expressed openness to sending violent American criminals to similar facilities. “He’s made it a very safe place,” Trump said, suggesting that the US should also get “rid of our criminals... allowed to come in by Biden.”The comments come as the administration imposes a 90-day pause on new reciprocal tariffs, while raising duties on Chinese goods to as high as 245 per cent. The tariff moves have shaken financial markets and stoked fears of a recession, even as officials engage in trade talks to reduce the US trade deficit .","US President Donald Trump said in a Fox News interview that revenue from sweeping tariffs might be enough to replace the federal income tax.

Family says ICE agents smashed car window in seizing Guatemalan man who's seeking asylum,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/family-says-ice-agents-smashed-car-window-in-seizing-guatemalan-man-whos-seeking-asylum/articleshow/120366426.cms,"Marilu Domingo Ortiz, whose husband was taken into custody by ICE agents (AP)

NEW BEDFORD: A Massachusetts family is demanding answers from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, complaining its agents smashed a car window with a hammer and detained a man who they claim had applied for asylum. A lawyer for the family also claims agents were not looking for Juan Francisco Mendez when they grabbed him Monday in New Bedford, Massachusetts, as he drove to a dental appointment.The lawyer, Ondine Galvez-Sniffin, told The Associated Press during an interview that the agents claimed they were looking for another man with a different name before they dragged him and his wife out of the car.The incident, recorded on video by Mendez's wife Marilu Domingo Ortiz, shows ICE agents using a hammer to smash the car window and then seize Ortiz. The family believes Mendez is being held at a facility in Dover, New Hampshire.""When I arrived on the scene, my client's wife was sobbing. She was crying. She was shaking,"" Galvez-Sniffin said, adding that Mendez yelled ""Help Me"" in Spanish as he was driven away in handcuffs.""I walked over to the car and I see the busted window, the glass all over the back seat, and I was shocked,"" the lawyer added. ""I've been doing immigration work for 27 years and this was the first time that I saw such violent drastic measures being taken.""A spokesperson for ICE did not return repeated messages seeking comment.Another lawyer for Mendez, Ryan Sullivan, said a federal judge in New Hampshire ruled Wednesday that the government must give his attorneys 72 hours notice before moving him anywhere. Sullivan believes that is enough time to determine next steps in his case.Ortiz and her 9-year-old son have already been given protection under an asylum status over fears of facing persecution if they returned home to Guatemala. Mendez was in the process of applying for what is called derivative asylum, where you can get asylum if a family member already has it.The woman said she felt ""scared"" when ICE broke into their car and never expected someone from her family would be detained like this.""We came here to do honest work. To fight for our family,"" Ortiz said through a translator. ""What they did, or what they're doing right now, no, it's not fair. We don't deserve that treatment.""Ortiz said she was worried about the toll the detention was taking, especially on her son.""He has already stopped eating because of what we're going through,"" she said. ""I just hope that they release my husband so he can come back with us and that my son can be with him as well.""New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell, in a post on X, said the incident ""raises questions that require clear answers,"" including why local police weren't alerted beforehand. He also questioned whether ICE agents are targeting criminals as the Trump administration promised or, rather, ""engaging in an indiscriminate round-up of individuals with uncertain immigration status.""Galvez-Sniffin said Mendez had been in the country for four years and worked in the seafood industry in New Bedford. He had no criminal record, she said, and was in the process of applying for asylum. He had been fingerprinted in December, she said, adding nothing turned up in terms of a criminal record.""There really was no reason to treat him the way that he and his wife were treated."" Galvez-Sniffin said, adding that agents refused to look at the paperwork showing he had applied for asylum.""My biggest concern, his family's biggest concern is getting him back,"" she said. ""He has no criminal background and everything to stay for in this country.""The incident comes as the governor and law enforcement officials in New England have raised concerns about the tactics ICE is using to detain people.Last month, ICE agent Brian Sullivan took Wilson Martell-Lebron, 49, into custody as he was leaving court. Boston Municipal Court Judge Mark Summerville found Sullivan in contempt, arguing that he deprived Martell-Lebron of his rights to due process and fair trial.That case has since been dropped but the detention outside court while Martell-Lebron was on trial prompted Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden to call the actions of ICE ""troubling and extraordinarily reckless.""Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk of Turkiye, 30, is also challenging her detention by ICE. A video account shows her walking on a street in a Boston suburb as she is surrounded by immigration officials. Ozturk is heard screaming as they take her cellphone and is seen getting handcuffed. Her lawyers have called for her immediate release.","Juan Francisco Mendez and his wife Marilu Domingo Ortiz were taken into custody Monday in New Bedford, Massachusetts.

Power blackout hits all of Puerto Rico as residents prepare for Easter weekend,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/power-blackout-hits-all-of-puerto-rico-as-residents-prepare-for-easter-weekend/articleshow/120366069.cms,"Power blackout hits at Puerto Rico as residents prepare for the Easter (Source: AP)

SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO: A power blackout hit all of Puerto Rico on Wednesday as the heavily Catholic US territory prepared to celebrate the Easter weekend.All 1.4 million clients were affected, Hugo Sorrentini, spokesman for Luma Energy, which oversees the transmission and distribution of power, told The Associated Press. By late Wednesday night, crews had restored power to nearly 100,000 clients, or about 7%, although the number was expected to fluctuate.Hotels were near capacity, with thousands of tourists celebrating Easter vacations on the island. Tourism officials rushed to reassure them that many hotels and other businesses were operating with generators.Meanwhile, at least 328,000 clients were without water. ""It is unacceptable that we have a failure of this magnitude in the transmission of the electrical system,"" said governor Jenniffer Gonzalez, who cut short her weeklong vacation and flew back to Puerto Rico on Wednesday night.Officials said 90% of clients would likely have electricity 48 to 72 hours after the blackout occurred. It was not immediately clear what caused the shutdown, the latest in a string of major blackouts on the island in recent years.Thousands of Puerto Ricans were fuming over the latest outage, with many renewing their calls that the government cancel the contract with Luma and Genera PR, which oversees generation of power on the island.""This is a total disaster,"" said Orlando Huertas, 68, as he sipped a drink with a friend at a streetside bar and criticized the government for not doing enough to tackle the chronic outages.Dozens of people were forced to walk on an overpass next to the rails of the rapid transit system that serves the capital, San Juan, while scores of businesses including the biggest mall in the Caribbean were forced to close. Professional baseball and basketball games were cancelled as the hum of generators and smell of smoke filled the air. Traffic became snarled as police officers were deployed to busy intersections.Reggaeton superstar Bad Bunny echoed the collective rage, writing on X: ""When are we going to do something?"" The governor pledged late Wednesday that she would cancel the contract with Luma, but noted that while government officials have started analyzing the contract and finding possible replacements, it wouldn't be a quick process.Gonzalez also said that she has requested an in-depth investigation into the blackout, noting that officials already have warned there won't be enough generation of power for this summer, when demand peaks. ""Puerto Rico can't be the island where the power goes out all the time,"" Gonzalez said. ""We're going to take action. Let people have no doubts.""While power restoration on the main island of Puerto Rico was moving slowly to protect equipment, emergency generation stations restored power to the tiny neighboring island of Culebra and parts of neighboring Vieques, said Josue Colon, the island's so-called energy czar and former executive director of Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority.Those without generators crowded around grocery stores and other businesses to buy ice across Puerto Rico. ""I'm desperate. My generator is broken,"" said Carmen Suriel, who worried about the impact of the blackout on her two children, a six-month-old and a five-year-old with Down syndrome, as the temperature rose across Puerto Rico on Wednesday.Alma Ramirez, 69, said she was frustrated with the constant outages, some of which had already damaged her TV and microwave, forcing her to buy new appliances. ""They have to improve,"" she said of the government. ""Those who are affected are us, the poor.""The island of 3.2 million residents has a more than 40 per cent poverty rate, and not everyone can afford solar panels or generators. While there was a push to use more renewable energy sources under the administration of former US President Joe Biden, which provided Puerto Rico with mega generators and other resources, experts worry that won't happen under U.S. President Donald Trump.Roughly 117,000 homes and businesses on the island have solar rooftops. Meanwhile, petroleum-fired power plants provide 62 per cent of Puerto Rico's power, natural gas 24 per cent, coal 8 per cent and renewables 7 per cent, according to the US Energy Information Administration.Daniel Hernandez, vice president of operations at Genera PR, said at a news conference that a disturbance hit the transmission system shortly after noon on Wednesday, during a time when the grid is vulnerable because there are not many machines regulating frequency at that hour.Veronica Ferraiuoli, acting governor and secretary of state for Puerto Rico, said the White House reached out to local officials and said they are available if needed. Pablo Jose Hernandez, Puerto Rico's representative in Congress, said he would work to ensure that ""Washington understands the real and urgent situation Puerto Ricans face every day.""""The electric grid crisis is frustrating, and after years of blackouts, it feels like it's going from bad to worse,"" he said. The last islandwide blackout occurred on New Year's Eve.Puerto Rico has struggled with chronic outages since September 2017 when hurricane Maria pummeled the island as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing a power grid that crews are still struggling to rebuild. The grid already had been deteriorating as a result of decades of a lack of maintenance and investment under Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority, which is struggling to restructure more than $9 billion in debt.","All 1.4 million clients were affected, spokesman for Luma Energy said. Crews had restored power to nearly 100,000 clients, or about 7%.

US President Donald Trump hugged Patty Morin , the grieving mother of Rachel Morin , during an emotional moment at the White House on Wednesday, reports the Daily Mail.“She’s been through hell,” Trump said, as he held her in the Oval Office .Rachel Morin, a mother of five from Maryland , was raped and murdered while hiking. Her killer, Victor Martinez-Hernandez , a fugitive from El Salvador , was later convicted of the crime.Trump invited Morin to the White House as part of his push to defend strict deportation policies . Comforting her during the meeting, he told her, “Your daughter is looking down proud of you, you know that… she’s proud of you.”The appearance came just hours after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt slammed Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen for flying to El Salvador to visit Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia. Garcia, a Maryland man and father of three, was deported in March — a move Van Hollen claims was mistaken. However, the Trump administration insists Garcia is tied to a violent gang.“Maryland Democrat Senator Chris Van Hollen rushed to Dulles Airport this morning to fly to El Salvador, potentially using taxpayer dollars to demand the release of deported illegal alien, MS-13 terrorist,” Leavitt told reporters, calling the trip “appalling and sad.”Leavitt then brought out Patty Morin as a “special guest” to make her voice heard.Morin then criticised Van Hollen, saying that the Maryland senator ""barely acknowledged"" the death of her daughter.“The senator from Maryland who didn’t even acknowledge — or barely acknowledged — my daughter and the brutal death that she endured, leaving her five children without a mother, chose to use my tax money to fly to El Salvador to bring back a person who isn’t even an American citizen,” she said.Furthermore, Morin said that President Trump wants to remove criminals from the country, and as American citizens, it is their duty to do the same.“These are the kind of criminals President Trump wants to remove from our country. These are the kind of criminals that we need to remove from our country. We are American citizens. Why should we allow people like this, violent criminals that have no conscience at all to murder our mothers, our sisters, our daughters? I don’t understand,"" said Morin.","Patty Morin, the grieving mother of Rachel Morin, met with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Wednesday.

It was God saying to the world ‘I love you’,” he quoted Reverend Billy Graham.Trump used the occasion to highlight the work of his administration and his 2024 campaign vision , declaring that “we’re making America great again” and vowing to continue defending Christian values, securing borders, and reforming education. He also cited recent political wins and asserted that “there is a whole new spirit in our country.”The evening concluded with musical performances and prayers led by various faith leaders, with Trump reiterating, “With God’s help, we can overcome every challenge… and restore the spirit of faith in the United States for generations to come.”","US President Donald Trump hosted a special Easter prayer service and dinner at the White House.

Video conferencing platform Zoom faced a major global outage on Friday, disrupting core services including video meetings, its website, and mobile applications. Zoom Communications later said it had resolved the issue, which left tens of thousands of users worldwide unable to connect.At the peak of the disruption around 3:01 p.m. ET, Downdetector.com — which tracks service outages — reported as many as 67,280 user complaints, primarily from the United States but also from several other countries. Users encountered error code 503 , commonly linked to server-side issues.“Service has now been restored after the earlier outage,” Zoom confirmed on X (formerly Twitter), after earlier acknowledging “domain name resolution issues on the zoom.us domain that is affecting multiple services.”The company is still investigating the cause of the outage and has not officially confirmed whether it was a cyberattack. However, several users on social media claimed that a hacking group named DarkStorm was behind a DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack targeting Zoom.“We do work on USA platforms as we said,” the group posted on X, prompting further speculation. Zoom has yet to comment on the alleged attack.According to Zoom’s status page, the disruption impacted multiple services including Zoom Meetings, Zoom Phone, Zoom Contact Center, and the company’s main website. Downdetector also recorded over 50,000 problem reports during the incident.A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a target server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic. Unlike a traditional Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, which typically comes from a single source, a DDoS attack originates from multiple sources, often using thousands of compromised devices such as computers, smartphones, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices. These devices, collectively known as a ""botnet,"" are controlled remotely by cybercriminals without the knowledge of their owners.The goal of a DDoS attack is to exhaust the resources of the target system, making it unable to respond to legitimate requests. This can cause the targeted website, service, or network to slow down, become unavailable, or crash entirely. DDoS attacks can affect any online service, including websites, applications, and cloud-based platforms.DDoS attacks are difficult to defend against due to their distributed nature. The sheer volume of traffic can overwhelm even the most advanced security systems. Businesses and organizations often implement various strategies, such as traffic filtering and load balancing, to mitigate the impact of these attacks.","Zoom faced a major global outage on Friday, disrupting core services including video meetings, its website, and mobile applications.

The IRS is expected to make a final determination in the coming weeks, CNN reported.This latest move marks a sharp escalation in the administration’s crackdown on elite universities accused of tolerating antisemitic incidents amid rising tensions on US campuses. It comes just weeks after the DOJ launched a sweeping review of Harvard’s federal contracts and grants, following similar scrutiny of Columbia University.President Donald Trump , who has frequently criticised Ivy League institutions, posted a scathing attack on Harvard via social media, writing, “Harvard has been hiring almost all woke, Radical Left, idiots and ‘birdbrains’ who are only capable of teaching FAILURE to students and so-called ‘future leaders’.” He added, “Harvard is a JOKE, teaches Hate and Stupidity, and should no longer receive Federal Funds.”The Department of Education had earlier announced it would review over $255 million in contracts and nearly $9 billion in grants involving Harvard and its affiliates. “Harvard’s failure to protect students on campus from anti-Semitic discrimination — all while promoting divisive ideologies over free inquiry — has put its reputation in serious jeopardy,” said Education Secretary Linda McMahon.“Harvard has served as a symbol of the American Dream for generations,” McMahon added, “but it must uphold its responsibility to ensure student safety and academic integrity .”",The IRS is expected to make a final determination in the coming weeks.

White House press briefing: Patty Morin shares story of her daughter's murder

Patty Morin , the mother of Rachel Morin murdered in Maryland, made a rare and emotional appearance at the White House on Wednesday. Her daughter was killed in 2023. The man found guilty recently, Victor Martinez-Hernandez, had illegally entered the United States from El Salvador.Morin, invited as a “special guest,” addressed reporters alongside White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt .“Why should we allow violent criminals that have no conscience at all to murder our mothers, our sisters, our daughters?” she asked. “We are American citizens. We need to protect our families, our borders, our children.”She also urged the press to report the truth: “Please tell the truth. Tell how violent it really is. This is about protecting our children. It’s more than just politics or votes or just anything,” she said before leaving the room.The sudden briefing appeared to be a direct response to criticism over the mistaken deportation of another Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, as Leavitt began the briefing by attacking Democrats for criticising the deportation of Garcia, who had no connection to Morin’s case.Abrego Garcia, 29, was living in Maryland with his wife and child under a special immigration status that protected him from being deported. But despite a judge’s order allowing him to remain in the United States due to fears of gang persecution in El Salvador, he was deported last month.The Trump administration later admitted the removal was the result of an “administrative error”, but has since refused to comply with a Supreme Court directive to bring him back.","Patty Morin, the mother of Rachel Morin murdered in Maryland, made a rare and emotional appearance at the White House on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: The Bloach rebels hijacked Pakistan 's Jaffar Express last month using US weapons, which American forces left behind during the hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, reported Washington Post.Weapons were left behind by United States forces following their 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. Among the weapons recovered from the scene was an M4A1 carbine rifle manufactured by Colt, an American arms maker, ARY News reported.The rifle's serial number reportedly confirmed that it was originally supplied to US forces in Afghanistan and later left behind during the chaotic withdrawal.The Bloach Liberation Army (BLA) opened fire on a passenger train in southwestern Pakistan on March 11, injuring the train driver. The train with over 400 passengers aboard was traveling from Quetta in Balochistan province to Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa when it came under attack.Rescue teams and security forces arrived at the scene, launching an operation which went on for more than 24 hours. The Pakistan security officials said that no passenger was hurt and “the number of passengers who fell victim to the barbarism of the terrorists is 21.”""On March 11 in Bolan, terrorists targeted a railroad track around 1pm and blew it up and stopped the Jaffar Express.

You saw that around 100 passengers were safely rescued yesterday evening from the terrorists, and today as well, a large number of passengers have been recovered,"" he said, adding that the process continued intermittently.For decades, separatist militant groups in Balochistan have waged an insurgency, frequently targeting the government, army, and Chinese interests while demanding a greater share of the region's mineral wealth.

Baloch separatists kill 8 Pakistanis in Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/baloch-separatists-kill-8-pakistanis-in-iran/articleshow/120262403.cms,"ISLAMABAD:

Eight Pakistani car mechanics were shot dead in Iran late Saturday, sparking outrage and deepening fears that the country was becoming a hub for anti-Pakistan militants after Afghanistan.Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack in Sistan-Baluchestan province, escalating tensions between the neighbouring countries as Pakistan demanded swift action. The eight workers hailed from Punjab -- Pakistan’s most populous province -- and were killed at a workshop in Mehrestan district, near Afghanistan’s border, Pakistani authorities said.BNA framed the killings as retaliation against perceived Punjabi dominance in Balochistan’s economic and political spheres. “We will not allow outsiders to exploit our land and resources,” BNA said in an online statement, echoing long-standing Baloch grievances over resource exploitation and marginalisation. The outfit has aligned itself with the broader Baloch insurgency led by groups like Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif called the attack “barbaric”. “We demand the perpetrators be brought to justice swiftly,” he said, urging Tehran to act. Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to help the victims’ families and repatriate the bodies. Foreign minister Ishaq Dar issued a similar condemnation. “This attack challenges our sovereignty. We cannot allow our citizens to be targeted abroad,” Dar said.Iran’s response was measured but conspicuously vague. Ambassador Reza Amiri Moghadam condemned the killings as “inhumane and cowardly”, calling terrorism a “chronic plight” that demands regional cooperation. Yet, Tehran offered no concrete assurances of cracking down on groups like BNA, prompting scepticism in Islamabad.Thousands of Pakistanis, particularly from economically deprived areas, travel to Iran on a regular basis to take up informal jobs in sectors such as vehicle repairs, construction, and agriculture.In Jan 2024, nine Pakistani labourers were killed and three critically injured in a similar attack in Saravancity, also located in Iran’s southeastern border region. Like in the latest killings, the victims in that case worked in an automobile repair shop. These murders occurred at a time when Pakistan and Iran were attempting to repair diplomatic relations after tit-for-tat missile and drone attacks.","Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack.

The resolution also demanded an immediate halt to any plans or work related to the project until an agreement with all provincial governments, especially Sindh, was reached to ensure that the province's rights were fully protected and respected.While addressing a PPP rally in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh on the anniversary of Pakistan's former Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's execution, Bhutto said that the PPP had always fought for peoples' rights to water, Dawn reported.He said, ""The workers of the PPP have grown old fighting for the fair distribution of water.""

Poll Do you believe that Pakistan is adequately prepared for earthquakes? No Yes

A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.Tremors were felt across many parts of the Valley, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or property damage. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometres, with coordinates of 33.63 degrees North latitude and 72.46 degrees East longitude.According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the recent earthquake struck at a shallow depth of 10km, increasing the likelihood of aftershocks.Shallow earthquakes are typically more dangerous than deeper ones because the seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface, causing stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and higher casualties.Pakistan, located on the boundary of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, is one of the most seismically active countries. The nation frequently experiences destructive earthquakes due to its position on major fault lines. Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and Gilgit-Baltistan lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir are on the north-western edge of the Indian plate. The collision of these plates makes the region highly susceptible to violent earthquakes.Earlier, Pakistan’s neighbor Tajikistan was also jolted by a 4.2 magnitude earthquake.","A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.

Poll Should the Pakistani military have a role in politics? No, it undermines democracy. Yes, they provide stability.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political landscape remains a battleground of competing forces, with the military, former prime minister Imran Khan, and the current govt under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif locked in a tense struggle.The interplay of US foreign policy and the Pakistani diaspora’s growing voice adds further complexity to a nation grappling with economic woes, security threats and democratic erosion.Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars. Convicted on corruption and state secret charges, the cricketer-turned-politician retains a fervent base, accusing the military and Sharif’s govt of colluding with the US to orchestrate his downfall.Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) alleges widespread rigging in the Feb 2024 elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secure power through a fragile coalition. PTI supporters, galvanised by Khan’s claims, have staged protests, clashing with the security forces and deepening the political divide.The military, longtime kingmaker in Pakistani politics, appears to have shifted allegiance. Once Khan’s backer in his 2018 rise, the army soured on him after policy disputes and his public criticisms of General Asim Munir, the current army chief.Analysts suggest the military now props up Sharif’s govt, a dynamic evident in legislative moves like the 2023 Pakistan Army Act amendment, which stifled dissent and empowered the armed forces. This hybrid regime – blending electoral democracy with military influence – has drawn scrutiny for undermining constitutional norms, yet the generals show no sign of relinquishing their grip.However, Shehbaz Sharif, re-elected in March 2024 as PM, faces a legitimacy crisis. His coalition, including the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and other smaller factions, struggles to address surging militant attacks, crumbling infrastructure, and an economy reliant on IMF bailouts.Sharif vows to mend ties with Washington but his govt’s dependence on military support raises questions about its autonomy. Khan’s call for an election audit, echoed in a letter to the IMF, threatens to derail these efforts as Pakistan awaits a critical loan installment.The US role remains contentious. Khan’s unproven claims of a Washington-led conspiracy resonate with a populace wary of foreign interference, a sentiment rooted in decades of strained relations. The Biden administration, while engaging Sharif’s govt, has maintained robust military ties with Pakistan, prioritising counter-terrorism over democratic concerns. This ambivalence has fuelled Khan’s narrative, even as US officials dismiss his allegations.Meanwhile, the Pakistani diaspora, particularly in the US, has emerged as a vocal force. Pro-democracy activists, many aligned with PTI, have lobbied Congress, securing bipartisan support for resolutions condemning elections irregularities and Khan’s detention. Over 100 lawmakers have urged his release, while some advocate sanctions against military leaders like Munir. This diaspora-driven pressure marks a shift, challenging the traditional US-Pakistan security nexus.As Pakistan teeters between chaos and stability, the military’s shadow looms large, Khan’s defiance endures, and Sharif’s govt navigates a treacherous path. With the US and Pakistani diaspora adding external weight, the nation’s democratic future hangs in the balance.","Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars.

"Shutter-down strike, road blockades grip Balochistan as Akhtar Mengal leads protest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shutter-down-strike-road-blockades-grip-balochistan-as-akhtar-mengal-leads-protest/articleshow/120080322.cms,"Pakistan's flag

Poll Do you support the call for a long march by Sardar Akhtar Mengal? No, I do not support it. Yes, I support it.

ISLAMABAD: A tense standoff unfolded across Balochistan on Monday as a shutter-down strike and widespread road blockades sparked by nationalist leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal ’s call for a “long march” from Lakpass to Quetta paralysed the Pakistani province.The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists, including women leaders of Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC), amid escalating clashes with authorities.Shops businesses and schools remained closed in cities like Quetta, Kalat, Mastung Khuzdar, and Gwadar. Mengal’s supporters blocked key highways, including the Quetta-Karachi national highway.The provincial govt’s deployment of containers, trenches, and police checkpoints at Lakpass, roughly 30 km from Quetta, stalled the march, forcing demonstrators onto rugged mountain routes.Reports of police using teargas and shelling BNP-M workers have intensified the unrest.Mengal, addressing a sit-in at Lakpass, accused the state of oppression and vowed to press forward. “The state may crush us, but we won’t bow,” he declared, signalling plans to escalate the march into province-wide resistance. The protest began March 28 in Wadh, Mengal’s hometown, following the arrest of BYC leaders, including Mahrang Baloch, during a crackdown on their Quetta sit-in. A suicide bombing near the rally on March 29 left Mengal unharmed but underscored the volatile stakes.Balochistan’s govt, led by chief minister Sarfraz Bugti, has taken a hard line. His spokesperson, Shahid Rind, warned Mengal of arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Act if the march entered Quetta’s Red Zone.Negotiations have faltered, with Mengal dismissing the provincial govt’s delegations as powerless to meet demands. BYC, however, rallied behind Mengal, urging highway blockades and strikes to amplify pressure.Analysts see it as a critical juncture for Balochistan, where grievances over state repression, enforced disappearances and resource exploitation fuel dissent. The shutter-down has disrupted public life, with Quetta’s land links to 12 districts severed for over a week. With cellular networks down and security tightened, the province braces for what Mengal’s supporters call a defining fight.","The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists.

Ice stupas

Harvest seasons multiply

HUSSAINABAD: At the foot of Pakistan's impossibly high mountains whitened by frost all year round, farmers grappling with a lack of water have created their own ice towers.Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan, a remote region home to K2, the world's second-highest peak.Farmers in the Skardu valley, at an altitude of up to 2,600 metres (8,200 feet) in the shadow of the Karakoram mountain range, searched online for help in how to irrigate their apple and apricot orchards.""We discovered artificial glaciers on YouTube,"" Ghulam Haider Hashmi told AFP.They watched the videos of Sonam Wangchuk , an environmental activist and engineer in the Indian region of Ladakh, less than 200 kilometres away across a heavily patrolled border, who developed the technique about 10 years ago.Water is piped from streams into the village, and sprayed into the air during the freezing winter temperatures.""The water must be propelled so that it freezes in the air when temperatures drop below zero, creating ice towers,"" said Zakir Hussain Zakir, a professor at the University of Baltistan.The ice forms in the shape of cones that resemble Buddhist stupas, and act as a storage system -- steadily melting throughout spring when temperatures rise.Gilgit-Baltistan has 13,000 glaciers -- more than any other country on Earth outside the polar regions.Their beauty has made the region one of the country's top tourist destinations -- towering peaks loom over the Old Silk Road, still visible from a highway transporting tourists between cherry orchards, glaciers and ice-blue lakes.Sher Muhammad, a specialist in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan mountain range that stretches from Afghanistan to Myanmar, however said most of the region's water supply comes from snow melt in spring, with a fraction from annual glacial melt in summers.""From late October until early April, we were receiving heavy snowfall. But in the past few years, it's quite dry,"" Muhammad, a researcher at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), told AFP.The first ""ice stupas"" in Gilgit-Baltistan were created in 2018.Now, more than 20 villages make them every winter, and ""more than 16,000 residents have access to water without having to build reservoirs or tanks"", said Rashid-ud-Din, provincial head of GLOF-2, a UN-Pakistan plan to adapt to the effects of climate change.Farmer Muhammad Raza told AFP that eight stupas were built in his village of Hussainabad this winter, trapping approximately 20 million litres of water in the ice.""We no longer have water shortages during planting,"" he said, since the open-air reservoirs appeared on the slopes of the valley.""Before, we had to wait for the glaciers to melt in June to get water, but the stupas saved our fields,"" said Ali Kazim, also a farmer in the valley.Before the stupas, ""we planted our crops in May"", said 26-year-old Bashir Ahmed who grows potatoes, wheat and barley in nearby Pari village which has also adopted the method.And ""we only had one growing season, whereas now we can plant two or three times"" a year.Temperatures in Pakistan rose twice as fast between 1981 and 2005 compared to the global average, putting the country on the front line of climate change impacts, including water scarcity.Its 240 million inhabitants live in a territory that is 80 percent arid or semi-arid and depends on rivers and streams originating in neighbouring countries for more than three-quarters of its water.Glaciers are melting rapidly in Pakistan and across the world, with a few exceptions including the Karakoram mountain range, increasing the risk of flooding and reducing water supply over the long term.""Faced with climate change, there are neither rich nor poor, neither urban nor rural; the whole world has become vulnerable,"" said 24-year-old Yasir Parvi.""In our village, with the ice stupas, we decided to take a chance.""","Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan. More than 20 villages make the ice stupas every winter, which provides 16,000 residents access to water. Water is piped from streams into the village and sprayed into the air during the freezing winter temperatures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120037712,imgsize-1455365,width-400,resizemode-4/article-15.jpg"

Who are the militant groups?



Poll Do you believe the rise in militant attacks in Pakistan is primarily due to the influence of groups based in Afghanistan? No, not at all Yes, definitely

Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim. It said that the Taliban provided support to the TTP and that some attacks were launched from Afghan territory.As a consequence, the Pakistani government has urged the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan to act against the allegedly responsible criminals. Kabul, on the other hand, denies that the militants are in Afghanistan.","Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

The former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize , recognising his contributions to human rights and democratic values.The nomination was announced by members of the Pakistan World Alliance (PWA), an advocacy organisation established in December, who are also affiliated with the Norwegian political party Partiet Sentrum.""We are pleased to announce on behalf of Partiet Sentrum that in alliance with somebody with the right to nominate, have nominated Imran Khan, the former prime minister of Pakistan, to the Nobel Peace Prize for his work with human rights and democracy in Pakistan,"" Partiet Sentrum posted on X on Sunday.Previously also, Khan received a Nobel Peace Prize nomination in 2019 for his endeavours to foster peace across South Asia.Strangely in his own country, the Centre has claimed that Imran Khan orchestrated the riots in the country.The Norwegian Nobel Committee evaluates hundreds of nominations annually through an extensive eight-month selection process before choosing a winner, according to The Express Tribune.Khan, who established Pakistan's primary opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), has been in custody since August 2023.In January, authorities sentenced Khan to 14 years' imprisonment for corruption and misuse of authority charges.This verdict marked his fourth significant conviction.Higher courts have since overturned or suspended three previous convictions related to state gift sales, state secret disclosures, and marriage irregularities.Following a no-confidence vote in April 2022, Khan was removed from office. He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

A moderate earthquake struck the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan early Wednesday morning, with tremors felt across parts of the seismically active zone.According to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS), the earthquake measured 5.9 on the Richter scale and occurred at 4.43 am IST, with its epicentre located at latitude 35.83 N and longitude 70.60 E.The NCS also reported that the quake struck at a depth of 75 kilometres beneath the Earth's surface.While there were no immediate reports of casualties or large-scale damage, experts remain concerned about the impact on communities already vulnerable due to ongoing humanitarian challenges.Afghanistan is one of the most disaster-prone countries in South Asia. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) has repeatedly warned that Afghanistan remains highly exposed to natural hazards such as floods, landslides, and earthquakes.According to UNOCHA, frequent seismic activity continues to damage regions with weak infrastructure, saying, “These frequent earthquakes in Afghanistan cause damage to vulnerable communities, which are already grappling with decades of conflict and under-development and have left them with little resilience to cope with multiple simultaneous shocks.”Afghanistan's susceptibility to earthquakes stems from its position on several active fault lines, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.According to the Red Cross, the Hindu Kush mountain range, where the latest quake occurred, is especially active and experiences earthquakes on a near-annual basis. A significant fault line also runs through Herat province, further raising the risk of future tremors.",A moderate earthquake struck the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan early Wednesday morning.

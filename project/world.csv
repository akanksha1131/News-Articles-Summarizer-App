Saqqara burial grounds reveal new insights into Old Kingdom Egypt



Statues, chairs, and headless figures



Additional royal connections within the tomb



Evidence of tomb reuse across centuries



Statues moved from a royal pyramid







Archaeologists came across an astonishing yet perplexing discovery while excavating the site of the historic tomb area in the region called Saqqara, which is situated 25 kilometers south of the capital city of Egypt, Cairo. This tomb has been identified and recognised to be 4,000 years old and belonged to an important figure known as the “Prince Waser-If-Re” belonging to the Old Kingdom era of Egypt. Among the various astonishing discoveries that the site has offered regarding the history of the area under excavation is the discovery of an enormous door belonging to the site that is almost 14 feet in height and constructed using pink granite. Therefore, the door has been identified as astonishing since the door did not open to nothing at all.The discovery has sparked new interest in the symbolism of the ancient Egyptians' tombs and has raised questions regarding the Fifth Dynasty's rituals, beliefs, and status.Saqqara has long been acknowledged as one of the most important burial sites in Egypt and has served as a vast necropolis for the ancient Egyptian capital of Memphis.The newly unearthed tomb is believed to be that of Prince Waser-if-Re, the son of the king who established Egypt's Fifth Dynasty.It was excavated through a collaborative effort by both the Supreme Council of Antiquities and the Zahi Hawass Foundation for Archaeological and Heritage. According to the official statements from the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, it may be established that this dates back to the Old Kingdom period and may, therefore, represent one of the oldest of this kind of monumental tombs. Among the significant features of this particular tomb was the size of the false door that was carved from pink granite. It measured over 14 feet in height and more than three feet in width.Nevertheless, this large and intimidating door was not meant to operate in this mode. Rather, it was used in a symbolic role. In ancient Egyptian spirituality, false doors were seen to provide spiritual gates through which the movement of the deceased was allowed. It would seem that this large and luxurious door was used by individuals of great importance, such as Prince Waser-If-Re.Several hieroglyphs carved on its sides, on granite stone, recorded numerous titles held by the prince. They included titles of hereditary prince, royal scribe, vizier, judge, regional governors within crucial areas of jurisdiction, and chanting priest. This again supports the notion that it was not a door of access.Beyond that, there were other pink granite furniture pieces, a collection not often seen in a single burial. Among those pieces was a collection of thirteen high-back chairs, each adorned with a seated statue. It was theorized that these statues were those of the prince's wives. However, there were two pieces that were missing their head pieces.One aspect worthy of note in the tomb is the predominant practice of using pink granite. Pink granite is both costly to import as well as transport. It is mostly utilised in the 近dconstruction of palaces.Also, within the tomb, there was a second entry that had pink granite, topped with a cartouche of Fifth Dynasty King Neferirkare, a previous pharaoh. At other parts of the location, there were other finds thatincluded a black granite statue, which had toppled over, measuring over four feet, as well as a red granite offering table that had inscriptions showing details pertaining to ritual sacrifices.These details suggest that apart from being a tomb, this was a place of ritual, perhaps even where offerings were made long after the prince in question died.Although originally constructed during the Old Kingdom, the tomb appears to have been reused centuries later. Archaeologists identified inscriptions and statues linked to the 26th Dynasty, indicating that the site remained significant well into Egypt’s later periods.One notable find was a black granite statue of a standing male figure, inscribed with names and titles associated with the 26th Dynasty. This reuse reflects a common practice in ancient Egypt, where older tombs were adapted or repurposed due to their prestige, location, or spiritual importance.Among the most surprising discoveries were statues of King Djoser, his wife, and his ten daughters. Archaeologist Zahi Hawass believes these figures were originally housed in a chamber near Djoser’s step pyramid before being relocated to the tomb of Prince Waser-If-Re.Why these statues were moved remains unclear. Archaeologists plan to continue excavations in the surrounding area to determine whether political shifts, religious practices, or preservation efforts prompted the relocation.","Saqqara burial grounds reveal new insights into Old Kingdom Egypt.

A few weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, Minneapolis was again rocked by the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti on January 24, 2026, during a federal immigration enforcement operation. Both deaths followed a grimly similar arc. Both involved fatal force used by immigration-linked federal agents against US citizens. Both were justified by official statements as responses to imminent danger. And in both cases, bystander videos and eyewitness accounts quickly complicated that narrative.In Good’s case, an ICE agent shot her while she sat in her vehicle. In Pretti’s, agents shot him at close range after a chaotic struggle on a snow-covered street. In each instance, federal officials described dangerous encounters. In each, video evidence suggested the victims were not posing an immediate threat at the moment they were killed. The shootings occurred within the same month, amid an intensified immigration crackdown that has already triggered protests, anger and a growing crisis of trust in the city.Alex Pretti was a 37-year-old registered nurse at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System and a resident of south Minneapolis.Family members and colleagues described him as compassionate, civic-minded and deeply shaped by a career spent caring for critically ill patients. His father said Pretti was disturbed by the scale and tactics of federal immigration operations unfolding around him.Pretti had no serious criminal history beyond minor traffic violations. He was a lawful gun owner with a valid permit to carry. His family has rejected federal claims that he posed a violent threat, saying he was filming agents and attempting to help a woman during the encounter. They described early official portrayals of him as “sickening lies” and demanded transparency and accountability.Pretti was present during a large federal immigration enforcement action in Minneapolis, part of a broader deployment under Operation Metro Surge. Video footage shows him holding a phone and recording agents rather than behaving aggressively.During the encounter, a woman nearby was sprayed with a chemical agent. Pretti appears to step toward her to help, still holding his phone. Moments later, agents spray Pretti himself and then forcefully tackle him to the ground. That sequence — filming, moving to assist someone in distress, then being subdued — has been consistently described in eyewitness and video-based reporting.A frame-by-frame analysis by The New York Times Visual Investigations team, based on multiple verified videos, reconstructs the final moments before Alex Pretti was killed and directly contradicts key elements of the federal account.The videos show a small group of demonstrators standing in the street, speaking with a federal agent as whistles sound. Alex Pretti is visible among them, holding his phone and filming the scene, and at moments appears to be directing traffic around the protest area. No weapon is visible in his hands.An agent begins pushing demonstrators and sprays pepper spray at their faces. At this moment, Pretti’s hands are clearly visible: one holding his phone, the other raised defensively to shield himself from the spray.As others are sprayed, Pretti moves toward a woman who has just been hit with the chemical agent and appears to assist her. Agents approach him from behind as he does so.Several agents grab Pretti and pull him away. A struggle follows as they force him to his knees and then to the ground. The footage shows agents grabbing his legs, pushing down on his back, and striking him repeatedly while restraining him.As multiple agents pin Pretti to the ground, one agent is seen approaching the group with empty hands, reaching in as others hold Pretti down. His arms appear pinned near his head.About eight seconds after Pretti is already restrained, agents are heard shouting that he has a gun. The timing suggests, according to the Times’ analysis, that agents may not have realised he was armed until after he was on the ground.The same agent who approached with empty hands pulls a handgun from within the cluster of bodies. The firearm appears to match the type that the Department of Homeland Security later said belonged to Pretti. At this point, Pretti remains pinned and under control.As the gun emerges, another agent aims his weapon at Pretti’s back and appears to fire a shot at point-blank range. He continues firing as Pretti collapses. A third agent then unholsters a weapon, and both agents appear to fire additional shots into Pretti as he lies motionless.The NYT analysis concludes that at least ten shots were fired within roughly five seconds.Pretti’s family described him as someone whose professional life revolved around saving lives, not threatening them. They emphasised that he was filming and trying to help someone who had been sprayed when agents confronted him. Vigils and protests followed, reflecting a broader sense that Minneapolis was reliving a familiar and unresolved trauma. City and state leaders called for independent investigations and greater transparency.Pretti’s death was the third serious shooting involving federal immigration agents in Minneapolis within weeks. Earlier in January, an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good. Days later, another federal agent shot and wounded a Venezuelan man during the same enforcement surge. Together, the incidents have fuelled claims that the city has become a testing ground for aggressive federal tactics with little margin for error.Federal officials have defended their personnel, framing Pretti’s killing as a defensive act during an attempt to disarm an armed individual. They have emphasised that he possessed a 9mm handgun and magazines and say agents acted to protect themselves. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem echoed that line, saying federal agents were operating in a “high-risk environment” and had responded to what they believed was an immediate threat. She warned against “second-guessing split-second decisions” made by officers on the ground and argued that criticism of the agents risked undermining immigration enforcement efforts nationwide. Critics counter that possession alone is not the issue. The central dispute is whether Pretti posed an imminent threat at the moment lethal force was used — something the videos, so far, do not clearly establish.Concerns about how Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are trained and deployed have sharpened in the wake of recent federal actions in Minneapolis, particularly after the fatal shootings of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti and the protests that followed. Critics point to several structural issues:ICE academy instruction has reportedly been shortened significantly in recent years, from several months to a matter of weeks. Critics argue that this compression limits agents’ ability to develop judgment, threat assessment and de-escalation skills needed in fast-moving civilian encounters.Expanded enforcement has been accompanied by a hiring surge, raising concerns that agents are being deployed quickly into the field without sufficient experience, supervision or vetting, especially in dense urban settings.Legal experts and civil liberties groups say ICE agents receive far less training in de-escalation than local police departments, despite being placed in situations involving bystanders, protests and emotionally charged confrontations.Federal immigration agents are not primarily trained for protest-adjacent or crowd-management scenarios, a gap that becomes visible when enforcement actions spill into public spaces with onlookers and demonstrators.Video from Minneapolis has intensified criticism of tactics such as early and liberal use of chemical sprays, rapid escalation to physical force, and domination-style restraints, which critics argue can inflame situations rather than stabilise them.Local officials say ICE tactics often reflect a rural or border-zone enforcement mindset that does not translate well to large cities, where encounters unfold in full public view and require greater restraint and coordination.The repeated involvement of federal agents in fatal encounters has fuelled questions about oversight, use-of-force standards and whether immigration agents are subject to the same transparency expectations as local police.Taken together, these concerns suggest that the surge of federal immigration officers into Minneapolis, armed with compressed training and operating in a city already on edge, may be increasing the likelihood of deadly confrontations rather than preventing them.The killing of Alex Pretti triggered a fierce political backlash. Kamala Harris said the videos were “heartbreaking” and that Pretti appeared to be “doing everything in his power to protect his community,” calling for a full and transparent investigation. Progressive Democrats sharpened their criticism. Ilhan Omar said the incident appeared to be “an execution by immigration enforcement,” while Elizabeth Warren called the shooting “horrific” and demanded accountability. Republicans rallied behind federal agents. Donald Trump defended the operation, saying “let ICE do their job,” and warned that criticism of enforcement would embolden criminals. Other Republicans echoed that view, stressing officer safety and law-and-order priorities.The divide was familiar but stark: Democrats focused on video evidence, restraint and accountability; Republicans on authority, enforcement and perceived threats.","Alex Pretti, 37, was a registered nurse at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System and a resident of south Minneapolis.

What UAE residents need to know



Unsettled winters in UAE: A growing pattern?



Safety tips for UAE residents



Slow down and allow extra braking distance in rain or mist.

Use headlights and fog lights appropriately.

Stay updated on road advisories from local authorities.

Monitor air quality if winds kick up dust, especially for children and the elderly.

Postpone strenuous outdoor events if winds become gusty.

Check sea condition reports before sailing or swimming, rougher waters are possible.

Avoid small craft outings during peak wind gusts.

Follow updates from the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) and official weather channels to get the latest advisories as conditions evolve.

Bottom line





The United Arab Emirates is gearing up for a spell of unsettled winter weather that is expected to bring clouds, light rain , gusty winds and even blowing dust over the coming days, a marked shift from the typically dry winter skies residents are used to. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) says a low-pressure system moving across the region is behind the unstable conditions forecast through much of the week.Weather conditions across the UAE today will be partly cloudy to cloudy at times, particularly over coastal, northern and eastern regions, with a chance of rainfall in some areas. Winds are expected to be light to moderate, but may strengthen at intervals, stirring up dust in open areas and briefly reducing visibility.Adding to the wintry feel, the lowest temperature in the country this morning dropped to 5.8°C, recorded at Jais Mountain in Ras Al Khaimah at 4am, underscoring the cooler conditions gripping the northern mountainous areas as the UAE experiences its winter peak.This change in weather comes amid an overall pattern of winter variability, with cooler temperatures in the mountains and partly cloudy skies near the coast.Daytime highs will still be mild, in the mid-20s Celsius but residents should prepare for intermittent rain, dropping temperatures, humidity overnight and dust-raising winds.According to the latest weather outlook from the NCM -Unsettled weather can affect daily routines, especially travel. Light rain or mist in the mornings may lead to slippery roads and reduced visibility for motorists, and gusty winds could impact driving conditions in exposed areas. Drivers should stay alert and adjust speeds accordingly. Recent traffic safety guides note that rainy or unstable conditions can lead to longer braking distances and recommend extra caution behind the wheel, particularly in reduced visibility or wet roads.Dust-raising winds and sudden cloud build-ups can disrupt outdoor plans, from sporting events to picnics. Although daytime temperatures remain pleasant for winter, blown dust can cause air quality dips and eye or respiratory irritation, especially for sensitive individuals such as children and those with asthma.For marine enthusiasts and sailors, the forecast suggests a need for caution. Rougher seas in the Arabian Gulf could make conditions choppy for small boats and swimmers. Coastal communities and marinas should monitor updates from the NCM before heading out on the water.Unusual bouts of winter rain and unstable weather are not unprecedented in the UAE. Historical data show the country has seen dynamic winter patterns caused by low-pressure systems and shifting wind currents, leading to intermittent rainfall, dust storms and cloudy spells. A February 2025 report noted similar patterns of wind, dust and rain due to low-pressure systems and Shamal winds.In fact, the UAE occasionally records rare weather events — such as heavy rainfall and low temperatures high in the mountains — that remind residents that winter in the Gulf can be more variable than assumed.In light of the unsettled forecast, here are some practical tips UAE residents should consider:As the UAE’s winter unfolds, residents should be prepared for a mix of cooler temperatures, intermittent rain and changing wind patterns before clearer skies return later in the week. While these conditions may not disrupt life dramatically, they highlight how quickly weather, even in an otherwise arid region, can shift with atmospheric systems passing through.Whether you are planning a beach day, a road trip, or simply a morning commute, staying ahead of the forecast and adjusting plans accordingly will help ensure safety and comfort during this unsettled weather period.","The lowest temperature in the country this morning dropped to 5.8°C, recorded at Jais Mountain in Ras Al Khaimah at 4:00 UAE Local Time.

Evidence of ancient microbial activity found in Namibian Desert rock formations

Erosion alone does not fit

Signs pointing toward biological activity

What kind of organisms could do this

Deserts hide unexpected histories

This matters for Earth and beyond





In some of the driest parts of southern Africa, rock faces hold quiet records of much older worlds. Marble and limestone formations, shaped long before today’s deserts formed, often preserve signs of shifting climates and slow geological stress. Most markings fit within known patterns of erosion or mineral change. But in scattered outcrops across Namibia and parts of the Arabian Peninsula, researchers have noticed something that sits uneasily with those explanations. Fine, repeated tunnels run through the stone in tight, parallel lines. They follow fractures but extend beyond them, cutting into solid rock. Their shape is controlled, their spacing consistent. These features appear old, inactive, and difficult to explain. They point to processes that do not operate in these environments today.The structures have been identified in desert regions of Namibia, Oman and Saudi Arabia. In Namibia, they are found in Neoproterozoic marble exposed along river valleys and plateaus far from the coast. Similar features occur in limestone formations across the Arabian Peninsula.The common factor is geological stability. These rocks have not been heavily deformed for hundreds of millions of years.The tunnels appear as bands rather than isolated holes. Each band can extend for metres, sometimes following a fracture before fading back into intact stone. Individual tunnels are small, less than a millimetre wide and only a few centimetres long. They are always aligned. They do not cross or branch randomly. This regularity is one of the details that drew attention in the field.At first glance, weathering seems an obvious explanation. Desert rocks often show pitting, flaking and chemical alteration. But these tunnels behave differently. They cut across mineral layers without disturbing them. In many cases, the original colour banding of the marble remains visible along the tunnel walls, suggesting material was removed rather than replaced.Typical karst processes produce irregular cavities and widened fractures. Crystallisation leaves angular patterns. Tectonic stress creates breaks, not fine parallel tubes. None of these processes produce tightly packed, evenly spaced borings that stop at similar depths. The geometry looks controlled, not accidental.Researchers of the article “Subfossil Fracture-Related Euendolithic Micro-burrows in Marble and Limestone” did a closer analysis that adds weight to a biological explanation. The tunnels are often filled with fine white calcite that contrasts with the host rock. Chemical testing shows that this infill is depleted in several elements compared to the surrounding stone. Along the tunnel edges, researchers have detected thin rims enriched in phosphorus and sulphur.Microscopy and spectroscopy reveal traces of degraded biological material. Carbon isotope values also fall within ranges associated with life. DNA and proteins are no longer present, which is not surprising given the age. But the chemical fingerprints remain. Together, they suggest that microorganisms once bored into the rock while alive, then left behind altered mineral chemistry when conditions changed.Endolithic microbes are known to live inside rocks in extreme environments. Some occupy cracks. Others actively dissolve minerals to create space. These organisms are found in places such as Antarctica and the Atacama Desert, where surface conditions are harsh but rock interiors offer protection.The newly described tunnels resemble endolithic activity, where microbes bore directly into carbonate rock. What's unusual is the scale and organisation. The tunnels form long bands with consistent orientation, suggesting a shared growth direction or environmental trigger. No known modern organism produces exactly this pattern. It remains unclear whether the responsible microbes still exist or are extinct.Today, the regions where these tunnels occur are hyperarid. Rain is rare. Biological activity is limited. Yet the tunnels imply conditions that once allowed sustained microbial life within the rock. That does not require lush landscapes, but it does suggest a different balance of moisture and chemistry.Because deserts preserve surfaces with little disturbance, they can lock in evidence that would be erased elsewhere. Features formed deep inside rock masses can later be exposed by erosion, appearing almost out of place in the modern climate.Carbonate rocks hold most of Earth’s carbon. Understanding how life interacts with them matters for models of the global carbon cycle. Even small biological effects, repeated over large areas and long times, can shift carbon between solid rock and the environment.These findings also matter beyond Earth. Similar carbonate rocks exist on Mars. If microbes once lived inside them, their traces might look subtle and unfamiliar. The tunnels in Namibia and Arabia show that life can leave marks that do not resemble fossils in the usual sense.The bands end quietly in fractures. There is no clear start or finish. Just traces, cut into stone, waiting to be noticed.","Mysterious ancient life found in tunnels of Africa and Arabia leave scientists searching for answers.

Ancient underground cities in Turkey reveal how entire communities lived below ground,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/ancient-underground-cities-in-turkey-reveal-how-entire-communities-lived-below-ground/articleshow/127397454.cms,"Ancient underground cities in Turkey reveal how entire communities lived below ground (AI-generated)

Turkey’s Cappadocia region contains dozens of fully developed underground cities

Why people chose to live beneath the surface

Discovered beneath Nevşehir Castle

How researchers are estimating its true size

What daily life looked like below ground

Cappadocia became a refuge zone

What the future holds for these underground cities





Beneath familiar landscapes, traces of everyday life sometimes survive in places few expect to find them. Across parts of the world, tunnels, chambers and stairways cut into rock show that living underground was once a practical choice, not a novelty. These spaces were not temporary shelters or isolated caves. They were planned environments where people cooked, stored food, worshipped and waited out danger. Many underground passages promoted today as lost cities are little more than mines or short refuges. A smaller number, however, were full habitations used over generations. In central Turkey, one This discovery is reshaping our understanding of how entire communities adapted to conflict and climate. Communities adapted to conflict and climate. The remains lie beneath modern streets, largely unseen, yet carefully organised for life below ground.The most extensive underground settlements known today are found in the Cappadocia region of central Turkey. The area is shaped by thick layers of volcanic ash rock, known as tuff, which is soft enough to carve but strong enough to hold its form. Over centuries, local communities cut rooms, corridors and shafts deep into this material.According to National Geographic , archaeologists have documented at least 36 underground cities across Cappadocia. Some were small refuges. Others expanded into multi-level complexes. The best known, Derinkuyu, reaches around 85 metres below the surface and includes living quarters, kitchens, storage rooms, chapels and ventilation shafts.Life underground offered protection. Cappadocia sat at the crossroads of empires, religions and trade routes. Invasions were frequent. When danger approached, residents could retreat below ground, seal entrances with heavy stone doors and survive for weeks or months.The underground cities were designed for this purpose. Narrow tunnels limited movement. Air shafts supplied fresh oxygen. Water channels connected to wells. Livestock were sometimes kept inside, adding warmth and food but also requiring careful ventilation.In 2013, a housing development near a Byzantine-era castle in Nevşehir revealed hidden entrances to a previously unknown underground settlement. Construction stopped, and archaeologists were called in. What they found was far larger than expected.Beneath the hilltop castle lay a network of rooms and tunnels stretching across several kilometres. Early surveys suggest the complex may rival or even exceed Derinkuyu in size. Artefacts, including ceramics, stone crosses and grinding tools, point to long-term use from Byzantine times through the Ottoman period.Geophysicists from Nevşehir University conducted detailed surveys using resistivity and seismic imaging. These methods allow scientists to map voids in rock without excavation. According to dozens of measurements, the underground city covers nearly five million square feet. Some corridors may reach depths of more than 110 metres. If confirmed, this would make the site one of the deepest known underground habitations. Researchers caution that much remains unexplored, and fragile rock conditions slow progress.The layout suggests a self-sustaining community. There are signs of kitchens, wineries and linseed presses used to produce oil for lamps. Chapels indicate regular religious practice. Storage rooms would have held grain and dried foods.Living underground was likely dark and crowded. Yet these spaces were carefully planned, not improvised. Over time, residents refined the design, expanding rooms and improving airflow. The cities were not hidden forever. People returned to the surface when threats passed.Cappadocia adopted Christianity early. By the fourth century, its bishops held influence within the Byzantine Empire. This religious identity made the region a target during centuries of conflict over Anatolia. Muslim forces arrived in the late eighth century. Later came the Seljuk Turks, followed by Ottoman rule. Through each shift, underground cities provided continuity. They allowed communities to endure without constant rebuilding or flight.Local authorities see cultural and economic potential. Plans include opening sections of the Nevşehir site to the public and developing museums and walking routes. There are also proposals for above-ground tourism facilities. Archaeologists remain cautious. Excavation carries risks, as the soft tuff can collapse. Work continues slowly, clearing rubble and documenting spaces as they emerge. Each chamber adds another detail to a long, quiet record of people who once lived beneath the earth, not as legend, but as routine.","Turkey’s Cappadocia region contains dozens of fully developed underground cities.

Rather than taking months of lessons, tests, and fees, residents from certain countries can exchange their existing licence for a UAE one, often without needing to take any tests.Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) offers this benefit to simplify life for foreign licence holders, helping them get on the road faster and avoid the standard licensing process. Last year alone, 58,082 licences from 57 countries were successfully exchanged in Dubai, a strong sign of rising demand from the UAE’s diverse expatriate community.The list of eligible nations has grown significantly, now covering 57 countries and territories. While European and GCC nations have long enjoyed this perk, recent additions like Croatia, Serbia, and the State of Texas (USA) have made the road even smoother for new arrivals.To be eligible, you generally must hold a permanent (not provisional) licence and be a citizen of the country that issued it. Below is the comprehensive breakdown of eligible countries:If you’re eligible, the process is straightforward and can be done either online or in person:You can receive your new UAE driving licence as a digital copy immediately, and opt for physical delivery if you prefer.Because the RTA periodically updates the list of approved countries, always double-check the official RTA portal before applying.The impact of this streamlined system is felt across the economy. By removing the barrier of expensive and time-consuming driving tests, the UAE ensures that doctors, engineers, and families can hit the ground running the moment they arrive.It reinforces Dubai and Abu Dhabi’s status as ""move-in ready"" cities, where the infrastructure is designed to welcome the world. For the British, Americans, and Europeans who top the exchange lists, it’s one less hurdle in their relocation journey, turning a complex legal process into a simple, 30-minute errand.","Last year, 58,082 licences from 57 countries were successfully exchanged in Dubai.

No outdoor loudspeakers this Ramadan: Saudi Ministry issues clear mosque rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/no-outdoor-loudspeakers-this-ramadan-saudi-ministry-issues-clear-mosque-rules/articleshow/127232745.cms,"No outdoor loudspeakers this Ramadan/Representative Image

Outdoor loudspeakers restricted to Adhan and Iqama





Circular outlines Ramadan mosque preparations





Iftar arrangements and facility readiness









As Ramadan approaches, Saudi authorities have reaffirmed strict rules governing mosque operations, with a renewed focus on sound discipline, prayer timing, and preparations for worshippers. The measures are intended to preserve the sanctity of prayers while ensuring comfort, order, and consideration for surrounding communities during the holy month.Minister of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance Sheikh Abdullatif Al-Sheikh confirmed that mosques across the Kingdom will not be allowed to use external loudspeakers during prayers throughout Ramadan. He clarified that outdoor speakers may be used only for the Adhan, the call to prayer, and the iqama, the second call that signals the start of congregational worship.The restriction applies to all prayers during the fasting month and is aimed at maintaining calm during worship, while limiting noise beyond mosque premises.The announcement followed the release of a circular by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance on Tuesday, setting out detailed instructions for mosque readiness ahead of Ramadan.The circular stressed strict adherence to official prayer times in accordance with the Umm Al-Qura calendar.It specifically highlighted the importance of calling the Isha prayer at its designated time and observing the prescribed duration between the Adhan and the iqama for each prayer.Mosques were instructed to organise iftar meals only in designated courtyard areas. The ministry also emphasised the responsible management of water donations to meet mosque requirements, while discouraging the accumulation of large quantities in storage facilities.Relevant departments were directed to strengthen the work of mosque caretakers and maintenance teams to ensure that facilities are clean, safe, and fully prepared for Ramadan. Particular attention was placed on women’s prayer areas, which the ministry said must receive the same level of care and readiness as other sections of mosques.According to the ministry, the guidelines are designed to ensure that worshippers experience a high level of organisation and care throughout Ramadan. Officials said the measures aim to create a calm, orderly, and spiritually enriching environment inside mosques, while also maintaining respect for nearby residential areas during one of the busiest periods of the Islamic calendar.","Saudi authorities have reaffirmed strict rules governing mosque operations.

UAE orders release for 900+ Indian prisoners ahead of National Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-orders-release-for-900-indian-prisoners-ahead-of-national-day/articleshow/127364348.cms,"UAE hands India a list of 900+ Indian prisoners set for release on National day / Image: file



UAE’s big clemency gesture

Spirit of Eid Al Etihad

Strengthening the bond





In a move that underscores the deep-rooted brotherhood between the two nations, the United Arab Emirates has officially handed over a list of more than 900 Indian prisoners to the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi. This release is part of a grand humanitarian pardon ordered by His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE.The decision originally coincided with the UAE’s 54th Eid Al Etihad (National Day) celebrations, a time when the nation reflects on unity and forgiveness. By including a significant number of Indian nationals in the wider release of nearly 3,000 inmates, the UAE has sent a powerful message of goodwill to India and its global diaspora.What makes this pardon truly exceptional is not just the gift of freedom, but the removal of financial barriers. His Highness the UAE President has pledged to cover the financial penalties incurred by the inmates as part of their original sentences. For many Indian families, these fines, often for overstaying, minor labor disputes, or financial defaults, represented a mountain of debt that prevented their loved ones from ever returning home.By clearing these debts, the UAE government is ensuring that these individuals don't just walk out of prison, but walk back into society with a clean slate and no crushing financial weight on their shoulders.The release of these prisoners is a deeply symbolic tradition tied to Eid Al Etihad (National Day), which marks the 1971 unification of the seven emirates. In Emirati culture, this anniversary is a time to celebrate solidarity and mercy. By granting pardons, the UAE leadership honors the legacy of the Founding Fathers, transforming a day of national pride into a moment of forgiveness.For 2026, these pardons align with the UAE’s ""Year of the Family"" initiative. The goal is to strengthen social ties by giving individuals who have shown good conduct a chance to reintegrate into society. By clearing their debts alongside their sentences, the government ensures these 900+ Indian nationals receive a genuine fresh start, allowing them to return home with dignity.The timing of this prisoner list transfer is no coincidence. It follows a highly successful official visit by President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed to India in mid-January 2026, where he met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi . During this fifth visit in ten years, the two leaders signed a Strategic Defence Partnership and discussed a future where bilateral trade targets $200 billion by 2032.This humanitarian gesture acts as the ""soft power"" foundation for these massive economic deals. It shows that the relationship isn't just about oil and trade, but about a shared commitment to the welfare of their citizens and the stability of the million-strong Indian workforce that helps build the UAE.","UAE hands India a list of 900+ Indian prisoners set for release on National day.

A routine drive can now take an unexpected turn for vehicle and motorcycle owners flagged for loud exhausts. Instead of heading straight to a workshop, repairs will first need official clearance.In Kuwait, vehicle and motorcycle owners are now required to obtain official approval before carrying out exhaust system repairs, under a new mechanism introduced by the General Traffic Department. The move is part of broader efforts to improve traffic services, streamline procedures, and enforce stricter compliance with approved technical standards.Under the new system, repair permits will be issued by the Technical Inspection Departments to vehicles and motorcycles found to be emitting excessive noise or operating in violation of approved technical specifications. Once a violation is detected, owners will receive an official exhaust repair form, which allows them to proceed with repairs only at authorised workshops and dealerships.The mechanism is intended to speed up the repair process while maintaining regulatory oversight. After completing the required repairs, vehicle and motorcycle owners must return to the Technical Inspection Department for a follow-up inspection.This step is mandatory to confirm that the exhaust system has been corrected and now fully complies with technical requirements.Authorities said the new approach is expected to improve service quality, boost operational efficiency, and help reduce noise pollution on Kuwait’s roads, while ensuring that modified or repaired exhaust systems meet approved standards before vehicles are allowed back into regular use.","Vehicle and motorcycle owners in Kuwait now need official approval before carrying out exhaust system repairs.

Qatar is set to experience unsettled weather at the start of the week, as strong northwesterly winds sweep across the country, raising dust levels, reducing visibility, and bringing a sharper drop in temperatures, the Qatar Meteorological Department has warned.According to the department, fresh to strong northwesterly winds are expected to affect most parts of Qatar on Sunday, January 25, and Monday, January 26. The winds, advancing from the northern Arabian Peninsula, are likely to create dusty conditions in several areas, which may at times lead to reduced horizontal visibility, particularly during periods of stronger gusts.The Qatar Meteorological Department also forecast a further fall in temperatures during this period, warning that residents may feel an increased sense of coldness, especially during the early morning and evening hours.Authorities have urged the public to remain cautious, particularly motorists who may be affected by poor visibility due to dust. Those heading outdoors are advised to take the changing weather conditions into account.Marine warnings will remain in effect around Qatar on both days, as strong winds are expected to impact sea conditions, making maritime activities more challenging during this period.","Strong winds will sweep Qatar on Sunday and Monday, bringing dust, low visibility, cooler temperatures.

The parents of Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old Minneapolis man fatally shot by a US federal agent during an immigration enforcement operation, have accused the Trump administration of spreading what they called “sickening lies” about the circumstances surrounding their son’s death.In a statement to CNN, Michael and Susan Pretti strongly rejected the department of homeland security’s account that their son was armed and violently resisted officers.“Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump’s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed,” they said.The department of homeland security earlier stated that border patrol agents were conducting a targeted enforcement operation when Pretti allegedly approached officers while armed with a handgun and two magazines.DHS said agents attempted to disarm him and that an officer fired “defensive shots” after the man “violently resisted.” Border patrol commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino claimed the man was attempting to “massacre law enforcement.”Rejecting those assertions, Pretti’s parents said, “The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting.”Pretti, a US citizen and south Minneapolis resident, worked as an intensive care unit nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital, according to family members and reports. His parents described him as a “kindhearted soul” who cared deeply for his family, friends and American veterans.“Alex wanted to make a difference in this world,” they said, adding, “I do not throw around the hero term lightly. However his last thought and act was to protect a woman.”Local police confirmed Pretti was believed to be a lawful gun owner with a valid permit to carry. Authorities said he had no significant criminal history beyond minor traffic violations. Video footage captured by bystanders showing the moments around the shooting has circulated widely on social media.The incident occurred early Saturday (local time) near West 26th Street and Nicollet Avenue in south Minneapolis and marked the third fatal shooting involving federal agents in the city in roughly three weeks, following the earlier death of Renée Good.The shooting triggered large protests, with crowds gathering at the scene and confrontations reported between demonstrators and law enforcement. Tear gas and crowd-control measures were deployed to disperse the gatherings.Minnesota’s governor and Minneapolis mayor questioned the federal account of events and called for an independent investigation, urging calm amid rising tensions. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump, VP JD Vance and other MAGA-aligned figures accused Minnesota officials of obstructing immigration enforcement.Investigations by Minneapolis police and federal authorities are ongoing. No charges have been announced.","Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old Minneapolis man, was fatally shot by a US federal agent during an immigration enforcement operation.

"Over 13,000 flights cancelled! US snow storm hits air travel, more disruptions expected",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/over-13000-flights-cancelled-us-snow-storm-hits-air-travel-more-disruptions-expected/articleshow/127443747.cms,"US ‘Under Siege’: Emergency In DC, NYC, 14 Other States; Monster Storm Threatens 230 Mn Americans





Air travel across the United States has been severely disrupted after thousands of flights were cancelled following a massive winter storm in the country, sweeping from Texas towards New England. The system has grounded air traffic across large parts of the country and may be among the most severe winter storms in years.According to flight tracking website FlightAware, more than 13,000 US flights were cancelled between Saturday and Monday, with cancellations continuing to rise as the storm advances. The scale of disruption marks the worst period for air travel since last year’s US government shutdown, Bloomberg reported. Furthermore, some airlines are expected to see Sunday disruption levels approaching those recorded during the Covid pandemic, when air travel was sharply reduced, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium.By 9:30 am New York local time on Saturday, cancellations accounted for 90% of outbound flights from Memphis, 76% from Oklahoma City and 75% from Dallas-Fort Worth. Apart from these, major disruption were also reported at airports in Austin, Charlotte and Nashville, while those in Washington and New York were expected to face increasing impact as the storm progresses.For the country overall, the system could rank among the most expansive winter storms since the 1993 “superstorm”, Rob Carolan, chief executive officer of Hometown Forecast Services, was cited by Bloomberg.US airlines had announced contingency measures earlier in the week, including waiving change fees and fare differences for passengers booked to travel over the weekend. American Airlines Group Inc. said it added nearly 1,800 extra seats on flights departing Dallas Fort Worth International Airport on Friday, along with more than 1,400 seats on inbound flights scheduled for Sunday after the storm passes. The airline also introduced additional flights between Charlotte Douglas International Airport and Chicago O’Hare International Airport on Saturday.Airports also began implementing winter weather preparations. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said on Friday that it had activated winter storm protocols at the major airports it operates: John F. Kennedy International, Newark Liberty International and LaGuardia, including ensuring snow removal equipment was fuelled and ready for use.The US Federal Aviation Administration said in a post on X, that its “weather and air traffic professionals are monitoring the winter storm around the clock to maintain the safety of the national airspace system.”“This is a significant long-duration winter storm that threatens 180 million Americas with widespread heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain from the southern Rocky Mountains to New England,” Allison Santorelli, a forecaster with the US Weather Prediction Center told Bloomberg.“South of the snow area we are continuing to expect catastrophic ice accumulation,” Santorelli added, noting that up to 0.5 inch of ice may fall across parts of the US South and into Northern Virginia.Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport said its crews are “prepared to treat runways and taxiways on the airfield, as well as bridges, overpasses and roadways across airport property,” according to a statement issued on Friday.Travellers are advised to check fly.faa.gov for real-time airport updates.","More than 13,000 US flights were cancelled between Saturday and Monday, according to flight tracking website FlightAware.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday reposted a graphic image on his Truth Social account showing a federal law enforcement officer’s severed finger, after a protester in Minneapolis allegedly bit it off during clashes with anti-ICE demonstrators.Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin originally shared the image on X, writing, “In Minneapolis, these rioters attacked our law enforcement officer and one of them bit off our HSI officer’s finger,” and adding, “He will lose his finger.”She also posted photos of two individuals who appeared to be in custody, although it is not clear which person is accused of biting the officer. Authorities have not released further details about the assault. Protests in the city have intensified after the deaths of two US citizens during immigration enforcement operations.Hours before McLaughlin’s post, Minnesota officials reported another shooting involving federal law enforcement in Minneapolis, amid the Trump administration’s intensified immigration crackdown.The man has been identified as Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old south Minneapolis resident and US citizen.Bystander footage of the incident circulated widely online after it went viral.Online video shows several federal agents wrestling the man to the ground while bystanders record the incident. One agent appears to strike him three times with what looks like a firearm, and more than ten shots can be heard, though it is unclear how many agents fired.The Department of Homeland Security told Fox News that the man “was armed with a gun and two magazines.”Following the shooting, officers sealed off nearby streets and deployed tear gas to push back demonstrators. Reports said more than 100 federal agents were present at the scene.Pretti’s death is the second fatal shooting involving federal immigration agents in Minneapolis in less than three weeks. It comes after the killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in a separate incident, and follows another case in which a man was shot in the leg while fleeing immigration officers.","US President Donald Trump reposted a graphic image on his Truth Social account showing a federal law enforcement officer’s severed finger, after a protester allegedly bit it off during clashes with anti-ICE demonstrators.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday said he had approved emergency declarations for 10 states hit by severe winter storms. He said that the federal government was working closely with FEMA, state governors and emergency management teams to ensure public safety as extreme cold and snow grip large parts of the country.""I have just approved Emergency Declarations for Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana, and West Virginia. We are working closely with FEMA, Governors, and State Emergency Management teams to ensure the safety of everybody. Stay Safe, and Stay Warm!"" Trump said through a post on Truth Social.Earlier on Saturday, the US president had approved emergency declarations for additional states in the storm’s path, including South Carolina and Virginia. Such declarations temporarily ease spending restrictions, enabling state governments to mobilise resources more quickly and seek federal assistance.At least 20 states have declared a state of emergency, among them Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.In Louisiana, where freezing rain and icy conditions struck earlier in the day, about 50,000 customers were without power, according to outage tracker Poweroutage.us.Nearly 140 million people, accounting for more than 40 per cent of the US population, were under winter storm warnings from New Mexico to New England as a major system brought heavy snow and dangerous ice across large swathes of the country. The National Weather Service warned of widespread snowfall and potentially severe ice accumulations from east Texas to North Carolina.By midday Saturday, up to a quarter inch (0.6 cm) of ice had been recorded in parts of southeastern Oklahoma, eastern Texas and Louisiana. Governors in more than a dozen states declared emergencies or urged residents to remain indoors, while power crews in several southern states worked to restore outages and officials in parts of the east issued final weather alerts.“What really makes this storm unique is, just following this storm, it’s just going to get so cold,” Allison Santorelli, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, was quoted as saying by AP. ""The snow and the ice will be very, very slow to melt and won’t be going away anytime soon, and that’s going to hinder any recovery efforts.”Meanwhile, more than 12,000 flights were cancelled across the United States over Saturday and Sunday, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware, as the winter storm disrupted air travel nationwide.Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport, one of the country’s busiest hubs, recorded over 700 cancelled departures on Saturday, with a similar number of arriving flights scrapped. Flight disruptions also mounted at major airports in Chicago, Atlanta, Nashville and Charlotte, North Carolina.After battering the southern states, the storm was forecast to push into the Northeast, with the National Weather Service predicting snowfall of about 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 centimetres) from Washington through New York to Boston.","US President Donald Trump on Saturday said he had approved emergency declarations for 10 states hit by severe winter storms.

A former US Air Force officer has defended the man shot dead by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis, saying carrying a gun does not make someone a criminal.Adam Kinzinger, an American politician and former Air Force and Air National Guard officer, criticised attempts to justify the shooting because the man was armed.In a video message on X, he said: ""So let's do an update for the ICE shooting. I'm seeing a lot of comments by people on the right trying to justify this, saying the guy was armed. So let's just take that where it is. First off, I want to point out there is a lot of video that shows that an agent actually took the guy's gun from him and disarmed him prior to nine shots being fired point blank into his body and killing him. If the video is telling us the truth, then you cannot shoot a guy once he's been disarmed. ""He added that every state in the US legally allows one to carry a gun above the age of 21 years: ""Every state in the union has a concealed carry provision. Every state in the union allows you to carry a gun.

US President Donald Trump has reacted to the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old man by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis, calling the incident a “cover-up” and launching a multi-pronged attack on Minnesota’s Democratic leaders.Trump posted a series of statements on Truth Social less than two hours after federal agents shot dead Alex Pretti, a Minneapolis resident and US citizen who police later said was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry. The GOP leader shared an image of a handgun and accused state and city officials of neglecting immigration enforcement in the Blue region.Trump said the man killed was armed: “This is the gunman’s gun, loaded (with two additional full magazines!), and ready to go – What is that all about? Where are the local Police? Why weren’t they allowed to protect ICE Officers?”He claimed that police had been “called off” by local leaders and that federal agents were forced to protect themselves.Trump went on to accuse Minnesota officials of corruption involving millions of dollars, asking, “Why does Ilhan Omar have $34 Million Dollars in her account? And where are the Tens of Billions of Dollars that have been stolen from the once Great State of Minnesota?”He added federal officers were present in Minnesota to fight the said corruption: “We are there because of massive Monetary Fraud, with Billions of Dollars missing, and Illegal Criminals that were allowed to infiltrate the State through the Democrats’ Open Border Policy.We want the money back, and we want it back, NOW.”In a follow-up post, Trump reiterated the 'cover-up' claim: “AMONG OTHER THINGS, THIS IS A ‘COVER UP’ FOR THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN STOLEN FROM THE ONCE GREAT STATE (BUT SOON TO BE GREAT AGAIN!) OF MINNESOTA!”The Minnesota Star Tribune later identified the man killed as Alex Pretti. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara confirmed that a 37-year-old man had died and that the man was legally carrying the weapon.Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said federal officers fired “defensive shots” after a man armed with a handgun approached them and “violently resisted” when they attempted to disarm him. Top White House aide Stephen Miller doubled down on this claim.Congresswoman and Somali leader Ilhan Omar responded by describing the killing as “an execution by immigration enforcement”. Zohran Mamdani and other democratic leaders like AOC agreed to this as well.Omar accused the Trump administration of trying “to beat us into submission rather than protect us.”The killing comes amid daily protests in Minneapolis following the death of Renee Good earlier this month, who was shot by an ICE officer named Jonathan Ross during an operation. After Saturday’s shooting, demonstrators gathered at the scene, chanting “ICE out now.""Governor Tim Walz was the first one to confirm the fatal shooting on his social media.

A bill introduced by Democrats in the Virginia General Assembly is drawing criticism over proposals to eliminate mandatory minimum prison sentences for a range of violent felony offenses.Shortly after Democratic Governor Abigail Spanberger was sworn into office, lawmakers from her party advanced House Bill 863, which would remove required minimum sentences for several crimes, New York Post reported.Former Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares has warned that the legislation would effectively eliminate minimum sentencing requirements for offenses including manslaughter, rape, possession and distribution of child pornography, assault on a law enforcement officer, and certain repeat violent felonies. The bill would also repeal the mandatory five-day jail sentence for some first-time DUI convictions.Supporters of the bill argue the changes would allow judges greater flexibility. Delegate Rae Cousins, the bill’s sponsor, described HB 863 as a “common-sense proposal” that moves away from “one-size-fits-all” sentencing mandates.In a statement to ABC 7, Cousins said the measure would give judges discretion to weigh the individual facts of each case while still preserving maximum penalties under state law.Law enforcement officials and public safety experts, however, have raised concerns about the potential consequences of removing mandatory minimums for serious crimes.Josh Ederheimer, an assistant professor at the University of Virginia’s Center for Public Safety and Justice and a retired law enforcement officer, said police generally support accountability through sentencing and grow frustrated when offenders are released quickly and later reoffend, particularly in violent felony cases.Ederheimer noted that while officers often understand when unique circumstances warrant leniency for minor offenses, violent crimes raise different concerns.He said the risk of reoffending and the public’s lack of awareness when offenders return to the community place added pressure on judges and prosecutors.According to Ederheimer, eliminating mandatory minimums could also affect victims and their families, who often view those sentencing requirements as assurances of accountability.“Mandatory minimums give victims and the community confidence that a convicted offender will serve a meaningful sentence,” he said.While HB 863 would not reduce maximum penalties, critics argue that removing sentencing floors could weaken public trust in the justice system and diminish the sense of accountability for violent crimes as the General Assembly continues its legislative session.","House Bill 863 would remove required minimum sentences for several crimes.

Critics argue that removing sentencing floors could weaken public trust in the justice system.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127426398,imgsize-13930,width-400,resizemode-4/127426398.jpg"

'How DARE You?': Britain EXPLODES After Trump Downplays NATO Troops Involvement In Afghan War





US president Donald Trump on Saturday praised “brave” British soldiers as warriors, a day after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer described his earlier remarks about NATO troops in Afghanistan as “insulting and appalling. ”“The GREAT and very BRAVE soldiers of the United Kingdom will always be with the United States of America! In Afghanistan, 457 died, many were badly injured, and they were among the greatest of all warriors. It’s a bond too strong to ever be broken. The U.K. Military, with tremendous Heart and Soul, is second to none (except for the USA!). We love you all, and always will!” Trump said through a post on Truth Social.Trump had earlier downplayed the role of some Nato allies in Afghanistan, suggesting they stayed away from frontline fighting, and reiterated his scepticism about Nato’s collective defence, saying he was unsure the alliance would come to the United States’ aid in a crisis.""They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan,"" Trump had said in an interview with Fox News adding, ""And they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.""Trump’s remarks sparked widespread anger in Britain and across Europe, prompting UK’s prime minister Keir Starmer to hit back at Trump, calling the comments “insulting and frankly, appalling.”In a video message, he said: ""Let me start by paying tribute to 457 of our armed services who lost their lives in Afghanistan.""""There are many also who were injured, some with life-changing injuries, and so I consider President Trump's remarks to be insulting and frankly, appalling, and I'm not surprised they've caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured.""Starmer added that if he had misspoken in such a way, he ""would certainly apologise"".Nato’s Article 5 collective defence clause, the alliance’s core principle, was invoked for the first and only time after the September 11 attacks, triggering European forces to join the US-led war.Britain lost 457 service personnel in Afghanistan, its deadliest overseas conflict since the 1950s. During some of the war’s most intense years, British forces led the allied campaign in Helmand, Afghanistan’s largest and most volatile province, while also serving as the United States’ principal battlefield ally in Iraq, as cited by Reuters.","'The GREAT and very BRAVE soldiers of the United Kingdom will always be with the United States of America!

A wedding celebration turned into a scene of devastation in Pakistan’s north-west after a suicide bomber blew himself up among guests, killing at least seven people and injuring around 25 others, officials said. The attack took place on Friday night in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Police said the blast occurred at the home of Noor Alam Mehsud, a pro-government peace committee leader, where a marriage ceremony was under way. Witnesses said guests had been dancing to the beat of drums when the attacker struck, detonating an explosive vest inside a crowded room.District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada confirmed it was a suicide bombing. The force of the explosion caused part of the roof to collapse, trapping several people under debris and complicating rescue efforts. An emergency was declared at the District Headquarters Hospital as ambulances rushed casualties from the site.Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesperson for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122, said multiple ambulances, along with fire and disaster response vehicles, were deployed. Rescue teams worked through the rubble to pull out victims, with some of the wounded reported to be in critical condition.No group immediately claimed responsibility. However, suspicion is likely to fall on Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban, which has carried out frequent attacks in the region. The group is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban and has grown more active since the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Many TTP fighters are believed to operate from across the border.Authorities sealed off the area and launched an investigation. Initial reports suggested that Waheedullah Mehsud, also known as Jigri Mehsud, was among those killed.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi condemned the attack and sought a report from the provincial police chief, saying those responsible would be brought to justice. Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also expressed grief and ordered that the injured receive full medical support.","Attack took place in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Bar leaders allege violence, warn of protests

What was the case?





Pakistan’s prominent human rights lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad. The incident triggered strong condemnation from legal bodies and rights activists over what they described as unconstitutional move.The lawyer couple was on its way to the Additional District and Sessions Court to appear in a case linked to controversial social media posts when police intercepted their vehicle. Arrest warrants had been issued against them on January 16 after the court cancelled their interim bail, news agency PTI reported.The arrest was confirmed by Imaan’s mother, Dr Shireen Mazari, a former federal human rights minister in the Imran Khan government, who said the couple was detained without explanation and taken to undisclosed locations.In a post on X, Mazari said that her daughter and son-in-law “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations,” adding that no arrest warrant or formal document was shown to them at the time, according to Dawn.Calling the incident a sign of repression, she wrote: “Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!”Mazari also shared videos on social media showing police vehicles following the lawyers’ car before blocking it on the road. In the footage, officers were seen opening the car doors, surrounding the vehicle and attempting to pull the occupants out. Another clip showed shattered car windows, which Mazari alleged were broken by the police during the arrest.In a separate post, she claimed that police had used force not only against the couple but also against senior members of the legal fraternity who were accompanying them.“Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari wrote, alleging that the arrest was carried out to prevent further embarrassment to authorities during court proceedings.Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) president Wajid Ali Gilani, who was present at the scene, said the arrest violated assurances given by authorities that the lawyers would be allowed safe passage to court.In a video message shared by Mazari, Gilani said the police attacked the convoy near Serena Chowk, broke car windows, forcibly removed the couple and pushed Imaan into a police vehicle. He also alleged that police officials assaulted IHCBA secretary Manzoor Jajja during the incident.“The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani warned, referring to the mass protests that once challenged military rule in Pakistan.The Islamabad High Court Bar Association, Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrests, calling them illegal and unconstitutional.The IHCBA and IBA announced a strike on Friday, while the IBC called for a nationwide lawyers’ strike on Saturday. The bar councils demanded the immediate release of the couple and an independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved.In a statement, the IBA said the arrest violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Pakistan’s Constitution, stressing that “every citizen has the right to defend themselves in court without fear.”Human Rights Commission of Pakistan strongly condemned the arrest of both lawyers. In a post on X, the organzation wrote: ""HRCP demands immediate disclosure of their whereabouts and holds the authorities fully responsible for any harm. Ms Mazari-Hazir and Mr Chattha must be released immediately.""The primary case against Mazari-Hazir and Chattha stems from a complaint filed in August 2025 with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), accusing Mazari of spreading content allegedly aligned with banned organisations. Her husband was implicated for reposting some of the content.They were indicted in October last year, and arrest warrants were issued after repeated non-appearances led to the cancellation of their interim bail.Additional cases linked to protests and an alleged scuffle outside the Islamabad High Court have also been filed against them, some of which are still under judicial review.","Iaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad.

Dozens feared missing



Compensation announced for victims’ families







The death toll from a devastating fire at a major shopping plaza in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, has risen to 26, with authorities warning that the number could climb further as search operations continue, as reported by Geo TV. The blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.Rescue teams gained fuller access to the building nearly 24 hours later, after firefighters managed to bring the inferno under control. Officials said smoke was still rising from the structure on Monday, complicating efforts to locate missing people.Rescue 1122 Sindh spokesperson Hassan Khan said 21 bodies had been recovered so far, adding that search operations were still under way. “The search will continue,” he said, as concerns remain over possible structural collapses inside the severely damaged building.Mohammed Shah, part of the Pakistan Navy’s rescue team, described the incident as a “deep-seated fire”, noting that smoke continued to emanate from the debris despite the flames being largely extinguished. Firefighters said the blaze had been brought 95 per cent under control, with cooling operations now in progress.Officials warned that the weakened structure posed serious dangers. Portions of the building’s front and back façades have collapsed, while cracks have been detected inside.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said authorities were still trying to establish the final death toll. Speaking at a press conference, he said around 65 people who were reported to have visited Gul Plaza remain unaccounted for, raising fears that casualties could rise sharply.“I cannot give a final number as of yet,” he said. “There has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident.”South DIG Syed Asad Raza said more areas of the plaza were yet to be cleared, and warned the number of fatalities could increase as debris is removed.The Sindh government has announced Rs10 million (£28,000) in compensation for the family of each person killed. “There can be no price tag on a life,” the chief minister said, adding that the compensation process would begin immediately.He also confirmed that one firefighter was among those who lost their lives.The cause of the fire has not yet been confirmed. Officials initially suspect an electrical short circuit, though a forensic investigation has been ordered. Police said samples had been collected for DNA matching to help identify victims.Authorities revealed that although the plaza had 16 gates, only three exits were open at the time of the fire, raising serious questions over safety compliance.Karachi has witnessed repeated fatal fires, often linked to poor safety standards, illegal construction and inadequate fire prevention systems. A government audit in 2024 found that the vast majority of commercial buildings in the city lacked proper fire safety measures.","Blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.

Karachi Gul Plaza Fire Claims At Least 10 Lives, Dozens Missing As Rescue Operations Continue





The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan’s Karachi has risen to 14 after rescue teams recovered eight more bodies from the debris, officials said on Monday.The blaze broke out late Saturday night at Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market on MA Jinnah Road in the city’s Saddar area. The fire was brought under control by Sunday night, but rescue operations continued as large parts of the building suffered severe structural damage.Six bodies were found soon after the fire erupted, with officials saying the victims likely died of suffocation. Dozens of injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals. As the fire spread rapidly, thick smoke and intense heat initially prevented rescue teams from entering the building.“Once the fire was doused, we didn’t wait for the cooling period and forcibly went in to rescue trapped people and we found eight more bodies, some badly charred,” Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Abid Jalal told PTI.Jalal said the fire had almost completely damaged the building, with both the front and rear portions collapsing due to weakened pillars.“The structure has become extremely unsafe, and we are still searching as there is a risk of further collapses,” he said.Gul Plaza, built in the early 1980s, houses around 1,200 shops spread across a basement, mezzanine and three upper floors. It has long been a prominent commercial hub in Karachi.Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site on Monday, said authorities feared that dozens of people could still be trapped inside. “We are extremely concerned and alarmed. Efforts are going on to find them but this is a national tragedy,” he told reporters.South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza said the casualty count could rise as large sections of the building were yet to be searched. Officials suspect an electrical short circuit may have caused the fire, though the exact cause will be confirmed after a full investigation.The incident has once again highlighted serious fire safety concerns in Karachi. In recent years, several commercial buildings in the city have caught fire due to poor safety measures, faulty electrical systems and illegal construction.A government audit in 2024 found that most shopping malls lacked proper fire safety systems, emergency exits and compliant wiring.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, while the Sindh government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.","The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan's Karachi has risen to 14.

On Friday, the White House announced appointments to the board, which will oversee phase two of Trump’s 20-point peace plan to end the Gaza conflict.According to a White House statement, the appointees include US secretary of state Marco Rubio, former British prime minister Tony Blair, Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, World Bank president Ajay Banga, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.The panel also includes Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan and US deputy national security adviser Robert Gabriel.“Executive Board members will oversee defined portfolios critical to Gaza's stabilisation and long-term success, including, but not limited to, governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment attraction, large-scale funding, and capital mobilisation,” the White House said.Trump will serve as chairman of the Board of Peace and has appointed Aryeh Lightstone and Josh Gruenbaum as senior advisers to oversee daily strategy and operations.

Firefighting hampered by smoke, structure damage

Many still trapped





At least six people, including a firefighter, were killed after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road late on Saturday night. Several others were feared trapped more than 12 hours after the blaze erupted, as rescue operations continued into Sunday.Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said the fire broke out at around 10.45pm, when most shopkeepers were closing their stores or had already left for the night.Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said around 20 people had been pulled out of the building and shifted to hospital. He added that the complex layout of the mall was hampering rescue efforts. “Once the cooling starts, we will start further rescue operations, but the layout of the building is very complex as it houses a basement and mezzanine floor with hundreds of shops and stores,” Khan said, as quoted by Dawn.Television footage showed firefighters in protective gear battling intense flames shooting out of windows and balconies, as thick black smoke rose into the night sky and was visible from several blocks away.Dozens of fire engines were deployed, using ladders, water cannons and hoses to reach upper floors.According to officials, the fire spread rapidly after breaking out in an area where shopkeepers had stored imported garments, clothing and plastic household goods, which fuelled the flames. As many as 40 snorkels were pressed into service, and by Sunday afternoon around 60 per cent of the fire had been brought under control.However, the blaze caused severe structural damage. Rescue officials said cracks had appeared in the mall’s walls, while a DawnNewsTV correspondent reported that one side of the building had “completely collapsed”. The News International said poor ventilation and sealed windows had allowed smoke to fill the interior, severely hindering rescue operations.Sindh Labour and Social Protection Minister Saeed Ghani warned that many people could still be inside the building. District South Deputy Commissioner Khoso told Geo News, “There are fears that people are on the first and mezzanine floors. The rescue teams have not been able to reach these floors.”IG Aslam said a short circuit was suspected, though the exact cause would be determined once the fire was fully extinguished. Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah has ordered an inquiry, directing Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi to investigate the incident and submit a report.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, as attention once again turned to poor fire safety standards in Karachi, where deadly mall fires have occurred repeatedly, including one in November 2023 that killed 10 people.","At least six people, including a firefighter, have died after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road.

At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday, including six children, as dense fog and over-speeding continued to disrupt traffic across several regions, according to officials.In the first incident, 14 people, including six children and five women, lost their lives when a truck carrying passengers fell from a bridge into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district.According to news agency PTI, the accident occurred in Kot Momin tehsil, around 200 kilometres from Lahore, during the early hours of the day.A spokesperson for Punjab Emergency Services Rescue 1122 said the truck had 23 people on board, most of them members of an extended family travelling from Islamabad to Faisalabad to attend a funeral.“As the motorway was closed because of heavy fog, the truck took a local route. It fell from the Galapur bridge in Kot Momin tehsil into a dry canal as the driver lost control over the vehicle because of poor visibility,” the spokesperson said.Nine people were injured in the crash and are being treated at the Civil Hospital in Kot Momin, according to PTI.In a separate incident in Balochistan, at least nine people were killed and 15 others injured when a passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway near Gwadar early Saturday.Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police Aslam Bangulzai confirmed the accident, saying the coach was travelling from Jiwani to Karachi. “The accident took place early this morning on the Makran coastal highway as the passenger coach overturned due to over speeding,” Bangulzai said, as quoted by PTI.Dense fog has severely affected traffic movement across Punjab’s motorways and major roads during night and early morning hours since the onset of an extreme cold wave last month.As reported by Dawn, several motorway sections have been closed intermittently due to low visibility.Pakistan frequently witnesses fatal road accidents, with factors such as over-speeding, poor enforcement of traffic rules, driver fatigue and weak licensing controls cited as major causes.On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed in a head-on collision between a bus and a van on the Jhang-Faisalabad road in Punjab, according to PTI.","At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday.

Shaksgam Valley: India bristles over China's fresh claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shaksgam-valley-india-bristles-over-chinas-fresh-claim-dispute-explained/articleshow/126529230.cms,"Why China Building Roads In Shaksgam Valley Is A Direct Strategic Challenge For India In Kashmir

What is the Shaksgam Valley?

What is the dispute about?

Why does Shaksgam Valley matter strategically?

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh



The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth



The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications



Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims



For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?





NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The Shaksgam Valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region. It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east. It is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India's claims over Pakistan- occupied Kashmir, and China's growing footprint in the Himalayas.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126529183,imgsize-1792158,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"

Pact To Power Bloc: How Turkish Arms, Saudi Money And Pakistan Nukes May Align In Islamic NATO





Islamic Nato in the making? Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, this can be seen as an effort in direction to reshape security alignments in the Middle East region and beyond, as Bloomberg reported.The pact, initially signed by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in September, reportedly states that “any aggression” against one member would be treated as an attack on all -- a provision that mirrors Article 5 of Nato, of which Turkey is a member and fields the second-largest military after the US.Talks on Turkey’s entry are said to be at an advanced stage, with a deal appearing likely, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on condition of anonymity.Bloomberg reported that the expanded alliance reflects growing overlap in the strategic interests of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan across South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa.Turkey also sees the arrangement as a way to strengthen its security and deterrence posture at a time when questions persist over US reliability and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato, despite Washington’s close military ties with all three countries.Saudi Arabia would bring financial strength to the grouping, Pakistan its nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkey contributes military experience and a rapidly expanding defence industry, said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.“As the US prioritizes its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan said.Turkish defence ministry declined to comment on the report. Pakistan’s information ministry did not respond to requests for comment, while Saudi officials were unavailable over the weekend.If Turkey formally joins the pact, it would highlight a new phase in relations with Saudi Arabia, once rivals for leadership of the Sunni Muslim world. After years of strained ties, the two countries are now deepening economic and defence cooperation, including holding their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.Despite shared concerns over Shiite-majority Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia favour engagement with Tehran rather than confrontation. They also back a stable, Sunni-led Syria and support Palestinian statehood.Turkey and Pakistan already enjoy close military ties. Ankara is building corvette warships for Pakistan’s navy, has upgraded Islamabad’s F-16 fighter jets, and shares drone technology with both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Bloomberg previously reported that Turkey now wants both countries to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet programme.The trilateral defence discussions come after a ceasefire between India and Pakistan ended a four-day military clash and high tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Regional tensions remain high, however, with Pakistan and Afghanistan at odds following clashes and accusations by Islamabad that the Taliban is sheltering hostile militant groups.Turkey and Qatar have mediated talks between the sides, though those efforts have so far failed to produce a breakthrough, Bloomberg reported.","Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

‘Not 1, Not 1,000’: Jem Chief Masood Azhar Returns With Audio Threat As India Tightens Terror Noose

Def experts: Azhar’s statement sign of post-Sindoor frustration





A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","New audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar has surfaced on social media.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.

Awami League Escalates Bangladesh Crisis With ‘No Boat No Vote’ Boycott Call Against Yunus Polls





Dhaka: In an apparent reference to Bangladesh's largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), BNP chairman and former PM Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman has said a ""certain party"" is trying to deceive voters, particularly women, with ""tickets to heaven"" if they align with it and vote for it in the parliamentary elections.In his maiden poll rally on Thursday in Sylhet, Tarique also warned of conspiracies being hatched to derail the polls through rigging. ""They are already cheating you. Now, think about how they will cheat you after the elections...They are not only deceiving people; they are making Muslims commit 'shirk' (act of ascribing divinity or worship to others alongside Allah). 'Nauzubillah' (we seek refuge in Allah),"" he said in veiled attack on former BNP ally JeI.Tarique also criticised the ""certain party"" for its stance against the 1971 Liberation War in multiple public meetings, amid high security as Bangladesh sees political violence intensifying ahead of the campaigning for which began Thursday.Nahid Islam, convener of JeI ally National Citizen Party, has accused ""one particular party"" of spreading misleading information among the public and creating an environment of fear.As the two rivals traded barbs, a leader of Tarique's party was critically injured after assailants opened fire on him in Dhaka's Keraniganj area on Thursday night. The incident comes amid two incidents of intense clashes between BNP and JeI workers this week that left several injured.

Ousted Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina says in an interview with Alpyu Singh that free and fair elections in her country are impossible under Muhammad Yunus’ interim govt and that India deserves a reliable neighbour. Excerpts:

Tarique Rahman

has assumed office as

Bangladesh Nationalist Party

chairman recently. How do you look at his return?

Ex-PM Hasina Calls Yunus “Murderous Fascist,” Warns Bangladesh at Edge of Abyss

A lot of people are questioning whether an election could actually take place in Feb? If so, how will

Awami League

take part, considering that there is a ban on your party?

As atrocities against minorities continue in Bangladesh, India's external affairs ministry reacted by saying there is a disturbing pattern in all this. What do you think is reason behind these recurring attacks?

How can India help in restoring peace in Bangladesh?

What do you think is the future of India-Bangladesh bilateral relations?

The people of Bangladesh should remember that Tarique Rahman has lived in exile in London for years, far removed from the daily realities faced by ordinary citizens. He fled the country because of his role in abetting his late mother, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, in the embezzlement of public funds. This is not a matter of political disagreement, but of accountability and integrity.BNP leadership has consistently aligned itself with extremist elements when it suits its short-term interests, even at the cost of national stability... it has chosen exclusion, intimidation, and opportunism. Bangladesh deserves leadership that governs from within the country, respects pluralism, and is accountable to the people, not figures who seek power through alliances with radical forces while remaining safely abroad.The question is not whether elections will take place but whether these will be elections in any meaningful or legitimate sense... At present, Bangladesh is ruled by an unelected regime that has appointed itself the authority to rewrite our country's constitution and amend our legislation to ban the nation's most widely supported party from participating in elections.Over half the voters in Bangladesh have confidence in Awami League and would vote for us if Awami League were allowed to participate.It is precisely this fear that has led them to ban us.A govt's most basic duty is to protect its citizens. The interim govt has not only failed in this responsibility, it has actively emboldened this repression. Under Yunus, extremist groups that my govt worked hard to contain have been empowered and elevated to positions of authority. These criminals, many of whom belong to known terrorist orgs, have been allowed to spread a hardline ideology that threatens to remove any trace of diversity from our country and carry out deplorable acts of violence against peaceful Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, Ahmadi Muslims with total impunity. The current climate is the direct result of the appeasement of fundamentalist forces.India has rightly condemned the human rights abuses and political repression that have become all too common under the Yunus regime. They are watching in dismay right now as Bangladesh descends into lawlessness, as minority groups face daily acts of violence, as political imprisonments become the norm, and as harmful, hostile rhetoric emanates from Dhaka. India understands that prosperity of our two nations is tightly linked.n India is Bangladesh's closest friend and longest-standing ally, a relationship built through geography, history and cooperation. Yunus has done considerable damage to this relationship through his empowerment of extremist groups who freely target religious minorities with impunity and his willingness to allow mobs to besiege Indian diplomatic premises and threaten representatives. This is recklessness by an administration with neither the experience nor the mandate to dictate Bangladesh's foreign policy.India deserves a reliable partner in Bangladesh, one that can maintain stability and honour its commitments. We must return to being the friend our neighbours knew they could trust.",Ousted Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina says free and fair elections in her country are impossible under Muhammad Yunus’ interim govt.

After capturing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and repeatedly threatening to take control of Greenland, US President Donald Trump has now set his sights on a new target: the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean.Trump has criticised ally, the UK, over a deal that would give Mauritius “ownership” of the archipelago, which comprises over 60 islands. His concern centres on the chain’s largest island, Diego Garcia, which hosts the well-known joint British-American military base, also known as Diego Garcia.The Republican’s outburst came despite his own administration welcoming the agreement, describing it as a “historic and monumental achievement.”The United Kingdom has “owned” and administered the Chagos Islands as the British Indian Ocean Territory since 1965, three years before Mauritius gained independence from the UK. Mauritius’ Constitution, however, includes the islands as part of its territory. During the 1960s and 1970s, up to 2,000 people were forced off the islands to allow the United States to build what became the Diego Garcia military base.The UK’s control of the archipelago and the forced removal of its local population led to international criticism and calls for sovereignty to be transferred to Mauritius.In 2022, negotiations began between the UK's then Conservative-led government and Mauritius and continued following the 2024 election of Keir Starmer and his Labour Party. Talks dragged on as Mauritius also witnessed a change in government and there were disputes over money, but the agreement was signed off in May 2025 after Britain had sought and received backing from the Trump administration.Under the treaty, which is currently in the ratification stage in the British parliament, the UK would pay Mauritius an undisclosed sum — reportedly about $100 million a year — for 99 years to control the islands.Washington has described the base, which hosts around 2,500 mostly American personnel, as “an all but indispensable platform” for security operations in the Middle East, South Asia, and East Africa. It has supported America's military operations from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2008, the US acknowledged that the base had also been used for secret flights transporting terror suspects.More recently, the United States deployed several nuclear-capable B-2 Spirit bombers to Diego Garcia amid an intense airstrike campaign targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels.In addition to its strategic security interests in the Indian Ocean, particularly regarding China, New Delhi has quietly encouraged London to return sovereignty of the archipelago to Mauritius. For India, there is also a historical context. The US decision to establish a full-scale military base on Diego Garcia was made during the Richard Nixon administration, which had sided with Pakistan in the 1971 India-Pakistan war and even sent a naval task force into the Bay of Bengal to try to pressure India. Instead of backing down, India, backed by the-then Soviet Union (mostly present-day Russia), went on to liberate Bangladesh — then East Pakistan — ahead of the arrival of the US Navy's USS Enterprise, the world’s largest and most powerful aircraft carrier at the time.In September last year, India announced a $680 million (over Rs 6,000 crore) economic package for Mauritius. The assistance, provided through grants and lines of credit, also supports development and the monitoring of the Chagos Archipelago’s marine protected area.The 99-year lease agreement between the UK and Mauritius ensures continued US access to the Diego Garcia base. However, if Trump were to take over the Chagos Archipelago, Mauritius would lose ownership of the islands, and all agreements, including India’s $680 million economic package, would be rendered automatically null and void. This could also undermine India’s strategic interests in the Indian Ocean.","Trump has criticised ally, the UK, over a deal that would give Mauritius “ownership” of the Chagos Archipelago.

"‘Criminal in nature’: Yunus defends minority-related incidents in Bangladesh, says only 71 of 645 communal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/criminal-in-nature-yunus-defends-minority-related-incidents-in-bangladesh-says-only-71-of-645-communal/articleshow/126699256.cms,"""No Control Over Minority Violence In Bangladesh..."": Former Indian Envoy Slams Yunus Govt

With inputs from agency)





Bangladesh’s interim government on Monday said that the majority of incidents involving members of minority communities in the country during 2025 were “criminal in nature” and not driven by communal motives, asserting that only 71 of the 645 cases recorded had communal elements.The statement, issued by the office of chief adviser Muhammad Yunus and later highlighted by him in a post on X, came days after India pressed Dhaka to “swiftly and firmly” deal with attacks on minorities and described as “troubling” attempts to attribute such incidents to extraneous reasons.Citing a year-long review of official police records from January to December 2025, the interim government said 645 incidents involving minority communities were documented nationwide based on verified FIRs, general diaries, charge sheets and investigation updates.“While every incident is a matter of concern, the data presents a clear and evidence-based picture: the overwhelming majority of cases were criminal in nature rather than communal,” the statement said.According to the data, 71 incidents were identified as having communal elements. These included 38 cases of temple vandalism, eight incidents of arson, one case each of theft and murder, and 23 other incidents such as threats to break idols, provocative social media posts and damage to worship pavilions.Police cases were registered in 50 of these incidents, with arrests made in an equal number, while preventive or investigative measures were taken in the remaining cases.The remaining 574 incidents, the government said, were linked to criminal or social disputes unrelated to religion. These included neighbourhood disputes (51), land-related conflicts (23), theft (106), prior personal enmity (26), rape (58) and 172 cases of unnatural death. Police registered 390 cases in this category, filed 154 unnatural death reports and made 498 arrests, with additional measures taken in 30 incidents.The statement stressed that accurate classification was necessary to counter misinformation and enable effective law enforcement.“While all crimes are serious and demand accountability, the data demonstrates that most incidents involving minority victims were not driven by communal hostility, but by broader criminal and social factors that affect citizens across religious and ethnic lines,” it said.However, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC) questioned the government’s assessment.“If the government thinks these are not communal incidents, the question then is whether anyone can take the law into their own hands,” BHBCUC leader Kajal Debnath said, warning that such statements could embolden criminals and create a sense of impunity.India has repeatedly raised concerns over attacks on minorities in Bangladesh, particularly Hindus. On January 9, external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “We continue to witness a disturbing pattern of recurring attacks on minorities as well as their homes and businesses by extremists,” adding that such incidents must be dealt with “swiftly and firmly”.Relations between India and Bangladesh have remained strained since the interim government headed by Yunus took charge following the collapse of the Sheikh Hasina government in August 2024, with New Delhi continuing to flag concerns over minority safety.","Bangladesh's interim government says majority of incidents involving members of minority communities in the country during 2025 were “criminal in nature’ The government says only 71 of the 645 cases recorded had communal elements.

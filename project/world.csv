Elon Musk in Epstein files?





Elon Musk offered his support to victims of Jeffrey Epstein by offering to cover their legal expenses if they publicly name their abusers. His offer came in response to a discussion about a new PSA featuring Epstein's victims that aired on Super Bowl Sunday.The tech billionaire made this commitment on X, replying to conservative commentator Matt Walsh's posts about the PSA. ""I will pay for the defense of anyone who speaks the truth about this and is sued for doing so,"" said Musk.The PSA showed several women who claim to be Epstein's victims, urging Attorney General Pam Bondi to support their cause. In the video, they appeared alongside photos of themselves from when the alleged abuse occurred, stating, ""After years of being kept apart, we're standing together"" and ""Because we all deserve the truth.""Walsh questioned why these women haven't named their abusers directly. He pointed out that the timing of their campaign was curious, noting it began just as Biden left office. He suggested they could safely reveal names through Congress members who could speak on the floor without legal risk.However, he noted that this hasn't happened and questioned why. Further dismissing the defence that women fear being sued, Walsh added, ""For those claiming that they can’t name names because they’ll be sued: they could simply give the names to any of their many (and mostly very recent ) advocates in congress, who could read the names out loud from the floor, insulating themselves and these women from any litigation.But they refuse to do that. Why?""It is in reponse to this that Musk offered to cover the legal costs.A newly released photograph from the latest batch of Jeffrey Epstein files shows the disgraced financier at a 2015 dinner attended by Elon Musk and other tech figures. The image, disclosed by the US Department of Justice as part of a large release of investigative records, appears to show Musk seated at a long dining table alongside other prominent guests.Emails included in the documents indicate Epstein had noted plans to dine in Los Angeles with “musk thiel zuckerberg” in August 2015 and later sent himself a photograph from the gathering.Musk has previously said he declined invitations to Epstein’s private island and has not been accused of any crime.","Elon Musk offered his support to victims of Jeffrey Epstein by offering to cover their legal expenses.

"Japan election 2026 explained: Who won, who lost and who is Sanae Takaichi?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/japan-election-2026-explained-who-won-who-lost-and-who-is-sanae-takaichi/articleshow/128093730.cms,"(AP)

Who is Sanae Takaichi?



China tensions grow under Takaichi







Economic promises







International reactions









Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), led by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, is on course to win Sunday’s snap election by a landslide, according to projections.The conservative leader is expected to deliver 316 seats of the 465-seat lower house to the LDP — the party’s best-ever result. Together with coalition partner Japan Innovation Party (Ishin), the ruling bloc controls 352 seats, giving it a commanding majority in parliament.NHK figures show Ishin is expected to secure 36 seats, while opposition parties won a combined 113 seats.Once officially confirmed, the result will give Takaichi wide scope to push through her conservative agenda. With a two-thirds majority, she would also be in a strong position to pursue her long-held aim of revising Japan’s pacifist constitution.If the coalition secures at least 261 seats — a threshold known as an “absolute stable majority” — it can control parliamentary committees, easing the passage of legislation, including key budget proposals.A supermajority of 310 seats would allow the coalition to override the upper house, where it currently does not hold a majority.If the polls prove wrong and she loses her lower house majority, Takaichi has said she will resign.Takaichi, 64, called the snap election to capitalise on her strong personal approval ratings after taking over the leadership of the long-dominant LDP late last year. Hugely popular with voters, she nonetheless leads a party that has governed Japan for most of the past seven decades but has recently struggled with funding irregularities and religious-linked scandals.She dissolved parliament just three months into her tenure, hoping to secure a fresh mandate and stabilise the party before her popularity began to wane — making the election a high-stakes political gamble.Speaking in a television interview as results came in, she said, “This election involved major policy shifts — particularly a major shift in economic and fiscal policy, as well as strengthening security policy.”“These are policies that have drawn a great deal of opposition ... If we have received the public's support, then we truly must tackle these issues with all our strength.”The projected victory marks a sharp contrast with the LDP’s recent troubles. Under Takaichi’s two predecessors, the party lost its parliamentary majority amid corruption scandals and rising living costs.In 2024, the LDP lost its majority in both houses of parliament, and its decades-old coalition with Komeito collapsed. In this election, Komeito joined forces with the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan to form the largest opposition bloc in the lower house.Despite facing a more unified opposition, Takaichi’s personal popularity appears to have revived the party’s fortunes, with government approval ratings mostly hovering above 70%.The far-right Sanseito party fielded a record 190 candidates and was expected to increase its presence in parliament. Opinion polls suggested it may win around 15 seats, up from just two.The gains would build on last year’s upper house election, when the party broke through with fiery warnings about foreigners and attracted notable support from younger voters.Sanseito has sought ties with US President Donald Trump’s MAGA movement. While it is expected to remain a small party, its emergence has helped shift Japan’s political discourse to the right, a trend seen in other advanced democracies.Japan’s first elected female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi is an ultraconservative leader known as much for her hardline views as for her distinctive personal style. A self-described admirer of Margaret Thatcher, she has long aspired to be Japan’s “Iron Lady,” pledging to “work, work, work” after taking office in October.A staunch conservative, Takaichi opposes same-sex marriage, legislation allowing married couples to use separate surnames, and the idea of women succeeding to the imperial throne. She has consistently backed more traditional roles for women in society and family life, despite becoming a symbol-breaking figure herself.Strongly pro-defence, she is focused on maintaining a close alliance with the United States while strengthening Japan’s own military capabilities. She has struck up a notably warm relationship with US President Donald Trump, meeting him just days after assuming office.A motorbike enthusiast and heavy metal drummer, Takaichi has become a pop-culture phenomenon, particularly among young voters. Her appeal is driven as much by her image as her policies, with personal items and catchphrases going viral and a massive following on social media, even as critics point to her limited promotion of women within her cabinet.Relations with China — Japan’s largest trading partner — have become increasingly strained after Takaichi suggested last November that Japan could intervene militarily if China attempted to seize self-ruled Taiwan by force.Seen as a China hawk even before taking office, Takaichi made the remarks barely two weeks into her premiership, reinforcing concerns among voters already uneasy about her push for sharply higher defence spending.In the televised interview, she largely sidestepped questions about how soaring military outlays would be funded or how her government plans to ease diplomatic tensions with Beijing.Analysts say her rightward shift is unlikely to fundamentally alter Japan’s broader foreign policy direction. Takaichi is expected to maintain stable ties with South Korea, driven by shared concerns over security threats from North Korea and China.A key election pledge — suspending the 8% sales tax on food — was aimed at helping households cope with rising prices. However, the promise has rattled investors concerned about how the policy would be funded, given Japan’s heavy government debt burden.Critics, including businesses, are sceptical that higher spending and tax cuts can revive the sluggish economy.One Tokyo voter, Ritsuko Ninomiya, told the BBC, “People want their lives to be better and more comfortable because we are so accustomed to not having inflation [costs rising]... so people are very worried. I think we need a long-term solution rather than short-term fixes.”During the campaign, Takaichi pushed to toughen immigration rules, review foreign ownership of Japanese land, and tackle unpaid taxes and health insurance by foreign nationals.Critics say the policies risk creating anxiety and division in a country where only 3% of the population are foreign nationals.Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Takaichi on her “ landmark victory,"" saying Japan and India’s friendship could reach “greater heights.”US President Donald Trump also congratulated Takaichi, calling her a “highly respected and very popular” leader.Writing on Truth Social, Trump said, “I wish you Great Success in passing your Conservative, Peace Through Strength Agenda.”He added, “The wonderful people of Japan, who voted with such enthusiasm, will always have my strong support.”US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called it a “big victory,” saying “when Japan is strong, the US is strong in Asia.”People across Japan braved snow and severe weather to vote in the country’s first mid-winter election in 36 years. The transport ministry said 37 train lines and 58 ferry routes were closed, while 54 flights were cancelled as of Sunday morning. There was rare snowfall in Tokyo as voters headed to polling stations.","Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), led by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, is on course to win Sunday's snap election by a landslide.

Self-growing city on Moon in 10 years? Why Elon Musk’s SpaceX may make Mars wait,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/self-growing-city-on-moon-in-10-years-why-elon-musks-spacex-may-make-mars-wait/articleshow/128093525.cms,"SpaceX has shifted its long-standing ambition of sending humans to Mars to the backburner and is now prioritising the establishment of a human settlement on the Moon, founder Elon Musk said on Sunday.The move marks a strategic recalibration for the private space company, which has emerged as a major contractor for NASA, and also brings Musk’s plans closer in line with US President Donald Trump’s renewed emphasis on lunar exploration.“For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,” Musk said in a post on X, the social media platform he bought in 2022.Musk cited logistical challenges as a key reason behind the shift, noting that travel to Mars is constrained by planetary alignment. “It is only possible to travel to Mars when the planets align every 26 months,” he said, adding, “We can launch to the Moon every 10 days.”SpaceX’s Mars ambitions have long drawn scepticism, with critics arguing that Musk’s timelines were overly optimistic. The billionaire has repeatedly revised his projections for human missions to the Red Planet.In 2016, he said passengers could head to Mars as early as 2024, provided financing and technical hurdles were cleared. That followed his 2011 prediction to the Wall Street Journal that SpaceX astronauts would reach Mars in “Best case, 10 years, worst case, 15 to 20 years. ”The renewed lunar focus comes as the Trump administration has signalled a shift in US space policy. In an executive order issued late last year, Trump said he wanted Americans on the Moon by 2028 under NASA’s Artemis programme, for which SpaceX is a key contractor. This marked a departure from Trump’s earlier goal of planting the American flag on Mars before the end of his four-year term.NASA currently plans to return astronauts to the Moon’s surface in mid-2027 as part of the Artemis 3 mission, though the schedule has been pushed back multiple times. Industry experts say further delays are likely, citing the unfinished lunar lander being developed by SpaceX.Despite the pivot, Musk said the Moon offers faster progress toward building a permanent settlement. Easier access to the Moon “means we can iterate much faster to complete a Moon city than a Mars city,” he said.However, Musk stressed that Mars remains part of SpaceX’s long-term vision. The company would “also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about 5 to 7 years,” he added.","SpaceX is now prioritising the establishment of a human settlement on the Moon, founder Elon Musk said on Sunday.

Scent of Ramadan 2026: Arabic fragrances trending in men’s style section this season in the Gulf,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/scent-of-ramadan-2026-arabic-fragrances-trending-in-mens-style-section-this-season-in-the-gulf/articleshow/128095050.cms,"What Arabic Fragrance Trends Are Ruling Men's Section During Ramadan 2026 in the Gulf?

Woody and Oud-inspired scents: The timeless Ramadan classic



Amber and resinous blends: Warmth with a spiritual undertone this Ramadan 2026



Spicy orientals: Bold, expressive and festive for Ramadan 2026



What's the Scent of Ramadan 2026? Exploring Gulf's Top Arabic Cologne Trends

Fresh-spice hybrids: A modern Ramadan 2026 twist



Musk and soft leather accents: Subtle sophistication for Ramadan 2026



Why fragrance matters more during Ramadan in the Gulf



Ramadan's Secret Weapon: How Gulf Men Are Using Scent to Make a Statement in 2026





As Ramadan 2026 settles in, scent is once again taking centre stage across the Gulf. Far beyond a grooming afterthought, fragrance during the holy month is a quiet marker of identity and are worn for evening prayers, family iftars and the social rhythms that lead into Eid. This year’s Arabic cologne trends reflect a deeper return to heritage notes, layered with modern sensibilities and long-lasting compositions designed for reflective nights and festive gatherings.Deep, smoky woods continue to dominate Ramadan fragrance preferences. Oud-inspired compositions that are rich, resinous and unapologetically bold, remain a cultural staple, particularly for evening wear. These scents often unfold slowly, starting dense and powerful before settling into warm, grounding bases that linger for hours.For many men, woody fragrances feel intrinsically tied to Ramadan nights as they are dignified, spiritual and deeply comforting. Their longevity makes them ideal for long taraweeh prayers and extended family gatherings, where subtle presence matters more than projection.Amber-forward fragrances are seeing renewed popularity this season, prized for their soft warmth and enveloping character. These colognes often blend sweet resins with balsamic undertones, creating a scent profile that feels intimate rather than overpowering.Perfect for Ramadan evenings, amber scents evoke a sense of calm and contemplation, aligning naturally with the month’s reflective mood. They are especially favoured by men who want something rich yet restrained, offering depth without heaviness.For those who prefer their fragrance to make a statement, spicy oriental profiles are trending strongly in 2026. Think warm spices layered over dark woods and subtle sweetness as fragrances that feel celebratory and confident.These colognes are often chosen for post-iftar socialising and Eid gatherings, where boldness feels appropriate. The spice notes add energy, while the oriental base ensures the scent remains grounded and culturally resonant.A newer category gaining traction blends freshness with traditional depth. These fragrances typically open with citrus or aromatic notes before transitioning into woody or musky bases. The result is a cleaner, lighter take on Arabic perfumery, which is ideal for daytime fasting hours or warmer evenings.This hybrid style appeals to younger wearers and those seeking versatility: fragrances that move seamlessly from mosque visits to casual gatherings without feeling too heavy.Musk-based colognes, often paired with soft leather nuances, are emerging as understated favourites this Ramadan. These scents sit closer to the skin, offering a personal rather than performative presence.Favoured for their elegance and restraint, musky profiles align well with the quieter, inward focus of the holy month. They are particularly popular among men who prefer a refined signature scent that does not announce itself loudly but leaves a lasting impression.Across categories, one theme is clear: performance and emotional resonance matter more than novelty. Men are gravitating towards scents that last through long evenings, feel appropriate for spiritual settings and carry a sense of cultural familiarity.In Ramadan 2026, Arabic colognes are less about chasing trends and more about honouring moments, from silent prayers to joyful Eid embraces. Whether woody, spicy, amber-rich or softly musky, the season’s fragrances reflect a balance of devotion, tradition and modern personal style.","Scent is a quiet marker of identity and worn for evening prayers, family iftars and the social rhythms that lead into Eid.

UAE's tax-free salaries don’t mean low costs in Dubai



Can You Afford to Live in Dubai? Essential Salary Guide for Singles and Families





Dubai remains one of the most vibrant and cosmopolitan cities in the world, attracting professionals, families and expats from across the globe. However, its cost of living, especially rent and everyday expenses, is among the highest in the Middle East. Understanding the salary needed to live comfortably is essential for anyone planning to relocate or work in Dubai.For a single person living alone, the minimum salary needed to cover essential living costs such as rent, food, transport and basic leisure, typically starts at around AED 9,000–12,000 (~$2,450–$3,270) per month for a modest lifestyle. A pay of AED 5,000–7,000 (~$1,360–$1,905) might technically cover the most basic survival costs (shared accommodation, strict budget ) but would leave little room for savings, social life or quality of life improvements.To live comfortably, with a private studio or small 1 BHK, moderate dining out, public transport and occasional leisure, salaries of AED 12,000–15,000 (~$3,270–$4,085) or more are recommended by local cost analysts.These figures reflect 2026 estimates and assume you live within a balanced budget and make standard lifestyle choices. Factors like apartment size and location (e.g., Downtown vs Discovery Gardens) can significantly affect monthly expenses.A couple without children generally needs a combined monthly income of around AED 14,000–18,000 (~$3,810–$4,900) to just cover a modest lifestyle including rent for a one-bedroom apartment, groceries and transport.For a family of four, expenses rise sharply. Most cost estimates suggest that a comfortable family lifestyle encompassing rent for a 2–3 bedroom, schooling costs, groceries, healthcare and transport requires at least AED 20,000–25,000+ (~$5,445–$6,810+) per month, with some qualified figures going even higher to AED 25,000–30,000+ (~$6,810–$8,170+) depending on school fees and lifestyle choices.Schooling, in particular, adds a substantial monthly outlay when children attend private or international schools, making family budgets significantly larger than for singles.Understanding the biggest costs can help explain why Dubai salaries need to be relatively high:Besides minimum income needs, local salary ranges provide context for what professionals might expect:These ranges help illustrate why many single professionals target at least AED 12,000+ ($3,270+) to balance expenses and savings.Dubai’s tax-free income boosts take-home pay but this advantage is balanced by high housing and lifestyle costs. As expat demand grows, housing prices and overall living expenses have trended upward, even if salaries have not risen at the same pace, creating pressure for middle-income professionals.Living in Dubai on a tight budget is possible for singles with careful planning and modest lifestyle choices but it is not comfortable without adequate income and savings. Salaries of AED 9,000–12,000+ (~$2,450–$3,270) for individuals and AED 20,000–25,000+ (~$5,445–$6,810+) for families are the rough benchmarks for managing everyday life without constant financial stress. Choosing affordable housing, planning for education costs and budgeting transport and leisure wisely are key to making these figures work in practice.","For a single person living alone, the minimum salary needed to cover essential living costs such as rent, food, transport and basic leisure, typically starts at around AED 9,000–12,000 (~$2,450–$3,270) per month.

UAE: Sheikh Hamdan inaugurates driverless RT6 taxi operations in Dubai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-sheikh-hamdan-inaugurates-driverless-rt6-taxi-operations-in-dubai/articleshow/127971112.cms,"Sheikh Hamdan launched driverless RT6 taxi operations in Dubai, paving the way for public service in 2026/Image: Dubai Media Office





Dubai has formally launched the operational phase of fully autonomous RT6 taxi vehicles, marking a major step in the emirate’s push to integrate advanced artificial intelligence into its transport network.The launch was led by Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai. Sheikh Hamdan travelled in one of the autonomous taxis to the venue of the World Government Summit at Madinat Jumeirah, demonstrating the readiness of the technology to operate in real urban conditions on roads open to live traffic. The milestone clears the path for the public launch of the service in the first quarter of 2026.During the journey, Sheikh Hamdan was briefed on the vehicle’s operating system, which relies on artificial intelligence, advanced sensing technologies, and autonomous decision-making to ensure safe and seamless mobility. The RT6 vehicle, developed by Baidu Apollo Go, represents the sixth generation of autonomous taxi technology and has been designed for large-scale deployment.It is equipped with more than 40 sensors, including high-precision LiDAR, multi-band radars, and advanced cameras, allowing it to perceive its surroundings accurately, respond to changing traffic conditions, and comply fully with transport safety standards and traffic regulations.The system is supported by a sophisticated software ecosystem that integrates real-time data, high-definition maps, and deep learning algorithms, enabling smooth interaction with intersections, pedestrians, and other vehicles. The technology draws on extensive global experience, with Baidu Apollo Go vehicles having completed more than 150 million kilometres of safe driving and over 10 million autonomous trips across several cities.The initiative is the result of cooperation between the Roads and Transport Authority and Baidu Apollo Go, following discussions held during the World Governments Summit 2025. Within around 10 months, the partnership progressed from planning to live operations, reflecting Dubai’s regulatory efficiency and smart infrastructure readiness.As part of the expansion, Baidu Apollo Go has opened its first autonomous vehicle operations and control centre outside China at Dubai Science Park. Spanning 2,000 square metres, the facility manages daily operations, monitoring, software updates, maintenance, and safety testing. The company plans to expand its autonomous fleet in Dubai to more than 1,000 vehicles in the coming years, reinforcing the emirate’s ambition to lead the future of smart and sustainable mobility.","Dubai has formally launched the operational phase of fully autonomous RT6 taxi vehicles.

As the issue of 'Indian takeover' of Frisco rocked the council meeting Tuesday, pushed by influencers on social media, Frisco council's first Indian-origin member Burt Thakur spoke about the issue and said Indians who came to America upheld American Dream because American Dream needs participation.“Somewhere along the way Indians came to America, and then they became Americans, and then they helped to reinforce the American Dream because the American Dream requires participation,” Thakur said. “People are upset.

UAE Tour Women 2026

What's next?





Dubai is set to host the second stage of the UAE Tour Women 2026 this Friday, February 6, bringing world-class professional cycling to the heart of the city.The race kicks off at 12:50 PM from the Dubai Police Academy in Al Sufouh and winds through some of the emirate's most iconic landscapes.Cyclists will cover approximately 145 kilometers, heading out toward the desert and passing through Dubai Investment Park, the Al Qudra Cycle Track, and Dubai Sports City.The challenging route will eventually lead the peloton back toward the city, passing the Meydan Racecourse before concluding at the Hamdan Bin Mohammed Smart University at approximately 4:30 PM.To protect competitors, several key roads in Dubai will be temporarily shut down for 10–15 minutes at a time as the cyclists pass.Cyclists will ride through major routes including:Each closure will be rolling and brief, reopening once the riders have safely passed. This smart staging helps balance city traffic flow with race safety.The RTA has urged motorists to plan ahead, start journeys early, and use alternative routes where possible to ease delays.The Ladies’ Tour de Dubai stage is just one piece of a larger celebration of women’s cycling in the UAE.The UAE Tour Women runs multiple stages across Emirati cities, combining sprint challenges with longer endurance stages.While Dubai hosts the opening segment this Friday, riders will continue through other parts of the UAE in the coming days.

Epstein files fallout: Why UK PM Keir Starmer is under fire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/epstein-files-fallout-why-uk-pm-keir-starmer-is-under-fire/articleshow/127927777.cms,"Epstein files earthquake in US but tremors in UK - Is UK PM Keir Starmer's job under threat? (AP photo)

Mandelson-Epstein Scandal Rocks UK Parliament; Starmer Under Siege Over Russian Spy Claims, Judgment

Leadership challenges add to pressure on Starmer





The global fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal is threatening the political future of a world leader — but not the one many might expect.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has never been directly linked to Epstein, yet he is facing mounting political pressure connected to the wider fallout of the case. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump — whose name appears in some investigative files related to the disgraced financier — is facing no immediate political threat. As political tensions grow in Britain, Epstein victims continue to push for further accountability in Washington.The contrast highlights the different political environments facing both leaders. While British institutions focused on scrutiny and accountability are actively probing links tied to the scandal, Trump’s influence over the Justice Department and strong backing within the Republican-controlled Congress have limited political fallout for him. At the same time, the reach of the Epstein files continues to expand globally, with implications now touching countries including Norway and Poland, nearly seven years after Epstein’s death.In the United Kingdom, public anger over any association with Epstein has been intense. King Charles III stripped his brother, former Prince Andrew, of royal titles and removed him from royal duties due to his links with Epstein.In contrast, the United States has not seen similar political or institutional consequences for figures connected to Epstein, who died by suicide in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking and abuse charges involving underage girls.One of the most prominent figures to face professional consequences was former US treasury secretary Larry Summers. The former Harvard University president stepped back from public roles last year after emails revealed he had exchanged sexist remarks and sought personal advice from Epstein. Summers later said he was “deeply ashamed.”Trump, meanwhile, is attempting to move past renewed scrutiny after the US Department of Justice said there would be no further prosecutions tied to the case. Authorities have not charged Trump or anyone else named in newly released files, and there is no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the president. Some references to Trump in the documents are routine, while others include newly surfaced, unverified sexual assault allegations and accounts from some Epstein victims describing encounters with the future president.Starmer’s political crisis, however, has deepened. His leadership came under further strain after unrest among Labour Party lawmakers added to ongoing challenges facing his government.During a tense parliamentary session, Starmer acknowledged he was aware of the relationship between former Cabinet minister Peter Mandelson and Epstein before appointing him ambassador to Washington.Starmer dismissed Mandelson last year after earlier Epstein documents showed Mandelson maintained ties with Epstein after his 2008 sex offense conviction in Florida. The controversy intensified this week following newly released files suggesting Mandelson may have shared sensitive, market-moving information with Epstein during the 2008 financial crisis. Mandelson is now under criminal investigation and has resigned from both the House of Lords and the Labour Party.“Mandelson betrayed our country, our parliament and my party,” Starmer told parliament.The political fallout in Britain is being driven not only by Epstein’s crimes but by deeper, ongoing tensions in British politics. Starmer is facing pressure less than two years after winning a landslide election victory, with speculation growing about potential leadership challenges within the Labour Party.British prime ministers face constant internal party pressure in a system where leadership challenges can emerge quickly. The current crisis comes after more than a decade of political instability that saw the UK cycle through multiple prime ministers.The Epstein scandal has also revived scrutiny of Mandelson’s long and controversial political career. Once a key architect of Labour’s transformation in the 1990s alongside Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, Mandelson helped move the party toward the political center. However, repeated controversies — often linked to his connections with wealthy and influential figures — have overshadowed his legacy.The scandal has also revived debate about the British royal family, particularly Prince Andrew’s association with Epstein and his settlement with Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of abuse after being trafficked by Epstein. Andrew denied wrongdoing and made no admission of liability or guilt, but the settlement intensified public criticism and contributed to his removal from royal duties.While Epstein-related developments have created turbulence in US politics, they have not posed a direct threat to Trump’s presidency. He has not been accused of any crimes related to the case, though his past association with Epstein continues to draw scrutiny.Trump remains politically resilient despite ongoing controversies, from immigration policies to disputes over election integrity. His political strategy often involves overwhelming public discourse with multiple issues simultaneously, reducing the impact of any single controversy.","UK PM Keir Starmer has never been directly linked to Epstein, yet he is facing mounting political pressure.

Who qualifies for EB-1, EB-2 visas?





A lawsuit has challenged Trump's Gold Card visa program, calling it an illegal fast lane for wealthy foreigners, irrespective of merit while researchers and scientists are waiting in the backlogged queue. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Washington, asked the judge to block the program as it prioritizes wealth over intellect or ability and bypasses Congress in the process.The Gold Card program promises permanent residency in exchange for payments of at least $1 million, like the EB-1 and EB-2 visas. In EB category visas, the applicants have to create jobs in the US but Gold Card visa program gives a waiver to the applicants from that criteria as they are 'gifting' the government a specific amount of money.“Rather than reserving those visas for the world’s best and brightest, the Gold Card program converts those visas into revenue-generating commodities sold to the highest bidder,” the lawsuit by a coalition of immigrants, labor unions and academic organizations argued.People with extraordinary ability qualify for an EB-1 visa showing sustained national or international acclaim and achievements that have been recognized in their field.One must intend to continue to work in this field and show that you will substantially benefit the United States in the future.The lawsuit noted that none of these categories created by Congress includes a million-dollar pay and play option and there is a separate visa category for that. EB-5 was specifically created by Congress to spur investment in the US and this category requires applicants to invest about $1 million in a new commercial enterprise for at least two years, but it also has other, more stringent requirements, including specifications as to where such investments must be made.“If you look at the statute, you can tell Congress made some pretty deliberate decisions about how they wanted to structure the availability of these visas,” said Sarah Wilson, a partner at the law firm Colombo & Hurd and one of the lawyers who brought the suit. Wilson's firm was joined by the Democracy Defenders Fund, a nonprofit that challenged Trump administration on a number of fronts.","A lawsuit has challenged Trump's Gold Card visa program, calling it an illegal fast lane for wealthy foreigners.

Hajj early start tied to long term planning goals





Hajj service and accommodation contracts completed





Hajj camps allocated and coordination ongoing





Focus on smoother operations during the season









Saudi authorities have moved early on preparations for the next Hajj, opening the visa process months before pilgrims begin their journey, a step aimed at tightening planning and easing pressure during the peak season.The Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has announced that visas for the 2026 Hajj season, corresponding to 1447 AH, began being issued on Sunday, February 8, which falls on Sha’ban 20. The early start places the Kingdom nearly four months ahead of the rituals, setting the tone for a more structured and predictable pilgrimage season.Officials said the advanced timeline is part of a broader push to raise service readiness and improve pilgrim comfort. The move aligns with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 framework, which prioritises efficiency, service quality, and better crowd management across the Hajj and Umrah ecosystem.By initiating visa issuance well in advance, authorities aim to give pilgrims, service providers, and Hajj affairs offices more time to prepare, coordinate, and address logistical requirements before arrivals begin.The ministry said contracts covering all services at the holy sites for pilgrims arriving from outside the Kingdom have been finalised.Accommodation agreements in Makkah have also been completed in full through the Nusk platform, clearing a major operational milestone early in the cycle.In terms of demand, 750,000 pilgrims have registered so far. Packages have already been booked for 30,000 pilgrims directly from their home countries, reflecting early engagement with the system.Preparations at the holy sites are advancing alongside visa issuance. Around 485 camps have been allocated for international pilgrims, while 73 Hajj affairs offices have completed their basic contractual arrangements.The ministry said coordination is continuing with Hajj affairs offices and service providers both inside and outside Saudi Arabia to finalise remaining operational details and ensure consistency across services.Officials described the early visa rollout as part of a proactive approach designed to reduce last minute challenges and deliver a more organised Hajj experience.The step forms part of a wider set of organisational and technical measures already under way. These include completing service contracts at the holy sites, approving accommodation and transport agreements, and preparing and allocating camps. Together, these measures are intended to support smooth operations and improve service delivery for millions of pilgrims expected to arrive for Hajj 2026.","Saudi Arabia will begin issuing Hajj 2026 visas from February 8, four months ahead.

‘Impregnate 20 Women, Create Super Race’: Inside Epstein’s SICKEST ‘Baby Ranch’ Plan Using His DNA





Jeffrey Epstein’s victims used the huge audience of Super Bowl Sunday to once again call for the release of millions of government documents linked to the late sex offender.In a short advert aired just before one of the most-watched television events in the United States, eight women stood together and demanded full transparency from the Trump administration. They held photos of themselves as children from the time they say they were abused by Epstein.“After years of being kept apart we’re standing together,” they said. “Because we all deserve the truth.”The public service announcement was released with World Without Exploitation, a human sex trafficking advocacy group. The video opened with the message, “On November 19, 2025, the Epstein Files Transparency Act was signed into law. 3 Million Files Still Have Not Been Released.”The video aired just before President Donald Trump and millions of other Americans tuned in to watch the Seattle Seahawks play the New England Patriots in the NFL championship.Earlier this week, Trump, whose second term has been clouded by attention on his past friendship with Epstein, said it was time to “move on” from the disgraced financier.On January 30, the US Department of Justice released about three million pages from its investigation into Epstein under the Epstein Files Transparency Act.The release included around 2,000 videos and 180,000 images.However, about half of the estimated six million files have not been made public. This has raised fresh fears among survivors that some of Epstein’s alleged accomplices may never face justice, and has led to new claims of a cover-up.The victims are now leading calls for the remaining files to be released. The video ends by urging the public to “stand with us” and to “tell Attorney General Pam Bondi it’s time for the truth”.The Department of Justice says the withheld files cannot be released because they reveal victims’ identities, include child pornography, or could affect ongoing federal investigations.“We didn’t protect or not protect anybody,” deputy attorney general Todd Blanche said, adding that the department had “completed” its release of the files.More than 38,000 references to Trump, his wife and his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida appear across 5,300 of the newly released files, reported The Telegraph.Epstein died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, in a death ruled a suicide. His longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell was jailed in 2022 and is serving a 20-year sentence for helping him recruit underage girls.According to a letter obtained by NBC News, members of Congress will be able to view the unredacted files on secure Justice Department computers starting on Monday.","Eight women held photos of themselves as children from the time they say they were abused by Epstein.

Kid Rock Or Bad Bunny? Trump’s Preference Shakes Super Bowl Talk





US President Donald Trump has launched a scathing attack on the Super Bowl LX halftime show, calling it “absolutely terrible” and one of the worst in history.The show, headlined by Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny and featuring multiple artists, drew Trump’s sharp criticism on social media, where he said it failed to reflect American values and standards.Taking to his Truth Social platform, Trump slammed both the performance and the choice of headliner.“Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World. This ‘Show’ is just a ‘slap in the face’ to our Country, which is setting new standards and records every single day — including the Best Stock Market and 401(k)s in History!” Trump wrote.He went on to accuse the media of giving the performance undue praise.""There is nothing inspirational about this mess of a Halftime Show and watch, it will get great reviews from the Fake News Media, because they haven’t got a clue of what is going on in the REAL WORLD — And, by the way, the NFL should immediately replace its ridiculous new Kickoff Rule,"" he added.The halftime show, however, was widely seen as a celebration of Latin music and culture.Bad Bunny turned the Super Bowl stage into a vibrant street-style spectacle, performing his biggest hits and becoming the first-ever halftime show headliner to sing entirely in Spanish.The performance came just a week after Bad Bunny made headlines at the Grammy Awards, where he won the coveted Album of the Year prize. During his acceptance speech, the singer delivered a pointed message against Trump’s immigration crackdown, earning loud cheers when he declared “ICE out” from the stage.Despite Trump’s harsh reaction, the show marked a historic moment for Latino representation at one of the world’s most-watched sporting events.","The Super Bowl LX halftime show was headlined by Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny.

Apps to boycott US goods gain traction amid Trump's threats to Greenland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/apps-to-boycott-us-goods-gain-traction-amid-trumps-threats-to-greenland/articleshow/128090506.cms,"EU's Huge Greenland Reveal After Trump Backs Off On Tariff Threat Over Invasion Protest





COPENHAGEN: The makers of mobile apps designed to help shoppers identify and boycott American goods say they saw a surge of interest in Denmark and beyond after the flare-up in tensions over President Trump's designs on Greenland.The creator of the ""Made O'Meter"" app, Ian Rosenfeldt, said he saw around 30,000 downloads of the free app in just three days at the height of the trans-Atlantic crisis in late Jan out of more than 100,000 since it was launched in March 2025.Rosenfeldt, who works in digital marketing, decided to create the app a year ago after joining a Facebook group of like-minded Danes hoping to boycott US goods. ""Many people were frustrated and thinking, 'How do we actually do this in practical terms,'"" the 53-year-old recalled. ""If you use a bar code scanner, it's difficult to see if a product is actually American or not. And if you don't know that, you can't make a conscious choice. ""The latest version of ""Made O'Meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyse several products at a time, then recommend similar European-made alternatives. Users can set preferences, like ""No USA-owned brands"" or ""Only EU-based brands."" The app claims over 95% accuracy.""By using AI, you can take an image of a product ... and it can make a deep dive to go out and find the correct information about the product in many levels,"" Rosenfeldt told Associated Press during a demonstration at a Copenhagen grocery store. ""This way, you have information that you can use to take decisions on what you think is right.""After an initial surge of downloads when the app was launched, usage tailed off. Until last month, when Trump stepped up his rhetoric about the need for the US to acquire Greenland, a strategically important and mineral-rich Arctic island that is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.Usage peaked Jan 23, when there were almost 40,000 scans in one day, compared with 500 or so daily last summer. It has dropped back since but there were still around 5,000 a day this week, said Rosenfeldt, who noted ""Made O'Meter"" is used by over 20,000 people in Denmark but also by people in Germany, Spain, Italy, even Venezuela. ""It's become personal,"" said Rosenfeldt, who spoke of ""losing an ally and a friend."" Rosenfeldt knows such boycotts won't damage the US economy, but hopes to send a message to supermarkets and encourage greater reliance on European producers.Another Danish app, ""NonUSA,"" topped 100,000 downloads at the beginning of Feb. One of its creators, 21-year-old Jonas Pipper, said there were over 25,000 downloads Jan 21, when 526 product scans were performed in a minute at one point. Of the users, some 46,000 are in Denmark and around 10,000 in Germany. ""We noticed some users saying they felt like a little bit of the pressure was lifted off them,"" Pipper said. On a recent morning, shoppers leaving one Copenhagen grocery store were divided. ""We do boycott, but we don't know all the American goods. So, it's mostly the well-known trademarks,"" said Morten Nielsen, 68, a retired navy officer. Sixty-three retiree Charlotte Fuglsang said, ""I love America, I love travelling in America. I don't think we should reegister protest that way.""","""Made O'Meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyse several products at a time.

Who is Martin Nowak?

A Harvard-trial





Harvard professor Martin Nowak's deep ties with convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have resurfaced after the release of the files by the Department of Justice. Along with email chains, the documents reveal a $6.5M gift, private travel and even university sanctions, in shocking revelations.Nowak, a popular mathematical biologist appears more than 4,000 times in the records released under the 2025 Epstein Files Transparency Act, as per The Sunday Guardian.The documents reveal that Epstein and Nowak shared a long-standing financial and personal relationship that continued even after the late billionaire was convicted in 2008.In 2003, Epstein gave $6.5 million to establish Program for Evolutionary Dynamics (PED) at Harvard which Nowak founded and led. This was a part of his larger $9.1 million donations to the university. Epstein also kept a private office in the PED building for 10 years and visited more than forty times between 2010 and 2018.In 2014, the two exchanged an email where the professor wrote to Epstein, ""our spy was captured after completing her mission."" To this Epstein responded, ""Did you torture her?""In another email, a writer told Nowak that Epstein wanted to have dinner with him, the 'Chomskys' and 'all the boys' at the Institute.“Jeffrey would like to have dinner at the Institute this Friday with the Chomskys and `all the boys' he says he would like an hour with you alone first—will this work for you? I know you said you have something starting at 4 pm at PED,” they wrote. Chomsky here refers to Noam Chomsky, who has also been mentioned in the files earlier.Apart from professional help and suspicious emails, Nowak also stayed at Epstein's New York apartment and thanked his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell for ""amazing hospitality"". He was also a planned beneficiary of $5 million in Epstein's will, just days before his death.Martin Nowak is an Austrian-born professor of math and biology at Harvard University. From cancer progression to viral systems, he has researched on numerous diverse topics. He also founded and ran the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics (PED) at the university.Born in Vienna in 1965, he went to Albertus Magnus School and studied Biochemistry and Mathematics at the University of Vienna. He went to Oxford as an Erwin Schrödinger Scholar in 1989 and became Professor of Mathematical Biology in 1997. He joined Harvard in 2003. A highly cited and popular scholar he has previously held positions at the Institute for Advanced Study as well.In 2020, Harvard shut down PED and banned Nowak from starting new research or advising students for at least two years. This was after he was suspended following a university review that found he had extensive and unreported contact with Epstein. The review also found that Nowak devoted a page to Epstein on the centre's website with links to the financier's website.However, all sanctions were lifted in 2023 and Nowak remains a professor with joint appointments in Mathematics and Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at the university.Epstein killed himself in Metropolitan Correctional Centre, New York City in 2019 after being arrested on sex trafficking charges. He had pleaded not guilty to sexually abusing girls as young as 14 and young women in New York and Florida in the early 2000s.","Harvard professor Martin Nowak's deep ties with convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have resurfaced after the release of the files by the Department of Justice.

US President Donald Trump has once again claimed that American elections are “rigged” and “stolen,” renewing calls for sweeping changes to voting rules that he says are necessary to restore public trust in the electoral system.In a post on Truth Social on Sunday, Trump warned that the United States risks political collapse unless major reforms are introduced.""America’s elections are rigged, stolen, and a laughingstock all over the world. We are either going to fix them, or we won’t have a country any longer,"" Trump wrote.In his post, Trump outlined three key demands under what he called the “Save America Act.”First, he called for mandatory government-issued photo identification for all voters. Second, he demanded proof of US citizenship at the time of voter registration. Third, he urged an end to most mail-in voting, allowing it only in limited circumstances such as illness, disability, military service or travel.Trump argued that these measures would prevent fraud and restore public confidence in elections. While several US states already require voter ID, the types of identification accepted vary widely across the country.His latest remarks follow comments in a recent interview in which he urged Republicans to “nationalise” and “take over” voting processes in at least 15 locations, though he did not specify which ones. Those comments drew criticism from election experts, who warned that federal control of local elections could undermine the independence of state and county authorities.Under the US Constitution, states hold primary responsibility for administering elections, although Congress can establish certain nationwide standards.Democratic leaders quickly condemned Trump’s statements. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused him of attempting to manipulate the electoral system for political gain.“What Donald Trump wants to do is try to nationalise the election. Translation: Steal it. And we’re not going to let it happen,” Jeffries said in an interview with CNN.Jeffries said Democrats had blocked Republican efforts to redraw congressional maps in what he described as unfair ways and had opposed attempts to expand federal control over election administration.According to US election data and multiple court rulings, no evidence has emerged to support claims of widespread fraud in recent national elections. More than 60 lawsuits challenging the 2020 election results were dismissed or withdrawn.","US President Donald Trump has once again claimed that American elections are “rigged” and “stolen,” renewing calls for sweeping changes to voting rules.

Why is Minneapolis witnessing unrest?





Minneapolis witnessed a fresh wave of unrest on Saturday as an anti-ICE protest outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building spiralled into chaotic scenes, including demonstrators hurling sex toys and other objects amid clashes with law enforcement.Videos circulating online showed protesters throwing items over security fencing toward the federal complex, which houses immigration enforcement operations.In one viral video, a pickup truck driver displaying anti-ICE placards, including one reading “Nuremberg 2.0”, was surrounded by demonstrators who appeared to mistake him for an opponent.Despite repeatedly shouting that he supported their cause, the man was confronted by members of the crowd, some of whom struck his vehicle and removed a sign from his hands. The situation eventually de-escalated after other protesters intervened.Authorities said the gathering later intensified, with some individuals allegedly throwing ice chunks and bottles at officers guarding the building.The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office declared an unlawful assembly and confirmed that dozens of people were arrested.Officials stated that while many participants protested peacefully, some engaged in property damage and assaults, including an incident in which a deputy was reportedly struck.Counter-protesters were also present. Witness accounts and online footage suggested that individuals in a passing vehicle fired paintballs and pepper balls toward demonstrators, further escalating tensions.The protest coincided with ongoing federal immigration enforcement operations in the Twin Cities area.Recent remarks by federal officials indicated that personnel levels may be reduced, though operations continue under what has been described as “Operation Metro Surge.”The demonstrations stem from anger over the fatal shootings of two American nationals during separate encounters with federal immigration agents. Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three and poet, was shot last month as she drove away from immigration officers on a snowy Minneapolis street.Federal authorities described her as a threat, a claim disputed by local leaders. Her death triggered large-scale protests across Minneapolis and other US cities.Three weeks later, Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital, was shot during a confrontation with border patrol agents who reportedly spotted his licensed firearm.Family members described him as compassionate and deeply troubled by the federal immigration crackdown.",Anti-ICE protest in Minneapolis spiralled into chaotic scenes on Saturday.

Colder than Antarctica? What caused New York’s life-threatening deep freeze,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/colder-than-antarctica-what-caused-new-yorks-life-threatening-deep-freeze/articleshow/128080555.cms,"



New York City recorded temperatures colder than parts of Antarctica on Sunday after life-threatening winds swept across much of the Northeast and New England over the weekend.Temperatures hit 3 degrees in the city on Sunday, with bitter wind chills dragging the real feel temperatures to 14 degrees below zero. Parts of the northeast reported wind chills that hit 40-below, New York Post reported.Rare Extreme Cold Warnings were issued for more than 43 million people, including major metro areas such as New York and Philadelphia, through Sunday evening by the National Weather Service.“The last time [New York City] had a warning issued similar to what we have this morning was in 2004,” FOX Weather Meteorologist Stephen Morgan said Friday.Antartica, by contrast, was a balmy 21 degrees at McMurdo Station, 18 degrees warmer than New York City.New Yorkers can thank a blast of Arctic air that is heading south from the frozen tundra north of Hudson Bay, Canada, for the latest round of winter misery.“In many parts of the Northeast away from the coast, this prolonged stretch of cold is the most extreme in at least the last decade and, in some areas, the last two decades,” AccuWeather Senior Director of Forecasting Operations Dan DePodwin said.“Many locations will end up with a streak of days below freezing that falls into the top 10 longest such streaks on record,” he added.This weekend was set to be the coldest day in what has already been a record cold snap, the worst in over two decades.“The deep freeze is returning to the northeastern United States this weekend,” AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.“The combination of Arctic air and gusty winds could make it feel colder than any other point so far this winter for many in the region,” he added.So far this year, at least 17 people died outside in New York City, with 13 confirmed to have perished from hypothermia.Despite the rising death toll, Mayor Mamdani refused to force homeless people off the streets and into shelters.Warming shelters were opened in other major cities including Philadelphia, Washington DC, and Boston, where Mayor Michelle Wu issued a cold weather emergency for the city lasting through Monday.","Temperatures hit 3 degrees in the city on Sunday, with bitter wind chills dragging the real feel temperatures to 14 degrees below zero.

Two Indian American men from Glastonbury were charged in federal court with using thousands of stolen identities to defraud FanDuel, a major US online sports betting company, and other online gambling platforms of roughly $3 million.A federal grand jury in New Haven returned a 45-count indictment on February 3 charging Amitoj Kapoor, 29, and Siddharth Lillaney, 29, both of Glastonbury, with fraud, identity theft , and money laundering offences, the US Attorney’s Office, District of Connecticut, announced on Feb. 7 The announcement was made by David X. Sullivan, US Attorney for the District of Connecticut, along with Thomas Demeo, special agent in charge of the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation in New England, and Bryan T. Cafferelli, commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection.Kapoor and Lillaney were arrested on Feb. 5 and appeared before the US Magistrate Judge Maria E. Garcia in New Haven. Both were released on US$300,000 bonds.According to court documents and statements made in court, the defendants conspired to defraud online gambling companies, primarily FanDuel, by opening accounts using the personal identifying information of identity theft victims in Connecticut and elsewhere.Prosecutors alleged the accounts were used to exploit promotional incentives offered to new users, including bonuses, credits, and bonus bets.To open the accounts, Kapoor and Lillaney allegedly purchased stolen personal data belonging to thousands of victims from darknet marketplaces and through the encrypted messaging service Telegram.Authorities said the two men also maintained accounts on background-check websites to obtain additional information about victims and used that data to answer identity-verification questions during the account sign-up process.If a wager placed with a bonus bet resulted in winnings, prosecutors alleged the funds were transferred to virtual stored-value cards backed by FDIC-insured financial institutions that were linked to the gambling platforms. The proceeds were then moved into bank and investment accounts controlled by the defendants.Federal authorities alleged that since 2021, Kapoor and Lillaney used the personal information of approximately 3,000 identity theft victims to open accounts across FanDuel and other online gambling platforms, generating about US$3 million in profits.“As alleged, these two men used thousands of stolen identities to open online gambling accounts and exploit new user incentives, which for several years allowed them to gamble with stolen money,” Sullivan said. “Their winning streak is now over.”Demeo said individuals responsible for identity theft on such a scale should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, adding that IRS Criminal Investigation remained focused on tracing complex financial transactions and money-laundering schemes.Cafferelli said the investigation began as a gaming-related inquiry but quickly expanded due to the scale of the alleged identity theft and fraud, which involved thousands of potential victims nationwide. He urged individuals who believe they may be victims of identity theft to report the matter through IdentityTheft.gov.The indictment charged Kapoor and Lillaney with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and identity fraud; 23 counts of wire fraud; eight counts of identity fraud; two counts of aggravated identity theft; one count of money laundering conspiracy; and 10 counts of money laundering. Several of the charges carry maximum prison sentences of up to 20 years, while the aggravated identity theft counts carry mandatory consecutive two-year prison terms.Federal prosecutors emphasised that an indictment is not evidence of guilt and that the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.","A federal grand jury in New Haven returned a 45-count indictment on February 3 charging Amitoj Kapoor, 29, and Siddharth Lillaney, 29.

Eight skull fractures, five brain hemorrhages

Calls for probe, political backlash





A 31-year-old Mexican immigrant has alleged that he was brutally beaten by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers during his arrest in Minnesota last month, leaving him with multiple skull fractures and brain hemorrhages.Alberto Castañeda Mondragón told the Associated Press that he was pulled out of a friend’s car outside a shopping centre in St. Paul on January 8 and assaulted without provocation. “They started beating me right away when they arrested me,” he told AP.According to Castañeda Mondragón, officers threw him to the ground, handcuffed him, punched him and struck his head with a steel baton before dragging him into an SUV and transporting him to a detention facility, where he claims the assault continued.“They were very racist people. No one insulted them, neither me nor the other person they detained me with. It was their character, their racism toward us, for being immigrants,” he said.ICE officers have maintained in court documents that he “purposefully ran headfirst into a brick wall” while being detained, a version of events he has strongly denied.“There was never a wall,” he told AP, alleging that officers used an ASP, a telescoping metal baton commonly carried by law enforcement, to hit him.Mondragón, who has no criminal record, said he plans to file a complaint. He told AP that he continues to suffer from memory loss, balance issues and lingering trauma following the incident.When he closes his eyes at night, he said, fear still grips him. “You’re left with the nightmare of going to work and being stopped,” he told AP. “They hit you.”Castañeda Mondragón was later taken to Hennepin County Medical Center, where CT scans revealed fractures to the front, back and sides of his skull. He told AP that doctors informed him he had suffered eight skull fractures and five life-threatening brain hemorrhages.Medical staff who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity reportedly questioned ICE’s claim that his injuries resulted from running into a wall. An outside physician consulted by AP also stated that the pattern of injuries was inconsistent with such an explanation.A federal court declaration filed on January 20 by ICE deportation officer William J. Robinson acknowledged that during intake it was determined Castañeda Mondragón “had a head injury that required emergency medical treatment.”The filing also noted that he had entered the US legally in March 2022 but had overstayed his visa. A federal judge later ruled that his arrest had been unlawful and ordered his release from ICE custody.The case has triggered calls for an investigation from Minnesota elected officials, including Governor Tim Walz, who posted on X: “Law enforcement cannot be lawless. Thousands of aggressive, untrained agents of the federal government continue to injure and terrorize Minnesotans. This must end.”St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and several members of Congress have also sought accountability, according to AP.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees ICE, did not respond to repeated requests for comment from AP. ICE and DHS also did not immediately respond to queries from PEOPLE magazine.","Alberto Castañeda Mondragón, 31, claims he was brutally beaten by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers during his arrest in Minnesota last month.

Florida now offers English-only driving tests following fatal crash involving immigrant driver,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/florida-now-offers-english-only-driving-tests-following-fatal-crash-involving-immigrant-driver/articleshow/128073693.cms,"ICE Puts Illegal Indian Trucker On Notice After California Crash | ‘High On Drugs, Didn’t Brake’





Floridians seeking a driver’s licence were required to pass the state’s exams entirely in English for the first time in nearly two decades, after the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles implemented an English-only policy that officials said followed a fatal crash involving an illegal immigrant who failed a test 10 times before the accident.The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles announced the policy last week. The rule went into effect Friday and was aimed at “promoting clear communication, understanding of traffic laws, and responsible driving behavior.”Officials said the move was prompted by a deadly crash last summer involving Hardjiner Singh, an illegal immigrant who had obtained a commercial driver’s licence in California. Singh attempted an illegal U-turn with his tractor-trailer, triggering a crash that killed three people, according to New York Post citing officials.State authorities later determined that Singh received his California licence despite failing an English proficiency test. Officials said the incident sparked backlash from public officials and renewed scrutiny of language requirements for commercial drivers.“Good reform by (Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles) to require driver exams be conducted only in English,” Governor Ron DeSantis wrote on X last week.“Need to be able to read the road signs!”The policy also drew criticism from Democrats. Nikki Fried, the former state agriculture commissioner and current chair of the Florida Democratic Party, condemned the change.“In one of the most multilingual states in the country, Florida is going to implement driver’s license exams exclusively in English,” Fried wrote Jan. 30 on X.“This is not about safety, this is about racism.”Authorities said Singh entered the United States illegally in 2018 and was living in California at the time of the crash. Records showed he failed the CDL knowledge exam 10 times in Washington state over a two-month period and twice failed the air brakes exam before ultimately being licensed.Singh was arrested days after the crash in Stockton, Calif., extradited to Florida and charged with three counts of vehicular homicide and three counts of manslaughter. He has pleaded not guilty and was being held without bond in the St. Lucie County Jail.","The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles announced the policy last week.

Political calculation ahead of midterm elections

Younger voters feel squeezed out

Construction slows despite housing shortage

Mixed signals on housing policy

Risks ahead for prices and voters

US President Donald Trump has made it clear that he wants home prices to keep rising, pushing back against calls to increase construction to make housing more affordable.Speaking at a Cabinet meeting on January 29, Trump said he did not want policies that would bring prices down, arguing instead that homeowners should continue to benefit from rising property values, as per news agency AP.“I don’t want to drive housing prices down. I want to drive housing prices up for people that own their homes,” Trump said, adding that making houses “too easy and too cheap” to buy would reduce their value.Trump’s stance could strengthen his support among older voters, who are more likely to own homes and turn out in large numbers during midterm elections in November.AP VoteCast data shows that 81% of Trump’s voters in the 2024 election were homeowners, many with low-rate mortgages or homes already paid off. However, analysts warn that the strategy could alienate younger voters, who played a key role in expanding Trump’s coalition in 2024.Brent Buchanan of Republican-aligned polling firm Cygnal said voters under 40 were crucial to Trump’s return to the White House and could stay away if they feel policy is tilted towards baby boomers.Housing affordability remains a major concern, particularly for younger Americans.Booker Lightman, a 30-year-old software engineer in Colorado, told AP that limited construction was pushing people out of the state. “There’s just not enough housing supply,” he said, as quoted by AP.Real estate agent Shay Hata said competition for homes had become intense, with many suburban properties attracting five to 20 offers. She described the market as “very discouraging for buyers” who are being priced out.Despite the supply crunch, new construction has slowed. According to the US Census Bureau, permits for single-family homes fell 9.4% over the past year to October, dropping to an annual rate of 876,000, reported AP.Economists and industry experts argue that boosting supply is key to easing affordability pressures.Trump previously supported measures to expand housing supply, including tax breaks, deregulation and opening federal land for development.As recently as October, he urged builders to ramp up construction, calling on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to help homebuilders “restore the American Dream.”In office, however, Trump has focused mainly on pressing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and directing the two government-backed mortgage firms to buy at least $200 billion in home loan securities to lower borrowing costs.Experts caution that if economic growth lifts demand further, home prices could rise even faster.Edward Pinto of the American Enterprise Institute said construction would need to increase by 50% to 100% over three years just to stabilise prices.“It’s very hard to crater home prices,” he said, suggesting Trump’s fears of falling values may be overstated.",US President Donald Trump has said he wants home prices to keep rising.

'Not Vassals Of Trump & Elon Musk': Spain's Deputy PM Makes Blistering Exit From 'Place Of Hate' X





Pakistan’s decision on granting a licence to Starlink to operate in its satellite internet market has been delayed amid data security concerns, geopolitical sensitivities and competition from Chinese firms, local media reported on Sunday.Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk , is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan. However, officials say unresolved security considerations and broader geopolitical factors have slowed the clearance process.According to the Express Tribune, the government has raised concerns that Starlink’s services could allow certain data transmissions to bypass Pakistan’s monitoring, regulatory and safety checks. “We cannot allow a license to Starlink without ensuring a safety check to ensure the safety of the data of consumers in Pakistan,” a senior government official was quoted as saying by Express Tribune.Sources cited by the newspaper said authorities had tested scenarios in which Starlink was expected to pick up sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services. “But the real reason is that the government has tested some cases in which Starlink was supposed to pick up some sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services,” sources said.Officials added that the government is working to address these issues, which have delayed the approval process.The report also cited the fallout between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk as a factor being weighed by the Pakistani establishment. While Trump and Musk had enjoyed a close relationship in the past, they later drifted apart. Officials indicated that Pakistan, which has seen improved ties with the United States since Trump returned to power last year, is cautious about taking steps that could draw scrutiny from Washington.At present, Pakistan maintains control over internet data traffic largely through Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited, which holds a majority stake in the country’s undersea cable infrastructure. Authorities are concerned that similar oversight may not be feasible with satellite-based services, raising fears of potential data breaches or loss of regulatory control.Satellite internet services are expected to focus primarily on remote and underserved regions, including Balochistan, where conventional broadband infrastructure remains limited. Currently, authorities are able to monitor internet traffic and suspend connectivity when required for security reasons. Officials have expressed concern that enforcing similar controls over satellite-based networks could prove more challenging.The Pakistan Space Activities Regulatory Board has confirmed that five companies, including Starlink and China-based Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology Limited, have shown interest in entering the satellite internet market. Chinese firms already have a strong presence in Pakistan’s telecommunications sector and are viewed as direct competitors to US-based companies such as Starlink.While consultations with stakeholders have been completed, the PSARB has yet to finalise the licensing framework. According to officials, additional time is needed to establish safety mechanisms before satellite-based internet services are permitted to begin operations.","Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday. Toll rose to 36 on Saturday after some critically injured people died in hospitals, said a PTI report.In a related development that has attracted the attention of Indian security establishment, the Islamic State in its latest al-Naba issue called on members of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) to defect and join the Islamic State in Khorasan Province.The claim regarding the blast was issued via IS central's mouthpiece, Amaq, stating the attack was a Fidayeen operation carried out by a soldier of the Islamic State in Pakistan Province (ISPP) -- active since 2019 -- inside the mosque compound. Amaq claimed over 200 casualties in contrast to the official Pak govt admission of 36 deaths and injuries to scores.The suicide bomber was identified by Amaq as Saifullah Ansari. His photograph taking the bayah (oath of allegiance) was also posted by the IS mouthpiece. The statement also mentioned that hundreds of Pakistani Shias had joined the pro-Iran 'Zaynabiyoun brigade' militia in Syria.The claim by Amaq followed an official denial by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which strongly rebutted any involvement in the incident.The blast, which occurred during prayers at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque in Tarlai area, was the deadliest in Islamabad since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.The explosion coincided with the visit of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to Pakistan. The attack is being seen as a result of growing sectarian tensions in the country.Earlier in Jan, ISKP had claimed responsibility for a blast in Bajaur district that killed a senior Lashkar commander named Najibullah.","Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday.

'Home-Grown Ills': Islamabad Mosque Blast Triggers Blame Game As India Rejects Pakistan's Blame





The Islamic State on Saturday claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad, which killed at least 36 people and injured many others.In a statement released through its Amaq News Agency, the Islamic State in Pakistan, an offshoot of Daesh, said the bomber opened fire at security guards when they tried to stop him at the entrance and then exploded inside among worshippers.The group also said Shiite Muslims in Pakistan were a target, claiming they provided recruits to militias fighting the Islamic State in Syria.The blast took place on Friday at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque-cum-shrine in the Tarlie area of the capital. The attacker, identified as 32-year-old Yasir from Peshawar, entered the mosque while worshippers were offering weekly prayers and detonated explosives.Authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said they arrested four suspects, including three alleged facilitators and the mastermind, during intelligence-based raids in Peshawar and Nowshera.Investigators said an identity card recovered during the probe confirmed the attacker’s identity. Official records showed his permanent address in Abbas Colony on Charsadda Road in Peshawar.Officials also said the attacker had spent around five months in Afghanistan before the bombing, where he allegedly received training in weapons handling and suicide attacks.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif had earlier claimed that India and Afghanistan were involved in the attack, without presenting any evidence.India had strongly rejected the allegations, saying, ""It is unfortunate that, instead of seriously addressing the problems plaguing its social fabric, Pakistan should choose to delude itself by blaming others for its home-grown ills. India rejects any and every such allegation, which is as baseless as it is pointless.""","The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad.

Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States aimed at easing tensions between the two countries, slated to take place on Friday in Turkey.“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query, reported Dawn.Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar is expected to take part in the meeting, the daily reported citing a diplomatic source, adding that “Islamabad’s participation was seen as significant.”An Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the meeting is likely to be held in Turkiye on Friday. The format of the talks remains unclear, though the official said the main meeting would take place that day.A regional official told Reuters that the priority of the talks was to avoid conflict and de-escalate tensions between Iran and the US, adding that several regional powers had been invited at the foreign ministers’ level.According to the official, countries invited include Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).US outlet Axios, citing two sources and a US official, reported that Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible agreement related to Iran’s nuclear programme.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had instructed Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” in an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.The talks, he said in posts on X, would be held “within the framework of our national interests”.US President Donald Trump has said he is hopeful Washington would “work something out” with Iran but warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal was reached.In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”“In return, we expect sanctions to be lifted,” he added, while warning that Iran was prepared for war if talks failed, saying any conflict would likely spread beyond Iran.Turkiye has been leading diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and engaging with regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.","Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States.

Imran Khan’s Sisters Allege Illegal Isolation, Stage Protest Outside Adiala Jail





A Pakistani anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan, sister of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan in connection with a protest held in Islamabad in November 2024.According to news agency PTI citing a media report, the warrants were issued by the ATC in Rawalpindi after Aleema Khan failed to appear before the court despite earlier directions.The court also issued non-bailable arrest warrants against her two guarantors and ordered that all three be arrested and produced before it on Wednesday, without fail. Aleema’s application seeking exemption from personal appearance was rejected.The case, registered at Sadiqabad Police Station, relates to a protest at D-Chowk in Islamabad on November 24, 2024 and includes charges of protesting against the government, chanting anti-government slogans, vandalism and stone-pelting. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing.The court also issued a show-cause notice to the Superintendent of Police (SP), Rawal, for failing to execute the arrest warrants.The SP has been directed to appear before the court on Wednesday and explain why Aleema Khan was not arrested and presented despite clear orders, according to Pakistani news website Express Tribune.During Monday’s hearing, Aleema Khan’s defence counsel sought a one-day exemption, citing difficulties in travel and daily affairs after her bank accounts, Computerised National Identity Card and passport were reportedly blocked. The court, however, did not accept the plea.The proceedings have drawn attention as Aleema Khan had earlier skipped multiple hearings in the case and appeared only after the court issued property seizure orders and several arrest warrants. She is among those nominated as accused in protest-related cases filed following the November demonstrations.The protest followed Imran Khan’s “final call” for nationwide demonstrations demanding the restoration of the party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) electoral mandate, the release of party leaders and the reversal of constitutional changes.The D-Chowk protest ended on November 26 after a security operation, with several cases registered across Rawalpindi district. In total, 29 cases linked to the protest have been filed in the district, with Imran Khan named in several and his wife, Bushra Bibi, charged in all 29 cases.","Pakistani anti-terrorism court issues non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan.

Troops ‘physically handicapped’ by vast terrain

Insurgency background and wider fallout





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country’s security forces are “physically handicapped” by the sheer size of Balochistan as they battle a fresh surge in militant violence, after authorities reported killing 177 insurgents in sweeping counter-terror operations across the province.Addressing the national assembly, Asif described the scale of the challenge facing troops deployed in Pakistan’s largest and least populated province, where coordinated attacks triggered one of the deadliest security crises in recent years. His remarks came after militants launched simultaneous assaults in multiple towns, targeting civilians, homes and security installations.“Balochistan constitutes over 40 per cent of Pakistan geographically...To control it is much more difficult than a populated city, and it needs deployment of massive forces. Our troops are deployed there and are in action against them (terrorists), but they are physically handicapped by guarding and patrolling such a big area,” Asif told lawmakers, as quoted by PTI.Security officials said the death toll of militants had risen to 177 in the past two days following large-scale raids and gun battles.The operations were launched after insurgents carried out coordinated attacks at 12 locations, with authorities confirming that at least 17 police and security personnel were killed, along with dozens of civilians.Asif said the weekend violence claimed 33 civilian lives and 17 members of the security forces. He ruled out talks with the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), saying no negotiations would be held with “terrorists” responsible for killing civilians, including women and children.Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, has long faced a separatist insurgency driven by ethnic Baloch groups who accuse the central government of discrimination and exploitation. Authorities say groups such as the BLA have targeted security forces, infrastructure and projects linked to the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor.Train services between Balochistan and the rest of Pakistan remained suspended for a third day, while mobile and internet services were cut in several districts during clean-up operations. Provincial officials said services were expected to resume once the security situation stabilised.Asif dismissed claims that Balochistan had been neglected, saying the province had seen development, including multiple airports. He also rejected the “missing persons” narrative, alleging that names of militants killed in operations had appeared on such lists. “This narrative has been concocted. I also used to support this cause and protest over it. But, terrorists and criminal elements have hijacked all these narratives,” he said.","Khawaja Asif says security forces are 'physically handicapped' by sheer size of Balochistan.

In a bizarre case, police in Pakistan’s Rawalpindi district registered a case on Sunday of abduction against a “jinn” (supernatural spirit) following the disappearance of an 11-year-old boy, news agency ANI reported, citing ARY News.The incident occurred in the garrison city when the boy went missing from his home on January 21. After ten days without any sign of the child, his father approached the Taxila Police Station and filed a First Information Report (FIR).In the FIR, the father alleged that supernatural entities, known locally as jinns, had forced his son to run away.The complainant said that this is not the first time such an incident has occurred. He added that the jinns had “abducted” his son several times before.He highlighted that while the boy had returned home after previous incidents, this time ten days had passed without his return, prompting him to formally accuse the supernatural spirits of kidnapping.According to ARY News, similar claims have been reported in Pakistan’s legal system before. In Lahore, a mother had lodged a case against jinns over the disappearance of her married daughter, a matter that eventually reached the courts.A report by Dawn in September stated that a special investigation team of Lahore police was formed under the directions of the city's high court Chief Justice Aalia Neelam to probe the six-year-old case of the missing woman, believed to have been abducted by a jinn.The team, headed by Lahore Investigation DIG Zeeshan Raza, was tasked with locating and recovering the woman.","11-year-old boy went missing from his home in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, on January 21.

(With PTI inputs)





Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January, data released on Monday by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) showed.The fatalities included 242 militants, 73 civilians, and 46 security personnel, according to the Islamabad-based think tank.At least 135 people were injured, among them 71 were civilians, 52 security personnel, and 12 militants.PICSS reported 87 militant attacks across Pakistan in January, a 28% rise from the 68 incidents recorded in December 2025. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bore the brunt, with 58 incidents—38 in the mainland districts and 20 in the tribal areas. The restive Balochistan followed with 27 attacks, while Punjab reported two targeted incidents.Balochistan emerged as the main theatre of militant violence and security operations, recording its highest monthly militant death toll since the current insurgency began in 2001. While the province remained relatively calm for most of January, violence surged dramatically in the final two days. Coordinated attacks by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) across at least 12 locations, followed by intensified security operations, placed the province at the centre of the conflict.At least 172 militants were killed, the majority in the final two days of last month.Security forces arrested at least 60 suspected militants during the previous month, while militant groups kidnapped eight individuals. In Punjab, 53 militants were arrested, 48 of them from Lahore, the state capital and Pakistan's second-largest city.Meanwhile, no militant attacks were reported in January from Sindh, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), Islamabad, or the Gilgit-Baltistan region, according to the data.","Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January.

Driving the news

Balochistan Crisis: Pakistan-Origin Commentator Takes Apart Islamabad, Exposes Lies On India

What is clear: the scale, coordination and symbolism of the violence mark a sharp escalation in a conflict long treated by Islamabad as containable.

Why it matters

The big picture

What's different now is the interplay of three key factors:

Zoom in: What is ""Herof""?

Herof Phase 2.0 expands on that template:

Geographic spread: Violence has been reported in Quetta, Noshki, Mastung, Kalat, Kharan, Panjgur, Gwadar, Pasni, Turbat, Kech and Awaran.

Operational depth: Suicide bombings, vehicle-borne explosives and armed assaults occurred almost simultaneously.

Human footprint: For the first time, women are reported to be participating in direct combat roles alongside men.

What they are saying

Between the lines

Zoom in: Bashir Zaib's message

The regional angle

What’s next

The bottom line





Pakistan's latest surge of violence in Balochistan reflects a deepening, not isolated, security crisis as the Baloch Liberation Army escalates its campaign through ""Operation Herof.""Over several days, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) unleashed what it calls ""Operation Herof, Phase 2.0,"" a wave of coordinated attacks across Balochistan that included suicide bombings, gun assaults and arson in major towns and remote districts alike.Pakistani authorities say dozens of civilians and security personnel were killed, followed by one of the largest counterterrorism strikes in decades. Officials claim more than 130 militants were killed in 48 hours alone. However, the BLA has refuted these official claims and reiterate that it inflicted severe casualties on Pakistan forces.Balochistan sits at the intersection of Pakistan’s security, economy and foreign policy- and all three are now under strain. The province anchors China’s Belt and Road ambitions through the port of Gwadar, hosts globally significant mineral deposits at Reko Diq, and borders both Iran and Afghanistan at a time of regional instability.As analyst Michael Kugelman put it after the attacks, ""Today’s attacks in Balochistan should serve as a wake up call to those… keen to invest in Pakistan’s critical mineral reserves."" He warned that many of those reserves lie in areas now directly hit by violence- and that resentment over ""external exploitation of local resources"" is central to the insurgency.For Islamabad, the stakes go beyond security. Investor confidence, relations with Beijing, and Pakistan’s credibility as a destination for critical minerals are all on the line.Balochistan's troubles are hardly new, but they're shiftingSince Pakistan's birth, Baloch ethnic factions have, time and again, risen up against the central government. They've sought more autonomy, a larger share of the country's wealth, or even complete independence. Each insurrection has been met with military force, temporary quiet, and, ultimately, unaddressed issues.First, economic importance. Balochistan is now crucial to Pakistan's economic story. Think of the Chinese-funded projects and the West's interest in copper, gold, and rare minerals.Second, political disillusionment. Elections since 2018 have been widely criticized, and the space for peaceful opposition has shrunk. This has intensified the feeling that political solutions are impossible.Third, the evolution of militant groups. Organizations like the BLA have become more dangerous, adept at using the media, and ideologically focused. They've adopted tactics from global insurgencies while staying rooted in local grievances.As per a report in the Native Voices: ""Herof is a Balochi literary term meaning ""black storm"", commonly used in Baloch poetry, including by the veteran poet Karim Dashti.""The BLA first used the term in August 2024, launching Herof 1.0 with attacks across 12 districts. That campaign shocked authorities by striking areas previously considered relatively stable, including Lasbela and Musakhel, and by introducing a female suicide bomber into the group’s operations.An intelligence officer cited by Native Voices estimated 800 to 1,000 fighters may be involved- a number that suggests months of recruitment, training and coordination.Pakistani officials describe the violence as foreign-orchestrated terrorism.Balochistan chief minister Sarfraz Bugti said security forces killed 145 members of what he termed ""Fitna al-Hindustan,"" the state’s label for the BLA. He claimed militants aimed to seize hostages and storm government installations, and alleged backing from India and Afghanistan- accusations both countries deny.Residents recount chaos and fear. ""(It) was a very scary day in the history of Quetta,"" said Khan Muhammad, a local resident, describing armed men openly patrolling streets before security forces moved in.India’s foreign ministry rejected Pakistan’s claims, calling them ""baseless,"" and urged Islamabad to address ""long-standing demands of its people in the region"" instead of deflecting blame outward.As per the Native Voices, the Baloch resentment has roots in a series of flashpoints.Several incidents hardened public anger: the killing of university student Hayat Baloch by paramilitary forces in 2020; the death of Malik Naz inside her home the same year; the crackdown on the Haq Do Tehreek protests in Gwadar; and the custodial killing of Baalach Mula Baksh in 2023. Each episode sparked protests. Each was followed by arrests, internet shutdowns, or worse.The arrest of activist Dr Mahrang Baloch in 2025 marked another turning point. To many young Baloch, her detention signaled that even peaceful dissent had become intolerable. Analysts say that belief has fed recruitment into armed groups, including among women, a shift now visible on the battlefield.Each episode narrowed political space- and widened the insurgency’s recruitment pool.As Kugelman noted, framing the crisis solely around body counts ""telegraphs your policy failures- because the question is why are there so many fighters to start with."" Analysts argue the BLA has successfully tapped into accumulated resentment, especially among young Baloch who see peaceful activism punished and armed resistance rewarded with attention.One of the most striking elements of Herof II has been its media choreography.As per the Native Voices, the BLA released new footage of its leader Bashir Zaib, seated on the back of a motorcycle, moving through rugged terrain believed to lie between Kharan and Chagai- a region synonymous with mineral wealth.Observers see layered symbolism: mobility, control and defiance. A senior Baloch journalist described the location choice as deliberate- close to Reko Diq and other high-profile mining sites that have drawn interest from companies like Barrick Gold and financiers such as the Asian Development Bank.The subtext to Islamabad and investors alike: the insurgency can operate where Pakistan’s economic future is being planned.Timing matters.Analysts believe the BLA launched Herof II amid unrest in neighboring Iran’s Baloch-populated regions and persistent instability in Afghanistan to amplify its message beyond Pakistan’s borders.Balochistan’s long frontier with Iran- and proximity to Gulf shipping lanes- means sustained violence here resonates in Middle Eastern, US and European policy circles, particularly as Western governments search for alternatives to Chinese-dominated mineral supply chains.The message appears aimed as much at foreign capitals as at Islamabad.In the short term, security operations will intensify. Expect heavier troop deployments, stricter controls around mining projects, transport corridors and Chinese-linked infrastructure, and continued information blackouts during operations. Islamabad will likely double down on its claims of foreign sponsorship, even as evidence remains contested.The longer-term trajectory is murkier.The paradox facing Pakistan is stark: Balochistan is now too economically important to ignore- but remains too politically neglected to stabilize.Unless that gap is addressed, the ""black storm"" the BLA invokes may only deepen, reshaping the conflict from a peripheral insurgency into a central challenge to the state.The spy-action film Dhurandhar has inadvertently revived global interest in the region by featuring elements that touch on Pakistan’s underworld and geopolitics set around Baloch communities.Dhurandhar revolves around a simple but unsettling idea: in covert conflict, what matters most is not the spectacle of action but the slow, almost invisible shifts beneath it. That logic offers a useful lens for what’s happening in Balochistan.Today, Balochistan can no longer be treated only as a security issue measured through attacks and casualties. It has become a political problem rooted in governance, representation, and legitimacy, and it cannot be managed through messaging, denial, or communication blackouts.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) unleashed what it calls ""Operation Herof, Phase 2.0,"" a wave of coordinated attacks across Balochistan that included suicide bombings, gun assaults and arson in major towns and remote districts alike.

Ten security personnel were martyred while a few others were injured"", he spoke on the condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. ""At least four policemen were killed in Quetta alone.""According to the reports, the Baloch Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the attacks. The rebel group said that they aimed to target military installations and police and civil administration officials.With this attack, the group has declared the second phase of ""Operation Herof"", news agency ANI reported, citing The Balochistan Post (TBP). BLA had earlier stated about their plans to launch a new phase to ""protect the motherland.""Following the insurgent incident, security in the region has been ramped up. Emergency teams have been deployed in multiple cities.No reports of civilian casuality has been reported by the officials as of now.Confirming the attack, a senior official stated that the attack was ""coordinated but poorly executed."" He also said that the insurgents could not inflict damage due to the swift security response.""The attacks failed due to poor planning and rapid collapse under an effective security response.""The situation is yet to get under control, as per the reports.For decades, Pakistan has faced a separatist insurgency in Balochistan, a mineral-rich southwestern province bordering Afghanistan and Iran, where rebels have repeatedly targeted security forces, foreign nationals, and people from outside the region.","At least 15 civilians, 18 security personnel and 92 rebels were killed after Baloch separatist fighters carried out a “coordinated” wave of attacks across 12 locations in Pakistan’s Balochistan province.

Bangladesh elections 2026





Zaima Rahman, daughter of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chief Tarique Rahman, took to the streets of the capital on a rickshaw to campaign for her father in the high-profile Dhaka-17 constituency ahead of the February 12 general elections.Videos circulating online show the London-trained barrister riding through busy neighbourhoods with Fatema Khatun, caregiver to former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, as she handed out pamphlets and appealed directly to voters.Beginning her outreach at Gulshan Police Plaza, Zaima moved through streets, shops, cafes and office buildings, distributing leaflets bearing the BNP’s election symbol, the “Sheaf of Paddy.” She was seen speaking with pedestrians, rickshaw pullers, vendors and office staff.“My father, Tarique Rahman, is the ‘Sheaf of Paddy’ candidate in Dhaka-17. I am asking for your votes in his favour,” she told residents during the campaign trail.Rahman, 60, is considered a front-runner in what will be Bangladesh’s first general election since the ouster of long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2024. He faces a key challenge in Dhaka-17 from Jamaat-e-Islami candidate Dr SM Khalekuzzaman.The BNP supremo recently rejected a proposal from Jamaat-e-Islami for a unity government, asserting confidence in his party’s prospects. “How can I form a government with my political opponents, and then who would be in the opposition?” he said in an interview, expressing hope that rivals would play the role of a “good opposition” if elected.Rahman returned to Bangladesh in December after nearly two decades in exile, following the deteriorating health of his mother, Khaleda Zia, who passed away on December 30, 2025. Zia was the country’s first woman prime minister.General elections will be held on February 12, 2026, to elect 300 members to the Jatiya Sangsad (National Parliament). The vote will also be accompanied by a constitutional referendum on the July Charter.More than 127 million voters are eligible to cast their ballots, making it one of the largest democratic exercises of the year. As many as 1,981 candidates are contesting the polls.The election is being conducted under an interim government led by Muhammad Yunus, which has been in place since Sheikh Hasina’s removal following a student-led uprising in 2024.Hasina, now in exile in India, was later convicted by a Bangladesh tribunal for allowing the use of lethal force against protesters during the unrest, which left around 1,400 people — many of them students and teenagers — dead. She has been sentenced to death in absentia.The Awami League, which won the previous four elections under Hasina, has been suspended and is not participating in the upcoming vote. This has turned the contest largely into a bipolar fight between the BNP and the 11-Party Alliance led by Jamaat-e-Islami and the National Citizen Party (NCP).The BNP has nominated 288 candidates and is seeking additional seats through allies and independents. The 11-Party Alliance is contesting 298 seats, while Islami Andolan Bangladesh has fielded candidates in 253 constituencies. The National Democratic Front (NDF), led by the Jatiya Party (Ershad), is contesting 206 seats. Leftist parties under the Democratic United Front are in 149 seats, and the Greater Sunni Alliance is contesting 64 constituencies.Key campaign issues include unemployment, corruption, extortion, proportional representation and outreach to youth and minority voters. Postal voting will be used for the first time, and the “No Vote” option has also been reintroduced.With opinion polls indicating an edge for the BNP but a strong showing expected from Jamaat-e-Islami, the February 12 election is set to reshape Bangladesh’s political landscape.","Zaima Rahman, daughter of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chief Tarique Rahman, took to the streets of the capital on a rickshaw to campaign for her father in the high-profile Dhaka-17 constituency.

Yunus Sparks Fresh Alarm As Greater Bangladesh Map Gifted To US Envoy Includes India’s Northeast

UN human rights office formally approached

Dispute over investigation and wider fallout





Bangladesh’s interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus , has approached the United Nations human rights office seeking assistance for a fair and transparent investigation into the killing of student leader Sharif Osman Hadi Hadi, 32, a prominent figure during the July–August 2024 mass protests that led to the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League government, was shot in the head during an election campaign event in Dhaka on December 12.He later died on December 18 after being flown to Singapore for treatment.According to Bangladesh’s state-run BSS, the country’s Permanent Mission in Geneva sent a formal Note Verbale on Friday to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), requesting cooperation in the investigation.The interim government’s Chief Adviser’s press wing confirmed the development on Saturday.“The government of Bangladesh has reiterated that it is firmly committed to identifying those responsible for the killing of Shaheed Sharif Osman Hadi and bringing them to justice,” the press wing said, as cited by news agency PTI.The request seeks technical and institutional assistance to ensure that the probe meets international standards.Hadi was the spokesperson of Inqilab Moncho and had emerged as a national figure during last year’s youth-led uprising. He was also contesting as a parliamentary candidate in the February 12 elections.In January, Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s Detective Branch filed charges against 17 people, including alleged shooter Faisal Karim Masud. Police said the killing was driven by “political vengeance” and carried out at the behest of the Awami League.Detective branch additional commissioner Md Shafiqul Islam had claimed that Masud was linked to the Awami League’s student wing, Chhatra League, and that the murder was ordered by Awami League-nominated ward councillor Taizul Islam Chowdhury Bappi.Hadi’s party has rejected the police chargesheet, alleging involvement of state agencies in the killing. The interim government had last year banned both the Awami League and Chhatra League.The killing sparked violent protests across the country and further unsettled Bangladesh’s already volatile political situation.The interim administration has pledged to ensure “the highest standards of transparency and accountability” in the case.Hadi’s death also strained relations with India after some groups alleged an Indian connection to the crime. New Delhi has firmly denied the claims, dismissing them as a “false narrative”.Supporters of Hadi have described him as a martyr and a symbol of Bangladesh’s youth-driven anti-establishment movement.","Student leader Sharif Osman Hadi Hadi, 32, was shot in the head during an election campaign event in Dhaka on December 12.

As Bangladesh Elections Near, Hindu Minority Faces Rising Attacks, Islamist Return And State Silence





A veteran Bangladesh politician, Bangladesh Awami League senior leader Ramesh Chandra Sen died on Saturday while in custody at Dinajpur District Jail.Sen, 83, reportedly became unwell inside the jail early Saturday morning and was taken to Dinajpur Medical College Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at around 9:29 am local time, according to prison officials. Jail Superintendent Farhad Sarkar said the body would be handed over to his family once all legal procedures have been completed, as reported by ANI.His death, only days before the country’s general election scheduled for February 12, has heightened concerns over the treatment of incarcerated political leaders and renewed allegations of custodial negligence. Organising Secretary of Bangladesh Awami League Central Committee Shafiul Alam Chowdhury Nadel, alleging negligence and calling out Yunus said on X, ""Ramesh Chandra Sen from a teacher to a politician and a public representative. A five-time MP and former minister—this elderly, ill man was arrested and led away with his hands tied. He has now passed away in Dinajpur jail due to a lack of medical treatment. Yunus, you must answer for this.""President of Bangladesh Students' League Saddam Hussein also claimed medical neglect saying, ""Eighteen months ago, this widely respected, elderly leader was attacked, humiliated by BNP-Jamaat mob and taken into police custody, without any specific charges.One false and fabricated case after another was imposed on him to justify his continued detention. Despite his deteriorating health, he was deliberately denied bail, denied minimum medical treatment, and denied basic human rights. "" ""At 86 years of age, Sri Ramesh Chandra Sen was kept behind bars for one and a half years without trial and without proper medical care. This happened under the illegal, murderous-fascist Yunus regime, which chose cruelty over humanity and repression over the rule of law,"" he added.Further mentioning other Awami League politicians in custody he added, ""According to Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK), at least 107 prisoners died in custody in 2025 alone—the majority of them leaders and activists of the Awami League. In almost every case, the authorities casually cited causes such as “heart attack” or “sudden illness.” Despite clear legal provisions, not a single custodial death has been properly investigated by this illegal government. ""The veteran Hindu leader had been in custody since August 16, 2024, after being arrested by police in Thakurgaon. ""Bangladesh Police have arrested a Hindu leader of Awami League and put him on a farcical trial. Ramesh Chandra Sen, an octogenarian, was arrested from his house in Thakurgaon who was having his dinner. Surprisingly, he hails from Mirza Fakhrul's constituency,"" the Bangladesh Awami League had said, just days after his arrest nearly two years ago.A court subsequently ordered his transfer to Thakurgaon District Jail and later to Dinajpur. There, he was facing three cases, including a murder charge linked to the political turmoil that followed a mass uprising against the government of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Born on April 30, 1940, in Ruhia Union under Thakurgaon Sadar Upazila, Sen was elected multiple times from the Thakurgaon-1 constituency to the Jatiya Sangsad. A presidium member of the Awami League, he secured his most recent parliamentary victory in the 2024 general election, before the party was later barred from political activity by the current interim administration.Meanwhile, the interim government, headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and tasked with overseeing the electoral process for February 12 elections, has faced criticism at home and abroad over its human rights record. Opposition figures contend that deaths of prominent detainees, particularly former Awami League leaders, point to systemic failings and raise concerns about the adequacy of medical care in custody.His death comes at a politically sensitive moment in Bangladesh, with the Awami League excluded from the forthcoming polls and rival parties competing for advantage.","Bangladesh Awami League senior leader Ramesh Chandra Sen died on Saturday while in custody at Dinajpur District Jail.

Authorities said the bus collided with a motorcycle and a truck, making it one of the deadliest accidents in recent years.Earlier that same month, another 25 people died when a bus overturned on a highway near the capital, Kabul, ""due to the driver's negligence,"" officials reported.","At least 15 people were killed in northeastern Afghanistan after a minibus overturned and fell into a valley.

Bangladesh elections: What is BNP’s ‘strict position’ pitch for relations with neighbors?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-elections-what-is-bnps-strict-position-pitch-for-relations-with-neighbors/articleshow/128020691.cms,"As Bangladesh Elections Near, Hindu Minority Faces Rising Attacks, Islamist Return And State Silence





Bangladesh’s main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on Friday unveiled its election manifesto, promising electoral reforms and accountable governance, while outlining a tougher foreign policy stance, centred on border security and river-water sharing.The manifesto was launched by BNP chairman Tarique Rahman in Dhaka. The party pledged to uphold the “dignity of the vote” and ensure that no one is above the law, committing to a government that is accountable and directly answerable to citizens.A key feature of the manifesto is its emphasis on long-standing flashpoints in Bangladesh’s relationship with India, although New Delhi hasn’t been mentioned in as many words in the bullet points, including cross-border shootings, alleged “push-ins” and unresolved sharing of common rivers. The BNP said it would adopt a more assertive approach to frontier management and river diplomacy if voted to power.Under what it calls a “Bangladesh Before All” doctrine, the party framed its foreign policy around “equality and self-dignity” and the slogan “Friend Yes, Master No”. It said Dhaka would not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and would not allow interference in its own.The strongest language came for border-related concerns.The manifesto vows to take “a strict position” to stop “border killing, push-in, and smuggling”, reflecting persistent Bangladeshi complaints over deaths along the India-Bangladesh border and allegations of people being pushed across without due process.On river-water sharing, the BNP promised “effective measures” to secure Bangladesh’s “fair share” from common rivers “like Teesta and Padma”. It proposed implementing a “Teesta Master Plan”, pursuing a Padma barrage project and strengthening the Joint River Commission (JRC), the bilateral body responsible for managing shared rivers.Although India is not explicitly named in the manifesto’s bullet points, the border and river issues highlighted are central to Dhaka-New Delhi ties.The manifesto also signals interest in reviving regional platforms, promising to make SAARC “effective” and to pursue ASEAN membership, potentially broadening Bangladesh’s diplomatic options beyond its immediate neighbourhood.The manifesto was unveiled just six days ahead of Bangladesh’s national elections scheduled for February 12, the first since the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in 2024. With the Awami League barred from contesting, BNP is widely seen as the front runner in the upcoming elections. The political landscape remains polarised, and international observers, including the International Crisis Group, have raised concerns over electoral credibility and the risk of unrest.",Bangladesh’s main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) unveiled its election manifesto on Friday.

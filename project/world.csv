President Trump Participates in the Make America Wealthy Again Event

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a sweeping set of tariffs in what he called a declaration of ""economic independence,"" igniting fears of a global trade war. Speaking from the White House Rose Garden, Trump declared that April 2, 2025, would ""forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn.""In his address, the president insisted that domestic manufacturing would surge as companies moved production back to the United States. While the economic impact remains uncertain, Trump was resolute in his stance against imports without appropriate tariffs, asserting that nations needed to accept ""a little tough love.""Trump delivered a scathing rebuke of international trade practices, blaming foreign nations for undermining the American economy.""Foreign leaders have stolen our jobs, foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn aport our once-beautiful American Dream,"" Trump declared. ""But it is not going to happen anymore.""""For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,"" Trump said, arguing that trade abuse by allies was often more damaging than that committed by rivals.""This is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in American history. It's our declaration of economic independence.""The president pledged that the tariffs would bring back jobs and boost domestic industry. ""Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country, and you see it happening already. We will supercharge our domestic industrial base. We will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers, and ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers.""""India, very, very tough. Very, very tough. The Prime Minister just left. He's a great friend of mine, but I said, 'You're a friend of mine, but you're not treating us right. They charge us 52%. You have to understand, we charge them almost nothing for years and years and decades, and it was only seven years ago, when I came in, that we started with China',"" he said while announcing 26 per cent 'discounted' tariff on India.Despite imposing a ""minimum baseline"" 10 percent tariff on trading partners, Trump portrayed his policy as a fair and moderate solution.""We are being very kind,"" the president claimed. ""We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us.""He had a message for nations unhappy with the new tariffs, ""If they complain, if you want your tariff rate to be zero, then you build your product right here in America.""China topped the list of tariff targets Trump held up during his speech, with the president claiming that Beijing imposed a total tariff equivalent of 67 percent on US goods, including currency manipulation.""So we're going to be charging a discounted reciprocal tariff of 34 percent"" Trump said. ""They charge us, we charge them, we charge them less. So how can anybody be upset? They will be, because we never charged anybody anything. But now we're going to charge.""He said Chinese President Xi Jinping, along with other world leaders, understood the necessity of the tariffs, referencing those he imposed on Chinese steel and other products during his first term.""They all understand we're going to have to go through a little tough love, maybe. But they all understand. They're ripping us off and they understood it.""Trump invoked history to support his policy, pointing to an era when tariffs played a central role in US revenue.""From 1789 to 1913 we were a tariff-backed nation, and the United States was proportionately the wealthiest it has ever been,"" Trump said, citing protectionist President William McKinley as a historical hero.He criticised the introduction of the income tax in 1913, claiming it shifted financial burdens onto American citizens instead of foreign nations.""In 1913 for reasons unknown to mankind, they established the income tax so that citizens, rather than foreign countries, would start paying the money necessary to run our government,"" Trump said. ""Then in 1929 it all came to a very abrupt end with the Great Depression. And it would have never happened if they had stayed with the tariff policy.""His interpretation of history, however, overlooked broader economic factors such as global financial instability, banking crises, and the 1929 stock market crash.Trump's tariffs extended beyond China to include other Asian economies and the European Union, but he also took aim at North American trading partners.""The United States can no longer continue with the policy of unilateral economic surrender,"" he said. ""We cannot pay the deficits of Canada, Mexico and so many other countries. We used to do it. We can't do it anymore.""","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a sweeping set of tariffs in what he called a declaration of ""economic independence"" Speaking from the White House Rose Garden, Trump declared that April 2, 2025, would ""forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn"" Trump delivered a scathing rebuke of international trade practices, blaming foreign nations for undermining the American economy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119925168,imgsize-873641,width-400,resizemode-4/119925168.jpg"

Economists predict inflationary pressures, with some forecasting a 1% contraction in the US economy in the second quarter due to rising prices and disrupted supply chains.In response, countries like Israel and Vietnam have lowered their own tariffs on US imports, possibly to avoid further punitive measures.

Wall Street

Asian markets and US stock futures tumbled on Thursday after Donald Trump unveiled a sweeping increase in tariffs on imports from across the globe, escalating trade tensions and sending investors into a frenzy.Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index dropped more than 3.4 per cent before a slight recovery, closing 2.9 per cent lower at 34,699.52. South Korea’s Kospi also slumped, losing 1.9 per cent to 2,459.30 after the US imposed a 25 per cent tariff on South Korean imports.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slid 1.8 per cent to 7,793.10, while US futures hinted at steep losses ahead. The S&P 500 futures contract fell 3 per cent, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped 2 per cent, setting the stage for a volatile session when Wall Street reopens.US President Trump’s tariff announcement, which he called “liberation day” measures, included a 24 per cent “reciprocal tariff” on Japan, one of America’s closest allies, along with new levies on China, the European Union, Canada, and Mexico. Speaking at the White House, Trump showed off a chart outlining new import taxes, including a 34 tariff on Chinese goods, 20 per cent on the EU, and 32 per cent on Taiwan.He justified the move as an effort to “bring fairness” to global trade and revive US manufacturing jobs. However, analysts warn the tariffs could stifle economic growth and push inflation higher at a time when the Federal Reserve is struggling to keep it under control.Before the tariff announcement, US markets saw another turbulent session with the S&P 500 climbing 0.7 per cent to 5,670.97 after oscillating between a 1.1 per cent loss and a 1.1 per cent gain.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 42,225.32, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced 0.9 per cent to 17,601.05.Tesla dropped over 6 per cent on weak first-quarter deliveries but later recovered.

The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note swung between 4.11 per cent and 4.18 per cent, reflecting uncertainty over economic growth and inflation.Oil prices tumbled in early trading on Thursday.

A message to levied countries

Reversing decades of financial stress

Impact on market

US President Donald Trump declared a national emergency to enforce his extensive new tariff policy, called ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, imposing a 10 per cent baseline duty on nearly all imports. The measures, which included steeper ""reciprocal"" levies on key allies such as the European Union, Japan, and Israel, were unveiled after the close of stock trading on Wednesday.Trump, speaking from the Rose Garden, described the move as a ""declaration of economic independence,"" emphasising its importance for the American economy. ""This is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in American history. It’s our Declaration of Economic Independence,"" he said.“Factories will come roaring back into our country — and you see it happening already. We will supercharge our domestic industrial base. We will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers.”Trump, who has long advocated for these tariffs said, “If you look at my old speeches, where I was young and very handsome … I’d be on a television show, I’d be talking about how we were being ripped off by these countries. I mean, nothing changes very much,” he said.“It’s such an honor to be finally able to do this.”The new tariffs, which will take effect from 12.01 am on Saturday, significantly increase the average US tariff rate, nearly tripling the pre-January baseline. The reciprocal duties, which are tailored based on trade deficits with individual countries, will be implemented from April 9. These include a 20 per cent tariff on EU imports, 24 per cent on Japanese goods, and 17 per cent on Israeli products.""We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us,"" Trump explained.""Ultimately more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers. This will indeed be the golden age of America.""Trump also pointed to the pre-1913 era when the US relied on tariffs rather than income tax. ""From 1789 to 1913, we were a tariff-backed nation and the United States was proportionately the wealthiest it has ever been,"" he said. He blamed the shift to income tax for economic downturns, including the Great Depression. ""It would have never happened if they had stayed with the tariff policy.""The president declared that April 2, 2025, ""will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America’s destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again.""A White House aide described the tariff rates as fair and calculated based on trade deficits. ""The numbers have been calculated by the council of economic advisers … based on the concept that the trade deficit that we have with any given country is the sum of all trade practices, the sum of all cheating,"" the official stated. ""It’s the most fair thing in the world.""Trump criticised foreign tariffs and regulations, referring to Australian restrictions on US beef, EU bans on American poultry, and Japanese taxes on US rice. Australia will see a lower 10 per cent tariff due to its trade surplus with the US, however, other countries face steeper rates: Cambodia 49 per cent, India 26 per cent, Iraq 39 per cent, South Africa 30 per cent, South Korea 25 per cent, Sri Lanka 44 per cent, Switzerland 31 per cent, Taiwan 32 per cent, Thailand 36 per cent, and Vietnam 46 per cent.Israel, despite receiving significant US military aid, faces a 17 per cent tariff due to its $7.4 billion trade deficit with the US. ""Israel steals a lot of intellectual property from, for example, the pharmaceutical manufacturers in this country,"" a senior administration official said ahead of the announcement.White House officials confirmed the 10 per cent baseline tariff was designed to prevent evasion of the stricter country-specific levies, citing China’s alleged use of Cambodia and Vietnam for re-exporting goods.The 78-year-old leader argued that if tariffs and trade barriers caused poverty, every country would be rushing to remove them.He further added, ""To all of the foreign presidents, prime ministers, kings, queens, ambassadors and everyone else who will soon be calling to ask for exemptions from these tariffs, I say, ‘Terminate your own tariffs, drop your barriers.’""Trump justified the decision as necessary to reverse decades of economic harm. ""For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,"" he said, addressing auto workers, steelworkers, and farmers.""American steel workers, auto workers, farmers and skilled craftsmen — we have a lot of them here with us today — they really suffered gravely,"" the New York Post quoted Trump.A tax foundation analysis estimated that a blanket 10 per cent tariff could raise $200 billion annually over the next decade, covering about one-tenth of the federal deficit. However, the analysis cautioned that retaliation from other nations could shrink revenue as economic activity slows.The president also emphasised his push for congressional Republicans to approve tax reforms, including eliminating federal taxes on tips, overtime, and social security benefits, as well as allowing tax deductions for domestic car loan interest.Additionally, the White House confirmed new 25 per cent tariffs on non-USMCA-compliant imports from Canada and Mexico, targeting illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling. A 25 per cent tariff on all foreign-made cars and auto parts is set to take effect at 12.01 am Thursday, affecting 75 per cent of vehicles sold in the US.This followed Trump’s recent tariff hikes on China for fentanyl smuggling, as well as February’s steel and aluminium duties, which ended previous exemptions for major exporters like Brazil and South Korea.With Canada, China, and Mexico together accounting for 43 per cent of US imports, analysts are closely watching how the new tariffs will impact trade flows. While China’s ""reciprocal"" tariff was set at 34 per cent, its interaction with existing, even higher tariffs remains uncertain.The announcement sent after-hours stock markets tumbling, with S&P 500 futures dropping 1.7 per cent, Nasdaq 100 futures falling 2.5 per cent, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slipping 0.7 per cent.Critics warned that the tariffs could fuel inflation, worsening the 22 per cent price surge seen during Joe Biden's presidency. Though Trump countered that inflation remained low during his first term, despite earlier tariffs, suggesting prices would not necessarily rise under the new policies.Trump has also hinted at additional tariffs on computer chips, copper, lumber, and pharmaceuticals, sectors notably excluded from the latest round of measures.","US President Donald Trump declares a national emergency to enforce his extensive new tariff policy.

He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

No Yes

Defence experts criticise Yunus over ‘landlocked’ remark

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh 's interim government chief adviser, Muhammad Yunus , who was on a four-day visit to China, invited Beijing to make an ""extension"" in the region while mentioning that the seven northeastern states of India remain landlocked.In a widely circulated video on social media, Yunus encouraged the Chinese government to establish an economic base in Bangladesh, emphasising that Dhaka is the ""sole guardian of the ocean"" in the region.""Seven states of India, eastern part of India, called seven sisters ... they are landlocked country, landlocked region of India. They have no way to reach out to the ocean,"" Yunus said in the video.""We are the only guardian of the ocean for all this region. So this opens up a huge possibility. So this could be an extension of the Chinese economy. Build things, produce things, market things, bring things to China, bring it out to the whole rest of the world,"" Yunus said.Sanjeev Sanyal, currently a member of PM Narendra Modi’s economic advisory council, shared the video on X and wrote: ""Interesting that Yunus is making a public appeal to the Chinese on the basis that 7 states in India are land-locked. China is welcome to invest in Bangladesh, but what exactly is the significance of 7Indian states being landlocked?""Yunus, who met Xi Jinping during his four-day visit, also sought a 50-year master plan from Beijing for its river water management , including that of the Teesta river, co-shared by the Indian upstream region, calling China the “master of water management”.“We have come here to learn from you; how we can make water resources useful to people,” state-run news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) quoted him as saying.He particularly pointed out the issues related to the 'Teesta River System' but added, however, that “Bangladesh's problem lies not just with one river, but with the (entire) system”.The ousted Hasina government had sought India's involvement in the Teesta River basin project.Meanwhile, Bangladesh and China held positive discussions on signing the Implementation Plan of the MoU on the Exchange of Hydrological Information for the Yarlung Zangbo-Jamuna River, which originates in China and flows into Bangladesh after passing through a significant stretch of Indian territory.The two nations also agreed to enhance maritime cooperation and plan to hold a new round of Dialogue on Maritime Cooperation at a suitable time.""Bangladesh welcomes Chinese companies to participate in the Mongla Port Facilities Modernisation and Expansion Project and is ready to collaborate with China to further develop the Chinese Economic and Industrial Zone (CEIZ) in Chattogram,"" the statement said.According to BSS, China has planned to provide approximately $400 million for the modernization of Bangladesh’s southwestern Mongla seaport, $350 million for the development of the China Industrial Economic Zone, and another $150 million as technical assistance.""The remaining funds will be provided as grants and other forms of financial support,"" the BSS report added.Yunus' remarks drew strong reactions from Indian defence experts on Monday.Responding to Yunus' statement, defence expert Dhruv Katoch criticised the mention of India in the discussion. ""He had no business bringing up India,"" Katoch said. ""If we have connectivity issues and how we connect to the oceans, that is a matter for our government, and we are handling it. The Kaladan River project will be completed soon. As far as access to the sea is concerned, we don’t need Bangladesh,"" he said.Katoch also speculated on the motive behind Yunus' remarks, suggesting he was attempting to send a message to both India and China. ""He is trying to tell China that Bangladesh’s unique location could provide China with access through India’s northeastern states to Nepal and Bhutan. But inserting India into the conversation in this way is threatening. Is he indirectly trying to say that Bangladesh could cut off India’s Northeast?""He further noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to meet Muhammad Yunus on the sidelines of BIMSTEC. ""Mr. Yunus has sought a meeting with PM Modi. But India is too big a country to be threatened by any country—Bangladesh is totally irrelevant in that regard,"" Katoch asserted.Meanwhile, in Jammu, retired defence expert Captain Anil Gaur linked Yunus' remarks to Bangladesh’s economic struggles. ""Muhammad Yunus has gone to China to secure funding because Bangladesh's economy has collapsed,"" Gaur claimed. He pointed out that USAID, which previously funded Bangladesh, had ceased support under orders from US President Donald Trump.""Today, Bangladesh is in a situation similar to what it was before its liberation in 1971. Yunus has no choice but to seek help from China, praise them, and try to sell his country and economy,"" Gaur said. However, he reassured that India has no reason to worry. ""India is in a strong position and is already taking measures to curb infiltration attempts from Bangladesh.""","Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh's interim government chief adviser, invited Beijing to make an ""extension"" in the region. In a widely circulated video on social media, Yunus encouraged the Chinese government to establish an economic base in Bangladesh. He also sought a 50-year master plan from Beijing for its river water management, including that of the Teesta river.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119801906,imgsize-949595,width-400,resizemode-4/119801906.jpg"

Bykovskaya, who remains at large, was convicted in absentia and placed on an international wanted list .In April 2022, Ukraine’s Security Service (SSU) released an audio recording of a chilling conversation between Bykovskaya and her husband, Russian paratrooper Roman Bykovsky , who was actively involved in Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The woman was heard granting her husband permission to commit sexual violence against Ukrainian women—provided he “uses protection.”Investigators from Radio Liberty identified the couple, tracing them to Feodosia, occupied Crimea. Ukrainian authorities charged Bykovskaya in December 2022, leading to her eventual conviction.Bykovskaya has also been ordered to reimburse the Ukrainian state over UAH 15,000 (about $362) for forensic and legal expenses related to the case. The verdict will take effect if no appeal is filed within the designated period.Despite the evidence, both Bykovskys denied involvement. Olga deleted her social media accounts and cut off communication after being confronted by journalists.

China on Thursday strongly condemned the sweeping new tariffs imposed by United States, declaring that it ""firmly opposes"" the measures and will implement ""countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests"".The sharp response from Beijing comes after US President Donald Trump announced a 10 percent base tariff on global imports, with additional 34 per cent levies specifically targeting China.In a statement on Thursday, China's commerce ministry criticised the tariffs as a violation of international trade norms, arguing that they significantly undermine the legitimate rights of affected nations.""US tariffs do not comply with international trade rules and seriously harm the legitimate rights and interests of the relevant parties,"" the ministry said, urging Washington to ""immediately cancel"" the new levies.Beijing warned that the tariffs could have widespread consequences, affecting not only China but also the global economy, international supply chains, and even US businesses.""These measures endanger global economic development and the stability of production and supply chains,"" the ministry said, emphasising that trade conflicts are ultimately detrimental to all parties involved.Trump has defended the tariffs as ""reciprocal,"" claiming they address long-standing trade imbalances.Following Trump's tariff announcement, China called for ""dialogue"" to resolve the dispute.""There is no winner in a trade war, and there is no way out for protectionism,"" Beijing's commerce ministry said. ""History has proven that raising tariffs does not solve the US's own problems,"" it added.""It harms America's own interests and endangers global economic development and the stability of production and supply chains.""","China strongly condemns sweeping new tariffs imposed by United States.

LIVE: Trump FIRES At Europe, India, China; Announces SHOCK Reciprocal Tariffs On 'Liberation Day'

United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday called Prime Minister Modi his 'great friend' while imposing his ambitious retaliatory tariff on India.Trump said Washington would impose ""discounted reciprocal tariffs "" of 26 per cent on New Delhi.""India, very, very tough. Very, very tough. The Prime Minister just left. He's a great friend of mine, but I said, 'You're a friend of mine, but you're not treating us right.' They charge us 52 per cent. You have to understand, we charge them almost nothing, for years and years and decades, and it was only seven years ago, when I came in, we started with China and we took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China in tariffs,"" Trump said holding the chart that mentioned list of countries and tariff charges.Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Washington, D.C., in February, less than a month after President Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term in the White House.Trump has previously referred to India as the "" tariff king "" and a ""big abuser"" in global trade . During a joint press conference with Modi at the White House on February 13, Trump remarked that India had ""been very strong on tariffs,"" adding, ""I don't blame them, necessarily, but it's a different way of doing business. It's very hard to sell into India because they have trade barriers, very strong tariffs.""Highlighting the US trade deficit with India, which he estimated at nearly $100 billion, Trump stated that he and Modi had agreed to begin negotiations to correct ""long-running disparities that should have been taken care of over the last four years – but they didn't do that."" The goal, he said, was to ""sign an agreement"" that would create ""a level playing field, which we really think we're entitled to, and he does also, in fairness, so we're going to work on that very hard.""While announcing the new tariffs, Trump defended the move by saying the US had been ""very kind"" to trading partners and would now charge them ""approximately half of the levies they impose on US goods.""","US President Donald Trump announced a retaliatory tariff of 26 per cent on India.

The TOI correspondent from Washington:

US President Donald Trump hit India with a 26 per cent tax on its exports to America despite making friendly noises about New Delhi and its efforts to buy time and avert punitive tariffs with broad concessions on US imports to India.At a White House Rose Garden event on Wednesday on what he called ""Liberation Day"" for the US, India became a middling victim in Trump's take-no-prisoner approach that treated friend and foe alike with a two-tier tariff: a baseline tax of 10% on all countries that will go into effect on April 5, and additional tariffs on some countries that he considers to be the ""worst offenders,"" that will be imposed on April 9.India, described by Trump as the ""tariff king,"" makes the US President's ""worst offender"" checklist because, by his calculation, New Delhi taxes US imports to the tune of 52 per cent, a dubious figure arrived at by adding perceived non-monetary, non-tariff barriers, “currency manipulation” etc. China was assessed at 69 per cent, Taiwan at 64 percent, and South Korea at 50 percent.But out of the kindness of his heart he would impose not a ""commonsense reciprocal tariff"" but give a 50 percent ""discount,"" Trump said, thus making it 26 percent tariff on imports from India.Similarly, China was slammed with 34 percent, Indonesia 32 percent, Bangladesh 37 per cent, Pakistan 29 percent, Thailand 36 percent and so on. Even close allies were not spared -- Japan copped 24 percent, EU 20 percent, UK and Australia 10 percent, Israel 17 percent -- ignoring its late call on Tuesday to scrap all import duty. Nor were the poorest nations on the planet spared: 50 per cent on goods from Lesotho, 47 per cent on Madagascar (which exports a ton of vanilla), 18 percent on Zimbabwe, right down to Haiti and Gabon.“For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far – both friend and foe alike. Foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream,” President of the richest country on earth raged in remarks that were borderline offensive and distasteful.More to follow","US President Donald Trump hit India with a 26 per cent tax on its exports to America despite making friendly noises about New Delhi and its efforts to buy time and avert punitive tariffs.

Trump Unveils Tariffs LIVE | Trump Announces 26% Discounted Reciprocal Tariffs On India | N18G

US President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that the United States would impose reciprocal tariffs on a select group of Antarctic islands, despite the fact that they are uninhabited.The Heard and McDonald Islands, known for their remote location and thriving wildlife populations, were among the territories targeted as part of Trump’s broader trade policy push.During a press conference, Trump used a poster to display the countries and territories affected by the new tariffs, while additional details were provided on printed sheets distributed to reporters. One of the sheets suggested that the Heard and McDonald Islands currently impose a “Tariff to the USA.” of 10%, specifying in small print that this includes ""currency manipulation and trade barriers."" In response, the US is implementing ""discounted reciprocal tariffs"" at the same 10% rate.The White House has not yet issued an official statement on the matter. The Australian Antarctic Division , which oversees the islands, referred inquiries to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade , which had not responded as of publication.Australia, which has claimed the islands as a territory since 1953, manages them primarily for conservation and research purposes. The region is designated as a World Heritage Site and is covered in glaciers and rocky landscapes, with Heard Island featuring an active volcano. The islands are home to significant populations of penguins, seabirds, and elephant seals.Beyond the Heard and McDonald Islands, Australia and several of its territories were also affected by the tariff policy. Christmas Island and the Cocos Keeling Islands were hit with a 10% tariff, while Norfolk Island faced a significantly higher 29% tariff.Under the Antarctic Treaty , Antarctica is designated for peaceful purposes and international scientific cooperation, prohibiting any single country from claiming land on the continent. However, Australia has extended its sovereignty over the surrounding waters by establishing a marine reserve in 2002, later expanding its boundaries in 2023.Elizabeth Buchanan, a senior fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and an expert on polar geopolitics , questioned the legality of the decision. ""One could argue this is in breach of the international Antarctic spirit,"" she said.Australia’s Defense Force monitors the waters surrounding the islands as part of Operation Resolute, which covers a vast area, including waters off Christmas, Cocos Keeling, Macquarie, Norfolk, and Lord Howe Islands. The operation is aimed at countering ""security threats"" such as piracy and pollution.Although largely uninhabited, the region occasionally receives visits from ships engaged in scientific research, commercial fishing, and tourism, according to the Australian Antarctic Division.","US President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that the United States would impose reciprocal tariffs on a select group of Antarctic islands.

Ashfaq Syed is first Indian American on Naperville city council; Supna Jain wins school district seat again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ashfaq-syed-is-first-indian-american-on-naperville-city-council-supna-jain-wins-school-district-seat-again/articleshow/119924720.cms,"Voters in Naperville, Illinois, went to the polls on Tuesday for the consolidated local elections of 2025. According to projected results, there are three Indian Americans who have emerged winners.Supna Jain , a non-partisan candidate who was born and raised in Illinois, is one of the projected winners for one of the four open seats in the Indian Prairie School District 204 . She is also an incumbent and has secured 20% of the votes. In explaining her reasons for running for re-election Jain said that for her entire life, she has been in the role of a ‘student’ or an ‘educator’. “If there is anything I understand, it is the power of education. I have experienced and witnessed its ability to teach each child how to learn, understand diverse perspectives, think critically, and become contributing members of our society. Education gives our children options on what they hope to do in life today and in the future. Education has been at the centre of my roles as a parent, educator, and community advocate,” she said on her campaign website. An experienced academician, Jain is a principal lecturer in communication and director of the speaking centre at North Central College in Naperville. She also teaches Indian dance at the Naperville Park district and is the founder and artistic director of a non-profit dance troupe.From her past four years on the school board, she feels that she has understood the vital role that the board plays in children’s development - from addressing remote learning challenges, redrawing boundaries, crafting a five-year strategic plan, and conducting a master facility assessment. The Indian Prairie School District 204 serves over 25,600 students from Will and DuPage counties and covers 33 schools.Ashfaq Syed , a newcomer, has been elected to the Naperville City Council winning one of the four open slots. Syed, who has roots in Hyderabad, becomes the first Indian American to hold this position. He is well-recognised for community service and serves on several boards and co-chaired the 2020 census committee.He has also had a successful career in finance and banking and serves as president of the Naperville Public Library board of trustees and is a board member for Loaves & Fishes Community Services and Naperville Neighbors United. Syed chose to run for city council because he believes in the need for leaders who know how to bring people together to solve the most pressing challenges. His top priorities are fiscal responsibility, excellence in public safety, and responsible development, Syed had stated in his campaign. “My top priorities are all with a focus on sustainability. I will work to ensure that taxpayer dollars are used efficiently to maintain and improve city services while alleviating the financial burden on residents.”Indian American Meghna Bansal , who also ran for a position on the city council, is in sixth place. Council members have four-year terms.Aishwarya Balakrishna, who is a newcomer and was the youngest candidate across all the electoral races in Naperville this year, is among the projected winners for the four open seats on the Naperville Park District Board of Commissioners. All park board commissioners serve four-year terms. She ran because she believes that every resident deserves vibrant public spaces and a say in how they’re run. A daughter of Indian American immigrants and a lifelong Naperville resident, Balakrishna feels she has received a lot from the community and wants to give back. On her campaign website, she has said that she is committed to fostering healthier communities through evidence-based approaches and community-driven initiatives.Naperville’s parks and programmes are vital to the community’s well-being and identity, she said. “Our common spaces are where we connect and form community bonds. As someone who grew up in our parks and continues to use its programmes to this day, I have experienced this first hand and want to make our parks and programmes more accessible, affordable, and inclusive for all of our residents.”","Voters in Naperville, Illinois, went to the polls on Tuesday for the consolidated local elections of 2025.

New book exposes Biden’s exhaustion and confusion before Trump debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-book-exposes-bidens-exhaustion-and-confusion-before-trump-debate/articleshow/119923800.cms,"Joe Biden

A forthcoming book reveals that former White House chief of staff Ron Klain described former President Joe Biden as ""fatigued, befuddled, and disengaged"" ahead of his June debate with President Donald Trump. The book, ""Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History,"" written by Chris Whipple, is set for release this month.According to an excerpt published by The Guardian, Klain was alarmed during an initial meeting with Biden at Aspen Lodge, the presidential retreat. ""He’d never seen him so exhausted and out of it,"" Whipple wrote. ""Biden was unaware of what was happening in his own campaign. Halfway through the session, the president excused himself and went off to sit by the pool.""The book details concerns among Biden’s closest aides, with Whipple arguing that they were in a ""fog of delusion and denial."" In an interview with Politico, Whipple stated, ""I have fresh reporting on an hour-by-hour, day-by-day basis of Biden’s final days, and obviously his decline is a major part of the story. I happen to think that to call it a ‘cover-up’ is simplistic. I think it was stranger and way more troubling than that. Biden’s inner circle, his closest advisers, many of them were in a fog of delusion and denial. They believed what they wanted to believe.""Biden’s preparation for the debate included two mock sessions. However, Whipple’s book claims the first practice debate, intended to last 90 minutes, was cut short after 45 minutes. ""The president’s voice was shot and so was his grasp of the subject. All he really could talk about was his infrastructure plan and how he was rebuilding America and 16 million jobs. He had nothing to say about his agenda for a second term,"" the excerpt states.Klain, a longtime ally of Biden, played a key role in helping him prepare for the debate, but concerns mounted as Biden reportedly struggled during the second mock debate. ""25 minutes into the second mock debate, the president was done for the day. ‘I’m just too tired to continue and I’m afraid of losing my voice here and I feel bad,’"" the book quotes Klain as saying. ""‘I just need some sleep. I’ll be fine tomorrow.’ He went off to bed.""Biden’s team has not yet responded to requests for comment on the claims made in Whipple’s book.The book is one of several set to be published this year chronicling the 2024 campaign, one of the most tumultuous elections in US history. Other books, such as those by The Hill’s Amie Parnes and NBC News’ Jonathan Allen, are expected to provide additional insight into the former president’s departure from the race.Allen’s reporting suggests that former President Barack Obama was not in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris replacing Biden on the ticket, allegedly working behind the scenes to block her efforts. Meanwhile, CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson are preparing to release their own book in May, titled ""Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.""The revelations in Whipple’s book add to ongoing scrutiny over Biden’s fitness for office, with his performance in the 2024 campaign becoming a central point of discussion among political analysts and voters alike.","Former White House chief of staff Ron Klain described former President Joe Biden as ""fatigued, befuddled, and disengaged"" ahead of his June debate with President Donald Trump.

Trump admin slashes Maine’s funds over trans inclusion in sports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-admin-slashes-maines-funds-over-trans-inclusion-in-sports/articleshow/119923645.cms,"File photo

Maine defies Trump order on transgender athletes, risks federal funding

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has halted federal funding to Maine, citing the state’s refusal to comply with a federal directive on gender-based participation in educational programs.The department also launched an extensive review of grants previously awarded to Maine under the Biden administration, suggesting that many were ""wasteful, redundant, or otherwise against the priorities of the Trump Administration,"" reported the Fox News.The move comes after Maine refused to enforce President Donald Trump’s executive order, issued in February, which bars transgender athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports. Secretary of Agriculture Brooks Rollins confirmed the funding freeze, emphasizing that federal dollars will only be restored if Maine aligns with Title IX protections for female athletes.“In order to continue to receive taxpayer dollars from USDA, the state of Maine must demonstrate compliance with Title IX which protects female student athletes from having to compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males,” Rollins stated in a letter to Maine officials.Maine’s policies regarding transgender athlete participation have been the subject of intense national debate. GOP state Rep. Laurel Libby brought renewed attention to the issue after identifying a transgender track and field athlete at Greely High School who had placed first in a girls’ pole vault competition, having previously competed in the boys’ division. Her social media post sparked widespread discussion but also led to her censure by the Democratic-controlled Maine House for allegedly identifying a minor. Libby has since taken legal action to have the censure overturned.“Governor Janet Mills and Maine Democrats have chosen to dig their heels in and embrace radical left-wing ideology over the safety and rights of Maine women and girls. Despite repeated warnings from President Trump, Maine Democrats continued to defy federal law, forcing Maine girls to unfairly compete against biological males,” Libby told Fox News Digital.“As a result, Maine’s Democrat majority has poised Maine students to lose hundreds of millions in federal funding, starting with our USDA funding, instead of championing Maine girls by adhering to federal law. I continue to stand firmly with Maine girls and President Trump in the pursuit of sanity and fairness. I implore Maine Democrats to abandon this incredibly harmful and radical gender ideology for the sake of our students.”The US Department of Education has also intervened, warning the Maine Department of Education that it has until April 11 to address the issue or face further action, including a possible referral to the Department of Justice. The Department of Health and Human Services has already referred Maine’s case to the DOJ for review.Wednesday’s decision by the USDA marks the second time this year the department has suspended funding to Maine. Last month, federal funding was temporarily withheld from the University of Maine System while officials examined its adherence to Title IX policies. That funding was reinstated days later after the university system was found to be in compliance. However, the primary controversy over transgender inclusion in sports remains at the high school level.Multiple female athletes in Maine have voiced concerns about competing against transgender students. Cassidy Carlisle, a high school student, shared her experience of being placed in a locker room with a transgender peer in middle school and later competing against another transgender athlete in Nordic skiing.“The defeat that comes with that in that moment is heartbreaking,” Carlisle said. “I'm just in shock in a way. I didn't believe it. … I didn't think it was happening to me.”A recent survey conducted by the American Parents Coalition found that a majority of Maine voters support restrictions on transgender participation in women’s sports. Out of approximately 600 registered voters surveyed, 63% said school sports participation should be determined by biological sex, while 66% agreed that it is “only fair to restrict women’s sports to biological women.” The poll also revealed that 60% of respondents—including 64% of independents and 66% of parents with children under 18—would back a ballot measure limiting female sports to biological women.More repercussions may be on the horizon for Maine as federal agencies ramp up pressure. If the state fails to meet the administration’s demands, additional sanctions could be imposed in the coming week, further threatening Maine’s access to federal resources.","USDA halts federal funding to Maine, citing the state's refusal to comply with a federal directive on gender-based participation in educational programs.

LIVE: Trump announces sweeping new tariffs

Donald Trump has unveiled sweeping new tariffs on imports, targeting a range of global economies but notably omitting Russia and North Korea from the list. The move, announced in a dramatic White House Rose Garden event, has sparked concerns over an escalating trade war .Speaking against a backdrop of American flags, Trump declared the tariffs a necessary step to protect US industries, calling the day ""Liberation Day."" The new measures include a 34% tariff on goods from China, 20% on the European Union, and 24% on Japan, with a general 10% baseline tariff for most other nations, including Britain. Trump framed the move as a way to reverse decades of economic exploitation, stating, ""For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike.""However, Russia, North Korea, Cuba, and Belarus were not included in the tariffs. A White House official, speaking anonymously to the New York Times, explained that these countries were excluded because they already face ""extremely high tariffs and our previously imposed sanctions preclude any meaningful trade with these countries.""The announcement triggered immediate backlash. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese denounced the tariffs as ""totally unwarranted,"" while Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, despite her ties to Trump, called them ""wrong."" The European Union has vowed retaliation, with officials warning of countermeasures that could affect US exports.Wall Street reacted sharply to the news. The S&P index dropped 1.5% in after-hours trading, while the dollar initially fell against the euro before recovering. Businesses in the US have also raised concerns that the tariffs could lead to higher prices for consumers and trigger a broader economic slowdown.Trump’s stance on tariffs has long been a cornerstone of his economic policy. He insists that such measures will bring a ""rebirth"" of American manufacturing and encourage companies to relocate to the US ""This is Liberation Day,"" he declared, claiming that the tariffs would ""make America wealthy again.""Key allies, however, are seeking ways to mitigate the impact. Britain, which faces a 10% tariff, launched a diplomatic effort, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer personally delivering an invitation from King Charles III for a state visit. Meanwhile, business leaders in affected nations are scrambling to assess the full ramifications of the new trade barriers.","US President Donald Trump announces sweeping new tariffs on imports.

US President Donald Trump has announced sweeping new tariffs on major US trading partners, imposing a 34% tax on imports from China and 20% on the European Union, among other nations.Speaking from the Rose Garden, Trump declared that the tariffs were necessary to counter trade deficits and revive American manufacturing. A 10% baseline tax will be applied to all imports, while countries with significant trade surpluses with the US will face higher rates. Justifying the action, Trump said, “Taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years. But it is not going to happen anymore.”The new tariffs, enacted under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, represent one of the most aggressive trade measures taken by a US president in modern history. Critics warn that they could spark a global trade war , disrupt economic stability, and drive up consumer prices.Trump has defended the tariffs as a means to generate revenue and ensure fairer trade practices. However, the move has drawn opposition from some Republican lawmakers, particularly those representing agricultural states, who fear that escalating trade tensions could harm American farmers and businesses.","US President Donald Trump has announced sweeping new tariffs on major US trading partners, imposing a 34% tax on imports from China and 20% on the European Union.

US President Donald Trump defended himself on Wednesday against criticism over high egg prices , claiming he had no role in the surge.Speaking at highly anticipated ‘ Make America Wealthy Again ’ event where he announced the reciprocal tariffs over other countries, Trump briefly spoke about egg prices before revealing the taxes.About speaking of egg prices, he shifted blame to his predecessors and said, “I just got here,” and asserting that the steep rise occurred before his return to office.At the event, Trump announced a sweeping set of tariffs targeting various nations, including China, the European Union, and Japan, under what he called “Liberation Day.” While these tariffs aim to strengthen American industry, economists have raised concerns that they could further drive up prices for consumers.Egg prices have been a point of frustration for many Americans, with costs skyrocketing in early 2024 due to supply chain disruptions and avian flu outbreaks.According to CNN, a dozen eggs reached a 10-year high of $5.90 in February. However, prices have started to decline, with wholesale eggs now averaging $3.00 per dozen, largely due to improved supply and fewer avian flu cases.Despite the decrease, consumers have yet to see major relief at grocery stores. The US department of agriculture said that “only now starting to see shelf prices slowly decline.”Earlier, Trump had taken credit for recent price drops, stating, “we got it down,” and pointing to his administration’s $1 billion investment in combating avian flu. However, industry experts, including American Farm Bureau Federation economist Bernt Nelson, attribute the decline to the natural recovery of poultry farms and increased production, reported CNN.","US President Donald Trump defended himself on Wednesday against criticism over high egg prices.

Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.The operation, in Katlang, a remote hilltop area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was aimed at militant hideouts and resulted in the deaths of 12 suspected terrorists. However, it also led to the deaths of 10 civilians, including women and children, sparking outrage.Government spokesman Muhammad Ali Saif confirmed the casualties and said that the location was being used as a hideout and transit point for terrorists. He admitted that unarmed civilians were present at the site.""The safety of civilians is always a top priority during such operations. However, due to complex geography, terrorists using civilian populations as cover, and the urgent nature of the operation, unintended consequences can sometimes occur,"" said Saif, as quoted by the Associated Press.The provincial government has now promised an inquiry into how the operation led to civilian deaths.Local residents reported that the victims were nomads from the Swat region who had been living in the Shamozai mountains with their livestock. Their families protested by placing their bodies on the Swat Highway, demanding justice.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur called the incident “highly condemnable and tragic.” He assured that every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties but acknowledged the challenges of military operations in complex terrains where militants embed themselves among civilians.The government said medical aid is being provided to the injured, and compensation for the victims' families is being arranged. A provincial press note said the operation had ""neutralised several high-value militant targets"" but admitted that the “fog of war” sometimes leads to unintended consequences.","Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.

IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme | Dawn News English

Pakistan's citizens may have to pay additional taxation as a new carbon levy is anticipated following a USD 1.3 billion agreement with the IMF for climate change initiatives PTI reported citing official sources.Alongside this, the IMF agreed to release approximately USD 1 billion as the second tranche of the previously agreed USD 7 billion loan.""The IMF team has reached a SLA with the Pakistani authorities on the first review of the 37-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), and a new 28-month arrangement under the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) with total access over the 28 months of around USD 1.3 billion,"" the Fund said in a statement.The total IMF loan now amounts to USD 8.3 billion with this RSF arrangement. Upon approval from the IMF's Executive Board, Pakistan would receive immediate access to approximately USD 2 billion to strengthen its balance of payment position.The new agreement requires additional commitments from the tax-burdened population, including a new carbon levy, increased water rates, and liberalisation of the automobile sector. Dawn newspaper reports that a reduction in power rates is expected, funded by reallocating the existing petroleum levy.Senior officials familiar with the SLA and MEFP indicated that the prime minister would announce an approximate Rs 7 per unit reduction in average electricity rates, effective from April 1, 2025.The implementation of new measures - carbon levy, water pricing and automobile sector reforms - will commence from July 1, 2025. Fiscal consolidation will continue through reduced energy subsidies and controlled development spending.Officials confirmed that whilst the government sought GST reduction on electricity, the IMF instead permitted the use of increased petroleum levy to offset power tariffs. A Rs 10 per litre increase in petroleum levy would provide approximately Rs 1.80 per unit relief.The government has agreed to implement a carbon levy of Rs 3-5 per litre or equivalent on all hydrocarbons, including petroleum products and coal, with gradual increases planned. The revenue will fund climate-related initiatives.Automobile sector trade tariffs will decrease from 10.5% to 6% by FY 2030, ending what both parties agreed was excessive protection. These measures require cabinet approval before implementation through the finance bill 2025-26.The authorities aim to achieve an FY25 underlying primary surplus of 1% of GDP minimum, maintaining consolidation in FY26. The focus remains on revenue mobilisation, spending efficiency and tax base expansion.Pakistan has committed to maintaining strict monetary policy to keep inflation within the SBP's 5-7% target range and preserve foreign exchange market functionality while building reserves.The RSF programme includes strengthening public investment processes, improving water resource management, enhancing disaster financing coordination, addressing climate-related risks, and promoting environmental-friendly transportation to reduce pollution impacts.",IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme.

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

QUETTA: The Balochistan government , under the leadership of chief minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti , has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities , as reported by ARY News.In a high-level meeting chaired by CM Bugti, which was attended by the IG Balochistan and the chief secretary, the government announced that it would target individuals involved in anti-state propaganda and activism.According to ARY News, CM Bugti instructed all commissioners and district officers to act swiftly against any government employees suspected of promoting anti-state narratives or participating in activities that challenge the state's authority. The government's move appears to be a direct attempt to suppress activism and dissent within the province, especially among those critical of the state's policies. Bugti also confirmed that individuals involved in such actions would be placed under strict surveillance by being added to the Fourth Schedule for closer monitoring.ARY News also reported that CM Bugti directed all heads of educational institutions in the province to ensure the national flag is hoisted and the national anthem is recited regularly. Educational leaders who fail to enforce these directives are being told to resign, which signals a heightened crackdown on any form of resistance within these spaces.This renewed focus on stifling activism in Balochistan reflects the government's broader strategy to assert control over the region, including monitoring and potentially silencing any opposition to its policies.This comes amidst the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. Activists in the Balochistan region have frequently organised protests and campaigns, calling attention to the region's marginalisation.In response, governments have implemented harsh crackdowns, often leading to the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. These actions have sparked widespread criticism from international human rights organisations, highlighting concerns over the suppression of political expression and the stifling of peaceful advocacy for regional rights.","The Balochistan government has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities.

On the night of June 1, 2001, gunfire echoed through the marble halls, leaving nearly the entire royal family, including King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya, dead. Gyanendra Shah, the king no one expected, took the throne days later. But by 2008, amid a peace deal with Maoists and end of a decade-long civil war that left more than 17,000 dead, monarchy was abolished. For Nepal's post- 2000 generation, the palace is more museum than memory.And yet, the past is back. Not as nostalgia whispered in old homes, but as chants - 'Raja aau, desh bachau' - rising from TikTok and Facebook feeds, protest portals, and campuses. In private institutes, youngsters are asking hard questions of the republic. What has it delivered, besides a carousel of prime ministers and a nation in drift? Since becoming a republic in 2008, Nepal has had 13 different PMs, often through fragile coalitions. A school administrator said, ""They've come of age amid rolling blackouts, political instability, and a broken job market. It's not just the changing faces. It's the lack of direction. Every few months, there's a new education policy... a different entrance exam.""In classrooms where teachers once prepped students for exams and jobs, conversations now veer into who should lead the country - elected politicians or a king - and whether their votes would matter at all. ""We're supposed to be teaching maths and science,"" said Sagar Acharya, a principal in Chitwan. ""But these days, it feels like we're moderating parliament."" Smriti Acharya, a 20-year-old student, never imagined she'd attend a protest rally. ""I didn't live through the monarchy... But I've lived through this system - and it's not working."" Her friend added, ""When every year brings a new PM, what future are we supposed to plan for?""The churn isn't just political - it's personal. Students watch classmates vanish abroad in search of something better. According to International Organisation for Migration, over 3,00,000 students have left the country for higher education in past five years. Nepal's department of foreign employment said over 1,10,000 student visa recommendations were issued in 2022. Student absenteeism has spiked since the March 28 crackdown on protests. Even in schools that avoid overt political discussion, the tensions are palpable. ""There's a strange energy right now - a hunger to belong to something larger than themselves,"" said a teacher. Sociologist Tara Rai said the protests are more than just a royalist revival. ""This is a generation that has only known chaos. The generation's activism is rooted in disillusionment, not nostalgia. For them, the king is less a figure than a symbol - of order, identity, something to rally around.""For many, though, monarchy is not the solution. ""Given the choice, I'd still opt for a democracy,"" said another student. ""It may be messy, but it gives us rights and a chance to participate. I just want a system that works."" Despite rising tensions, education ministry has issued no formal advisory. But insiders say informal instructions have been sent to ""avoid sensitive political discussion"" in classrooms. Still, it's hard to silence what students are already debating online. Hashtags and remixed protest chants continue to spread across Instagram and TikTok. ""That's how students engage now,"" said a digital media analyst.","Since becoming a republic in 2008, Nepal has had 13 different PMs, often through fragile coalitions. In private institutes, youngsters are asking hard questions of the republic. Sociologist Tara Rai said the protests are more than just a royalist revival.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119923534,imgsize-1498424,width-400,resizemode-4/119923534.jpg"

KATHMANDU: Nepal MP Dhawal Shumsher Rana ’s daughter, Shivangini Rana , has described her father as “India’s damaad”, pointing to a network of deep personal, educational, and royal family ties between their household in Nepal and families across India. Rana has been in jail since Saturday for his alleged role in the pro-monarchy protests in which 2 people, including a journalist, were killed on Friday.Speaking to TOI, Shivangini said she studied at Mayo College Girls’ School in Ajmer, graduating in 2007. Her mother, Pratima Rana, studied at Loreto schools in Kolkata and Shillong and later attended Lady Brabourne College, Kolkata. “We’ve lived across India — in Calcutta, Shillong, Ajmer. India is home in many ways,” Shivangini said.The family's personal links span several Indian states. “My eldest aunt is married into the royal family of Dumraon in Bihar. Another aunt is married to the Kawardha royal family in Chhattisgarh. Pradyot Deb Barman, the erstwhile maharaja of Tripura, is my uncle,” she said.Shivangini’s grandmother is Padma Raje Scindia, the eldest daughter of Jivajirao Scindia, the last ruling maharaja of Gwalior, and Vijaya Raje Scindia, one of the founding members of the BJP. Her grandmother’s sister is Vasundhara Raje, the former chief minister of Rajasthan and senior BJP leader. “My mother’s maika is in India.

Shivangini Rana

KATHMANDU: Rumours swirled in Kathmandu on Monday that two senior Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) leaders could face treason charges — a crime punishable by life imprisonment in Nepal — after police produced them in court for involvement in the March 28 pro-monarchy violence in which two persons, including a journalist, were killed. The passports of current MP Dhawal Shumsher Rana and Rabindra Mishra have been revoked, and demands to impound former king Gyanendra Shah ’s passport were raised in parliament, Rana’s family members told TOI on Monday evening.RPP senior vice-president Mishra and general secretary Rana, a member of the lower house, were remanded in custody for five days by Kathmandu district court judge Taradevi Maharjan. The court permitted further investigation under charges related to crimes against the state. The duo were among 11 people presented in court on Monday, said court information officer Deepak Kumar Shrestha. Mishra was handcuffed; Rana was not.Rana’s daughter Shivangini told TOI that her father had been diagnosed with cancer in Nepal and treated at the Head and Neck Cancer Institute of India in Mumbai in September. He had just completed a round of radiation therapy and was due to return to India for follow-up treatment, but was not allowed to leave. “I won’t be surprised if they (govt) slap ridiculous charges against him,” she said. “Their passports have also been impounded. Neither he nor Mishra can leave the country now. He was due for treatment in India, but it is now clear that he cannot leave Nepal anytime soon.”Shivangini added that the family had been informed verbally by officials that the passports of both leaders were being held “until further notice”, but no formal communication had been received.Meanwhile, during a session of the federal parliament on Monday, lawmakers from the ruling coalition demanded that former king Gyanendra Shah’s passport also be impounded in connection with the violent demonstrations. Rastriya Janamorcha MP Chitra Bahadur KC said that a thorough investigation into the former king’s role was “essential to protect the republic”.Ramhari Sharma Kafle, chief of the Kathmandu district public prosecutor ’s office, said Mishra, Rana and others may be charged with crimes against the state after preliminary investigation. Of the nearly 200 persons – locals, members of various political parties – arrested and detained so far, police have produced 42 people in court, including those held under charges of criminal mischief and organised crime. The rest are under further investigation, police said.According to officials, the March 28 ‘ Janadolan ’ — led by Durga Prasai’s Nepal Royalist Movement — turned violent and led to widespread vandalism in Kathmandu. Protesters allegedly damaged homes, a hospital, vehicles, and a political party office, and looted a shopping mall. They also reportedly seized a weapon from the armed police. The aam sabha was led by Prasai. Rana was called in as a moral supporter and guest. Businessman-activist Prasai was appointed its ""people’s commander"".Police said Prasai has been on the run since Friday’s protest. On Sunday, he released a video on Facebook saying he was staying in a temple in the capital. Meanwhile, police arrested Gopal Malla, 38, from Bhimsen Gola for allegedly stealing a gas gun from an armed police officer during the violence. The gun has not yet been recovered. Malla, originally from Sainamaina municipality in Rupandehi, now resides in Tarakeshwar-10, Kathmandu.In another development, Kathmandu Metropolitan City has fined Gyanendra Shah Nepalese Rs 793,000 (INR 4 lakh) for protest-related damage. Officials issued the fine over multiple infractions, including littering streets, breaking public railings and damaging fire engines used during the protest. The city police attempted to deliver the letter at Gyanendra’s estate Nirmal Niwas but were turned away by his staff. The notice was subsequently sent by post.Shivangini added that Rana was among the few MPs to oppose foreign influence in Nepal’s political affairs. “In Parliament, he was the only MP who spoke against over 100 million dollars that came into Nepal to promote secularism and conversion,” she said, referencing remarks made by former US president Donald Trump.According to Shivangini, her father supports restoring Nepal as a Hindu kingdom. “He believes bringing back the monarchy and Hindu Rashtra can restore dignity and unite the people. The current democratic system and elected parties have failed the country. He always says, ‘To change the situation, we must change the system.’”On the day of the protest, she said Rana was not the organiser but attended as coordinator of the Janandolan committee. “It was organised by Durga Prasai. My father was present to speak, but before he could, tear gas shells landed on the stage. Everyone ran,” she said. “There were others who provoked the crowd. My father wasn’t one of them. He was unarmed, standing in the middle of the road.”Shivangini showed TOI the video footage that she said showed Rana urging protestors not to resort to violence. “Even after police began firing tear gas, he was asking people not to throw stones and trying to manage the crowd,” she said. “Yet they are talking about charging him with treason.” She said Rana’s driver was shot twice during the protest. “He was just standing next to my father. That bullet could have hit him.”She also alleged the police action was premeditated. “Officers were stationed on rooftops. As soon as we started the national anthem, tear gas rained down. The crowd hadn’t even fully gathered yet. It was all staged,” she said. “We’ve always said our protest will be peaceful, like Mahatma Gandhi’s. We don’t believe in violence.”Shivangini said the govt is deliberately building a case against her father. “There’s fear in the govt. This movement has shaken the country. People are fed up with corruption and political failure. That’s why they want to silence voices like his.”",Two senior Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) leaders could face treason charges.

"We want our guardian back, says RPP, calls for Hindu Rashtra",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/we-want-our-guardian-back-says-rpp-calls-for-hindu-rashtra/articleshow/119834327.cms,"KATHMANDU: Swati Thapa , central committee member of Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), weighs her words carefully. “The people want the king back,” she says. “Not as a ruler. As a guardian. A stabilising force. And they want Nepal restored as a Hindu rashtra . These are not political slogans anymore — they’re the people’s survival instincts.”RPP was formed in 1990 following the restoration of multi-party democracy. It began with four seats in the 1991 parliamentary elections and has remained a fluctuating but persistent presence in Nepali politics, often playing the role of kingmaker. In 2022, RPP secured 14 of 275 seats in the federal parliament, marking a modest resurgence. The party was part of the current coalition government until Feb 2023, when it withdrew support.Her party – from which several senior leaders have been arrested or detained – has long championed these demands: the return of a constitutional monarchy, the removal of the country’s “expensive” federal structure, and reinstatement of Nepal as a Hindu state. The return of Nepal as a Hindu rashtra is central to RPP’s vision. “This country became secular without asking its people. That’s the truth,” she said. “We believe more than 80% of Nepalis still want a Hindu state.”Thapa brushes off the concern that RPP’s agenda might alienate moderates or minorities. “This doesn’t mean discrimination (against other communities). It means protection of what’s ours. We respect every religion. But we will not lose ourselves in the process. Why must we keep apologising for our roots?” she said.She alleges that “coerced” conversions — particularly in remote and poor areas — are altering the cultural fabric of the country. “Foreign aid is being used to change who we are,” she said, naming Western agencies as enablers. “We respect all faiths. But this cannot come at the cost of Nepal’s soul.”.Former king Gyanendra Shah’s re-emergence has been a flashpoint in the country. His recent ""return"" to Kathmandu saw enormous crowds — but he remains silent. Is that silence a strategy or a missed moment? “He is not responsible for this movement. He is above all that is happening,” Thapa insisted. “And we don’t want to drag him into daily politics. But the people still revere him. They see him as someone who didn’t steal from them. Someone they can trust. So even his silence has weight.”She confirmed that RPP maintains contact with the royal family and said ""monarchy must remain above political manoeuvring"". On the tricky subject of succession — especially given public unease with Gyanendra’s son, Paras — Thapa is straightforward. “We’ve said clearly: succession should not be automatic.Thapa said, “We've been saying clearly: succession will be from the king's linage. Gyanendra might skip a generation as his has publicly said that he has no interest to rule the country. But it could be his son, grandson or someone from their family. Whatever decision will be taken that will be later after restoration of the monarchy.’When prodded that it's not really how monarchies work, she said that a member of the royal family would always wear the crown, but it would not necessarily be the eldest son. “The bloodline would be at the bottom of our list of what makes our king,” she said. “We’re not talking about bringing back direct rule. The king would be symbolic. The executive power would rest with a directly elected prime minister. But we need a figure above the fray. Someone the country can rally around.”Even if RPP succeeds, the road to restoring a monarchy, even a constitutional one, would take some time. And if not the king, then who? “There is no Plan B,” she said. “That is our honest answer. We see no other figure who can command the trust of the people. That’s why we want the monarchy — not for nostalgia, but because the republic has failed to offer us a credible alternative.”That sentiment has long existed within the party. But in recent weeks, it has found unexpected traction beyond it.What was once a political platform has spilled onto the streets. The slogans once confined to RPP rallies are now the chants of thousands. On March 28, these protests turned violent. Two people, including a journalist, died. Over a hundred were injured. More than 50 — including RPP veterans Rabindra Mishra and MP Dhawal Shumsher Rana — were arrested.“We are not leading all these protests,” Thapa clarified. “But we have given moral support to those that share our goals. This is a joint effort, driven by the public. We are not claiming ownership, and we don’t want to. That would be missing the point.”She said RPP’s movement has been non-violent, with a set calendar of demonstrations. “Our programme has always been peaceful. What happened on March 28 wasn’t who we are.” Thapa blamed state provocation. “We have footage of tear gas fired from rooftops by police in civilian clothes. The crowd was unarmed.” The party has called for a thorough investigation and continues to protest in all 77 districts.Thapa described the surge in support as driven by a profound loss of direction. “People aren’t just angry. They’re exhausted. Corruption, inflation, political instability...”When asked about the absence of political flags at rallies, she said she views it as an affirmation rather than a threat. “We’re proud to see the national flag. Even in our own programmes, we use it. It’s not about RPP. It’s about Nepal.”One of the more visible faces during the recent mobilisation has been controversial figure and former Maoist Durga Prasai, whom some have criticised for inflammatory rhetoric. “We supported the agenda he stood for,” Thapa said. “That doesn’t mean we support everything about his style. Our commitment is to peaceful protest. Anyone who wants the same future for Nepal is welcome — but not at the cost of our principles.”As the protests evolve and the govt continues its crackdown, Thapa said she and her party remain firm. “This is not a passing storm. It’s a reckoning. And it’s just beginning.”","Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) was formed in 1990 following the restoration of multi-party democracy.

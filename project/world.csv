US President Donald Trump declared a victory against the Pulitzer Prize Board in a libel lawsuit filed in 2022 relating to a series of reports in the New York Times and Washington Post on the 2016 Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.This came after the appellate court in the Fourth District denied the board's request to suspend proceedings until the MAGA leader completes their current term, as reported by Law & Crime. In their seven-page decision, the court determined that the board did not demonstrate any ""constitutional conflicts"" that would justify postponing the case, according to the legal news outlet.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that he won the case against the ""illegal and defamatory"" award given to ""malicious stories on the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax."" He also said that the reporters were awarded for false reporting.""BREAKING! In a major WIN in our powerful lawsuit against the Pulitzer Prize Board regarding the illegal and defamatory “Award” of their once highly respected “Prize,” to fake, malicious stories on the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, by the Failing New York Times and the Washington Compost, the Florida Appellate Court viciously rejected the Defendants’ corrupt attempt to halt the case,"" the US President said.""They won a Pulitzer Prize for totally incorrect reporting about the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax.

"Watch: Canada burns red — Wildfires trigger mass evacuations, Manitoba declares state emergency",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/watch-canada-burns-red-wildfires-trigger-mass-evacuations-manitoba-declares-state-emergency/articleshow/121478861.cms,"Manitoba has declared a province-wide state of emergency due to rapidly spreading wildfires, leading to the evacuation of over 17,000 people. Premier Wab Kinew has requested federal assistance, including military support, to aid in evacuation and firefighting efforts. The unprecedented scale of the fires, affecting multiple regions, is attributed to changing climate conditions, with significant forest area already scorched.

Wildfires prompt evacuations in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba





The Canadian province of Manitoba declared a state of emergency after the massive wildfire continues to spread in the province, resulting in evacuation of more than 17000 people.Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew announced the decision on Wednesday. The evacuation was essential amid the extreme fire conditions and growing threat to communities across the province.""The Manitoba government has declared a province-wide state of emergency due to the wildfire situation,"" Kinew said.“This is the largest evacuation Manitoba will have seen in most people’s living memory,” he added.Kinew has requested assistance from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney asking for military support to help with evacuation efforts and firefighting.He assured that military aircraft are being deployed to move people from danger zones to safety, alongside additional firefighting resources.Flin Flon, a town in Manitoba and home to about 5,000 residents was among the areas placed under evacuation orders. People there had already been warned to be ready to leave at short notice. Other remote towns and Indigenous communities have also been evacuated, with most residents expected to be relocated to the provincial capital, Winnipeg.One of the evacuees, Sheryl Matheson described the terrifying scene as wildfires surrounded her hometown of Sherridon.“It's been overwhelming. It was very smoky. You could see the fires four or five kilometers away and moving fast,” she told AFP.“The flames were shooting over 121 feet high and firefighters couldn’t get close enough to do anything”, she added.Another resident, Elsaida Alerta, who has lived in Flin Flon for three years, said the evacuation was extremely stressful.""Especially for somebody that lived in a big city (previously), that never had to evacuate, this is definitely nerve-wracking,"" she told CBC.She described the only highway out of town as jammed with traffic, with gas stations running dry.“We basically gathered all our essential things, important documents, medications and things our animals will need,” she said.""We're just gonna make our way and hope for the best"", she added.Premier Kinew said the scale of the fires is a warning sign. ""For the first time, it's not a fire in one region, we have fires in every region. That is a sign of a changing climate that we are going to have to adapt to,"" Kinew said.There are currently 22 wildfires active in the province. According to Kirstin Hayward of the Manitoba wildfire service, ""The wildfire has affected nearly 200,000 hectares of forests that have been scorched in just the past month, or triple the annual average over the previous five years.""""Manitoba has the highest fire activity in Canada so far this year, due in part to a prolonged period of warm and dry conditions,"" she added.About 1,000 residents of Lynn Lake and Marcel Colomb First Nation in Manitoba and 4,000 people from the northern village of Pelican Narrows and other communities in neighboring Saskatchewan had already been evacuated earlier in the week.Across Canada, 134 wildfires are burning, with half considered out of control. Fires are active in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario.Earlier this month, two people died in a wildfire near Lac du Bonnet, northeast of Winnipeg. In 2023, Canada experienced its worst wildfire season on record. The only reported deaths were among firefighters.Kinew said emergency shelters are being set up. Companies and communities across Manitoba were being asked to welcome the evacuees.","Manitoba has declared a province-wide state of emergency due to rapidly spreading wildfires.

Africa elects its next 'super banker',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/africa-elects-its-next-super-banker/articleshow/121478601.cms,"Head of the African Development Bank (AfDB) Akinwumi Adesina (Image credit: AfDB official website)

Five priorities:

Election rules:







The race to become Africa's next ""super banker"" ends on Thursday, with five candidates, including one woman, vying to succeed Nigeria's Akinwumi Adesina as head of the African Development Bank (AfDB) in a contest that appears too close to call.In 2015 it took six rounds of voting to elect Adesina as president of the AfDB, which was founded in 1964 and now has 81 members, including 54 African nations.Based in Ivory Coast's economic capital Abidjan, the AfDB is one of the world's largest multilateral development banks, and is funded by member subscriptions, loans raised on global markets as well as repayments and income from loans.But Adesina's successor will immediately face a disrupted international economic environment, notably due to announcements from the US Trump administration.Beyond tariffs, the AfDB is also facing the threat of losing 500 million dollars in US funding for its projects to support low income countries on the continent.Two of the five candidates are from west Africa -- former finance ministers Amadou Hott of Senegal and Sidi Ould Tah of Mauritania.Two others hail from southern Africa -- Zambian economist Samuel Munzele Maimbo and South African Bajabulile Swazi Tshabalala, who was previously a vice president at the institution.Chadian Abbas Mahamat Tolli, the former governor of the Bank of Central African States, will represent central Africa, which has never held the AfDB presidency.All five promise to make the AfDB even more effective to transform Africa, continuing Adesina's five priorities to light up, feed, industrialise, integrate and improve quality of life.""I am proud of the legacy we are leaving behind for... my successor, for the bank, and for Africa,"" the outgoing president said in a speech on Tuesday.""We have built a world-class financial institution that will continue to advance Africa's position within a rapidly changing global development and geopolitical environment.""Adesina said 565 million people had benefited from AfDB projects during his decade in charge.Major projects include support for the construction of the Gabal El Asfar wastewater treatment plant in Egypt -- the largest in Africa.The bank also helped finance a bridge connecting Senegal and the Gambia, expanded the port of Lome in Togo, and supported sanitation projects in Lesotho and access to electricity in Kenya, he said.From 2015 to this year, the bank's capital more than tripled from $93 billion to $318 billion, he added.To win Thursday's election, candidates must secure a majority of votes from all member countries and a majority of votes from African nations.But the weight of each shareholder state is determined by the extent of its capital contribution to the bank.As such, the five largest African contributors -- Nigeria, Egypt, Algeria, South Africa, and Morocco -- will be especially courted.The United States and Japan are the largest non-regional contributors.If there is no winner in the first round, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, a situation that repeats until a candidate achieves the required majority.Alliance-building will therefore be crucial on Thursday, in the corridors of the Hotel Ivoire in Abidjan.","Five candidates, including one woman, vying to succeed Nigeria's Akinwumi Adesina as head of the African Development Bank.

Watch: Dramatic footage shows glacier burying Swiss Village,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/watch-dramatic-footage-shows-glacier-burying-swiss-village/articleshow/121477194.cms,"Dramatic footage shows glacier burying Swiss Village

Earthquake and flooding threat

A precarious wait and ongoing threats





A massive section of the Birch Glacier collapsed in the Swiss Alps on Wednesday, unleashing a powerful landslide of ice, mud, and rock that buried nearly the entire village of Blatten in the Valais canton, just over a week after residents were ordered to evacuate.Authorities confirmed that one person is missing and warned that recovery could take years, as drone footage captured the dramatic moment the glacier broke away, sending a towering plume of dust cascading down the mountainside.The glacier, burdened by approximately 9 million tons of debris, had been inching steadily, up to 11 feet per day, toward the Lötschental Valley in recent weeks, prompting evacuations of the village’s 300 residents.“We’ve lost the village, but not the heart,” said mayor Matthias Bellwald at a news conference on Wednesday.Officials estimate that 90% of Blatten has been buried, according to Stéphane Ganzer, a state councillor for Valais. The destruction has also closed the main road connecting Blatten to the nearby village of Goppenstein, cutting off access for all except local residents.The landslide registered as a 3.1 magnitude earthquake, and emergency teams are now closely monitoring a blocked riverbed nearby, which poses a significant risk of ice jams and flooding.Authorities are not ruling out further evacuations and have requested assistance from the Swiss Army to deploy pumps and debris-clearing equipment.Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter shared a photo of the devastation, expressing her condolences, “It is terrible to lose a home. I’m thinking of the people of Blatten.”For nearly two weeks, the fractured glacier loomed ominously above Blatten, a picturesque Alpine hamlet known for its serene beauty and traditional farming lifestyle. As the threat grew, livestock were evacuated, including 52 cattle, sheep, and rabbits. A widely shared video of a cow being airlifted to safety underscored the seriousness of the situation.","A section of the Birch Glacier collapsed in the Swiss Alps on Wednesday, unleashing a powerful landslide of ice, mud, and rock that buried nearly the entire village of Blatten.

"A prison escape, a fake uniform, and 2,000 caves: Inside the hunt for Grant Hardin",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-prison-escape-a-fake-uniform-and-2000-caves-inside-the-hunt-for-grant-hardin/articleshow/121477592.cms,"A prison escape, a fake uniform, and 2,000 caves: Inside the hunt for Grant Hardin

Hardin’s knowledge of the region poses key obstacle

Caves are central focus of search efforts

Authorities urge vigilance as manhunt continues





The hunt for escaped killer and ex-cop Grant Hardin is in its fourth day as law enforcement officers face several obstacles in the rugged wilderness of the Ozark Mountains. With thick forests, abandoned cabins, and one of the highest concentrations of caves in Arkansas, the terrain is proving ideal for a fugitive dubbed “The Devil in the Ozarks. ”Hardin, 56, escaped from the North Central Unit at Calico Rock on Sunday by impersonating a law enforcement officer, a lapse prison officials have called a serious failure in protocol. By the time his absence was noticed, Hardin had a 30-minute head start on foot in a region filled with natural cover and hidden hideouts.“He knows where the caves are,” said Darla Nix, a local café owner whose family knew Hardin. “He’s a survivor — very smart, very quiet. That’s what makes this so difficult.”Search crews, including local, state, and federal agencies, are using dogs, drones, and helicopters to comb through the vast, uneven terrain. But caves, hundreds of them, have become a central challenge in the manhunt.“There are a lot of places to hide and take shelter,” said Rand Champion, spokesman for the Arkansas department of corrections.“We’re talking about abandoned sheds, remote campsites, and caves that go deep underground. That’s been a key focus of our search teams.”Hardin's escape has drawn comparisons to notorious fugitive Eric Rudolph, who evaded capture for years by hiding in the Appalachian Mountains. Experts say someone can survive underground for days or even weeks, especially in the cave-rich environment of the Ozarks.“There are nearly 2,000 documented caves in northern Arkansas,” said Michael Ray Taylor, a caving expert and author. “The entrances can look like nothing — a rabbit hole in the ground — but inside, there are enormous passageways. If someone like Hardin knows them, he could go days without being seen.”Still, Taylor pointed out a major risk: “You have to come out for food. That’s when you’re most vulnerable.”Hardin, a former police officer in multiple Arkansas towns, has a long history of misconduct and violent crime. His law enforcement career ended in disgrace after a series of firings and resignations, including an excessive force incident in Eureka Springs. In 2017, he was sentenced to 30 years for murdering James Appleton, the brother of Gateway’s mayor and 50 years for a 1997 rape.Hardin's past as a police chief and knowledge of the local terrain are making the pursuit even more complex. “He’s not just a fugitive,” said Champion. “He’s someone who knows how we operate.”Authorities continue to urge residents across the Arkansas Ozarks to lock doors, secure vehicles, and report anything suspicious. As of Wednesday, one of the biggest concerns is the network of underground hideouts that could buy Hardin more time and make this manhunt last longer than anyone wants.“We’re not letting up,” said Champion. “But this is a hard place to disappear and a harder one to search.”","Grant Hardin, 56, escaped from the North Central Unit at Calico Rock on Sunday by impersonating a law enforcement officer.

"Trump issues series of pardons for politicians, union leader, rapper",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-issues-series-of-pardons-for-politicians-union-leader-rapper/articleshow/121477219.cms,"NBA Youngboy, Donald Trump, Julie and Todd Chrisley





WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump issued a series of pardons on Wednesday, awarding them to a former New York congressman, a Connecticut governor, a rapper known as ""NBA YoungBoy"", a labour union leader and a onetime Army officer who flaunted safety measures during the Coronavirus pandemic.His actions mixed Trump's willingness to pardon high-profile Republicans and other supporters, donors and friends with the influence of Alice Marie Johnson, whom Trump recently named his pardon czar after he offered a pardon to her in 2020.Johnson was convicted in 1996 on eight criminal counts related to a Memphis-based cocaine trafficking operation. Trump commuted her life sentence in 2018 at the urging of celebrity Kim Kardashian West, allowing for Johnson's early release.Johnson then served as the featured speaker on the final night of the 2020 Republican National Convention, and Trump subsequently pardoned her before more recently naming her as his point person for pardons.Among those receiving the latest round of Trump pardons was Louisiana rap artiste NBA YoungBoy, whose real name is Kentrell Gaulden and whose stage moniker stands for ""Never Broke Again"".In 2024, he was sentenced to just under two years in prison on gun-related charges after he acknowledged having possessed weapons despite being a convicted felon.Gaulden also pleaded guilty to his role in a prescription drug fraud ring in Utah.Gaulden's and the other pardons were confirmed Wednesday evening by two White House officials who spoke only on background to detail actions that had not yet been formally made public.In a statement posted online, Gaulden said, ""I want to thank President Trump for granting me a pardon and giving me the opportunity to keep building - as a man, as a father, and as an artiste.""He said this ""opens the door to a future I've worked hard for and I am fully prepared to step into this"", and thanked Johnson.Trump has spent the week issuing high-profile pardons.A video released by a White House aide showed Johnson in the Oval Office on Tuesday, as Trump called their daughter to say he was pardoning TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley of the reality show ""Chrisley Knows Best"".Their show spotlighted the family's extravagant lifestyle, but the couple was convicted of conspiring to defraud banks in the Atlanta area out of more than USD 30 million in loans by submitting false documents.Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, addressed the Republican convention last summer and had long said her parents were treated unfairly.Also Wednesday, Trump commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, a former Chicago gang leader serving a life sentence.Hoover was first imprisoned in connection with a murder in 1973, and was convicted of running a criminal enterprise in 1998, but later renounced his criminal past and petitioned for a reduced sentence.The president also pardoned James Callahan, a New York union leader who pleaded guilty to failing to report USD 315,000 in gifts from an advertising firm and was about to be sentenced.The president pardoned former Connecticut governor John Rowland, a Republican who served from 1995 to 2004 and was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison for charges related to concealing his involvement in two federal election campaigns.He further pardoned Michael Grimm, a New York Republican who resigned from Congress after being convicted of tax fraud.Grimm won reelection in 2014 despite being under indictment for underreporting wages and revenue at a restaurant that he ran.Grimm eventually resigned after pleading guilty and serving eight months in prison. Last year, Grimm was paralysed from the chest down when he was thrown off a horse during a polo tournament.Yet another Trump pardon was issued for Army Lt. Mark Bradshaw, who was convicted in 2022 of reporting to work without undergoing a Covid-19 test.","US President Donald Trump issued a series of pardons on Wednesday.

Sky News Australia tore into former vice president Kamala Harris for being the chief speaker at a real estate event in Gold Coast, where she was reported paid half a million dollars to ""essentially chuckle on stage and make jokes about being unemployed"". The former vice president was in Australia Sunday to speak at the Australian Real Estate Conference, where she sat on stage with real estate industry veteran John McGrath and spoke about her mother, Playboy Magazine covers, hormones and being unemployed right now.Sky News Digital Presenter Gabriella Power called Kamala Harris a comedian as she asked comedian and commentator Alex Stein to comment on Harris's Australia outing.“She can’t do any worse than spending $1 billion on her presidential campaign and somehow ending up $100 million in debt,” Stein said, adding that he double-checked whether Kamala Harris ever visited Australia when she was the vice president and the answer is no.

She is there for the money,"" Stein said.“Kamala Harris is not having very good job prospects, or many offers here in America that are that great, so what is she going to do?

Poll Do you think the CIF’s rule change will positively impact female athletes? Yes, it will create more opportunities No, it may cause challenges in competition





The California interscholastic federation (CIF) announced a rule change this week to allow more girls to participate in the upcoming state track-and-field championships following public backlash over the inclusion of a transgender athlete, reported AP.In a statement issued Tuesday, the CIF said it would implement a ""pilot entry process"" to extend entry to more “biological female” athletes. The new rule allows any athlete who missed the automatic qualifying mark but had the next-best result in their section final to compete at the state level.“The CIF believes this pilot entry process achieves the participation opportunities we seek to afford our student-athletes,” the organisation said.The change only applies to this weekend’s competition. The CIF did not say how many athletes would be affected or whether the rule applies to all events or only those where a transgender athlete has qualified for the final. This could be the first time a high school sports governing body in the US has expanded competition in response to the participation of a transgender athlete.The change was introduced after US President Trump criticised the participation of trans athlete AB Hernandez, a transgender athlete competing in girls track and field.Trump threatened Tuesday to pull federal funding from California if the state did not bar transgender students from competing in girls’ sports.“THIS IS NOT FAIR, AND TOTALLY DEMEANING TO WOMEN AND GIRLS,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Hernandez is set to compete in the girls varsity triple jump, high jump, and long jump at the state finals. She won the Division 3 girls long jump and triple jump and placed seventh in the high jump at the Southern Section Division Finals on May 19.Parents and conservative advocates opposed to transgender girls competing in girls sports have criticized Hernandez and heckled her during postseason meets.After losing to Hernandez in the long jump at the sectional final, La Canada High School’s Katie McGuinness called on the CIF to revise its policy.California governor Gavin Newsom recently said on his podcast that it is “deeply unfair” for transgender girls to participate in girls sports.Last month, Democratic state lawmakers in California blocked bills that would have barred transgender girls from participating in girls sports.","The California interscholastic federation (CIF) announced a rule change this week to allow more girls to participate in the upcoming state track-and-field championships.

Yury Ushakov, a former Russian ambassador to the United States, has accused Donald Trump of being “not sufficiently informed” about the situation in Ukraine after the US president slammed his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin for “playing with fire.”“Trump says a lot of things. Naturally, we read and monitor all of this. But in many ways, we have come to the conclusion that Trump is not sufficiently informed about what is really happening in the context of the Russian-Ukrainian confrontation,” Ushakov told state TV channel Russia-1, according to CNN ""He appears to be unaware of the increasingly frequent massive terrorist attacks Ukraine is carrying out against peaceful Russian cities,” the Kremlin aide added.The remark from Ushakov, who was part of the negotiating team which Moscow sent to Saudi Arabia to meet US officials earlier this year to discuss a possible ceasefire in Ukraine, came just after Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on Trump's statement, during a call with reporters.Moscow's ex-envoy to Washington was reacting to the Republican leader's Truth Social post in which the latter said, “What Vladimir Putin doesn’t realize is that if it weren’t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD. He’s playing with fire!""Dozens of civilians have been killed by Russian drone and missile strikes against residential areas in the past few weeks.After Moscow's recent drone attack, its largest ever aerial assault on Ukraine, Trump accused Putin of having gone “absolutely CRAZY.”“I’ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY! He is needlessly killing a lot of people, and I’m not just talking about soldiers.

Billionaire Elon Musk has announced that his tenure as a formal adviser to President Donald Trump is coming to an end, raising questions about the future of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative he led.In a post on X, his social media platform, Musk expressed gratitude to Trump for the opportunity to address government spending inefficiencies.“As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,” Musk posted on X. “The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.”The most straightforward explanation lies in the statutory limitations of Musk's role as a Special Government Employee. These positions are legally restricted to 130 days of service within a 365-day period, with Musk's term scheduled to conclude around late May 2025. This arrangement was always intended to be temporary and advisory in nature, rather than a permanent executive position with direct decision-making authority.The position's inherent time constraints made this transition inevitable, regardless of other factors.A significant catalyst for Musk's departure appears to be his public opposition to Trump's signature legislation.Just one day before his announcement, Musk openly criticised what the president dubbed his ""big beautiful bill,"" describing it as a ""massive spending bill"" that would expand the federal deficit.This legislation, combining tax cuts with enhanced immigration enforcement measures, stood in direct opposition to DOGE's core mission of reducing government spending and waste. During a CBS interview, Musk pointedly remarked, ""I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful, but I don't know if it could be both."" This fundamental disagreement over fiscal policy created an untenable situation for his continued advisory role.While speaking to CBS, Musk described it as a “massive spending bill” that increases the federal deficit and “undermines the work” of DOGE.Musk's experience with federal bureaucracy proved far more challenging than he initially anticipated. In various public statements, he expressed growing frustration with the pace of change and institutional resistance within Washington.Speaking to the Washington Post, Musk described the situation as ""much worse than I realized"" and characterised his reform efforts as an ""uphill battle.""The challenges extended beyond mere administrative hurdles, as DOGE became a lightning rod for criticism, often being blamed for various government-related issues, even those outside its purview. This mounting pressure affected not only the initiative but also Musk's other business ventures, with some protesters even targeting Tesla vehicles.The gap between DOGE's ambitious targets and actual achievements likely contributed to Musk's decision.Initially promising $2 trillion in savings, the target was subsequently revised downward to $1 trillion, and then further to $150 billion. While DOGE implemented aggressive budget cuts and workforce reductions, the results fell significantly short of original expectations.The department aimed to reduce the civilian workforce by 12% (approximately 288,000 positions from the 2.4 million total), but achieved only about 100,000 reductions through buyouts and terminations - a figure lower than typical annual retirement numbers. The DOGE website's reported savings of $175 billion, while substantial, represented just a fraction of the initial goals.Musk's decision also reflects a strategic pivot back to his corporate interests, particularly Tesla, which has faced recent challenges in sales and profitability. During a Tesla earnings call, Musk announced plans to significantly reduce his time commitment to DOGE starting in May, indicating his intention to dedicate more attention to his business ventures.This shift comes as Tesla navigates through declining profits and revenues, complicated by political uncertainties and tariff concerns. The company has also faced challenges related to Musk's political involvement, with some consumers and activists targeting Tesla in response to his government role.Throughout his tenure, Musk maintained that his position as ""chief nothing officer"" was not essential to DOGE's mission. However, his departure raises questions about the initiative's future direction and effectiveness.",Billionaire Elon Musk has announced that his tenure as a formal adviser to President Donald Trump is coming to an end.

Harvard settles lawsuit over enslaved ancestor images,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harvard-settles-lawsuit-over-enslaved-ancestor-images/articleshow/121477721.cms,"Harvard University (File photo)





NEW YORK: Harvard University has agreed to settle a deeply emotional dispute over who has the rights to images of enslaved Africans taken in 1850 by a professor who sought to support a racist theory.The daguerrotypes, a precursor to modern photographs, are considered to be the earliest known images of Black American slaves, who were posed nude and semi-nude ""without consent, dignity or compensation,"" a 2019 lawsuit stated.The Cambridge institution has agreed to relinquish the images and has offered plaintiff Tamara Lanier a confidential monetary settlement.Lanier says she is a descendant of a slave known only by his first name, Renty, who was photographed nude, and his daughter Delia, who was photographed nude from the waist up, in images commissioned by Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz as supposed evidence of Black inferiority.The images were taken in South Carolina, and Lanier is advocating for them to be transferred to the International African American Museum there.Lanier accused the university of using them for advertising and commercial purposes, and denounced the use of Renty's image on a cover of a $40 anthropology book it published in 2017.""Since Black Americans were first brought to this country in chains, our pain and trauma have been exploited for capitalistic gain,"" said Lanier.Lanier claimed rights to the images 15 years ago, but Harvard has long-disputed the claim that she is Renty's great-great-great-granddaughter.""As descendants of slaves, familial history and well-documented genealogy are a luxury that many Black Americans do not have,"" Lanier said, who relied on her family's oral history to determine the connection in lineage.In a statement on the settlement, Harvard said they have ""long been eager"" to steward ""the daguerrotypes in a responsible manner.""In his time Agassiz, a Swiss-born biologist, was a renowned scientist who worked in geology.But Lanier's attorney Ben Crump said Agassiz also supported polygenism, which was ""used to justify both the ongoing enslavement of Black people prior to the Civil War and their segregation afterward.""The daguerrotypes were in the possession of Harvard's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology to date.""Harvard played a role in the darkest chapter in American history,"" Lanier said. ""This is a small step in the right direction towards fully acknowledging that history and working to rectify it.""The stain of Agassiz's work has been controversial elsewhere, too.He had an elementary school named after him near Harvard -- but local residents successfully demanded the name be changed to honor a long-serving Black principal Maria Louise Baldwin in 2002, citing his scientific racism.","The daguerrotypes, a precursor to modern photographs, are considered to be the earliest known images of Black American slaves.

The Trump administration has slashed $766 million allocated in funding to Moderna Inc., an American biotech and pharmaceutical company responsible for developing vaccines. Moderna was tasked to make vaccines against potential pandemic influenza viruses, as well as the H5N1 bird flu.The Health and Human Services Department had notified the company on Monday about the withdrawal of funds that were awarded through the BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) program.HHS is withdrawing funds awarded in January and July this year, intended to finance the development and purchase of the company’s investigational vaccine.Moderna had received $590 million in January and $176 million in July in funding meant to help judge the efficacy of the vaccines for bird flu and other pandemic viruses, as said by a company Spokesperson.Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy has expressed his concerns regarding the company’s vaccines despite evidence that vaccines developed by Moderna are safe and have saved millions of lives before.“While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis,"" said the company in a statement as reported by AP.Using the same technology used to develop and roll out vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic, Moderna has developed a new vaccine called mRNA-1018.On the other hand, a new, highly contagious variant of Covid-19 has surfaced in the US known as NB. 1.81. Initially detected in late March and early April among international travelers, cases have since been identified in New York, Ohio, California, Rhode Island, Hawaii, Washington State, and Virginia.Last year, the H5N1 bird flu virus spilled from wild birds into cattle and ended up infecting hundreds of animals across several states. 70 people reported sick with the flu, and one person died.Scientists have warned that continued alteration or evolution in the virus can make it more potent and ultimately lead to a pandemic.","The Trump administration has slashed $766 million allocated in funding to Moderna Inc., an American biotech and pharmaceutical company.

16 states, mostly controlled by Democrats, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Wednesday, asking a federal court to block major funding cuts and program changes at the National Science Foundation (NSF). The states argued that the moves threaten the United States' leadership in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, is led by New York attorney general Letitia James. “This administration's attacks on basic science and essential efforts to ensure diversity in STEM will weaken our economy and our national security,” she said.According to the lawsuit, the NSF has begun ending programs that support the participation of women, minorities, and people with disabilities in STEM fields.It also challenges a new rule that limits funding for indirect research costs, such as lab space and equipment, to 15 per cent of total grants. The lawsuit claims these actions go against long-standing Congressional goals, reported The New York Times.The NSF has supported broader participation in STEM since 1980, under direction from Congress. The foundation recently changed its policy priorities, removing support for diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.Days after the grant cancellations began, NSF director Sethuraman Panchanathan announced his resignation.As of Wednesday, more than 1,700 NSF research grants had been cancelled, totaling about $1.4 billion in cuts. One example in the lawsuit says the State University of New York could lose $18 million as a result.The NSF had a $9 billion budget for fiscal year 2024, but the Trump administration’s draft budget proposes cutting it by 55.8 per cent.In addition to New York, the other states joining the lawsuit include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin.","16 states, mostly controlled by Democrats, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Wednesday.

Trump is getting the military parade he wanted in his first term,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-is-getting-the-military-parade-he-wanted-in-his-first-term/articleshow/121477108.cms,"A member of the US Army 'Golden Knights' parachute team descends onto the Ellipse in front of the White House in Washington, July 4, 2020. (NYT)





WASHINGTON: In President Donald Trump's first term, the Pentagon opposed his desire for a military parade in Washington, wanting to keep the armed forces out of politics.But in Trump's second term, that guardrail has vanished. There will be a parade this year, and on the president's 79th birthday, no less.The current plan involves a tremendous scene in the center of Washington: 28 M1A1 Abrams tanks (at 70 tons each for the heaviest in service); 28 Stryker armored personnel carriers; more than 100 other vehicles; a World War II-era B-25 bomber; 6,700 soldiers; 50 helicopters; 34 horses; two mules; and a dog.But critics say it is another example of how Trump has politicized the military.The Army estimates the cost at $25 million to $45 million. But it could be higher because the Army has promised to fix any city streets that the parade damages, plus the cost of cleanup and police are not yet part of the estimate. While $45 million is a tiny fraction of Trump's proposed Pentagon budget of $1.01 trillion for fiscal year 2026, it comes as the administration seeks to slash funding for education, health and public assistance.""It's a lot of money,"" the Army spokesperson Steve Warren acknowledged. ""But I think that amount of money is dwarfed by 250 years of service and sacrifice by America's Army.""The Army is not calling the event a birthday parade for Trump. It is the Army's birthday parade. The Continental Army was officially formed on June 14, 1775, so June 14 will mark 250 years.That also happens to be Trump's birthday.There was no big parade in Washington back when the Army turned 200 in 1975, when Vietnam War scars were still raw. While smaller commemorations were held at Army bases around the country, complete with dinner dances, barbershop quartets and cake cutting, few people were looking to glorify the military so soon after the Kent State shootings. Besides, the country was gearing up for big bicentennial celebrations the next year.If things were going to be similarly low-key this time around, Fort Myer, across the Potomac in Arlington, Virginia, might be an ideal location, ""where the Old Guard could march with some veterans,"" said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the leading Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, in a reference to the 3rd Infantry Regiment, the Army's oldest active duty infantry unit.""But this is Trump,"" Reed added, speaking to reporters last week at the Defense Writers Group. ""It's consistent with so much of what he's doing.""Army officials say the parade will cross in front of Trump's viewing stand on Constitution Avenue, near the White House, on the evening of Saturday, June 14, part of a big bash on the National Mall.There will be marching troops who will be housed in two government buildings, officials say. They will sleep on military cots and bring their own sleeping bags, a topic of much merriment on late-night television.There will be Paladins, the huge self-propelled howitzers, and nods to vintage style. Army officials want to outfit some troops in uniforms from the wars of long ago, like the one in 1812 or the Spanish-American War.For more than two years, the Army has been planning national, global and even interstellar aspects of the celebration -- an Army astronaut on the International Space Station will be phoning in, Warren said.But those planned celebrations focused on festivals, a postal stamp, various fun runs, military bands and the like. At some point this year, Army officials said, a military parade in Washington appeared in the plans.Still, officials say there are no plans at the moment to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to Trump, or to the Army, during the parade. One plan does, however, call for paratroopers from the Golden Knights, the Army parachute team, to land amid the festivities and hand Trump a flag.In 2017 during his first term, Trump watched the Bastille Day parade in Paris with President Emmanuel Macron of France and returned home wanting his own. But the Trump 1.0 Pentagon shut him down. Jim Mattis, the defense secretary at the time, said he would ""rather swallow acid,"" according to ""Holding the Line,"" a book by Guy Snodgrass, Mattis' former speechwriter.""We're all aware in this country of the president's affection and respect for the military,"" Mattis said tersely when reporters asked about Trump's wishes. ""We have been putting together some options. We will send them up to the White House for decision.""Gen. Paul J. Selva, then the vice chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Trump during a meeting at the Pentagon that military parades were ""what dictators do,"" according to ""The Divider,"" by Peter Baker, a New York Times reporter, and Susan Glasser.When Mattis was gone, Trump brought up the idea again. Mattis' successor, Mark T. Esper, responded with an ""air parade"" as part of July 4 celebrations in 2020, Pentagon officials said. An array of fighter jets and other warplanes flew down the East Coast over cities that played roles in the American Revolution, including Boston, New York and Philadelphia.Officials in Trump's first Defense Department resisted his parade suggestion -- it was never a direct order -- because they viewed it as putting the military in the middle of politics, something the Pentagon historically has been loath to do.But now Trump has Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and military leaders who have been more willing to put his musings into action.This ""raises the question, 'Is the U.S. military celebrating Trump?'"" said Risa Brooks, an associate professor of political science at Marquette University.""Having tanks rolling down streets of the capital doesn't look like something consistent with the tradition of a professional, highly capable military,"" Brooks said in an interview. ""It looks instead like a military that is politicized and turning inwardly, focusing on domestic oriented adversaries instead of external ones.""There have been big American military parades in the past, but the last one was almost 35 years ago, to commemorate the end of the first Gulf War. Military parades in the United States have traditionally followed the end of major conflicts, such as the Civil War and the two World Wars. There were also military parades during three presidential inaugurations during the Cold War. And small-town festivities also sometimes commemorate the military with a few armored vehicles and troops.""I don't actually see the problem with a military parade,"" said Kori Schake, a former defense official in the George W. Bush administration who directs foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. Schake said more Americans need to see the troops who serve the country.""If seeing our fellow Americans in uniform encourages public knowledge and connection, or inspires volunteering, it would be beneficial,"" she said.At the end of the day, ""the military won't die on this hill even if they do not like it,"" said Peter Feaver, a political-science professor at Duke University who has studied the military for decades. ""Trump's 2.0 team is better at giving the president what he wants whether or not it is best in the long run.""",The Army estimates the cost at $25 million to $45 million.

Growing uncertainty for international students

Trump vs Harvad

'We’re treated as threats'





Secretary of state Marco Rubio announced on Wednesday that US will begin revoking visas of some Chinese students, ""including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. ”Rubio announced in a post on X, saying the state department would “aggressively” revoke visas. China is the second-largest source of international students in the US. During the 2023–2024 academic year, over 270,000 Chinese students were enrolled in UAS institutions, nearly a quarter of all international students.The announcement follows a series of actions this week that have added to growing uncertainty for international students. On Tuesday, Rubio suspended the scheduling of new visa interviews as the state department drafts stricter guidelines, including increased surveillance of students' social media activity.The crackdown has intensified concerns among international students, who are already facing pressure under US President Donald Trump’s administration. Critics have accused the administration of using national security as a pretext to reduce foreign student presence on US campuses.The visa revocations come just days after the Trump administration attempted to block Harvard University from enrolling any international students, a move now paused by a federal judge pending litigation. On Wednesday, Trump defended the effort, telling reporters, “Harvard should limit international student enrollment to around 15%. I want to make sure the foreign students are people that can love our country. ”The administration has already drawn backlash for earlier immigration actions, including the arrest and attempted deportation of students involved in pro-Palestine campus protests and the abrupt termination and later partial reinstatement of legal protections for thousands of international students.The evolving policies have left many students in limbo, worried not only about their visas but also about their safety and future in the US.“There’s a growing fear among us,” said one graduate student from China who asked not to be named. “We came here to learn and contribute. Now we’re treated as threats.”Universities, advocacy groups, and immigration experts have voiced concerns that these measures may deter top talent from coming to the US, eroding the country’s status as a global education hub.",Secretary of state Marco Rubio announced on Wednesday that US will begin revoking visas of some Chinese students.

'It's called negotiation': Trump denies 'chickening out' on tariffs when asked about TACO trade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/its-called-negotiation-trump-denies-chickening-out-on-tariffs-when-asked-about-taco-trade/articleshow/121474522.cms,"



US President Donald Trump has hit back at claims of regularly taking a step back on tariff threats, insisting that his moves are part of a strategic negotiation process rather than weakness.Trump took particular offence to the suggestion that he backs down after dramatic tariff announcements, a pattern known as the “TACO” trade, short for Trump Always Chickens Out, was coined by the Financial Times’ Robert Armstrong.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Trump was visibly annoyed when asked about the nickname, rejecting the idea outright.“You call that chickening out? It’s called negotiation,” he said, adding that he sets a “ridiculous high number and I go down a little bit, you know, a little bit.”The president defended his tactic of announcing steep import taxes, such as a 145 per cent tariff on Chinese goods, only to later reduce the figure, as happened recently when the rate was cut to 30 per cent during a 90-day negotiation window.A similar move came just last week, when Trump threatened a 50 per cent tariff on goods from the European Union starting in June, only to delay the increase to July 9. For now, the baseline 10 per cent tariff remains in place while talks continue.This strategy has become a hallmark of Trump’s trade approach, with similar episodes unfolding around cars, electronics and even his broad tariffs announced on 2 April, which were partially based on individual trade deficits with other nations.Each announcement has sent markets reeling, with stocks typically dipping on the threat of tariffs before recovering when Trump eases off. The S&P 500 index, for instance, fell as much as 15 per cent earlier this year before clawing back gains and was up slightly as of Wednesday afternoon.Despite the market swings and scepticism from economists, Trump claimed his methods have driven investment, saying they’ve led to $14 trillion in new investment in the United States, a figure that has yet to be fully backed by official data.“Don’t ever say what you said,” Trump warned the reporter who raised the “chickening out” claim.“To me, that’s the nastiest question.”He also argued that the EU wouldn’t be coming to the negotiating table without his aggressive stance, saying, that he usually have the opposite problem of being ""too tough.”","US President Donald Trump has hit back at claims of regularly taking a step back on tariff threats.

A fresh wave of suspected fake encounters in Balochistan has led to public anger, as rights activists accuse security forces of killing people in custody and staging the events to look like clashes.Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) on Monday claimed it had killed three militants in an operation in the Tang Kiryar area of Barkhan district. The bodies of Abdul Rehman Buzdar, Fareed Buzdar, and Sultan Marri were later shifted to the Basic Health Unit hospital in Rakni.However, the families of the deceased and Baloch rights groups strongly disputed the official account. They said all three had been missing for months, victims of enforced disappearance, and insisted the encounter was fake.The activists alleged that ""the men were executed after being kept in illegal detention.”A CTD spokesperson said that the men died during an exchange of fire and that weapons were recovered from the scene. But this version of events has been widely rejected.In a separate incident, another youth, Ghaus Bakhsh, was found dead in Awaran district’s Kolwah tehsil. He had reportedly been summoned to a nearby military camp, and his body was discovered just hours later, bearing visible signs of torture.This added to growing suspicions of custodial killings.The Balochistan Post reported both incidents, saying the deaths follow a pattern seen in other districts such as Dukki, Ziarat and Quetta. In those cases too, individuals who had previously gone missing later turned up dead in what were officially described as security operations.Human rights groups and Baloch activists say these cases point to a disturbing trend of state-led violence. They are calling for independent investigations and international attention to ensure accountability. “This is part of a systematic campaign,” said one rights campaigner. “There needs to be an end to the impunity,"" they added.",Rights activists accuse security forces of killing people in custody and staging the events to look like clashes.

While there have always been inducements for Islamic countries to establish ties with the Zionist regime, Pakistan has never been influenced by those inducements,” he added.This comes after Pakistan’s prime minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Tehran, the second stop of his four-country trip. He came from Turkiye and was welcomed by Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian at Saadabad Palace, where he received a guard of honour and held talks with the president.Khamenei also praised the long-standing friendly relations between Iran and Pakistan, highlighting Pakistan’s support during Iran’s war with Saddam Hussein.","Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called for strong unity among Muslim countries.

Poll Do you believe that climate change is contributing to extreme weather events in Pakistan? Yes No





At least 14 people were killed and more than 100 injured after powerful windstorms swept across central and northern Pakistan following a days-long heatwave, officials confirmed on Sunday.The storms, described as “particularly destructive” by authorities, battered the provinces of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa as well as Islamabad on Saturday afternoon and evening.Mazhar Hussain, spokesperson for the Punjab disaster management authority, was quoted by news agency AFP as saying, “This windstorm was particularly destructive. The wind speed was very high. There was so much dust in it that visibility was greatly reduced.”According to him, the extreme weather followed several days of intense heat, with temperatures exceeding 45°C. “There were three to four days in the recent heatwave where temperatures went up quite a lot,” he added, attributing the sudden storm to the intense build-up of heat.The majority of casualties were caused by collapsing roofs and walls, while at least two people died after being struck by solar panels dislodged by high-speed winds.In one tragic incident, lightning claimed the life of one man and injured three others.The storms uprooted trees, knocked over electric poles, and caused significant damage to vehicles and infrastructure. Social media was flooded with dramatic videos showing the aftermath, including a viral clip filmed inside a passenger plane struggling to land in Lahore before being diverted to Karachi amid severe turbulence.Islamabad and surrounding areas have also seen multiple unusual hailstorms over April and May, damaging vehicles and solar panels—marking a growing trend of erratic and extreme weather events in the country.Pakistan is widely recognised as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, with early summers and intense heatwaves becoming increasingly common.India is also battling extreme temperatures. According to news agency ANI, Rajasthan's Jaisalmer hit 48°C, forcing locals indoors. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) warned that severe heatwave conditions will continue in Rajasthan until May 27 and in Punjab, Haryana, and Jammu and Kashmir until May 26.Meanwhile, heavy monsoon rainfall has already arrived on India’s west coast, with IMD forecasting intense downpours over Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Goa in the coming week.Back in Pakistan, the Meteorological Department has predicted more storms on Sunday, raising concerns about further damage and casualties.","Powerful windstorms swept across central and northern Pakistan following a days- long heatwave.

Poll Do you believe that the assassination of journalists in Balochistan is a systematic issue? Yes, it is a systematic issue. No, it's an isolated incident.





Abdul Latif Baloch, a well-known journalist in Pakistan's Balochistan province, was shot dead inside his home in Mashkay, in the wee hours of Saturday.The Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), a local rights group, confirmed that he was shot by state-backed armed groups at around 3 am, in front of his wife and children, reported news agency ANI.Latif was respected for his fearless coverage of human rights abuses and military operations in Balochistan. His work focused on enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and the struggle of ordinary Baloch citizens. His death underlines the extreme risk faced by reporters in Pakistan.This incident comes just months after his son, Saif Baloch, and seven other family members were reportedly abducted by security forces and later found dead. Activists describe these patterns of violence as part of Pakistan’s “kill and dump” policy, used to silence dissent and suppress the Baloch identity.Shalee Baloch of the Baloch Women Forum described the killing as part of “systemic violence” against the Baloch people. She urged international organisations and media to intervene, saying silence from the global community is enabling further bloodshed.Human rights groups and press freedom organisations have condemned the assassination and are calling for urgent international pressure on Pakistan with regard to Balochistan. The region has been the site of persistent and grave human rights violations, including enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and the suppression of dissenting voices.","Abdul Latif Baloch, a well-known journalist in Pakistan's Balochistan province, was shot dead inside his home in Mashkay.

Jailed former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has ruled out any negotiations with Pakistan's civilian government, declaring that only talks with the country’s military establishment are meaningful.In a post on X, Khan said, “Engaging in any talks with the puppet Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government is pointless. This illegitimate Form-47 installed government has already wasted two months. Its only objective is to cling to false authority. It holds no real power.”Khan, who has been behind bars since August 2023 in multiple cases following the collapse of his government in April 2022, stressed that negotiations would only be held with those who actually “hold power”, the military establishment, and only in the national interest.“I do not fear hardship as my resolve remains strong,” he said, while alleging that political cases, abductions, and forced press conferences were being used to dismantle his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. “All prove that the rule of law has been entirely dismantled. What we now have is the law of the jungle,” he added.Reiterating his stance from earlier this week, Khan stated that May 9, 2023, the day of violent protests after his arrest, was a “false flag operation” designed to crush PTI.“No CCTV footage has been presented to this day... The truth will be evident to all if the CCTV footage of that day is made public,” he added, as reported by news agency PTI.In a separate post, Khan also dismissed media reports suggesting that a deal was in the works with the military. “No one has approached me for any negotiations. News claiming otherwise is entirely false,” he said, adding that despite harsh jail conditions, including denial of access to his children and physician, he remains steadfast.He recently took a swipe at Army chief General Asim Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, saying “it might have been more fitting to give him the title of ‘King’ instead, because right now, the country is ruled by the law of the jungle. And in the jungle, there is only one king,” as per PTI.Meanwhile, the Punjab government said Khan has refused to undergo polygraph and voice analysis tests in 12 terrorism cases linked to the May 9 riots for the third consecutive time.Pakistani Punjab’s information minister Azma Bokhari accused Khan of defying court orders, saying he made repeated excuses to avoid the tests. “He must understand this is Adiala Jail, not his Bani Gala residence,” she said.The trial in the GHQ attack case, which was last heard in February, has been adjourned again until May 29. Separately, the hearing in the Toshakhana-II case was postponed to May 26.Khan’s party has also urged the Islamabad High Court to speed up hearings in the Al-Qadir Trust case involving Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi. Protests continue outside the court, with party members demanding Khan’s release and denouncing what they call “unjust incarceration.”",Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has ruled out any negotiations with Pakistan's civilian government.

Sindhudesh as an independent nation: JSMM demands UN recognition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/sindhudesh-as-an-independent-nation-jsmm-demands-un-recognition/articleshow/121359382.cms,".

The Sindhudesh Global Freedom Charter





The Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), a Sindhi nationalist group led by exiled chairman Shafi Burfat, has issued a renewed plea to the United Nations and other international communities, urging recognition of Sindhudesh as an independent nation and calling attention to what it describes as sustained political repression and human rights violations in Pakistan ’s Sindh province.In a comprehensive political manifesto titled, JSMM has approached the United Nations, international human rights bodies, democratic governments, and global civil society organizations, arguing that the Sindhi people are subject to a form of internal colonialism under Pakistan’s military and political establishment.In a direct appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian public, JSMM cited historical and cultural ties between Sindh and India, requesting moral and political solidarity. The group also called on international institutions to send human rights observers, document alleged violations, and engage with Sindh’s demand for peaceful self-determination.JSMM alleges that demographic engineering through state-sponsored resettlement has diluted Sindh’s ethnic composition, threatening the linguistic and cultural identity of the Sindhi people. Environmental degradation, particularly the diversion of the Indus river’s waters, has compounded local grievances, with widespread desertification of once-fertile lands cited as an ecological consequence of state policy.The statement firmly condemned Pakistan's security forces for committing serious human rights abuses in Sindh, including enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings of political activists, journalists, and student leaders. It mentioned that anti-terrorism legislation is being misused to target secular and nationalist movements, whereas religious extremists receive support from the state.Positioning itself as a secular, democratic movement, JSMM has reiterated its vision for a sovereign Republic of Sindhudesh, grounded in principles of equality, minority protections, and social justice. The group invokes international law including the United Nations Charter and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to support Sindh’s right to self-determination.Long before modern borders were drawn, Sindh flourished as the heart of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation which was a sophisticated urban society that emerged over 5,000 years ago along the banks of the Indus river. With advanced city planning, intricate craftsmanship, and a vibrant mercantile culture, Sindh was once a beacon of early human progress. Mohenjo-daro, one of the civilisation’s most iconic sites, still stands as a testament to the region’s intellectual and architectural legacy. This deep-rooted historical identity is central to the Sindhi nationalist narrative, which views contemporary political struggles as a continuation of a civilisational arc interrupted by colonial conquests and post partition state formation.I n the colonial era, Sindh existed as a distinct administrative region under British India before being annexed, and eventually was re-established as a separate province in 1936. Advocates for Sindhi autonomy argue that this period fostered a unique political consciousness, one that emphasised cultural plurality and regional pride. The Partition of 1947, however, redrew not just boundaries but identities. Over subsequent decades, Sindhi activists have pointed to a pattern of political marginalisation and centralised control, arguing that their historical autonomy has been systematically pulled apart.Framing Sindh’s struggle as both civilizational and contemporary, the charter situated the region within the historical legacy of the Indus valley civilization, asserting that Sindh was forced into joining Pakistan in 1947 and has since faced cultural erasure and economic exploitation. The document claims that Sindh's resources including oil, gas, coal, fertile farmland, and deep-sea ports have been systematically extracted to benefit other regions, while the local population remains economically marginalized.While JSMM’s claims are politically charged and remain unacknowledged by the Pakistani state, the charter marks a significant step in internationalizing what has largely been a domestic conflict.","The Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), a Sindhi nationalist group led by exiled chairman Shafi Burfat, has issued a renewed plea to the United Nations and other international communities.

Tens of thousands of students and youths from a leading Bangladeshi political party rallied in the capital, Dhaka, on Wednesday, calling for a general election in December as discontent grows with the interim government appointed after the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August.Activists from three groups linked to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, or BNP, headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia gathered on the streets outside its party headquarters, under heightened security.Wednesday's rally was held after weeks of political tensions after interim leader and Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus threatened to quit and the influential military chief publicly declared his support for an election in December.Zia, who has been suffering from ill-health for several years, recently returned to Bangladesh after four months of medical treatment in London, putting further pressure on Bangladesh's interim government to call an election.""We have come here to respond to the call for the unity of the young people. We want democracy, we want election. Next election should be held soon, not later than December,"" Jahangir Hossain, a student activist, told The Associated Press.""We are united for democracy.""Hasina, Zia's archrival, has been in exile in India since she was toppled last year by a mass uprising. Her party, the Awami League, was also banned by the interim government.The BNP's acting chairman, Tarique Rahman, Zia's elder son, addressed the rally later on Wednesday by video link from London, where he is in exile.Detailing his party's future plans for youth and others, Rahman reiterated his call for the next elections to be held in December and asked his supporters to prepare.""The polls must be held by December. It has to take place within December,"" he said.The interim government has been shaken by a series of protests, including by civil servants, primary school teachers and employees at the national revenue service in recent weeks. Many, including New York-based Human Rights Watch, accuse the government of failures in prosecuting organized crime figures responsible for killing and injuring hundreds of people. The rights group in a statement this month blamed the interim administration for legislative initiatives that undermine fundamental freedoms,Business bodies have also criticized Yunus over the weakness of the economy and labor unrest.When Yunus came to power, he promised to make reforms in areas including the election law, women's rights and general administration, but the process has been slow and his critics believe he is using delaying tactics to remain in power.The 10 months of rule under Yunus also marked a visible rise of influence by Islamists in the Muslim-majority country, which is governed largely by a secular constitution and legal system. A fatigued military, which has been out of barracks since July last year to maintain law and order, is unhappy because of the delay in returning to democracy.The BNP recently met with Yunus and reiterated its demand for an election in December, saying that if Yunus quits, the country will find an alternative leader. But Yunus' associates later said he was staying.Yunus promised to hold an election by June 2026, depending on the extent of reforms it has undertaken. The BNP, which is hopeful of forming the next government with the absence of Hasina's Awami League, said the pace of implementation of reforms should not be an excuse to delay the election and argued that the reform is a continuous process.","Bangladesh's interim government has been shaken by a series of protests in recent weeks.

Bangladesh’s supreme court on Tuesday overturned the conviction of ATM Azharul Islam, a senior leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami party, who had been on death row since 2014. The court ordered his immediate release, ending a legal battle that had spanned over a decade.Islam, who has been in custody since 2012, was originally convicted for crimes against humanity, including charges of rape, murder, and genocide during Bangladesh’s 1971 independence war from Pakistan. The conviction was delivered under the administration of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina , whose 15-year tenure ended last year amid widespread protests and her subsequent exile.The Jamaat-e-Islami party, of which Islam is a senior leader, had opposed Bangladesh’s independence and was aligned with Pakistani forces during the war, a role that remains a point of national sensitivity and political division in Bangladesh.Following his conviction, Islam appealed in front of the court multiple times. His lawyer, Shishir Monir, highlighted the acquittal as a form of justice, contrasting Islam’s fate with that of five other senior leaders from Jamaat-e-Islami and the Bangladesh National Party (BNP), who had been executed after their convictions. “He got justice because he is alive,” Monir said, noting that the Supreme Court’s appellate division had previously failed to adequately review evidence in other cases.During Hasina’s tenure, Jamaat-e-Islami was banned from political participation, and its leaders faced intensified legal scrutiny. The administration’s crackdown on the party was widely seen as an effort to address long-standing grievances related to the 1971 war and to diminish political opposition.Sheikh Hasina, now in self-imposed exile in India following the revolt last year, has been accused by the interim government and opposition groups of authoritarian tendencies. Her Awami League party was banned as part of the political upheaval that brought a transitional government to power, which has pledged to hold national elections by June 2026.Tuesday’s court ruling has reignited political debate in Bangladesh, with Jamaat-e-Islami supporters celebrating the release of their leader.

Who is Kami Rita? Nepal's Sherpa who broke his own record with 31st Everest summit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/who-is-kami-rita-nepals-sherpa-who-broke-his-own-record-with-31st-everest-summit/articleshow/121428623.cms,"Kami Rita (PTI)

Who is Kami Rita, Nepal’s own Everest Man?

Rita’s mountaineering journey dates back to 1992 when he joined an expedition to Everest as a support staff member.



His father was also among the first Sherpa guides.



In a successful mountaineering career spanning from 1994 to 2025, Rita has ascended the Everest, K2, Cho Oyu, Lhotse, and Manaslu.



He scaled Everest for the first time in 1994, and ever since then, he has stood on top of the 8,849-meter summit almost every year.



Over the past two years, Rita has summited Mt. Everest 30 times, achieving this by climbing it twice each season.



According to AP, Rita had vowed to climb the summit for the 31st and even a possible 32nd time before this expedition.







Dubbed as the “Everest man”, Nepal’s Kami Rita, 55, has successfully scaled the world’s highest mountain for the 31st time. Rita broke his own record on Tuesday, more than thirty years after he ascended his first summit.According to Mingma Sherpa of Seven Summit Treks based in Kathmandu, Rita was in good health and reached the summit at around 4 am under stable weather conditions.""This new feat cements his status as the record holder for the highest number of ascents to the top of the world - a record that no one else has come close to,"" said Mingma as reported by Kathmandu Post.Kami Rita was the guide for the Indian Army Adventure Wing Everest Expedition, which was led by Lieutenant Colonel Manoj Joshi.Every year, hundreds of climbers attempt to scale Mt. everest from Nepal’s side. This season itself, Nepal has issued more than 1,100 permits for mountaineers, including 458 for just Everest.Everest's summit was first reached by New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Nepal’s Tenzing Norgay Sherpa in 1953.","Nepal's Kami Rita, 55, has successfully scaled the world's highest mountain for the 31st time.

COLOMBO: Debt-stricken Sri Lanka hosted one of New Zealand's top ministers to discuss ways to deepen bilateral ties in areas such as trade, tourism and agriculture.Winston Peters, New Zealand's deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister, met Sri Lanka's foreign affairs minister Vijitha Herath in the capital, Colombo, on Monday. The five-day visit by Peters is scheduled to continue until WednesdayThe visit comes as Sri Lanka struggles to emerge from its worst economic crisis, which began in the Indian Ocean island nation three years ago.The countries have improved relations in recent years, establishing a New Zealand embassy in Colombo in 2021 and a Sri Lankan embassy in Wellington this year.The discussion Monday focused on advancing ties in trade, investment, agriculture, education, and tourism, Herath said.""We also explored expanding trade links in high-potential sectors such as dairy, processed food, fresh produce and discussed improving market access for Sri Lankan products,"" Herath told reporters.He commended New Zealand's support in developing Sri Lanka's dairy industry, saying it had a ""transformational impact on rural livelihood.""Sri Lanka has embarked on an effort to expand and modernize its domestic dairy industry in recent years, but still produces only about 40% of the country's demand for milk and dairy products, while the balance is imported.New Zealand is a key supplier of those dairy products, especially milk powder.In 2024, New Zealand exported $335 million in goods to Sri Lanka, with dairy products forming the bulk.Trade balance between the nations favors New Zealand, which in 2024 imported goods worth $64 million from Sri Lanka, including tea, coffee, apparel and rubber products.The discussion included reducing red tape at the border and how to ""increase Sri Lanka's market access capabilities,"" Peters said.""We discussed the growing number of New Zealand companies working with and investing in Sri Lanka or looking to work with Sri Lankan partners,"" said Peters, adding that those collaborations will benefit Sri Lanka's tourism, agriculture and healthcare sectors.Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy in April 2022 with more than $83 billion in debt, more than half to foreign creditors. It sought the help of the International Monetary Fund, which approved a $2.9 billion, four-year bailout package in 2023 under which Sri Lanka was required to restructure its debt.In September last year, Sri Lanka said it had concluded the debt restructuring process after reaching agreements with bilateral and multilateral creditors and private bondholders. Sri Lanka is seeking to obtain $17 billion in debt service relief.Sri Lanka's crisis was largely the result of economic mismanagement combined with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, along with 2019 terrorism attacks that devastated its important tourism industry. The pandemic also disrupted the flow of remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad.","Winston Peters, New Zealand's deputy prime minister, met Sri Lanka's foreign affairs minister.

They inhaled a gas and scaled Everest in days. Is it the future of mountaineering?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/they-inhaled-a-gas-and-scaled-everest-in-days-is-it-the-future-of-mountaineering/articleshow/121451558.cms,"Photo/Agencies

With xenon, 'you feel better.'

The use of the gas is 'against climbing ethics.'





Climbing Mount Everest typically takes weeks, with most of that time spent at the foot of the mountain adjusting to the thin air. But four British men last week shrank that timeline dramatically, traveling from London to the summit and back in less than a week, according to the organizer of their expedition.They skipped the adjustment period, in part, by inhaling a secret weapon: xenon gas.Their feat has roiled the world of mountaineering and prompted an investigation by the Nepalese government, as use of the gas is fiercely debated. Some research has shown that xenon can quickly acclimatize people to high altitudes, even as some experts say the benefits, if any, are negligible and the side effects of its use remain unclear.Organizers said the gas was key to the speed of the climb, but their approach has prompted a broader debate that strikes at the core of mountaineering: Should scaling Mount Everest , one of sporting's greatest accomplishments, be made easier -- available to more people during a quick vacation -- with the help of a performance enhancer?""It is a provocation, especially for traditional mountaineers, who feel bad about this idea that you can climb Everest in less than a week,"" Lukas Furtenbach, who organized the exhibition, said in a phone interview from the base of the mountain.""This showed that it can work.""Furtenbach said that beginning in 2026 he planned to offer two-week round-trip excursions to Mount Everest using xenon gas, cutting the typical time needed to scale the mountain by several weeks.""This can be the future of commercially guided mountaineering on Mount Everest,"" he said.For those who live at lower elevations and have traveled to the mountains, the discomfort of altitude sickness is all too clear. Symptoms include nausea, headaches and disrupted sleep, and in some cases it can lead to brain swelling or even death.As you go higher, less oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream with each breath. That is why so many people who climb Everest use supplemental oxygen.Xenon, an odorless gas, has been known for years to activate a molecule called the hypoxia-inducible factor, which is also turned on when people acclimate to low oxygen, said Hugh Montgomery, a professor of intensive care medicine at University College London and a mountaineer who led an expedition to Mount Everest to study how humans respond to low oxygen.""So what these people claim to have done,"" he said, ""is basically found a way to switch on the adaptation to low oxygen levels.""The group took what was known from medical science, he said, ""and have now applied it, recreationally, to sport mountaineering.""Montgomery said scientists were still unsure how xenon triggers this response.While some doctors have used the gas in the past to ""precondition"" patients to low oxygen levels -- for example, before major heart surgery -- the practice hasn't really caught on because ""it hasn't been as protective as one would hope,"" he said.Mike Shattock, a professor of cellular cardiology at King's College London, said ""xenon probably does very little, and there is virtually no reputable scientific evidence that it makes any difference.""Experts cautioned that self-medicating with xenon, which has the effects of anesthesia, could lead to overdose or death, and more study was needed to understand how the gas works and its use in mountaineering.On Mount Everest, the weeks of training and acclimation on the lower levels of the mountain are typically required to survive the ""death zone,"" the area above 26,000 feet where the air is particularly thin.The British group, which included four former special forces members, took a different approach.About 10 weeks before the expedition, the men began sleeping in hypoxic tents, which lower oxygen levels in the air and gradually acclimatized the hikers to conditions on Mount Everest, Furtenbach said.While hypoxic tents have been used by some climbers for years, the big innovation for the British expedition came two weeks before the excursion, when the men flew to Limburg, Germany, outside Frankfurt, where a doctor, Michael Fries, had been experimenting with inhaled gases in his clinic.The men wore masks hooked up to ventilators as an anesthesiologist slowly introduced higher levels of xenon into their systems.Furtenbach, who has tried xenon gas on his own mountaineering trips since 2020, said that after the treatment, users experienced enhanced breathing and the sensation of more lung volume, and ""when you do your workout or training, you feel better.""After arriving at the base of Everest, the British group climbed to the summit in less than three days, which Furtenbach said was one of the fastest times for a group that hadn't acclimatized on the mountain. (According to the Nepalese government, the record for the fastest climb overall is held by Lakpa Gelu, a Sherpa, who reached the top of the mountain in just under 11 hours.)The rapid climb by the British expedition and the use of the gas caught the eye of the Nepalese government, and the fallout has been swift.Himal Gautam, director of Nepal's tourism department, which is responsible for regulating expeditions on the nation's mountains, said in an interview that using the gas was ""against climbing ethics,"" and that it would hurt the country's tourism industry and the Sherpas who help climbers by reducing their time on the mountain.Gautam said his department was looking into the use of the gas by the British climbers, one of whom, Alistair Carns, is also a member of Parliament.In an interview, Carns said that his expedition had been in touch with the ministry and clarified with the department that it had not taken the gas on the mountain.He added that many people who want to climb Mount Everest don't have the time to spend multiple weeks acclimating.""The reality is if I had six to eight weeks to climb Everest, I would, but I'm a government minister, and I don't have time,"" he said. ""What we've done is we've proven that you can reduce the timeline safely.""Others in the mountaineering community have warned against the use of the gas.In January, the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation, a global network that promotes and protects the sport, released a statement that said there was no evidence that xenon gas improved performance, adding that ""inappropriate use can be dangerous.""The federation noted that xenon has been on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of banned substances since 2014 and is not approved in all countries.""From a medical point of view, off-label use without a scientific basis and with unknown health risks must be rejected,"" the statement said.Furtenbach argued that his expeditions were still using Sherpas -- five accompanied the British climbers to the summit -- and that shorter times on the mountain were safer, as they reduce the chance that climbers will be exposed to other health threats, including avalanches, hypothermia or falls.He said the prohibition of the gas by the World Anti-Doping Agency didn't apply to mountaineering because it is not a regulated competitive sport.Use of the gas gets at a core question about why people climb mountains in the first place, Montgomery said.""Is it really a good idea that we can all have what we want, when we want, as quick as we want?"" he asked. ""Are we missing out on the sacrifice you sometimes have to make to get the achievement?""""I'm not a critic,"" he added. ""But maybe just bagging every hill at speed means you miss out on the joy you could have had.""","Xenon gas can quickly acclimatize people to high altitudes, some research shows. Some experts say the benefits, if any, are negligible and the side effects of its use remain unclear. Four British men last week traveled from London to the summit and back in less than a week.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121451579,imgsize-856938,width-400,resizemode-4/121451579.jpg"

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

The first was in June 2023 and focused on Robinson promoting a film called Silenced, which included defamatory claims. It was also pinned to the top of his X profile and shared in interviews. The second was filed in August and concerned Robinson playing the film at a rally in Trafalgar Square and included six further breaches.





Far-right activist Tommy Robinson was released early from prison on Tuesday after a high court judge reduced his sentence for contempt of court by four months.Robinson's real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. He was serving an 18-month jail term for breaching a court order that barred him from repeating false allegations about a Syrian refugee. The 42-year-old left HMP Woodhill in Buckinghamshire on Tuesday, after the court accepted that he had shown a “change in attitude” and taken steps to comply with the injunction.In October 2024, Robinson was sentenced to 18 months—14 months as punishment and four months as a coercive measure to push him to follow a 2021 injunction. That injunction followed a successful libel case by Jamal Hijazi, a schoolboy Robinson falsely accused online of attacking girls, despite a viral video in 2018 showing Hijazi being assaulted.Although the sentencing judge noted Robinson showed “no remorse or contrition”, Mr Justice Jeremy Johnson ruled last week that the coercive part of the sentence had served its purpose.After the release, Robinson appeared visibly changed, with longer hair and a beard.In a video shared on his X account, he gave an assurance that he would not repeat the allegations.“He has given an assurance that he will comply with the injunction in the future, that he has no intention of breaching it again,” said Justice Johnson. “I consider it appropriate to grant the application.”The Solicitor General brought two contempt cases against Robinson after he ignored the high court’s order.In total, he admitted to ten breaches of the injunction. The court heard Robinson’s behaviour had led to a campaign of abuse against Hijazi and forced the teenager’s family to move house for their safety, reports the Independent.Despite previously fleeing the country to avoid legal consequences, Robinson returned and was taken into custody in October 2024.Robinson's legal team argued that he had removed much of the offending content and no longer intended to defy the injunction. The judge accepted this, but warned that any future breaches could land him back in prison for up to two years.Contempt of court, though classified as a civil offence, can still lead to criminal penalties such as imprisonment. It typically involves behaviour that disrupts the legal process, like breaching reporting restrictions or sharing material that could affect active cases. In Robinson’s case, the offences stemmed from defying a legal reporting ban, rather than any direct attempt to influence the outcome of a trial.",Far-right activist Tommy Robinson was released early from prison on Tuesday.

Court decision follows legal application to purge contempt

Controversial figure remains divisive

Robinson thanks Elon Musk





British TV channels interrupted their regular broadcast on Tuesday morning after Tommy Robinson was released from prison four months early.Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was jailed for 18 months for contempt of court after repeatedly breaching a 2021 injunction. The injunction had been granted to prevent him from making false claims against a Syrian refugee, who later won a libel case against him.GB News presenter Eamonn Holmes told viewers: “Tommy Robinson has been released from jail, that is four months early. He was originally jailed for 18 months for contempt of court after multiple breaches of an injunction, that was four years ago, but reportedly showed a ""change in attitude.”“He was originally due to be released on July 26,"" he added.Robinson looked visibly changed in his first public appearance since his release, sporting a thick beard and appearing older. Social media quickly reacted to the images, with many saying he was “unrecognisable.”Robinson’s early release came after a legal request to purge his contempt of court charge.His lawyers told the high court he had demonstrated a “commitment” to complying with the injunction. This commitment included refraining from repeating defamatory statements about the Syrian teenager.Although progress had been made, Justice Johnson said Robinson still showed “no real remorse or contrition.” Even so, he noted there had been a “change in attitude” since sentencing, which helped justify cutting the sentence.Lawyers representing the Solicitor General did not oppose the move, saying Robinson had taken necessary steps to follow the terms of the court order.Robinson remains one of the UK’s most controversial political figures. He co-founded the far-right English Defence League in 2009 and has faced multiple legal issues since. His supporters have often claimed he is unfairly targeted by the establishment, while critics have long denounced his inflammatory rhetoric and criminal record.His release will likely reignite debate over freedom of speech, contempt of court, and the limits of public discourse. The very issues Robinson himself has often used as rallying cries.Following Robinson's release, the reaction online was swift and polarised. Supporters celebrated his release, while critics questioned the decision and the message it might send.Tommy Robinson thanked Elon Musk as he was released early. Robinson said, ""I have to say a thank you to Elon Musk, because without X, if we didn't have X, everyone would just think I lied. No one would have got any other narrative."" Musk has shown support for Robinson, calling for his release and saying he was jailed ""for telling the truth.""Robinson is seen very differently by people. His supporters view him as a free speech martyr who tells the truth. However, his opponents call him a convicted fraudster who spreads lies and false information.","Tommy Robinson was released from prison four months early.

'Abundance of caution'



Passengers recount horror incident, call 'scary'







An aircraft travelling from Birmingham to Jersey passenger aircraft was forced to perform an emergency landing shortly after departure due to a ""technical issue"" affecting one of its engines.The Blue Islands aircraft, with capacity for approximately 70 passengers, departed at 15:00 BST on Sunday before returning to Birmingham Airport, successfully landing despite strong winds.The airline's representative confirmed their engineers were examining the aircraft, emphasising that passenger, crew and aircraft safety remained their top priority, BBC reported.The affected passengers received accommodation and meals for the night.The airline's official statement confirmed the crew followed standard protocols, with passengers disembarking normally.The crew received a cockpit alert indicating a ""technical issue"" and followed procedures by shutting down the engine preventively.They clarified that the engine remained under control throughout the incident.A company representative stated: ""These procedures have an abundance of caution built into them to ensure passenger safety.""Birmingham Airport confirmed one flight diversion, with no additional runway restrictions implemented.Leanne Rowe, travelling with family for holiday, attempted to calm her children whilst feeling uncertain herself.She stated: ""It was pretty scary - straight from the start it was quite rocky...""My daughter was quite upset about it... at some point in the air the captain said to us that we were going to turn around because there was a problem with the engine.""You don't really know how serious that is.""She noted fire engines were present upon landing. Lauren York described the landing as ""very worrying."" York mentioned her 20-month-old son remained asleep throughout. She said: ""When we touched ground and we were swerving all over the place, that was really frightening.""We were just holding on to him thinking are we going to make it? It was very worrying.""Sarah Brown praised the pilot's handling of the situation, despite the frightening experience.She said: ""We knew we'd get here safely in the end."" She noted that afterwards her children ""got to go in the cockpit, meet both the pilots, so they had an experience"".The AAIB decided not to investigate further after reviewing the incident.","The Blue Islands aircraft was travelling from Birmingham to Jersey.

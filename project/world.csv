The Pentagon is urging Japan and Australia to clarify what role they would play if the US and China went to war over Taiwan, the Financial Times reported on Saturday. Elbridge Colby, the US under-secretary of defence for policy, has been pushing the matter during recent talks with defence officials of both countries, the report said, citing people familiar with the discussions.According to the newspaper, the reported request caught both Tokyo and Canberra off guard, as the US itself does not offer a blank cheque guarantee to defend Taiwan.Colby said in an X post that the department of defence is focused on implementing the president’s “America First” common sense agenda of restoring deterrence and achieving peace through strength, which “includes by urging allies to step up their defence spending and other efforts related to our collective defence.”The US is Taiwan’s most important arms supplier, despite a lack of formal diplomatic ties.REUTERS","The Pentagon is urging Japan and Australia to clarify what role they would play if the US and China went to war over Taiwan.

ICE barred from racial profiling in Los Angeles sweeps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ice-barred-from-racial-profiling-in-los-angeles-sweeps/articleshow/122414067.cms,"Representative image





A federal judge in Los Angeles issued a temporary order barring US immigration authorities from stopping people for questioning without cause, the latest fallout from the Trump administration's controversial crackdown on migrants.A temporary restraining order sought by a group of Southern California residents, workers and advocacy groups was granted Friday by US district judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong.The judge barred agents in the Los Angeles area from stopping and questioning individuals without reasonable suspicion that they're in the US illegally. The order forbids the agents from basing their suspicion on race, ethnicity, speaking Spanish, speaking English with an accent, the type of the work they do or where they are located.Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the department of homeland security, said ""a district judge is undermining the will of the Americans.""The groups argued that officials ""must have an objective, particularized basis"" to believe that a person is in the US illegally before they can stop them and require they answer questions. To do otherwise, they alleged, amounts to illegal racial profiling.","US district judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong grants temporary restraining order.

ADF attack: 66 people killed in Congo; UN spokesperson describes it as 'bloodbath',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/adf-attack-66-people-killed-in-congo-un-spokesperson-describes-it-as-bloodbath/articleshow/122413966.cms,"Representative Image (AI-generated)





At least 66 people have been killed in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo by rebels linked to the Islamic State group, local officials said on Saturday.Fighters from the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), an Islamist group with ties to IS, attacked civilians in the Irumu area of Ituri province, which borders Uganda. The attack comes as eastern Congo may see an end to its ongoing war with the M23 rebel group, which is backed by neighbouring country Rwanda.Jean Tobie Okala, spokesperson for the United Nations mission in Ituri, described the attack as a “bloodbath.”“Around 30 civilians were killed between Thursday and Friday, July 11, in the Walese Vonkutu chiefdom, Irumu territory, in Ituri,” Okala said, as reported by news agency AP.""Based on information from civil society, the death toll has risen from 31 to 66 civilians killed,” he added.The ADF is a Ugandan Islamist group that operates on both sides of the porous border. Marcel Paluku, president of a local civil society group, said all of the victims including women were killed with machetes. The number of people taken hostage remains unknown.Officials suspect the attack was in retaliation for a recent bombing campaign by joint Congolese and Ugandan forces that began on Sunday.In recent years, ADF attacks have intensified along the border with Uganda and have spread toward Goma, the main city in eastern Congo, as well as the neighbouring Ituri province. Rights groups and the United Nations have accused the ADF of killing hundreds of people and abducting many more, including large numbers of children.","Fighters from the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), an Islamist group with ties to IS, attacked civilians in the Irumu area of Ituri province, which borders Uganda.

US state department layoffs: Trump administration orders workforce reduction; over 1300 employees affected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-state-department-layoffs-trump-administration-orders-workforce-reduction-over-1300-employees-affected/articleshow/122398722.cms,"The headquarters of the Department of State (AP image)





The US State Department on Friday (local time) laid off more than 1,300 employees as part of the Trump administration’s latest move to cut its American workforce by about 15%. This is part of a broader effort to reorganize the department.According to a notice sent to State department employees, the layoffs include 1107 civil service employees and 246 foreign service officers. Overall, nearly 3000 people are expected to leave.The department is also rearranging the organizational structure of staff. These layoffs, officially called a “reduction-in-force” or RIF, have been planned for months. Officials sent the reorganization plan to Congress in March, saying the cuts were necessary to remove duplicate offices and focus on the department’s core responsibilities.However, critics argue the cuts will hurt the State Department’s ability to work. All Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday opposing the layoffs.""During a time of increasingly complex and wide-spread challenges to U.S. national security, this administration should be strengthening our diplomatic corps—an irreplaceable instrument of U.S. power and leadership—not weakening it,"" the senators wrote.""However, RIFs would severely undermine the Department's ability to achieve U.S. foreign policy interests, putting our nation's security, strength, and prosperity at risk,"" the letter added, as reported by news agency CBS.Foreign service officers who received layoff notices will leave their jobs in 120 days, while civil service employees will depart in 60 days.The long planned layoffs began just days after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration’s broader plan to slash the size of government workforce, overruling a lower court's order that halted layoff plans at dozens of federal agencies.Department staff were notified about the upcoming layoffs on Thursday afternoon in a message from Deputy Secretary of State Michael Rigas, who thanked departing staff ""for their dedication and service to the United States.""Some employees were instructed that because of the planned layoffs, they would not be allowed to work remotely on Friday. They were told to report to the office with all department-issued items, including laptops, phones, diplomatic passports, travel cards and other government property. An email explained that badges would be collected during the checkout process and reminded staff to gather any personal belongings beforehand.Diplomats and other staff applauded departing colleagues in emotional scenes at the State Department’s Washington headquarters that runs US foreign policy and embassies around the world.The American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), the union representing State Department employees, criticized the move as a “catastrophic blow to our national interests.”""At a moment of great global instability -- with war raging in Ukraine, conflict between Israel and Iran, and authoritarian regimes testing the boundaries of international order -- the United States has chosen to gut its frontline diplomatic workforce,"" AFSA said in a statement.""We oppose this decision in the strongest terms,"" the statement added.","US State Department laid off more than 1,300 employees as part of the Trump administration’s latest move to cut its American workforce by about 15%.

The O'Keefe Media Group has released an audio featuring Rami Hassan, deputy senior National Intelligence Officer at the FBI, in which he is admitting that law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, may have mishandled the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.The leaked audio recording comes amid tensions between law enforcement and political figures over the Justice Department’s decision to officially close the Epstein case.“I’m with FBI. It’s a shit show, it's just messy, like, you can see where law enforcement kind of either turned a blind eye or like missed things (on Epstein) and there’s an opportunity just from like hearing and listening,” Hassan said in the audio.“They (FBI) were trying to release some of the files, like the White House was,” he added.Hassan also mentioned that the White House was planning to release documents related to the case and that right-wing influencers were being invited to help publicize the material.“They even invited some of the influencers, right wing bloggers and to release the files, that seems a little weird. Just release it online,” said Hassan.A joint memo released last week by the DOJ and FBI concluded that Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide and found no evidence of foul play.

Russia’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov visited North Korea on Saturday, and warned the United States, South Korea, and Japan against forming a security alliance aimed at Moscow's ally.Lavrov met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the eastern coastal city of Wonsan, delivering greetings from Russian President Vladimir Putin. During the meeting, Kim reaffirmed North Korea’s full support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, saying both Moscow and Pyongyang shared “identical views on all strategic issues in conformity with the level of alliance,” according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).Lavrov also called for greater “strategic and tactical cooperation” between Russia and North Korea, and highlighted their alignment on international affairs. He also accused the US, South Korea, and Japan of escalating military pressure on North Korea.“We warn against exploiting these ties to build alliances directed against anyone, including North Korea and, of course, Russia,” he said, according to Russia's state Tass news agency.Lavrov’s remarks come as the US, South Korea, and Japan ramped up joint military drills in response to North Korea’s expanding nuclear program. Just days earlier, the three allies held a joint air exercise near the Korean Peninsula involving US nuclear-capable bombers.North Korea views such exercises as rehearsals for invasion and insists its nuclear weapons are necessary for self-defense. Lavrov backed that stance, saying Russia understands Pyongyang’s reasoning.“The technologies used by North Korea are the result of the work of its own scientists. We respect its aspirations and understand the reasons why it is pursuing nuclear development,” Lavrov said.During separate talks, with his counterpart Choe Son Hui, Lavrov thanked North Korea for what he said was its contribution during a Ukrainian attack on Russia’s Kursk region.The meeting was held in Wonsan, where North Korea recently unveiled a large beach resort as part of efforts to boost tourism. Lavrov said he hopes Russian tourists will begin visiting the area and pledged to support increased travel through improved air connections.","Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov visited North Korea on Saturday.

EU says it still wants US trade deal





US President Donald Trump on Saturday announced he's levying tariffs of 30 per cent against the European Union and Mexico starting Aug 1, a move that could cause massive upheaval between US and two of its biggest trade partners.Trump detailed the planned tariffs in letters posted to his social media account. They are part of an announcement blitz by Trump of new tariffs with allies and foes alike, a bedrock of his 2024 campaign that he said would set the foundation for reviving a US economy that he claims has been ripped off by other nations for decades.In his letter to Mexico's leader, President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump acknowledged that the country has been helpful in stemming the flow of undocumented migrants and fentanyl into US. But he said the country has not done enough to stop North America from turning into a ""narco-trafficking playground"".""Mexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough,"" Trump added.Trump in his letter to the European Union said that the US trade deficit was a national security threat.""We have had years to discuss our Trading Relationship with The European Union, and we have concluded we must move away from these long-term, large, and persistent, Trade Deficits, engendered by your Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies, and Trade Barriers,"" Trump wrote in the letter to the EU.""Our relationship has been, unfortunately, far from Reciprocal.""The letters come in the midst of an on-and-off Trump threat to impose tariffs on countries and right an imbalance in trade. Trump in April imposed tariffs on dozens of countries, before pausing them for 90 days to negotiate individual deals. As the three-month grace period ended this week, Trump began sending his tariff letters to leaders but again has pushed back the implementation day for what he says will be just a few more weeks.If he moves forward with the tariffs, it could have ramifications for nearly every aspect of the global economy.European Union Commission president Ursula von der Leyen responded by noting the bloc's ""commitment to dialogue, stability, and a constructive transatlantic partnership.""""At the same time, we will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required,"" von der Leyen said in a statement.Von der Leyen added that the EU remains committed to continuing negotiations with the US and coming to an agreement before Aug 1. Trade ministers from EU countries are scheduled to meet Monday to discuss trade relations with the US, as well as with China.European leaders joined von der Leyen in urging Trump to give negotiations more time and warnings of possible new tariffs on Washington. ""With European unity, it is more than ever up to the Commission to assert the Union's determination to resolutely defend European interests,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement posted on X.Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni's office said ""it would make no sense to trigger a trade war between the two sides of the Atlantic"".European leaders had held out hope that they would avoid receiving a letter, and that a deal would be worked out. The bloc collectively sells more to the US than any other country.US goods imports from the EU topped $553 billion in 2022, according to the Office of the US Trade Representative. Europe’s biggest exports to the US were pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments and spirits.Trump has complained about the EU’s 198 billion-euro trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more goods from Europe than the other way around. However, American companies fill some of the gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings, and legal and financial services. With the reciprocal tariffs, Trump is effectively blowing up the rules governing world trade.For decades, the United States and most other countries abided by tariff rates set through a series of complex negotiations known as the Uruguay round. Countries could set their own tariffs, but under the “most favoured nation” approach, they couldn’t charge one country more than they charged another","US President Donald Trump announced he's levying tariffs of 30 per cent against the European Union and Mexico starting Aug 1.

"Flash floods once again hit Vermont, damaging homes and roads",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/flash-floods-once-again-hit-vermont-damaging-homes-and-roads/articleshow/122408486.cms,"



SUTTON: Communities in rural parts of Vermont on Friday woke up once again to damaged homes and washed-out roads due to heavy rainfall and flash flooding, making it the third consecutive summer that severe floods have inundated parts of the state.Up to 5 inches (13 centimeters) of rain fell in just a few hours on Thursday, prompting rapid flooding as local waterways began to swell, said Robert Haynes, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Burlington office.Nearly 20 homes were cut off in the small town of Sutton as a local brook quickly rose from its banks and surrounded buildings, Fire Chief Kyle Seymour said. His crews were called out to help rescue people from two homes, which required help from swift-water rescue teams called in from neighboring communities.""This was an incredibly strong, quick-moving localized heavy water,"" Seymour said. ""It overwhelmed all of our road culverts, all of our streams, all of our rivers. But the actual weather event lasted three hours, with the bulk of the rain concentrated within one hour.""Though the severity of the storms wasn't as widespread compared to the past two years, local officials were still surveying the extent of the damage Friday morning and shaking their heads that they were dealing with flood recovery for three years in a row.""When I started seeing the reporters saying it wasn't going to be that bad, I didn't believe it,"" Seymour said, adding that at least one member of his crew has contemplated retiring after experiencing such repeated flood emergencies.Michelle Tanner stood Friday on what used to be her driveway, dismayed that for the third time her property was washed out by flooding. She and her family have lived in Sutton for 25 years and want to continue doing so, but fear what another flood might do.""We don't know if the house will make it again,"" Tanner said. ""We'll see what happens. We don't want to start all over, though I guess we are.""Tanner's daughter, Tanika Allard, said taking in the flood damage once again made her tear up.""This year by far did the worst amount of damage with the least amount of rain, which didn't make a whole lot of sense,"" she said.According to the National Weather Service, Vermont's experience with floods can be traced to both ongoing climate change and the state's mountainous geography. Greater rainfall and increased moisture availability have made the state's steep terrain more susceptible to flooding.Elsewhere in Vermont, heavy winds blew off a significant portion of a high school's roof in Addison County.Meanwhile, flash flooding also occurred in Massachusetts on Thursday after rains dumped more than 7 inches (18 centimeters) of rain in some areas. Some businesses were flooded in the town of Weymouth, which saw the bulk of the rain and flooding while commuters faced delays as highways and streets south of Boston flooded.","Up to 5 inches (13 centimeters) of rain fell in just a few hours on Thursday, prompting rapid flooding.

PESHAWAR: An under-construction government primary school for girls in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was damaged in an IED blast by unknown militants, police said on Friday.No casualties were reported as the building was unoccupied at the time of the explosion.Militants had planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School in Baka Khel police jurisdiction of Bannu district.The device was detonated with a powerful blast, causing substantial structural damage to the building.An FIR has been registered and forensic teams have been deployed to collect evidence from the blast site, police said.Authorities have condemned the attack as an attempt to derail educational development in the region.According to a report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, more than 1,100 girls' schools have been destroyed in the tribal areas between 2007 to 2017, with teachers and young students also targeted.Before an all-out military operation launched by Pakistan's security forces in 2014, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) carried out hundreds of attacks on girls' schools in the tribal areas and settled districts of the northwestern province from its stronghold in Swat district.After the crackdown, TTP militants fled to Afghanistan and began to orchestrate cross border attacks from their new sanctuaries.The Taliban takeover of Kabul has emboldened the TTP, which is fighting to regain control of its strongholds in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Since the takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has banned girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and banned women from universities.Pakistani Taliban, who are ideologically closer to Afghan Taliban, are trying to enforce a similar anti-education and theocratic agenda in Pakistan's tribal areas by force.The youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, who is from Swat district, was shot in the face when she was 14 by TTP gunmen in 2012 as she wanted to pursue her education.","Militants planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School.

The victims were targeted based on their identity cards showing Punjab origins, as per reports.According to Dawn, two buses travelling from Quetta to Punjab were intercepted near Sur-Dakai along the Loralai-Zhob highway. Armed men reportedly blocked the road, boarded the vehicles, and began checking passengers’ CNICs.Those identified as residents of Punjab were taken off at gunpoint and later killed. “The terrorists forced the two passenger buses to stop on a highway and pulled nine passengers out. They took them in an area nearby and killed all of them,” said local official Naveed Alam, speaking to AFP.District administrator Saadat Hussain confirmed that the bodies were later recovered from the roadside. “The forces found the dead bodies all belong to different areas of Punjab,” he told AFP.“The terrorists must have taken the passengers’ identification documents with them,” AC Alam told Dawn.While no group initially claimed responsibility, the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLA) later took credit. The group has waged a long-running insurgency against the Pakistani state, frequently targeting non-Baloch civilians and military personnel.The Baloch insurgency, which seeks independence from Islamabad, has intensified in recent years despite claims by Pakistani authorities that it is under control. President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the killings, blaming “terrorists from the outlawed BLA” for seeking to destabilise the country.The killings echo a similar attack last year in which 23 passengers were killed. Human rights groups and separatists have accused Pakistan’s security forces of brutal counter-insurgency tactics, including enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.","Nine people were shot dead by rebels in Pakistan’s Balochistan province.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political temperature spiked on Thursday after Jemima Goldsmith, ex-wife of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , accused the govt of denying their sons the right to speak with their father and threatening them with arrest if they attempt to visit the country.In a strongly worded post on X, Goldsmith said her sons, Sulaiman and Qasim Khan, have not been allowed to speak to Imran, who has been held in solitary confinement in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail for nearly two years.“Pakistan’s govt has now said if they go there to try to see him, they too will be arrested and put behind bars,” she wrote. “This isn’t politics. It’s a personal vendetta.”Her intervention has triggered widespread reactions both domestically and abroad, with PTI accusing govt of using intimidation tactics ahead of a major protest planned for Aug 5 to mark two years of Khan’s incarceration.Reports suggest the sons, currently based in the UK, were planning to join the protest movement. However, Goldsmith’s statement appears to signal serious concern about their safety.Adviser to the Prime Minister on political affairs Rana Sanaullah, responding to the claims, said: “Why won’t they be arrested? If they come to lead a violent movement, the consequences will follow.” Law minister Aqeel Malik also warned that entry could be denied if their intent is to “spread discord”.Goldsmith’s post has reignited criticism of Khan’s detention conditions, with human rights groups raising an alarm over his prolonged solitary confinement — reportedly 22 hours a day — and limited access to lawyers and family. Khan’s son Qasim also weighed in, posting: “My father... has now spent over 700 days in prison – held in solitary confinement.”The row comes amid intense political speculation in Islamabad, including unconfirmed reports of President Asif Ali Zardari ’s possible resignation and a rumoured meeting between Khan and longtime rival Nawaz Sharif in jail.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi has rejected the reports, calling them part of a “malicious foreign campaign” and denying claims that Army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir is being considered for the presidency under a proposed shift to a presidential system, a move Khan has condemned as “monarchic”.Khan, who faces over 150 legal cases, has rejected any negotiations with the Shehbaz Sharif govt. His sister, Aleema Khan, claims he and his wife, Bushra Bibi, are being held without access to sunlight, visitors, or even newspapers.",Imran Khan's ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith accuses govt of 'personal vendetta' She claims sons Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have not been allowed to speak to their father.

ISLAMABAD: Alphabet-owned YouTube has told more than two dozen critics of the Pakistani govt that it is considering blocking their channels after a local court sought to ban them for being ""anti-state"".The channels that could be blocked include that of the main opposition party, of its chief, jailed former PM Imran Khan, and journalists critical of govt, according to a June 24 court order. The judicial magistrate court in Islamabad said it was seeking the ban after national cyber crime investigation agency criticised the channels in a report for ""sharing highly provocative and derogatory contents against state institutions and officials of state of Pakistan"".Rights campaigners say any ban would further undermine free speech in Pakistan, where authorities are accused of stifling newspapers and television, and social media is seen as one of the few outlets for dissent. YouTube told 27 content creators their channels could be taken down if they did not comply with the court orders. State minister for interior Talal Chaudhry said the creators would also face criminal charges. ""It's not only about anchors getting fired or YouTube channels getting banned.

Beijing 'Open To Arming' Allies





ISLAMABAD: In a rare show of coordinated praise, senior defence officials from China and Turkiye have commended the combat readiness and operational capability of the Pakistan Air Force following last month’s four-day conflict with India, a development seen in Islamabad as quiet validation of its evolving airpower doctrine.In back-to-back high-level visits to Air Headquarters in Islamabad this week, top officials from the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and the Turkish ministry of defence hailed PAF’s “decisive” response and “battle-proven” performance during the May clashes.China’s Chief of Air Staff, Lt Gen Wang Gang, met PAF chief Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu on Tuesday and described Pakistan’s aerial actions as “a textbook example of precision, discipline and courage in the face of unprovoked aggression”. He praised PAF’s integration of multi-domain operations (MDOs), calling it a “hallmark of modern air warfare”, and expressed interest in adopting elements of PAF’s doctrine for the PLAAF.A day later, on Wednesday, Turkiye defence minister Yaşar Güler offered similar praise. Calling the PAF’s performance “exceptional”, Güler lauded Sidhu’s “insightful leadership” and highlighted PAF’s role in the “resolute defence of national sovereignty”.He also proposed expanded cooperation in training, unmanned aerial systems, and disruptive technologies.Güler’s visit coincided with the arrival of Turkiye foreign minister Hakan Fidan on Wednesday, signalling coordinated diplomatic and military outreach as Pakistan seeks to shore up support from key allies.Neither China nor Turkiye elaborated on the details of the May conflict — downplayed by Islamabad and denied outright by New Delhi — but both echoed Pakistan’s military narrative, offering a diplomatic boost as Islamabad contends with regional isolation and growing India-West defence ties.Both delegations were briefed on PAF’s restructured posture, including its focus on AI-driven targeting and cyber-electronic warfare. PLAAF officials reportedly showed strong interest in the JF-17 Block III, a jointly developed fighter jet now equipped with AESA (active electronically scanned array) radar and advanced avionics.The Turkish side proposed joint working groups to fast-track industry-to-industry ties — part of Ankara’s push to expand its defence footprint in South Asia amid rising collaboration with Pakistan on drones, pilot training, and aerospace development.The rare twin endorsements from two of Pakistan’s closest allies reflect a shifting regional balance, with China and Turkiye increasingly positioning themselves as strategic counterweights to India’s deepening ties with the US, France and Israel.While India denies any aerial losses, the external praise for PAF suggests otherwise, raising questions about whether these visits signal deeper strategic alignment or simply calculated shows of support.Islamabad and Ankara on Wednesday agreed to boost their cooperation in a range of sectors, including defence, trade, energy and infrastructure, aiming to enhance bilateral trade volume to $5 billion. This was agreed during talks between Fidan and Guler with Pakistan foreign minister Ishaq Dar here. “Pakistan would like to benefit from Turkiye’s expertise and experiences in this (defence) field,” Dar said. “We are actively engaged in different activities, including capacity building and counterterrorism,” Dar said, describing Turkiye as a ""trusted friend"" and a ""reliable brother”. ""We are pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone dedicated to Turkish entrepreneurs at Karachi,” Dar said. He also mentioned finalising the revival of the Istanbul-Tehran-Islamabad train.",Senior defence officials from China and Turkiye have commended the combat readiness and operational capability of the Pakistan Air Force.

India's Big Win In Pak Clash? Jaish Chief Masood Azhar's Brother Rauf 'Eliminated' In Op Sindoor





Pakistan’s former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar faced an uncomfortable moment during a recent Al Jazeera interview as she attempted to defend a man, seen leading funeral prayers for terrorists killed in India's counterterror Operation Sindoor.The individual, widely identified as senior Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) leader Hafiz Abdul Rauf, a UN-designated terrorist, was seen leading funeral prayers for terrorists killed in the Operation Sindoor strikes, where the bodies were accorded full state honours in Pakistan, with uniformed police and army personnel in attendance.Khar claimed the man in question was not the LeT figure India accuses him of being. ""I am telling you with authority, with evidence which has been shared with the whole world, that this is not the man that you (India) are claiming it to be. There are a million Abdul Raufs in Pakistan,"" she said, dismissing India's assertion.However, her defence began to falter when the interviewer pointed out that the man's national ID number matches one listed on the US Treasury Department's sanctions database.The journalist mentioned that the national identity number belonging to Hafiz Abdul Rauf -- 35202-5400413-9 -- was identical to the one listed by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the US Treasury’s list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT).""They said that he is a member of a political party, and they released his national ID number. That ID number is the same one as on the US sanctions list. So, according to the US sanctions terrorist list, this man is a terrorist,"" the journalist said.Pressed further, Khar responded, ""The Pakistani army is defending this man. The Pakistani army is not defending the person who is proscribed by the US.""She continued, ""The ISPR (Inter-Services Public Relations of Pakistan Army) categorically has said that this is not the same person, and you just sat over here and told me that they just defended him and did not say it is not the same person.""The man at the centre of the controversy, Hafiz Abdul Rauf, is known to be a close associate of 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed and holds senior status in the LeT. The presence of his identity number in the official document shown by Pakistan’s military spokesperson, DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif, matched that of the terrorist sanctioned by the United States.Under Operation Sindoor, India carried out precision strikes on nine terrorist hubs in Pakistan and PoK, including a major Lashkar-e-Taiba base in Muridke, which was reduced to rubble.In an unexpected revelation, the same US list also names Lt Gen Sharif’s father, Mahmood Sultan Bashiruddin, as a designated terrorist with links to al-Qaida -- further raising questions about the Pakistani military’s role in shielding extremists.","Pakistan’s former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar faced an uncomfortable moment during a recent Al Jazeera interview.

Gulzar Dost, a well-known social activist and convener of Kech Civil Society, was arrested on Monday in a wider effort by the Pakistani state to silence dissent in Balochistan.According to The Balochistan Post, Dost was taken from his home in Turbat during a raid by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and later charged with what The Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) says were “false and politically motivated” allegations. It has demanded his immediate release.Dost was arrested early Monday morning during a CTD raid at his residence in Turbat. He was then brought before a court and charged, though the exact nature of the charges has not been publicly detailed.In a post on X, BYC described Dost as a peaceful citizen who has always spoken up for families of forcibly disappeared persons and victims of extrajudicial killings.“His only ‘crime’ is standing with the oppressed,” BYC said. “The state cannot tolerate that.”The committee also criticised the CTD, calling it a tool of state repression used to target grassroots activists. It accused authorities of carrying out unlawful raids, filing fake cases, and using forced disappearances to suppress political voices.BYC has demanded Dost’s unconditional release and warned that the continued targeting of activists will only increase resistance in the region.“If the state thinks it can create silence in Balochistan by targeting political activists, it is gravely mistaken,” the group said.The arrest is part of what rights groups say is an increasing pattern of intimidation against Baloch activists. Just two days ago, at least five men were reportedly forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces during a series of raids in the Kech and Gwadar districts of Balochistan.A wave of anger has swept across Pakistan’s troubled Balochistan province after the reported abduction and killing of young Baloch activist Zeeshan Ahmed by military personnel. Zeeshan had been actively campaigning for the safe return of his father, Zaheer Ahmed, who was forcibly disappeared by the Frontier Corps back in 2015.","Gulzar Dost, a well-known social activist and convener of Kech Civil Society, was arrested on Monday.

Pakistani authorities confiscated eighteen lions kept illegally as pets in the densely populated Punjab region during a targeted operation, provincial officials said Monday.Authorities launched a crackdown after a lion escaped from a house in Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, and attacked a woman and two children. The incident, which took place last week, was captured on video.None of the people suffered life-threatening injuries, according to provincial officials. The lion, which was kept without a license in a house in Lahore, was confiscated.The lion was sent to a local safari park, according to Mubeen Elahi, director general of the provincial Wildlife and Parks Department.Police said the owner was arrested.Keeping a lion at home without following the legal requirements for ownership of big cats is an offense punishable by up to seven years in jail, Elahi told the Reuters news agency.As well as confiscating the 18 animals, the department raided 38 lion and tiger breeding farms and arrested eight people for violating the rules, he said.There are more than 500 lions and tigers in homes and breeding farms in Punjab, Elahi said, adding they would be inspected by the end of the week.Keeping exotic animals is considered a status symbol among some wealthy Pakistanis, despite the high fees associated with ownership.","Authorities launched a crackdown after a lion escaped from a house in Lahore and attacked a woman and two children.

ISLAMABAD: Swat Valley and Gilgit-Baltistan — key cradles of the Indus river — are battling deadly floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), exposing Pakistan’s weak climate governance and the fragility of its disaster response.At least 72 people have died nationwide, including 14 in Swat and 23 in Astore (Gilgit-Baltistan) where a passenger bus plunged into a swollen river. Another 25 people were rescued from the surging Indus near Shadi Khan in Punjab’s Attock district.Swat’s flash floods were triggered by a GLOF in Kalam Mitaltan area, while accelerated glacier melt in Gilgit-Baltistan has swelled rivers such as the Hunza, Kunjrab, and Shimshal Braldu. In both regions, roads, bridges, and homes have been swept away, leaving mountain communities stranded.“No early warning systems, no modern rescue equipment – Swat is left to drown, again,” said Ambreen Ali, a local activist, echoing growing public frustration.Once a prized alpine tourist destination, Swat continues to reel from its past under Taliban rule (2007–2009). Despite a military-led recovery and donor-funded rebuilding, this summer’s floods have damaged rebuilt infrastructure, including hotels in Kalam and Bahrain and the Mankial bridge, a lifeline for remote villages.In Gilgit-Baltistan, floodwaters threaten power lines and roads in Diamer, Skardu, and Astore, while downstream provinces fear the Indus’s surging flow. In Sindh, farmers worry that floods – exacerbated by dam releases upstream – will drown their fields.The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) blames a 67% rainfall deficit last winter for intensifying water stress. With only 150 cubic meters of per capita water storage, Pakistan is among the most water-insecure countries globally, retaining just 10% of its river flows.But it’s not just Pakistan that’s vulnerable.India, which shares the Himalayan watershed and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan, faces similar climate pressures. The 2022 floods, which killed 1,700 in Pakistan and inundated Indian regions, underscored the shared ecological risks tied to glacial retreat and erratic monsoons.The IWT, signed in 1960, has come under renewed strain. India suspended the treaty on April 23, 2025 following a terrorist attack in Kashmir’s Pahalgam. This halted data-sharing on river flows, leaving Pakistan exposed during the monsoon season.Pakistan suspects India’s water infrastructure push – including the Shahpurkandi and Ujh dams – could further disrupt downstream flows. But India too faces its own water anxieties, including unilateral dam operations and growing glacier-related threats in its Himalayan catchments.Analysts warn that lack of coordination on flood management could have catastrophic consequences for both countries. Experts call for restoring data exchange under IWT, investing in joint watershed management, and building early warning systems. With over 3,000 glacial lakes in Pakistan alone, the risk of future GLOFs looms large.As Swat mourns its dead and Gilgit-Baltistan braces for more floods, the Indus – a lifeline for both nations – is turning into a symbol of shared peril.","At least 72 people have died nationwide, including 14 in Swat and 23 in Astore.

At least 72 people have been killed and over 130 injured in Pakistan as relentless monsoon rains and flash floods battered the country over the past ten days, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said on Monday.Since June 26, casualties have been reported across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan provinces. The NDMA has urged local administrations to remain on high alert and advised tourists to steer clear of vulnerable areas, warning that continued rainfall could lead to further flooding and road blockages.Emergency services were already on heightened alert after a tragic incident last month in which 17 members of the same family were swept away by the Swat River.Thirteen bodies were recovered, including eight children, while four people were rescued. Footage of the family stranded on a rooftop and pleading for help sparked public outrage and criticism of the delayed rescue response.Many of the recent deaths were caused by collapsing walls and roofs, as well as sudden floods in low-lying areas.Officials are concerned that worsening weather conditions could mirror the devastating 2022 floods, which killed over 1,700 people and submerged nearly a third of the country.The NDMA has said it cannot rule out the possibility of similar large-scale disasters this year.With a population of more than 240 million, Pakistan remains one of the most climate-vulnerable nations in the world. Scientists warn that climate change is driving a rise in both the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, putting millions at risk.Rescue operations are ongoing, and authorities have called on the public to remain cautious as the monsoon season continues to intensify.",At least 72 people have been killed and over 130 injured in Pakistan as relentless monsoon rains and flash floods battered the country over the past ten days.

Bangladesh’s interim government on Thursday officially revoked a long-standing directive from the Sheikh Hasina administration that required public officials to address her and other senior women officials as “sir. ” The order, in effect for nearly 16 years, was deemed ‘inappropriate’ by the Yunus- led government.The decision was announced by chief adviser of the government of Bangladesh in a post on X, following a meeting of the advisory council in Dhaka. ""During Sheikh Hasina's nearly 16-year-long autocratic rule, a directive was reportedly issued requiring public officials to address her as 'sir,'"" the post read.""This practice extended to other high-ranking women officials, who were and still are being called 'sir,' which is clearly odd,"" it added.The rule had drawn criticism over the years for undermining gender norms and appearing out of touch with social conventions.To establish a more respectful and culturally appropriate form of address for senior officials, the government has formed a review committee. The panel will be co-led by energy, road and railway adviser Dr M Fouzul Kabir Khan and environment and water resources adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan.Alongside the cancellation of this directive, the interim government also discussed scrapping several other outdated protocol rules issued by the previous cabinet.","The order, in effect for nearly 16 years, was deemed ‘inappropriate’ by the Yunus- led government.

A 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on Friday, said the National center for seismology (NCS). The tremor occurred at a depth of 101 km, with its epicenter at 25.76 N latitude and 95.26 E longitude.There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.This was the third earthquake to hit the country in July. Earlier, on July 7, a 4.6 magnitude earthquake shook the region at 10.40 am IST. The quake struck at a depth of 85 km.On July 3, another earthquake of magnitude 4.1 hit Myanmar early morning. Shallow earthquakes are generally more dangerous due to the stronger ground shaking they produce, potentially causing more damage and casualties.Myanmar has been facing increased seismic activity in recent months. On March 28, the country was hit by powerful earthquakes measuring 7.7 and 6.4 in central regions. In the aftermath, the world health organisation (WHO) raised concerns about rising health threats among displaced populations, including tuberculosis (TB), HIV, and vector- and water-borne diseases, as reported by ANI.Myanmar is highly vulnerable to moderate and large magnitude earthquakes, as well as tsunami threats along its coastline. The Sagaing Fault, which runs through key regions such as Sagaing, Mandalay, Bago, and Yangon, increases the seismic risk for nearly half of the country’s population.Despite being some distance from the fault, Yangon remains at significant risk due to its dense population. Historical records show that an earthquake in Bago in 1903 with a magnitude of 7.0 also impacted Yangon.","A 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on Friday.

Rights groups in Bangladesh have accused the interim government, led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, of ignoring a disturbing surge in violence against religious minorities and shielding perpetrators from justice. The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council said on Thursday that it had recorded 2,442 incidents of communal violence between August 2024 and June 2025—many of them involving killings, sexual assaults, arson, and the destruction of places of worship and property.The group alleges that these attacks intensified following the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina last year and have continued under the current administration. “The accused are enjoying impunity,” said Monindra Kumar Nath, the council’s acting general secretary, adding that the authorities have repeatedly dismissed their concerns as fabricated or politically motivated, despite compelling evidence. Yunus’ office has acknowledged only 88 cases of violence and claims 70 people have been arrested.Council leaders say religious minorities, who make up around 10% of Bangladesh’s population of 170 million, have been systematically excluded from national reform processes.“No representative from minority groups has been included in any commission meant to ensure equality,” Nath said. Others pointed to a long history of marginalisation since the country’s independence in 1971. “We hoped for better under a Nobel Peace Prize winner, but we have only seen continued neglect,” said Kajal Debnath, a council member.On May 22, following a murder unrelated to the minority community, attackers targeted the homes of 20 minority families, looting, burning property, and allegedly assaulting women. Despite a police case being filed, no arrests have been made in the five weeks since, according to the council. Many victims have fled or gone into hiding, and vital documents such as house deeds and ID cards were destroyed.India has taken note of the situation. The ministry of external affairs reportedly told a parliamentary panel that the Yunus government is downplaying the scale of violence, which it blames on political motives rather than communal targeting. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri warned that extremist groups are filling the power vacuum left by Hasina’s exit, leading to increased religious radicalisation. The Indian government has called for action against those responsible for anti-minority violence and for Bangladesh to uphold its commitments to religious freedom.","Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council recorded 2,442 incidents of communal violence between August 2024 and June 2025.

Malaysian beauty queen and actor Lishalliny Kanaran, winner of Miss Grand Malaysia 2021, has accused an Indian priest of molesting her during a recent visit to a Hindu temple. The allegation surfaced after Kanaran shared a detailed account of the incident on Instagram two days ago, sparking public outrage and calls for immediate action.Lishalliny said she visited the Mariamman Temple in Sepang alone on June 21, as her mother was in India. Being unfamiliar with temple rituals, she usually relied on the priest for guidance.During the visit, the priest told her he had some holy water and a protective string for her. After she completed her prayers, she waited for about 90 minutes before the priest asked her to follow him to his private office for the blessing.Inside the office, the priest poured a strong-smelling liquid, described by Lishalliny as rose or flower essence, into the holy water and told her it was brought from India and not given to ordinary people. He then began splashing the water on her, so much that she couldn’t open her eyes.The situation escalated when the priest allegedly asked Kanaran to lift her Punjabi suit. When she declined, explaining that it was too tight, he reportedly scolded her for wearing such attire.He then stood behind her, held her head, and began murmuring what she believed were prayers—before allegedly putting his hands inside her blouse and bra.“My brain knew everything about that moment was wrong and yet I couldn’t move. I couldn’t speak. I froze. And I still don’t understand why,” she said.Kanaran said she spent the following days feeling disgusted and deeply traumatised. After her mother returned from India, she confided in her. Shocked and enraged, her mother informed the rest of the family, and they filed a police complaint on July 4.When they returned to the temple, they found the priest had already fled. “Apparently, the priest wasn't there anymore. Someone had already reported him before for the same thing and yet no action had been taken,” Kanaran said, accusing the temple management of prioritising its reputation over helping victims.The actress’s detailed social media post has sparked outrage, with calls for the suspect to be swiftly apprehended. Police have not yet located the priest but confirmed that efforts to track him down are underway.Sepang district police chief ACP Norhizam Bahaman, speaking to Malay Mail, said, “The suspect is an Indian national who was temporarily filling the position because the temple’s resident priest is currently abroad.”“The suspect’s modus operandi was allegedly to sprinkle holy water on the victim’s face and body before proceeding to molest her,” he added.","Lishalliny Kanaran, winner of Miss Grand Malaysia 2021, has accused an Indian priest of molesting her during a recent visit to a Hindu temple.

Four members accused of stealing over 1 million pounds worth of jewellery from London’s Indian and South Asian communities were jailed Friday after they pleaded guilty to burglary.Jerry O’Donnell, Barney Maloney, Quey Adger and Patrick Ward, part of an organised crime network, have been sentenced for a total 17 years and one month after the Metropolitan Police led out a “comprehensive operation” against them.Head of investigation Met Police detective sergeant Lee Davison, said the gang “largely targeted the South Asian community throughout the capital,” as quoted by PTI.“This comprehensive operation enabled us to disrupt a key part of an organised crime network. As a result of the work conducted by specialist officers, a handful of serial criminals will now spend a substantial amount of time behind bars,” he added.Three of the men- O’Donnell, Maloney and Adger- were caught in July 2024 with stolen jewellery following a year-long intelligence-led investigation.Officers stopped their car after CCTV linked it to several burglaries. Inside, police found hundreds of stolen items, including a gold wedding ring, necklaces, and a solid gold hair pin.Each received sentences of over five years.Ward was arrested later at his home and identified as a key member of the same network. He was sentenced to two years and five months.As part of the investigation, officers also searched a Hatton Garden jewellery shop believed to be used for melting down stolen gold.

Jury shown CCTV footage of two brothers assaulting police officers at Manchester Airport





A police officer has told a jury that she was left “absolutely terrified” after she was punched during a brawl with two men at the Manchester Airport last year. PC Lydia Ward from Greater Manchester was left with a broken nose in the incident that took place on July 23 last year at the Terminal 2 car park pay station, as reported by the BBC.She was allegedly attacked by Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, 20, and his brother Muhammad Amaad, 26. Both men are from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, and have denied the allegations.The jury heard that Amaaz was approached at a ticket machine by the female cop and two of her colleagues after they received a complaint that a man who fit his description had head-butted a customer at a Starbucks in the airport.Amaaz apparently resisted, and his brother then intervened. ""I was trying to keep hold of Mr Amaaz's arm and get it behind his back so I could get some cuffs on him,” said Ward. One of her colleagues was then pushed, and Amaaz started to kick him, said Ward.""I tried to grab him off so he could stop kicking PC Marsden. All I remember then is that he turned and he punched me straight in the face,” she said as reported by the BBC. ""I can't really remember where it landed but I know where my injuries were.I remember falling on the floor and everything went black.""""I was terrified to be honest. I was absolutely terrified. I had never experienced that level of violence towards me in my life,” she added. ""I didn't know who was going to come up at me next. I was scared of going after this male again and being punched in the face again.""Ward said people around them did not come up to help, and were “filming on their mobile phones"", ""Nobody came to assist. I felt everyone in that room was against us. To be honest, I was terrified,” she said.Footage from the bodycam that was presented in the court showed Ward was being comforted by one of her colleagues.Rosemary Fernandes, the lawyer representing Amaaz, suggested that her client was “taken by surprise” and was “shocked”. She also stressed that Amaaz had acted out in “lawful self-defence.” ""It is important you identify yourselves as police officers, isn't it?"" she asked.Ward said that they did not have the time for any “rational discussion” as the situation turned “violent quickly"". ""He could see I was a police officer and he could see I was a female as well,” she added.Amaaz was accused of assaulting PC Marsden and PC Ward, resulting in actual bodily harm, and also accused of assaulting PC Cook and Abdulkareem Ismaeil from Starbucks.His brother was accused of having assaulted PC Marsden, resulting in actual bodily harm.

France and the United Kingdom on Thursday reached several deals on migration, nuclear cooperation and support for Ukraine, after a visit from French President Emmanuel Macron to London.The three-day visit was hosted by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and included a carriage procession to Windsor Castle with King Charles and a state banquet.Starmer and Macron held a press conference on Thursday where they announced the deals, highlighting tougher migration controls.The two countries agreed on a ""one in, one out"" returns scheme, where the UK would be deporting undocumented people arriving in small boats to France, in return for accepting an equal number of legitimate asylum seekers with British family connections.""I'm pleased to announce our agreement today on a ground breaking returns pilot.

Prince Andrew becomes the only name on Epstein's list







As the US government finally closed the Epstein case announcing that the convicted sex offender who died in 2019 by suicide did not have a client list, Prince Andrew who was linked to the case is now free to travel abroad. According to reports, there was no embargo on Prince Andrew but he imposed a travel ban on himself as he was stated that he could be arrested if he travels outside the UK.The 65-year-old Royal family member who lost all his titles after he was accused of sexually exploiting a minor at Epstein island left the UK once in the last six years. “He has been abroad once since the scandal erupted,” a source told the Sun.“He has always been very nervous about going abroad and felt he’d always be looking over his shoulder as he could be subject to civil action or at worst, being arrested.”“Hopefully with this out of the way it means he can at least leave the country,” the insider said. “What’s he supposed to do with the rest of his life? He hasn’t been convicted of any crime and can’t sit around doing nothing at Royal Lodge forever.”Before the lawsuit, he was known to be trotting the globe.Virginia Giuffre, the woman who mysteriously died by suicide earlier this year, sued Prince Andrew and claimed that she was forced to have sexual encounters with Andrew when she was 17, after she was trafficked by Epstein.In 2022, Giuffre and Andrew's attorneys reached an agreement to settle the case in exchange of a hefty amount of money but Prince Andrew denied any wrongdoing. He said he did not even remember meeting Giuffre, though his photo with Giuffre surfaced online.In 2020, the FBI had asked the UK Home Office to assist it in bringing Andrew in for questioning, but the investigation was put on hold in 2024 for reasons unknown. Andrew admitted that he had associations with Epstein but he cut those in 2010.

When the interview resumed, she said, ""Now it's your chance, Kapil, to get me back.""The HR team later contacted her after a month of the interview and said she was fired for her racial comment.“I was horrified to hear these as I would not blame a culture or country for any kind of failure or direct any such comments toward an interview panel that I was applying for a role with,” she said in her witness statement prepared for the London hearing.Watson said she did not deny making the comment but she could not recall it because of the symptoms of long Covid-19 and menopause. She said she was remorseful though she has no recollection of what she said.Citi said its investigation into Watson was fair and impartial, and stood by the decision to fire her. Watson said the firing was too harsh and it did not take into account her 12 years of service at the bank and came at a time when she was going through a tough menopause.

Royal Exit Sealed? Meghan Pulls The Plug As Archie’s Title Sparks Fresh Palace Turmoil





Prince William was reportedly wary of Meghan Markle’s alleged “plan” of getting married into the royal family through Prince Harry, claimed long-time royal commentator and biographer Phil Dampier.The Prince of Wales, 43, apparently had early doubts about Meghan’s intentions of joining the royal family, Damper told The Sun.His skepticism is said to have surfaced around the same time Queen Elizabeth II’s cousin, Lady Elizabeth Anson, revealed that the late monarch herself had reservations about Markle’s entry into the royal fold, remarked Dampier.“I think, unfortunately, that confirms what I’ve been saying or thought for the last few years that, sadly, Meghan never really had any intention of staying in the royal family,” he said while referencing to Anson’s comments. “She saw as a stepping stone getting married to Harry to new fame and fortune. And I think that’s what initially Prince William was concerned about,” he added.“That’s why they fell out. And now we are where we are. But to have this confirmed by somebody so close to the Queen is really dynamite,” said Dampier.Lady Elizabeth Anson, who passed in 2020, at the age of 79, told The Times of London, “When I spoke with the queen, she said she is not at all content.Meghan could turn into nothing but trouble. She sees things in a different way.""Dampier said that the revelation was “very, very telling,” noting that it came “right from the horse’s mouth.” He emphasized that the comments made by Anson were credible.Royal broadcaster Esther Krauke weighed in on the revelation and said that the Late Queen’s outlook towards Meghan might have been positive initially, but had changed over time. “The Queen’s opinion of Meghan evolved, and it’s much like how the country’s opinion evolved,” she said to The Sun.“And much like the public, I think the Queen thought Meghan was a breath of fresh air. Very intelligent, very well-spoken, obviously from her acting background,” she said. “And she worked, she welcomed her,” Krakue said. “I think, like much of the country with open arms, I think where things went wrong was clearly the cultural clash.”Krauke also mentioned King Charles is fully aware of how Prince Harry is “totally whipped” by his wife. “We know that King Charles said something about him being whipped,” she commented. “We keep hearing things consistently coming out from courtiers and people that are close to the royal family.”During a state banquet on Tuesday, at Windsor Castle, King Charles. 76 had delivered a speech that had warmly referred to Prince William and Catherine’s family, but made no mention of Prince Harry and Meghan, who exited royal life back in 2020, as reported by The New York Post. French president Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, were also present at the dinner.","Prince William was reportedly wary of Meghan Markle’s alleged “plan” of getting married into the royal family through Prince Harry, claimed long-time royal commentator and biographer Phil Dampier.

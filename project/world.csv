Israel, for the first time, publicly confirmed their involvement in the July killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.In his warning to the Houthis amid their recent attacks, Israeli defence minister Israel Katz confirmed the involvement in killing Haniyeh. ""Israel will damage their strategic infrastructure, and we will behead their leaders – just as we did to Haniyeh, Sinwar and Nasrallah in Tehran, Gaza and Lebanon – we will do it in Hodeidah and Sana'a,"" Katz said during an event honoring defense ministry personnel.Speaking about the Houthis he also said, ""These days, when the Houthi terrorist organization is firing missiles at Israel, I want to convey a clear message to them at the beginning of my remarks: We have defeated Hamas, we have defeated Hezbollah, we have blinded Iran's defense systems and damaged the production systems, we have toppled the Assad regime in Syria, we have dealt a severe blow to the axis of evil, and we will also deal a severe blow to the Houthi terrorist organization in Yemen, which remains the last to stand.""Also read: How Israel weaponized pagers, walkie-talkies in decade-long plot against Hezbollah While this is the first public acknowledgement from Israel, Iranian authorities had already previously attributed the assassination to Israel.Haniyeh, operating from Qatar, led Hamas' international diplomacy during the Gaza war, which began with a Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. He also participated in ceasefire negotiations.Following Haniyeh's death in Iran's capital, Israeli forces also killed Yahya Sinwar in Gaza.

and why Trump can't take it back on his own,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-history-of-the-panama-canal-and-why-trump-cant-take-it-back-on-his-own/articleshow/116614713.cms,"(AP photo)

Here's a look at how we got here:

What is the canal?

Who built it?

Why doesn't the US control the canal anymore?

What's happened since then?

Why has Trump raised this?

PANAMA CITY: Teddy Roosevelt once declared the Panama Canal ""one of the feats to which the people of this republic will look back with the highest pride."" More than a century later, Donald Trump is threatening to take back the waterway for the same republic.The president-elect is decrying increased fees Panama has imposed to use the waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. He says if things don't change after he takes office next month, ""We will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America, in full, quickly and without question.""Trump has long threatened allies with punitive action in hopes of winning concessions. But experts in both countries are clear: Unless he goes to war with Panama, Trump can't reassert control over a canal the US agreed to cede in the 1970s.It is a man-made waterway that uses a series of locks and reservoirs over 51 miles (82 kilometers) to cut through the middle of Panama and connect the Atlantic and Pacific. It spares ships having to go an additional roughly 7,000 miles (more than 11,000 kilometers) to sail around Cape Horn at South America's southern tip.The US International Trade Administration says the canal saves American business interests ""considerable time and fuel costs"" and enables faster delivery of goods, which is ""particularly significant for time sensitive cargoes, perishable goods, and industries with just-in-time supply chains.""An effort to establish a canal through Panama led by Ferdinand de Lesseps, who built Egypt's Suez Canal, began in 1880 but progressed little over nine years before going bankrupt.Malaria, yellow fever and other tropical diseases devastated a workforce already struggling with especially dangerous terrain and harsh working conditions in the jungle, eventually costing more than 20,000 lives, by some estimates.Panama was then a province of Colombia, which refused to ratify a subsequent 1901 treaty licensing US interests to build the canal. Roosevelt responded by dispatching US warships to Panama's Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The US also prewrote a constitution that would be ready after Panamanian independence, giving American forces ""the right to intervene in any part of Panama, to re-establish public peace and constitutional order.""In part because Colombian troops were unable to traverse harsh jungles, Panama declared an effectively bloodless independence within hours in November 1903. It soon signed a treaty allowing a US-led team to begin construction.Some 5,600 workers died later during the US-led construction project, according to one study.The waterway opened in 1914, but almost immediately some Panamanians began questioning the validity of US control, leading to what became known in the country as the ""generational struggle"" to take it over.The US abrogated its right to intervene in Panama in the 1930s. By the 1970s, with its administrative costs sharply increasing, Washington spent years negotiating with Panama to cede control of the waterway.The Carter administration worked with the government of Omar Torrijos . The two sides eventually decided that their best chance for ratification was to submit two treaties to the US Senate, the ""Permanent Neutrality Treaty"" and the ""Panama Canal Treaty.""The first, which continues in perpetuity, gives the US the right to act to ensure the canal remains open and secure. The second stated that the US would turn over the canal to Panama on December 31, 1999, and was terminated then.Both were signed in 1977 and ratified the following year. The agreements held even after 1989, when President George H.W. Bush invaded Panama to remove Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega .In the late 1970s, as the handover treaties were being discussed and ratified, polls found that about half of Americans opposed the decision to cede canal control to Panama. However, by the time ownership actually changed in 1999, public opinion had shifted, with about half of Americans in favor.Administration of the canal has been more efficient under Panama than during the US era, with traffic increasing 17% between fiscal years 1999 and 2004. Panama's voters approved a 2006 referendum authorizing a major expansion of the canal to accommodate larger modern cargo ships. The expansion took until 2016 and cost more than $5.2 billion.Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino said in a video Sunday that ""every square meter of the canal belongs to Panama and will continue to."" He added that, while his country's people are divided on some key issues, ""when it comes to our canal, and our sovereignty, we will all unite under our Panamanian flag.""Shipping prices have increased because of droughts last year affecting the canal locks, forcing Panama to drastically cut shipping traffic through the canal and raise rates to use it. Though the rains have mostly returned, Panama says future fee increases might be necessary as it undertakes improvements to accommodate modern shipping needs.Mulino said fees to use the canal are ""not set on a whim.""Jorge Luis Quijano , who served as the waterway's administrator from 2014 to 2019, said all canal users are subject to the same fees, though they vary by ship size and other factors.""I can accept that the canal's customers may complain about any price increase,"" Quijano said. ""But that does not give them reason to consider taking it back.""The president-elect says the US is getting ""ripped off"" and ""I'm not going to stand for it.""""It was given to Panama and to the people of Panama, but it has provisions - you've got to treat us fairly. And they haven't treated us fairly,"" Trump said of the 1977 treaty that he said ""foolishly"" gave the canal away.The neutrality treaty does give the US the right to act if the canal's operation is threatened due to military conflict - but not to reassert control.""There's no clause of any kind in the neutrality agreement that allows for the taking back of the canal,"" Quijano said. ""Legally, there's no way, under normal circumstances, to recover territory that was used previously.""Trump, meanwhile, hasn't said how he might make good on his threat.""There's very little wiggle room, absent a second US invasion of Panama, to retake control of the Panama Canal in practical terms,"" said Benjamin Gedan, director of the Latin America Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.Gedan said Trump's stance is especially baffling given that Mulino is a pro-business conservative who has ""made lots of other overtures to show that he would prefer a special relationship with the United States."" He also noted that Panama in recent years has moved closer to China, meaning the US has strategic reasons to keep its relationship with the Central American nation friendly.Panama is also a US partner on stopping illegal immigration from South America - perhaps Trump's biggest policy priority.""If you're going to pick a fight with Panama on an issue,"" Gedan said, ""you could not find a worse one than the canal.""","Donald Trump is threatening to take back the Panama Canal. The US agreed to cede control of the waterway to Panama in the 1970s. The waterway links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. It spares ships having to go an additional roughly 7,000 miles to sail around Cape Horn.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116614779,imgsize-1902162,width-400,resizemode-4/116614779.jpg"

NYC subway horror

New York Times

Officials warn of 'serious consequences'

Police chief defends officer seen in video

Previous attacks on trains

Sebastian Zapeta-Calil , a 33-year-old man who allegedly burned a woman on a subway train in New York City, was charged with first-degree murder and arson on Monday. Videos circulating on social media show the woman on fire in a subway doorway, with a man appearing to fan the flames.The incident occurred early Sunday on a parked F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station in New York City. Police said Zapeta-Calil approached the woman and set her clothing on fire with a lighter. The victim, who has not been identified, was apparently homeless. Sitting at the end of the subway car, the victim was consumed by flames within seconds. Disturbing video footage shows the suspect watching the incident with a chillingly indifferent demeanor as the victim burned.Police said that the victim did not know Zapeta-Calil. They reportedly rode the same train from Queens to Coney Island, where the attack occurred.NYPD commissioner Jessica Tisch called the attack “one of the most depraved crimes one person could possibly commit.”Following the attack, teenagers reported spotting a man who resembled the suspect on another train, which led to Zapeta-Calil's arrest. Police said they found a lighter in his pocket. The suspect gave police the address of a Brooklyn homeless shelter for men with drug problems.Zapeta-Calil was charged with first-degree murder and arson in the case, according to areport.Federal immigration officials said Zapeta-Calil is a Guatemalan immigrant who was deported in 2018 and returned illegally.Brooklyn district attorney Eric Gonzalez said, ""This gruesome and senseless act of violence against a vulnerable woman will be met with the most serious consequences.""US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said it would lodge an immigration detainer against Zapeta-Calil if he is released from local custody. A detainer is a notification from immigration authorities stating their intent to take someone into custody if they are released from the local criminal justice system.Mayor Eric Adams said immigrants who impede others' pursuit of the ""American dream"" are not welcome, saying, ""We need to immediately remove them from our country after they serve their time.""Police chief of transit Joseph Gulotta defended an officer seen in video walking by the burning woman, saying the officer was securing the crime scene. ""I commend that one officer who stayed there, made sure he kept the crime scene the way it's supposed to be, made sure he kept an eye on what was going on,"" Gulotta said. ""So I think he did his job perfectly. As his fellow officers went and got MTA workers, got fire extinguishers, and eventually were able to extinguish the individual.”This attack is the latest in a series of subway crimes. A stabbing on a 7 train earlier Sunday left one dead and another injured. Despite these incidents, police statistics show overall subway crime is down 6% this year through October compared to last year, according to a New York Times report.","Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, 33, charged with first-degree murder and arson in New York City subway attack.

SYDNEY: Australia's prime minister said on Tuesday his government is working to secure a ""positive outcome"" after a video emerged of an Australian man captured by Russian forces in Ukraine.In video footage that first emerged online on Sunday, the man is seen with his hands tied and being slapped across the face by a man speaking Russian.The man said he was a biology teacher named Oscar Jenkins and that he had joined the armed forces because he wanted to help Ukraine. Australian media verified the man's identity.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters his office had made ""appropriate representations"" with Russian officials.""Our Australian embassy in Moscow has also made representations to secure a positive outcome,"" he said.A diplomatic source told Australia's national broadcaster ABC that the government believed the video was legitimate and was working to determine when it was filmed.Acting Foreign Minister Mark Dreyfus urged the Russian government to ""fully adhere to its obligations under international humanitarian law , including with respect to prisoners of war"".""Our immediate priority is understanding where Mr Jenkins is and confirming his wellbeing,"" Dreyfus said.He said his department was providing support to Jenkins' family and urged Australians not to travel to Ukraine.Ukrainian-born Kateryna Argyrou, who runs the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations, said she felt ""sick"" when she saw the video of Jenkins.""I was also surprised and touched to hear him speaking Ukrainian,"" she told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper.""He'd really made an effort to learn the language.

The lawsuit

Misleading payment practices





Walmart and Branch Messenger's response

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), an independent agency of the US government, sued Walmart and the workforce payments company Branch Messenger on Monday for allegedly forcing delivery drivers to use specific bank accounts, costing them more than $10 million in junk fees and misleading them about payment access. The lawsuit focuses on Walmart’s Spark Driver program , which utilises gig workers for deliveries.The CFPB alleged in the lawsuit that Walmart forced drivers in its Spark Driver program to open and use Branch accounts for receiving their pay. It claimed that Walmart and Branch opened accounts for drivers without their consent, depositing earnings directly into Branch accounts. Walmart allegedly told drivers they had to use Branch and threatened termination for non-compliance.""Today, the CFPB sued Walmart Inc. and Branch Messenger, Inc. for forcing gig economy drivers to use costly and risky accounts to get paid and for deceiving workers about how they could access their earnings,"" the CFPB said in a statement on the social media platform X.The lawsuit also said that Walmart and Branch misled drivers about accessing their earnings quickly, resulting in over $10 million in fees for drivers transferring money to their preferred accounts.“Walmart made false promises, illegally opened accounts, and took advantage of more than a million delivery drivers,” said CFPB director Rohit Chopra. “Companies cannot force workers into getting paid through accounts that drain their earnings with junk fees.”Walmart runs the Spark Driver program nationally. Branch, a financial technology company, provides a digital bank account through Evolve Bank & Trust.The lawsuit accuses Branch of additional illegal activities, including failing to investigate errors, ignoring stop payment requests, and neglecting required record-keeping.The CFPB alleges these violations occurred for roughly two years, beginning in 2021. The lawsuit aims to halt the practices, compensate affected drivers, and impose a financial penalty payable to the CFPB’s victim relief fund. This penalty would be paid into the CFPB’s victims relief fund.Both Walmart and Branch Messenger denied the allegations. They accused the CFPB of not giving them sufficient time to respond before filing the lawsuit.“We look forward to vigorously defending the company before a court that, unlike the CFPB, honors the due process of law,” Walmart said.The CFPB's action follows its other initiatives concerning worker protections, including guidance on background checks and employer-driven debt. This marks the CFPB’s first action against a fintech partner of Evolve Bank & Trust related to deposit accounts, though the agency has previously sued another Evolve partner in the short-term loan sector. The Federal Reserve also took action against Evolve Bank & Trust in June for failing to oversee its fintech partners.","The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) sued Walmart and the workforce payments company Branch Messenger on Monday.

Trump Wants To Buy Greenland: 'Absolute necessity': Why Trump wants to buy Greenland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/absolute-necessity-why-trump-wants-to-buy-greenland/articleshow/116605013.cms,"Donald Trump hinted he still wants to buy Greenland, a self-ruling territory of Denmark, saying that US ownership and control of the island is an “absolute necessity” for national security.The US President-elect reopened a debate from 2019, when he offered to buy what is the world’s biggest island, a proposal that was quickly rebuffed by Denmark at the time.“For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World,” Trump said on Truth Social Sunday, “the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.”Greenland is already crucial to American national defence, being home to a US air base and a radar station. The war in Ukraine has dramatically increased the territory’s military value to the US and NATO, given the island’s strategic location between the Arctic and the North Atlantic.Trump made the statement on Sunday as he nominated PayPal co-founder Ken Howery for US ambassador to the Kingdom of Denmark. Howery responded on X saying he would work to “deepen the bonds” between the US, Denmark and Greenland. Howery was an ambassador to Sweden from 2019 to 2021, under Trump’s first administration.Commenting on Trump’s post, Greenland’s Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede said by email that the island is “not for sale and will never be for sale.” However, he said Greenland must continue to be open to cooperation and trade directly with other countries, especially its neighbors.The autonomous authority published a blueprint for its foreign, security and defence policy earlier this year, in which it outlined hopes to forge closer links with North America through trade in critical minerals and by having a bigger say in key defence relationships that have historically been governed by Denmark.Trump’s proposal to buy Greenland in 2019 triggered tensions between the US and Denmark, with Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen describing it as “absurd,” making it clear Greenland was not for sale. The Danish government didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump’s more recent statement.The renewed interest in Greenland comes as Trump on Sunday threatened to retake control over the Panama Canal and earlier in the week suggested Canada could become the US’s 51st state.","Donald Trump says US ownership and control of Greenland is an 'absolute necessity' The US President-elect reopened a debate from 2019, when he offered to buy what is the world's biggest island.

Coast guardsmen from Barnegat Light, New Jersey, are voicing frustration after federal officials dismissed their accounts of being followed by a fleet of drones while patrolling the Atlantic Ocean earlier this month.A Coast guard member, speaking anonymously, shared his disbelief, stating, “It’s the implication that’s insulting.”“It’s implying we’re making things up, when the ones making up things are down in Washington, DC.”The sailor’s comments came shortly after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) imposed temporary flight restrictions over parts of New Jersey and New York. He was among 12 crew members aboard the 47-foot rescue vessel that encountered the drones on the evening of the sighting.“We were actually out there to see if we could spot any drones, because of all these sightings,” the sailor explained. “Well, we found some drones. Or more accurately, they found us.”According to the sailor, the drones appeared suddenly around 9 pm and followed the vessel for about 15 minutes. The drone swarm mirrored the boat’s movements, shifting direction as the boat did. “They had four propellers, about seven feet across, with festive red, green, and white flashing lights,” he said. The drones flew at an estimated 80 to 100 feet above the vessel.The swarm kept pace with the Department of Homeland Security boat, which was travelling at around 20 knots (just over 20 miles per hour). The drones eventually ascended, climbing an additional 100 feet before veering left towards the shoreline and disappearing from sight.The sailor is adamant that these were no ordinary commercial drones. “Commercial airplanes don’t move like that. We know what drones look and sound like,” he said.However, White House spokesman John Kirby downplayed the Coast Guard’s account, suggesting the drones could have been a mix of commercial, hobbyist, and law enforcement drones, as well as aircraft and even stars mistakenly identified as drones. Kirby stated that the sightings presented no national security or public safety threat, and suggested that the Coast Guard might have confused incoming airliners with drones.The Coast Guardsman disagreed, saying, “I can’t pretend to know what’s going on, but those weren’t the types of drones you can buy at the store. These were government drones.”The sailor added, “I don’t care what Kirby or [DHS head Alejandro] Mayorkas say — they’re full of sh-t.” He stressed that while their orders were to observe and not engage with the drones, they would have taken defensive action if the drones had acted aggressively.Local officials, including Representatives Chris Smith and Jeff Van Drew, have criticised the federal response, demanding a clear explanation for the mysterious drone activity, the New York Post quoted.Since November 18, more than 1,000 drone sightings have been reported over New Jersey, with dozens more in New York’s airspace, raising growing concerns over the presence of drones in civilian airspace. Federal authorities, however, maintain that the sightings pose no security threat.","Coast guardsmen from Barnegat Light, New Jersey, are voicing frustration after federal officials dismissed their accounts of being followed by a fleet of drones.

US President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday picked Chennai-born venture capitalist and Elon Musk confidant Sriram Krishnan as the White House advisor on Artificial Intelligence policy , triggering consternation among some MAGA radicals about immigrant roles in the incoming administration.In a post on social media, Trump said Sriram Krishnan ""will focus on ensuring continued American leadership in A.I., and help shape and coordinate A.I. policy across Government,"" noting that his putative A.I czar started his career at Microsoft as a founding member of Windows Azure.Krishnan subsequently led product teams at Twitter, Yahoo!, and Facebook, before returning to Twitter-turned-X in 2022 after Musk bought it to help him rebuild the platform, when he was already a general partner of the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz. The firm's key principal Marc Andreesen, the founder of Netscape, has been a major Trump supporter, and has, like Elon Musk, been camping at Mar-a-Lago to help with the transition.Trump also said Sriram will be working closely with the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology and David Sacks, like Musk another South African-American whom he has named as the White House crypto czar.Acknowledging Trump's announcement Krishnan said he is ""honored to be able to serve our country and ensure continued American leadership in AI ,"" amid disquiet from some of the more nativist MAGA flock on social media.""Someone should tell Donald Trump that AI doesn’t stand for import Another Indian,"" wrote one critic, even as MAGA nativists dredged out Krishnan's past social media posts in which he had called for allowing H1B visa holders to start companies or transition to entrepreneur visas, among other things.In a ""wishlist"" he posted on December 3, Krishnan had also called for fast tracking green cards for technical fields - engineering and hard sciences. ""Anything to remove country caps for green cards / unlock skilled immigration would be huge,"" he had said in an earlier post.Groups opposed to the H1-B visa regime and tech immigration bristled at the idea. ""This has nothing to do with skilled immigration. This has to do with @sriramk having ethnic loyalty to his fellow Indians who have exploited the H-1B visa system for gaining immigration benefits,"" a group called Project for Immigration Reform clapped back.""The majority of H-1Bs are Indians coming via some IT body shop displace American workers. And Sriram wants to reward this practice with green cards?"" it asked.Another online group called @USTechWorkers that has long railed against the H1B system called it ""a very questionable appointment by @realDonaldTrump,"" noting that ""@sriramk’s pet issue is expanding the H-1B visa program and removing country cap quotas for Green Cards. Not America First at all.""However, Trump's choice of Krishnan was welcomed by the broader tech commentariat. ""The appointment of a tech-savvy leader like Krishnan reflects the Trump administration’s recognition of AI as a critical element for global competitiveness. For enterprises, this could bring regulatory clarity or, conversely, added scrutiny in areas such as data sharing, intellectual property, and the ethical use of AI,"" the journal CIO noted.","Sriram Krishnan is a venture capitalist who worked at Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter.

Biden’s Decision: A Line Drawn at Hate and Terrorism



President Joe Biden's decision to commute the sentences of nearly all federal death row inmates stands as one of his most consequential acts of clemency. Yet, even as he commuted the sentences of 37 men, sparing them from federal execution, three individuals convicted of some of the most notorious and heinous crimes in recent US history were excluded from this reprieve. Their crimes, marked by hatred, terror, and mass murder, continue to resonate with national and international audiences.Robert D. Bowers, now 52, carried out the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in US history. On October 27, 2018, Bowers stormed the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, during Shabbat services. Armed with an AR-15-style rifle and multiple handguns, he murdered 11 worshippers and injured several others, including police officers responding to the attack.Bowers' actions were fueled by antisemitic hatred, as evidenced by his social media activity and statements made during the attack. He accused Jews of supporting immigration policies he opposed and declared his intention to kill as many Jews as possible. His crime sent shockwaves through the country, sparking renewed debates about hate crimes , gun control, and the rise of extremism in the US.Dylann Roof, now 30, is a white supremacist who carried out the 2015 mass shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Posing as a Bible study participant, Roof joined the parishioners for nearly an hour before opening fire, killing nine Black worshippers, including the church's pastor, Rev. Clementa Pinckney.Roof’s motive was rooted in racial hatred. He later admitted that he chose the church specifically because of its historical significance to the Black community. Roof hoped his actions would incite a race war, a goal he detailed in a racist manifesto he published online. His lack of remorse and overtly hateful ideology made him the first person in US history sentenced to death for a federal hate crime.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, now 31, carried out the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing alongside his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev. The attack, executed with homemade pressure cooker bombs, killed three people, including an eight-year-old boy, and injured more than 260 others, many of whom suffered life-altering injuries such as amputations.The bombing was an act of terrorism aimed at punishing the US for its military actions. In the ensuing manhunt, the Tsarnaev brothers killed an MIT police officer and engaged in a violent confrontation with law enforcement, during which Tamerlan was killed. Dzhokhar was apprehended shortly thereafter. During his trial, evidence showed his continued support for extremist ideologies, which contributed to his death sentence.President Biden's commutations were grounded in his long-standing opposition to the death penalty, reinforced by a moratorium on federal executions issued during his administration. However, Biden drew a firm line when it came to mass killings driven by hate or terror. In his statement, Biden underscored his belief that while the death penalty should generally be abolished, exceptions must be made for ""cases of terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder.""These three men represent the kinds of crimes Biden deemed beyond the scope of clemency, crimes that not only claimed innocent lives but also targeted entire communities with terror and hatred. For the families of their victims, as well as many others, their continued presence on federal death row signals the profound weight of justice in the face of unforgivable acts.Biden’s nuanced approach has been praised and criticized, reflecting the deep divisions in public opinion on the death penalty, particularly in cases as infamous and devastating as these.","President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of nearly all federal death row inmates.

US President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to restore the original name of the United States’ tallest mountain, nearly a decade after former President Barack Obama renamed it to honour Alaska’s native community.The 20,000-foot peak, located in Denali National Park and Preserve in south-central Alaska, had been known as Mount McKinley since 1917. The name honoured the 25th US president, William McKinley, who was assassinated in 1901.However, in 2015, Obama signed an order renaming the mountain Denali, which means ""The High One"" in the local Athabascan language, reflecting its traditional name among Alaska's indigenous people, as per the New York Post.Speaking at a rally in Phoenix on Sunday, Trump criticised the decision and reaffirmed his plans to reverse it. “They took his name off Mount McKinley,” Trump told his supporters. “He was a great president. That’s one of the reasons that we’re going to bring back the name of Mount McKinley, because I think he deserves it.”William McKinley, who served as president from 1897, was known for his efforts to promote US industry through protective tariffs and for leading the country to victory in the Spanish-American War. Critics of Obama’s 2015 order pointed out that McKinley had never visited the mountain and had no significant historical ties to Alaska.Denali had already been officially recognised as the peak’s name by the state of Alaska in 1975, and local leaders had long lobbied for federal recognition of the indigenous name. During Trump’s first term in office, he reportedly discussed the matter with Alaska’s Republican senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan in March 2017, according to CNN. Both senators, however, advised him to retain the name Denali.As Trump prepares for his upcoming term, the proposal to reinstate Mount McKinley’s name has reignited debate over the balance between honouring historical figures and respecting indigenous heritage.","US President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to restore the original name of the United States' tallest mountain.

This offer represents a 42 per cent premium on the company's stock price from March 18, the day before media reports of the potential acquisition emerged. In addition, the Nordstrom family will assume over $2 billion in debt according to CBS news.As a privately held business, Nordstrom will have more flexibility to address long-standing challenges, including the plunging sales that many department stores have faced in recent years. Retailers like Macy's and Kohl's have been under pressure from major investors to deliver greater returns while contending with competition from lower-cost rivals like Walmart and Amazon.Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData, noted that while a change in ownership alone won't solve all of Nordstrom's problems, it will give the family and their backers the freedom to adopt a long-term perspective. ""While a change in ownership does not automatically remedy all of the problems with the department store operation, it will allow the family and their backers to take a long term view of the business and make necessary investments and changes away from the short term scrutiny of public markets,"" he said in a research note.In early trading, Nordstrom's stock fell by 36 cents, or 1.5 per cent, to $24.17.

Additionally, the board has authorised a special dividend of up to 25 cents per share, contingent on the deal closing and based on the company's cash reserves at the time.The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025, at which point Nordstrom’s shares will no longer be publicly traded.

Copying Cirus

MUMBAI: A little-known incident in the history of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme is a purported attempt made by the country in the early ’70s to copy the design of India’s Cirus reactor — a 40 MW thermal neutron research facility, which first achieved criticality at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Trombay, near Mumbai, on July 10, 1960. An acronym for Canada India Reactor Utility Services, Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million, according to news reports.Pakistan’s attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan , a man who played a role in the neighbouring country’s nuclear weapons programme. In his book “Eating Grass: The Making Of The Pakistani Bomb”, published in 2012 by the Stanford University Press, Feroz wrote, “Munir Ahmed Khan, later chairman of the PAEC [Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission], recalled that in October 1965 he had met Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto [the then Pakistan foreign minister] in Vienna. Munir explained to him that he had been to India’s Cirus facility at Trombay in 1964 and saw for himself that India was well on its way to making the [nuclear] bomb. Bhutto asked Munir to meet Ayub Khan in December during Ayub’s upcoming visits to the United Kingdom and the United States and try to convince the president of the urgency of a weapons programme.” The country eventually carried out its first nuclear weapons tests on May 28 and 30, 1998.Feroz’s disclosure, though now 12 years old, assumes immediate significance in the context of the US last week announcing fresh sanctions on Pakistan’smissile development programme. For the first time, the measures target Pakistan’s state-run National Development Complex, for its role in the country’s mission development programme. US deputy NSA Jon Finer has said, “Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology… If these trends continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.”Feroz’s writing about the Cirus reactor is important because the plutonium for India’s Smiling Buddha project — the country’s first nuclear weapons test at Pokhran on May 18, 1974 — was from this reactor.According to Feroz, “Pakistani leadership wanted the rights to copy technological designs for its indigenous programme without incurring penalties and while remaining on the ‘good side’ of the international system.” He recalled: “While work to commission KANUPP [Karachi Nuclear Power Complex] went on, Munir Ahmed Khan said that there would be a secret team headed by a nuclear official, Sardar Ali Khan, to work on replicating India’s Cirus reactor.The author quotes Pervez Butt, who was purportedly part of the secret “copying’’ team and was chairman of PAEC between 2001 and 2005, as telling him, “Our team worked tirelessly, I did the mechanical part. When we merged our work and presented, Munir Khan could not believe it.”Feroz, however, has questioned Pakistan’s decision to copy the design of the Cirus reactor because there were some fundamental differences between Cirus and Kanupp.The team had modified the basic Cirus design.","Pakistan's attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan. Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million. Pakistan eventually carried out its first nuclear weapons tests on May 28 and 30, 1998.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116608587,imgsize-760319,width-400,resizemode-4/116608587.jpg"

Meaningful dialogue based on positive intentions should be held,"" PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said.He stressed that the potential talks should have a defined timeframe, adding that the dialogue must progress positively considering the sensitivity of the situation.National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq had taken the lead by offering on Wednesday that he was ready to host the two sides and facilitate their parleys.He welcomed the newly constituted committee and invited the government and opposition for talks, saying ""the speaker's office is always open for members"", according to a statement issued by the NA Secretariat.The speaker called on members of both committees to meet on Monday morning, adding that he would meet them at his chambers in Parliament House.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram said his party accepted the speaker's invitation to meet. He said their committee will attend the meeting on Monday.Akram said the PTI founder will be informed about the progress of the meeting and he will decide whether to cancel the civil disobedience movement .The talks are being held after the PTI had threatened to give a call for civil disobedience.The party posted on X from the account of the jailed former prime minister regarding the call for civil disobedience movement, which was initially shared on December 19, stating that the campaign will be launched if the government doesn't make progress on the party's demands by Sunday.""I had presented two demands to the government, the release of under-trial political prisoners and the establishment of a judicial commission for a transparent investigation into the events of May 9, 2023 and November 26, 2024,"" the post quoted PTI founder Khan. It further stated that both of these demands ""are legitimate"".""If the government fails to take any action on them by Sunday, the first phase of the civil disobedience movement - 'remittance boycott' - will be launched,"" it said.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram also reiterated that the civil disobedience drive would be launched tomorrow (Monday) if the party's demands go unmet.However, the issue of civil disobedience has been apparently put on hold for some time while allowing the two sides to address the differences through political means.Khan, 72, on December 5 had warned of a civil disobedience movement from December 14 if his demands about the release of political prisoners facing trial and the formation of a judicial commission to probe the events of May 9, 2023, and November 26 this year were unmet.Meanwhile, Pakistan's military courts sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for attacking military installations during riots which erupted following the arrest of Khan in May last year, the Army announced on Saturday.On May 9, 2023, Khan's PTI supporters allegedly attacked several military installations, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and the ISI building in Faisalabad, to vent their anger against the arrest of their party founder in a corruption case.Hundreds of suspects were arrested in the countrywide swoop and at least 103 were handed over to the military authorities for trial due to their involvement in attacks on military installations.Khan's party has launched multiple protests through 2023 and 2024 demanding the release of their supreme leader, the latest being in November 2024.The former prime minister, currently lodged at the Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, was arrested in August last year and faces multiple cases since his government was toppled in April 2022.","The committee includes deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan.

"1,566 terror attacks killed 924 in Pakistan over past 10 months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/1566-terror-attacks-killed-924-in-pakistan-over-past-10-months/articleshow/116551393.cms,"KARACHI: Ten years have passed since Ajoon Khan's son died in a ghastly attack by the Pakistani Taliban that killed about 150 people, mostly children, at a military-run school in Peshawar, in northwestern Pakistan. But the pain of loss is unrelenting - it grows only deeper with time. Khan, a lawyer, said he could never forget the parents sobbing and pleading outside the school gates.The brutal assault on the school in Peshawar led to rare political unity in support of a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy for Pakistan and a vast military operation in the country's former tribal areas near Afghanistan. The efforts forced militants to retreat across the border and brought a degree of relative peace to Pakistan. Large-scale terrorist attacks were significantly reduced, with fatalities dropping from 2,451 across 1,717 attacks in 2013 to 220 in 146 attacks in 2020. But the hard-won gains are now in jeopardy.Over the past few years, violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan. Experts attribute the increase to the Afghan Taliban's seizure of power in neighbouring Afghanistan in Aug 2021.Last week, the interior ministry reported that 924 people, including civilians and law enforcement personnel, had been killed in 1,566 terrorist attacks across the country over the past 10 months. It said 341 terrorists had been killed during the period.Early on Saturday, sixteen soldiers were killed in northwest Pakistan in an attack by Islamist militants, a senior police official in the South Waziristan region said. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack, giving a higher figure for the number of personnel killed, Reuters reported.Experts and security officials have identified a range of challenges impeding Pakistan's progress against terrorism: political instability, weak governance, dwindling public support, economic constraints and reduced US counterterrorism assistance after the end of the 20-year war in Afghanistan.""The greatest challenge lies in mobilising the necessary financial resources and manpower for operations across such vast regions,"" said Muhammad Amir Rana, director of the Pak Institute for Peace Studies, a security think tank in Islamabad. The source of the problem for Pakistan, experts say, is found across the border, in Afghanistan.The Taliban administration in Kabul, the Afghan capital, denies accusations of harbouring militants from TTP. But Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace, said the TTP had been given ""a permissive safe haven in Afghanistan,"" which had allowed it to become ""resilient and lethal.""Pakistani security officials privately acknowledged that they had misjudged how the new Taliban rulers of Afghanistan would handle TTP. The officials had anticipated that the Taliban leaders would help curb the TTP in return for the covert support that Pakistan had provided them during the US-led war. Instead, the Taliban in Kabul have provided the TTP with resources and advanced American-made weapons and equipment seized after the collapse of the US-supported Afghan govt, according to a senior security official in Islamabad who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The TTP has gone on to unleash a wave of attacks inside Pakistan as it wages a campaign whose aim is to overthrow the govt. Among them was a suicide bombing in January 2023 that killed over 100 people at a mosque in Peshawar.Pakistani security forces have also been locked in a conflict with ethnic separatist groups in Balochistan, an arid province bordering Afghanistan and Iran that is home to the Chinese-run port Gwadar. nyt","Violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan.

Pakistan’s military announced Saturday that 25 civilians have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their alleged involvement in violent protests following the arrest of former PM Imran Khan on May 9 last year, which resulted in the death of at least eight people.Khan’s supporters stormed govt buildings and military installations. The military’s statement detailed that the convictions relate primarily to attacks on key military sites, including Jinnah House (the Lahore corps commander’s residence), General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, and a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) base in Mianwali.The sentences were issued by Field General Court Martial as part of the first phase of trials. Supreme Court had earlier conditionally allowed military courts to pronounce verdicts for 85 civilians detained in connection with the riots.The military statement highlighted that the convicts have the right to appeal and other legal recourses as guaranteed by law.The May 9 violence led to the arrest of many politicians and supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party. PTI has denied involvement in the violence. However, govt and military maintain that the attacks were meticulously planned and executed by PTI brass.Khan and his party have called for a judicial probe into the May 9 events, claiming the violence was a “false flag” operation intended to suppress PTI.PTI condemned the military court’s decision. National Assembly leader of opposition Omar Ayub wrote on X: “Military court sentences against civilians rejected. The detainees are civilians and cannot be tried by military courts.” He labelled the process as “kangaroo courts”.PTI’s US chapter criticised the rulings. “Colonels and majors, acting as judges, have sentenced civilians it tried in military courts. These civilians were held for over a year in harsh conditions, with many tortured into giving false confessions,” it posted on X.Amnesty International also denounced the military court’s decision, describing it as “an intimidation tactic, designed to crack down on dissent”.Army’s media wing Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) referred to the protests as “politically provoked violence and arson”. ISPR said further sentences for the remaining accused will be announced once the legal process is completed.",25 civilians have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years.

Sixteen Pakistani soldiers were killed and five critically injured on Saturday after militants attacked an army post near the Afghan border.The attack happened overnight in the Makeen area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, roughly 40 kms (24 miles) from the border.More than 30 militants assaulted the post, according to two intelligence officials who spoke to AFP (anonymously).

Driving the news

Speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, US deputy national security adviser Jon Finer described Pakistan’s missile advancements as a troubling shift in the country’s strategic posture.

described Pakistan’s missile advancements as a troubling shift in the country’s strategic posture. “Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology, from long-range ballistic missile systems to equipment that would enable the testing of significantly larger rocket motors,” Finer said.

“If these trends continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.”

This revelation comes on the heels of Washington imposing a fresh wave of sanctions on Pakistan’s missile program. For the first time, the measures target Pakistan’s state-run National Development Complex, alongside three private Karachi-based companies accused of supporting missile development.

Why it matters

Finer’s revelation marks a stark turning point in US-Pakistan relations, underscoring a broader erosion of trust since the 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Historically viewed as a key partner in counterterrorism, Pakistan’s ballistic missile advancements are now seen as a direct challenge to US security.

The move also raises critical questions about whether Pakistan’s missile program, long designed as a counter to India, is shifting toward broader ambitions with potentially global consequences.

Two senior US officials, speaking anonymously, revealed that Washington has repeatedly pressed Islamabad to explain the development of more powerful rocket engines but received evasive responses. “They don’t acknowledge our concerns. They tell us we are biased,” said one official.

This development places Pakistan alongside nations like Russia, North Korea, and China—states identified by the US as adversaries with nuclear weapons and missile systems capable of reaching American soil.

The strain in US-Pakistan relations reflects a broader geopolitical realignment in South Asia. Pakistan continues to cultivate strong ties with China while voicing concerns about US defense cooperation with India, including technology transfers and joint missile projects.

The big picture

Sanctions imposed:

The US has sanctioned Pakistan’s National Development Complex over proliferation-related concerns tied to ballistic missile development.This is a big deal; unlike recent rounds of US sanctions, this targets a government entity instead of just companies. Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Center’s South Asia Institute

Zoom in: Eroding US-Pakistan ties

The tensions over Pakistan’s missile program reflect a larger deterioration in the once-robust US-Pakistan partnership.

Historical context: Pakistan was a key ally during the Cold War and a central partner in the US-led war on terror, particularly after the 9/11 attacks. However, relations have soured over the years due to Pakistan’s alleged support for Taliban factions and its increasingly close ties with China.

India factor: The US-India defense relationship has grown stronger in recent years, underpinned by agreements like the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) and the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA). Washington has facilitated India’s acquisition of advanced missile systems, which has drawn criticism from Islamabad for allegedly undermining regional stability.

What it means for India

Accelerating India's missile programs:

India’s strategic reassessment:

Proxy conflicts:

Nuclear security risks:

Strengthening India-US ties

What’s next

The US administration is expected to maintain pressure on Pakistan through diplomatic channels and additional sanctions, while continuing to bolster ties with India.

The US appears to view Pakistan’s missile development as a broader shift in its strategic posture. Finer emphasized that Pakistan’s actions raise “real questions” about its intentions, particularly given its long-standing partnership with the US in security and counterterrorism.

Washington is also likely to encourage other countries to scrutinize Pakistan’s missile program as part of broader non-proliferation efforts.

Pakistan, however, is expected to deepen its reliance on China, which has historically supported its missile program and nuclear ambitions.

The United States has expressed alarm over Pakistan’s ongoing development of long-range ballistic missiles, a move Washington sees as an emerging security threat.Meanwhile, Washington’s public condemnation of Pakistan’s missile program could fuel further regional instability.The US State Department sanctioned Pakistan’s NDC for its involvement in developing long-range missile systems. This marks the first time a Pakistani state-owned enterprise has faced direct sanctions tied to missile production. Three Karachi-based companies—Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, Affiliates International, and Rockside Enterprise—were also sanctioned for supporting the program.Islamabad has dismissed the US sanctions as “discriminatory” and warned that such actions could upset the region’s strategic balance. Its Foreign Office defended the missile program as “defensive in nature,” aimed solely at countering Indian aggression and preserving peace in South Asia.Pakistani officials argue that their missile program is not intended to target the US. Diplomatic sources in Islamabad insist the program is designed to counter perceived threats from India, with whom Pakistan has fought three wars since 1947, a Reuters report said.In a strongly worded statement, the Pakistani Foreign Office accused the US of “double standards.” It criticized Washington for imposing sanctions on Pakistani entities while granting India waivers for advanced military technology. “Such policies have dangerous implications for the strategic stability of our region and beyond,” the statement read.Pakistan's development of long-range missiles may prompt India to fast-track its missile initiatives, particularly the Agni series, and enhance its Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) systems.Pakistan’s expanded missile range could push India to reevaluate its nuclear policies, potentially reconsidering its no-first-use stance or enhancing second-strike capabilities.Pakistan’s growing confidence, potentially bolstered by Chinese support, might lead to more aggressive postures, including cross-border skirmishes.The growing political instability in Pakistan increases the risk of its nuclear assets falling into the hands of radical groups, posing a significant threat to India and the world.: Pakistan's missile advancements could lead to closer India-US defense cooperation, including technology transfers and intelligence sharing.(With inputs from agencies)","US deputy national security adviser Jon Finer described Pakistan's missile advancements as a troubling shift in the country's strategic posture.

A senior White House official on Thursday said that Pakistan's development of sophisticated missile technology, including long range ballistic missiles , represents an emerging threat to the United States.The statement comes in the wake of sanctions imposed on four Pakistani entities, including the state-owned national development complex (NDC), for their role in advancing Pakistan's missile program.Principal deputy national security advisor Jon Finer, speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on Thursday, outlined the Biden administration’s growing concerns over Pakistan's missile development activities.“Simply put, we are going to keep the pressure on Pakistan regarding its long-range missile program, even as we also continue to seek diplomatic resolutions to address our concerns,” Finer said.The sanctions announced Wednesday target the NDC, based in Islamabad, which oversees Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, as well as three Karachi-based entities: Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, Affiliates International, and Rockside Enterprise.These entities were identified as contributors to the program, prompting what Finer called “necessary measures to curb these advancements.”Finer pointed out the significance of the sanctions. “This is the first time we have sanctioned a Pakistani state-owned enterprise tied to missile development,” he said.According to Finer, Pakistan’s recent advancements include the development of long-range ballistic missile systems and technologies that enable testing of larger rocket motors. “If these trend lines continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States, raising real questions about Pakistan's intentions,” he added.The official pointed out that only a small group of nations—Russia, North Korea, and China—possess nuclear weapons and missile capabilities capable of directly reaching the US, making Pakistan's actions particularly concerning. “It is hard for us to see Pakistan's actions as anything other than an emerging threat to the United States,” Finer said.Despite longstanding ties between the US and Pakistan in areas such as counter-terrorism and development, Finer expressed frustration over Islamabad's apparent disregard for American concerns. “We have provided support to Islamabad during difficult times and continue to desire a cooperative relationship in areas of shared interest,” he said. “That makes us question even more why Pakistan would be motivated to develop a capability that could be used against us.”The Biden administration has already implemented three rounds of sanctions over the past year targeting non-Pakistani entities supporting Pakistan’s ballistic missile program.Finer stressed that the US would not tolerate the continued development of capabilities perceived as a direct threat. “The United States cannot, will not simply sit back and watch the development of this capability that we believe could pose a threat ultimately down the road,” he stated.“This is of such great concern because it raises fundamental questions about Pakistan's intentions, and we are determined to ensure our security and that of our allies,” he added further.","White House official: Pakistan's development of missile technology represents an emerging threat to the United States.

Pakistan slams US missile sanctions as ‘biased’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-slams-us-missile-sanctions-as-biased/articleshow/116480917.cms,"TOI correspondent from Islamabad:

Pakistan criticised the US Thursday for imposing more sanctions on its missile programme, saying it reflected Washington’s double standards and discriminatory practices.The response came hours after the US announced the additional sanctions on four entities in Pakistan, claiming they were contributing to proliferation and delivery systems of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).The US State Department identified the firms as Islamabad-based National Development Complex (NDC) and three companies in the southern port city of Karachi: Affiliates International, Akhtar and Sons Private Ltd, and Rockside Enterprise.State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the measures were imposed under an executive order that “targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.” “The US will continue to act against proliferation and associated procurement activities of concern,” Miller said.In its reaction, Pakistan’s foreign ministry termed the decision “unfortunate and biased”, insisting that its strategic capabilities were meant to defend its sovereignty and preserve peace and stability in South Asia. According to the ministry, the sanctions defied the “objective of peace and security by aiming to accentuate military asymmetries,” an apparent reference to Pakistan’s rivalry with nuclear-armed India. “Such policies have dangerous implications for the strategic stability of our region and beyond,” the ministry said.The US had also imposed sanctions on Pakistani firms and a Chinese research institute in the past over alleged support and involvement in proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. “Similar listings of commercial entities in the past were based on mere doubts and suspicion without any evidence whatsoever. While claiming strict adherence to non-proliferation norms, licensing requirements for advanced military technology to other countries have been waived off in the past,” the ministry said.“Such double standards and discriminatory practices not only undermine the credibility of non-proliferation regimes but also endanger regional and international peace and security,” it added.According to the State Department, Islamabad-based NDC had sought to obtain components for the country’s long-range ballistic-missile program and missile-testing equipment. It said the NDC “is responsible for the development of Pakistan’s ballistic missiles,” including the Shaheen family of missiles.The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a media outlet aimed to reduce man-made threats to human existence, said the Shaheen series of missiles is nuclear-capable. The Bulletin estimates Pakistan’s arsenal at about 170 warheads.In Sept this year, the US had imposed sanctions on a Chinese research institute and several companies involved in assisting Pakistan’s missile programme. Additional sanctions were imposed in Oct on China-based firms for supplying missile-applicable items to Pakistan.",The US State Department identified the firms as Islamabad-based National Development Complex (NDC) and three companies in the southern port city of Karachi. The measures were imposed under an executive order that “targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery”,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116480909,imgsize-14244,width-400,resizemode-4/116480909.jpg"

The move freezes any US-based assets belonging to the targeted entities and also forbids American citizens or businesses from engaging with them.“In light of the continuing proliferation threat of Pakistan’s long-range missile development, the United States is designating four entities for sanctions pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13382, which targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery,” a press release by the US Department of State said.The NDC, headquartered in Islamabad, plays a central role in Pakistan’s missile development efforts, according to a State Department factsheet. It has been actively seeking components for the country’s long-range ballistic missile systems, including the SHAHEEN family of missiles, which are believed to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads.Research by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists suggests that Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal now consists of approximately 170 warheads. The country conducted its first nuclear test back in 1998, and remains outside the Non-Proliferation Treaty which is an international agreement aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.The sanctions also target three private firms—Affiliates International, Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, and Rockside Enterprise—accused of helping the NDC acquire equipment for its missile programme.“The United States will continue to act against proliferation and procurement activities that pose a concern,” Miller further added in the release.The Pakistani embassy in Washington is yet to respond to the sanctions.",The U.S. has announced a fresh wave of sanctions targeting Pakistan’s long-range ballistic missile programme.

Plan to put Hasina on trial

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh on Monday sent India a note verbale (formal diplomatic note), requesting extradition of its ousted PM Sheikh Hasina ""We sent a note verbal (diplomatic message) to the Indian government saying that the Bangladesh government wants her (Hasina) back here for judicial process,"" foreign adviser Touhid Hossain told The Daily Star at the foreign ministry this afternoon.Home affairs adviser Lt Gen (retd) Jahangir Alam Chowdhury told Dhaka Tribune: ""We have a prisoner exchange agreement with India.

At this time, we have no comment to offer on this matter,"" the ministery of external affairs spokesperson said.Last month, Bangladesh's interim head Muhammad Yunus had announced that the government would seek Hasina's extradition from India. Hasina fled to India on August 5 this year after mass protests against her regime.The Nobel Laureate while addressing the nation on his 100th day in office, said that his administration would prosecute those accountable, including Hasina, for the numerous casualties during the student protests that concluded her 15-year leadership.""We will seek the return of the fallen autocrat Sheikh Hasina from India,"" Yunus said.""I have already discussed the issue with chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan,"" he added.Muhammad Yunus-led interim government, under the extradition treaty with India, plans to bring Hasina back ""to try her for mass killings during the student-led protests in July and August"".Md Tajul Islam, the newly-appointed chief prosecutor of Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), has said that Dhaka will file an application with ICT to issue an arrest warrant against Hasina. The extradition of Hasina, who faces 51 cases, including 42 for murder, is governed by the extradition treaty signed between Bangladesh and India in 2013 and amended in 2016. The treaty states that ""extradition may be refused if the offence for which it is requested is an offence of a political character.""However, it also specifies that certain offences, such as murder, ""shall not be regarded as offences of a political character"" for the purposes of the treaty. One ground for refusal of extradition is if the charges being pressed have not been ""made in good faith, in the interest of justice,"" according to the BSS report.","Bangladesh sent India a note verbale (formal diplomatic note), requesting extradition of its ousted PM Sheikh Hasina.

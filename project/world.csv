A vehicle collision outside Yong'an Primary School in Changde, Hunan province, on Tuesday morning left multiple children injured as they arrived for classes. The incident occurred at the school gate, with authorities still working to determine the number of casualties and the circumstances of the crash, Reuters reported quoting CCTV news.The incident adds to growing concerns about attacks targeting students in China, where schools have witnessed a string of violent episodes in recent months.On Saturday, a stabbing at a vocational school in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, left eight dead and 17 injured. The suspect, a 21-year-old former student, reportedly attacked in anger over academic and financial frustrations. Shortly before that, a man drove his vehicle into a crowd at a sports facility in Zhuhai, killing 35 people and injuring 43.In September, a knife attack in Shanghai resulted in three fatalities and 15 injuries, while a Japanese schoolboy was fatally stabbed on his way to school in Shenzhen. Japanese officials have since urged Beijing to strengthen safety measures for students.Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for stronger action to address the rise in such attacks, urging authorities to enhance preventive measures and protect vulnerable groups, particularly children.","Vehicle collision outside Yong'an Primary School in Changde, Hunan province, on Tuesday morning left multiple children injured.

Before election, Trump indicated he wanted the agency to strip broadcasters such as NBC and CBS of their licensing for unfair coverage.Carr, 45, was the author of a chapter on the FCC in the conservative Project 2025 planning document, in which he argued that the agency should also regulate the largest tech companies, such as Apple, Meta , Google and Microsoft.""The censorship cartel must be dismantled,"" Carr said last week on X.Carr could drastically reshape the independent agency, expanding its mandate and wielding it as a political weapon for the right, telecommunications attorneys and analysts said. They predicted Carr would test the legal limits of the agency's power by pushing to oversee companies such as Meta and Google, setting up a fierce battle with Silicon Valley.Carr won't have free rein to make changes. The Federal Trade Commission and the department of justice have taken on the biggest roles in regulating tech. Congress oversees the FCC's budget, and it would probably take new legislation to expand the agency's regulatory oversight over companies such as Google and Meta, which are not defined as communications services, legal experts said. The FCC is also prohibited from punishing television and radio stations for editorial decisions. Still, Carr could use the bully pulpit of the agency to pressure companies, the experts added.

STOCKHOLM: Sweden on Monday began sending millions of pamphlets advising residents how to prepare for possible war and Finland launched a new website, as Ukraine fights the grinding three-year Russian invasion.The Nordic neighbours have dropped decades of military non-alignment to join the US-led defence alliance Nato in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.""The security situation is serious and we all need to strengthen our resilience to face various crises and ultimately war,"" said Mikael Frisell, the director of the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) which sent out the brochures.Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Stockholm has repeatedly urged Swedes to prepare both mentally and logistically for the possibility of an armed conflict.After the end of the Cold War, the country drastically slashed its defence spending as it focused its military efforts on international peacekeeping missions.But it reversed course following Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.Since then, Stockholm has reintroduced limited conscription, massively increased defence spending and reopened a garrison on the Baltic Sea island of Gotland.It subsequently strengthened bomb shelters, shored up drinking water supplies and transport infrastructure, appointed a minister of civil defence and established a Psychological Defence Agency aimed at combatting disinformation.The 32-page booklet ""If Crisis or War Comes"", which started being distributed from Monday, contains information about how to prepare for war, natural disasters and cyber or terror attacks.Sent to 5.2 million households over the next two weeks, it is an updated version of a pamphlet that Sweden has issued five times since World War II.The new version doesn't mention Russia, Ukraine or other country by name.Civil defence minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin made waves in January when he warned ""there could be war in Sweden"".Sweden's then army chief Micael Byden also alarmed many when he days later said ""Swedes have to mentally prepare for war"".Sweden has not gone to war in more than two centuries.The new pamphlet says: ""Military threat levels are increasing. We must be prepared for the worst-case scenario -- an armed attack on Sweden"".The tips include stocking up non-perishable food and water, keeping cash on hand and growing fruit and vegetables in gardens.The previous version from 2018 was the first time the pamphlet had been sent out since 1961 at the height of the Cold War.MSB said the updated version had a stronger focus on preparing for war than in 2018.The brochure is available in print in both Swedish and English and digital versions are available in several other languages -- including Arabic, Farsi, Ukrainian, Polish, Somali and Finnish.Meanwhile, in a separate move, the government in Finland launched a website gathering information on preparedness for different crises.Finland shares a 1,340-kilometre (830-mile) border with Russia and Helsinki has maintained a higher level of preparedness.But after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Helsinki announced plans to build a 200-kilometre border fence with Russia.Three metres (10 feet) tall and topped with barbed wire, it is due to be completed by 2026.The country last year closed its eight border crossings with Russia, following an influx of migrants which Helsinki claimed was a hybrid attack orchestrated by Moscow.",Sweden sends millions of pamphlets advising residents how to prepare for possible war.

Russian media mocks Biden



'Nobody can reverse clean energy revolution'



Biden's legacy and the road ahead



The United States President Joe Biden made history Sunday by becoming the first sitting US leader to visit the Amazon rainforest. Biden, in Brazil to attend the G20 summit, used the moment to declare that there's no going back in America's "" clean energy revolution "" and highlighted the urgent need for climate action despite incoming political headwinds from President-elect Donald Trump Meanwhile, Russian state-controlled media outlet RT on social media mocked Biden by sharing a post, captioning, ""where are you going Joe?"" as he can be seen abruptly walking into the forest after his speech, rather than taking the designated path.RT mocked the outgoing president, the network shared a video on X, captioned ""Biden finishes press conference, answers no questions, wanders off into the Amazon Jungle,"" the post implied the 81-year-old president was disoriented.Earlier in the day, an another tweet by RT, sharing a graphic that featured a smiling Biden alongside a headline about his administration's climate policies. The caption read, ""Joe Biden planning his final vacation as US president be like,"" mocking his legacy as his term nears its end.In the tweet, US President had given Ukraine tacit approval to use American missiles against Russian military targets, a sensitive topic amid the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.Standing amid towering ferns and against the backdrop of deforested land, Biden reaffirmed his administration’s commitment to fighting climate change. ""Nobody can reverse the clean energy revolution,"" he declared. ""The question now is which government will stand in the way and which will seize the enormous opportunity.""The Amazon rainforest, often called the ""lungs of the Earth,"" plays a critical role in mitigating climate change by storing vast amounts of carbon dioxide. However, the region faces major environmental challenges, with deforestation and drying rivers threatening its ecosystem.Biden’s comments also pointed out the uncertainty of America’s climate leadership under the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to ramp up fossil fuel production, withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, and roll back key climate initiatives, calling global warming a ""hoax.""As Biden wraps up his presidency, his trip to the Amazon highlights the tension between his administration's ambitious climate goals and the challenges posed by his successor's opposing agenda. While Biden has spearheaded historic investments in clean energy and climate action, his achievements face the prospect of being unraveled under Trump’s leadership.Biden’s visit to Brazil coincides with the UN climate conference in Azerbaijan, while Brazil prepares to host the event next year. These gatherings are pivotal as world leaders continue negotiating global solutions to the climate crisis.""Some may seek to deny or delay the clean energy revolution,"" Biden said. ""But its benefits are already being enjoyed by people across the country, regardless of party or politics.""","Russian media mocks US President Joe Biden's trip to the Amazon rainforest.

'You bent the knee': Major outrage from viewers



In a surprise announcement this morning, Morning Joe co-anchors Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski , the two fire-brand Trump critics of MSNBC, said that they visited Donald Trump and his tea, at Mar-a-Lago Friday. This was the first time they met him in person in seven years. “We didn’t see eye-to-eye on a lot of issues and we told him so,” Joe Scarborough said explaining the genesis of the meeting and the need they felt to restart communications, added Mika.In 2018, Donald Trump called them Crazy Mike and Psycho Joe and the husband-wife duo said they have not spoken directly to Trump since March 2020 except for a call Scarborough made to Trump after the attempt on his life in Pennsylvania.Mika said Trump was cheerful and upbeat at the meeting and was interested in finding common ground with Democrats on some of the most divisive issues.""For those asking why we would go speak to the president-elect during such fraught times, especially between us, I guess I would ask back – why wouldn’t we?"" she said. ""Five years of political warfare has deeply divided Washington and the country. We have been as clear as we know how in expressing our deep concerns about President Trump’s actions and words in the coarsening of public debate. But for nearly 80 million Americans, election denialism, public trials, January 6th, were not as important as the issues that moved them to send Donald Trump back to the White House with their vote. Joe and I realize it’s time to do something different, and that starts with not only talking about Donald Trump, but also talking with him.""Brzezinski said it seemed reasonable to patch things up, given the country’s divisions and the fact that Mr. Trump is not seeking reelection. “We know this will be a consequential presidency. The question is whether it will be constructive,” she said.Scarborough, a former Florida US congressman, left the Republican Party in 2017 over his disagreements with Trump.The announcement followed major outrage on social media with Democrat supporters calling Morning Joe dead. Some social media users commented that their announcement looked like a hostage video.""This is why people don't trust the mainstream media anymore. Joe and Mika who constantly attack “fascist” Trump on their show, went to Mar a Lago to talk with Trump over the weekend,"" the X handle Republicans against Trump posted.Scarborough and Brzezinski pre-empted the outrage and said they would not defend Trump on their show. “Don’t be mistaken,” Scarborough said. “We are not here to defend or normalize Donald Trump. We are here to report on him and to hopefully provide you insights that are going to better equip all of us in understanding these deeply unsettling times.”",Morning Joe hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski said they went to Mar-a- Lago to meet President-elect Donald Trump.

WWE RAW's Netflix Debut Might Be in Trouble Following Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul Fight Controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/wwe-raws-netflix-debut-might-be-in-trouble-following-mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-fight-controversy/articleshow/115415470.cms,"Image via WWE/Netflix

Why will WWE RAW face trouble at launch?

WWE RAW is set to make a grand debut on Netflix on January 6, 2025. However, the show might be in for a few troubles before it even launches on the platform. The main reason behind this problem is the recently concluded Tyson vs Paul fight which invited a lot of criticism from fans all over the world because of two main issues.With that said, it’s still a big event for WWE, because their Netflix debut will allow them to reach out to a larger audience, further solidifying their position in the world of professional wrestling.Before talking about the issue, let’s get one thing clear. WWE as we know it, does have a script, and more often than not, the rivalries that you see in the ring, are based on a script and don't have anything to do with the wrestlers and their real lives.Sometimes, however, these rivalries do spill out of the rings and into the real lives of the wrestlers, but such situations are rare.With that being said, here are the two main reasons why WWE RAW could face problems with their Netflix launch. Firstly, there are rumors doing the rounds which suggest that the fight between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson was scripted. And for anyone who watched the fight, such a rumor isn’t that difficult to believe. There are also rumors that suggest that Netflix and the promoters of the fight made the script because it would make them more money if they tweaked the outcome of the match to their favor.While WWE itself is scripted to a great extent, if Netflix were to interfere with the process, then there might be a problem if the storyline doesn’t add up with respect to the feuds that are being executed.Secondly, WWE is an extremely popular wrestling entertainment company, and many individuals tune into the matches at a regular basis. While this isn’t really a concern, there are worries that Netflix won’t be able to handle the traffic, considering that their servers were lagging very hard on the day they were streaming the event from ringside. If this is an issues that the company cannot solve, WWE’s numbers might be hurt to a great extent.Although all these are speculations for now, hopefully none of it will come to pass. It will be worth seeing how things pan out once the new show releases on the streaming platform.Also read: Jake Paul Wants to Fight Connor McGregor As Mike Tyson Throws Down the Gauntlet for Logan Paul","WWE RAW is set to make a grand debut on Netflix on January 6, 2025.

Where was Biden? The G-20 photo shows him out of the picture,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/where-was-biden-the-g-20-photo-shows-him-out-of-the-picture/articleshow/115435424.cms,"(AP photo)

Under sunshine and clear blue skies against a picture-perfect backdrop of Rio’s iconic Sugarloaf Mountain, the Group of 20 leaders gathered for their “family photo.” There was just one snag: US President Joe Biden was missing.The traditional photo opportunity descended into farce on Monday when Biden, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Italian premier Giorgia Meloni were absent from the lineup.That only became clear, though, once Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had posed for the snap with the other world leaders, after which they dispersed for further talks.Was it perhaps an act of protest against the presence of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who was standing in for President Vladimir Putin? Or had some bilateral meetings run late? In the end, it seems it was down to disorganization.A US official blamed logistical issues and said the family photo was taken early. Biden’s absence wasn’t an act of protest, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.The Brazilian organizers say Biden and the others were late. They may try to herd all the leaders together again for a reshoot — which would be a first in the history of the G-20.But the symbolism was unmistakable. The lack of unity among the leaders is a reflection of how difficult it has been to get everyone on the same page at the summit.Biden has been largely invisible at this gathering as he serves out his last two months in the White House. But he’s by no means the only lame duck. France’s Emmanuel Macron got a beating by voters and Germany’s Olaf Scholz is headed for early elections and will likely be ejected from power.In short, the West appeared in disarray.That allowed China’s Xi Jinping to stroll in and take center stage. Brazil’s Lula was flanked by the previous G-20 host — India’s Narendra Modi — and the next one — South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa. Argentina’s Javier Milei, who has been a thorn in Lula’s side, was lurking just behind him and next to Macron, with whom he appears to have struck a bond at this meeting.Lavrov was safely tucked away at the back next to his Saudi counterpart.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer walked out into the sun alone. Earlier he’d irked Xi by publicly chiding China on human rights and bringing up Taiwan. The chill between the two was palpable as they studiously avoided contact, separated only by Australian leader Anthony Albanese.The adage that a picture is worth a thousand words couldn’t be truer when it comes to the annual G-20 tradition of the family photo. Since its foundation in 1999, this snapshot in time tells the story of the rise and fall of collaboration between the world’s most powerful economies.There have been highs — like when they came together to overcome the global financial crisis in 2008 — and there have been lows.In these moments, leaders often drop their guard. And it’s when they are shuffling around into position — some arriving later (or not at all), some iced out, others whispering and giggling to the side — that keen observers can gain insights into the state of international diplomacy.The body language between leaders often reveals whether they truly like each other or are standing stiffly just waiting for the click of the camera before they can flee.The summit in New Delhi, amid the monsoon rains, presaged the difficulties that lay ahead at that summit. India abandoned the usual set-up because leaders couldn’t agree on what to do with Lavrov after Putin — who’d become a pariah following his 2022 invasion of Ukraine — avoided travel.Since then, the tides have shifted somewhat.Outrage and condemnation have made way for a dawning realization among many leaders here that Ukraine may have to accept the loss of some of its territory in negotiations to end the war.One of the most telling moments in the family gathering was Macron making his way to where Lavrov stood and briefly shaking his hand.Not so long ago, Volodymyr Zelenskiy was the star attraction at global summits and parliaments around the world. But as war fatigue has set in, the chasm between the West that still supports him and the emerging powers of the Global South has widened.Modi didn’t want him stealing the show at the G-20 in New Delhi, that was all about projecting the rise of India, and Lula felt very much the same way.The plan today was to invite everyone and paper over the cracks in global diplomacy. Lula literally hoped to drown out the differences by having more people in the frame.Instead, as Xi was holding hands with fellow leaders and smiling, Meloni came to realize she and Trudeau were missing out.According to a pool report, she gasped and said “The photo!”","The traditional photo opportunity descended into farce on Monday when Biden, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Italian premier Giorgia Meloni were absent.

What’s next

President-elect Donald Trump announced Monday his nomination of former Wisconsin Representative and Fox Business News host Sean Duffy as the next US secretary of transportation. If confirmed, Duffy will manage the department responsible for aviation, automotive, rail, transit, and various transportation policies, wielding oversight of a budget close to $110 billion. This appointment would also see him play a critical role in implementing parts of President Joe Biden’s $1 trillion infrastructure law from 2021, including the expansion of electric vehicle charging networks.Duffy nomination is part of a larger trend as Trump assembles his new administration, prioritizing loyalists for key roles. Unlike his first term, marked by internal divisions and power struggles, Trump appears determined to consolidate his power base and establish a leadership team aligned with his vision for federal governance. While the Republican party holds the Senate majority, some of these appointments are expected to face challenging confirmation processes.The nomination signals Trump’s intent to reshape critical areas of federal policy to reflect his administration's priorities, setting a tone of assertive governance as he steps into his second term.Meanwhile, according to an Axios report, Tesla CEO’s increasing involvement in Trump’s transition has ignited friction within President-elect's inner circle, with a significant flashpoint being a reported confrontation between Musk and Trump legal adviser Boris Epshteyn over potential Cabinet appointments. The showdown reportedly occurred during a high-profile dinner at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, illustrating the deeper power dynamics at play as Trump assembles his team for a return to the White House in January 2025, the Axios report said.Musk's newfound influence underscores his evolution from tech billionaire to political power broker. With at least $119 million contributed to Trump’s campaign, Musk’s presence in Trump’s sphere is as strategic as it is significant. His sway in Trump’s decision-making has fueled tension among traditional Trump loyalists who view him as an outsider encroaching on established roles. This clash represents not just a battle of personalities but a conflict over competing visions for Trump’s next administration.Sources familiar with the situation revealed that the tension between Musk, Trump's 'first buddy', and Epshteyn came to a head last week in what insiders described as a “massive blowup” at Mar-a-Lago. During a dinner attended by key advisers, Musk challenged Epshteyn's influence on Trump’s picks, accusing him of leaking transition details to the media. Epshteyn responded sharply, dismissing Musk’s accusations and insisting they were baseless.Musk's concerns reportedly stemmed from Epshteyn’s push for specific allies to secure pivotal roles in the new administration, such as Matt Gaetz for attorney general. Musk, on the other hand, has been advocating for more unconventional choices like Howard Lutnick for treasury secretary. The friction highlights a broader divide in Trump’s camp: those who support experienced, mainstream Republicans and those who insist on ""America First"" loyalists who embody Trump's disruptive political ethos.The Musk-Epshteyn clash signals a larger struggle as Trump prepares to step into his second term. Balancing loyalty with competence is a delicate task for the president-elect, whose base remains committed to his populist vision but whose path forward requires figures capable of navigating complex policies and legislative battles.Musk’s influence, which extends to reshaping policy priorities and advocating for significant federal spending cuts, has been a disruptive force. His involvement marks a new chapter in Trump's inner circle, which has long been dominated by loyalists who share deep, personal ties with Trump and adhere strictly to his agenda.As per the Axios, a few members within Trump’s orbit have publicly backed Musk’s presence, acknowledging his innovative perspectives. Vice President-elect JD Vance, conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, and Trump’s sons, Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump, have reportedly found common ground with Musk. Even Trump’s granddaughter, Kai Trump , showcased a lighthearted moment by posting a photo with Musk and calling him “uncle.”Despite the reported confrontation, a transition source played down the incident, emphasizing that Musk and Epshteyn had a “good relationship” and often dined together. This statement seemed intended to project an image of unity within Trump’s team amid increasing scrutiny over the transition’s internal workings. However, insiders note that Musk’s active role has led to discomfort among other key figures, including longtime Trump advisers who view him as overstepping his bounds, the Axios report said.Musk’s involvement has added pressure on Trump to consider Cabinet picks that blend fresh, bold approaches with seasoned expertise. Epshteyn’s supporters argue that the choices he promotes offer continuity and loyalty crucial for maintaining the administration’s cohesion, especially in light of Trump’s contentious relationship with Washington insiders. Meanwhile, Musk’s camp suggests that reliance on ""business-as-usual"" candidates risks stalling Trump’s agenda.The disagreement over the direction of appointments highlights Trump’s broader challenge: solidifying a team that can effectively implement his policies while appealing to the party’s broader coalition. Trump’s decision to include Musk in a recent call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky further demonstrated Musk’s elevated role, despite potential friction with established advisers.The backdrop of this power struggle is Trump’s overarching desire to maintain dominance over a circle known for being fiercely competitive. This dynamic has only intensified with the approach of his January 20 inauguration, where assembling a balanced Cabinet could set the tone for his term. Observers within and outside Trump’s camp are closely watching whether the president-elect will manage to unify his team around a cohesive vision or if internal rivalries will persist.Trump’s transition team faces critical weeks ahead as final Cabinet appointments loom. Musk’s ongoing efforts to push for his preferred candidates will likely continue, potentially intensifying the rift with Epshteyn and others aligned with him. The president-elect will need to strike a delicate balance between rewarding loyalty, which has been a hallmark of his leadership style, and integrating influential figures like Musk, whose ideas often push beyond traditional Republican lines.The drama at Mar-a-Lago is emblematic of Trump’s signature approach: fostering competition among his advisers to test their resolve and ideas. Whether this will lead to a harmonious administration or further strife remains an open question as Trump navigates these critical last weeks before inauguration.

"Two men put profit over lives by smuggling Indian family across Canada border, say US prosecutors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/two-men-put-profit-over-lives-by-smuggling-indian-family-across-canada-border-say-us-prosecutors/articleshow/115432755.cms,"NEW DELHI: US prosecutors alleged on Monday that two men prioritised financial gain over human life in a smuggling attempt that led to the death of an Indian family of four crossing the US-Canada border during a severe winter storm.The accused, Harshkumar Ramanlal Patel and Steve Shand , are on trial in Minnesota for allegedly transporting the family across the border in severe winter conditions, resulting in their death by exposure. Both men have pleaded not guilty to the charges, with prosecutors asserting that their actions placed profit above safety, ultimately causing the tragedy.The US prosecutors on Monday said that the two men accused of alleged human smuggling of Indian Family over US-Canada border valuing financial profit over human life by attempting to smuggle a family of four across the borderIn the alleged human smuggling of Indian family over US-Canada border, two men are accused of valuing financial profit over human life by attempting to smuggle a family of four across the border during a severe winter storm—a plan that led to the family’s death from exposure, prosecutors said on Monday.The accused, 29-year-old Indian national Harshkumar Ramanlal Patel and 50-year-old Steve Shand, are facing trial in Minnesota on federal charges related to human smuggling. Both have pleaded not guilty, and the trial is expected to last about five days.According to prosecutors, 39-year-old Jagdish Patel, his wife Vaishaliben, their 11-year-old daughter Vihangi, and three-year-old son Dharmik, all from Gujarat, India, died on January 19, 2022, after enduring hours of freezing conditions in a blizzard.Shand allegedly waited in a truck for 11 migrants, including the Patel family, in a remote area as wind chills dropped to minus 38 degrees Celsius. Prosecutor Ryan Lipes told the jury that both men went forward with the smuggling plan despite the dangerous winter weather.""The migrants were dropped at a dark, isolated part of the Canadian border nowhere near a legal port of entry,"" Lipes explained, adding that Jagdish Patel was found holding his young son, Dharmik, wrapped in a blanket.""This case is about these two men putting profit over people’s lives, profit they earned by smuggling migrants from India across the Canadian border into the US,"" Lipes added.Harshkumar Patel ’s attorney, Thomas Leinenweber, argued that his client was wrongfully charged, claiming there is no concrete evidence linking him to a smuggling conspiracy.""There are certain universal feelings that we all have,"" Leinenweber said. ""One of the worst feelings universally that anyone could feel is when you are wrongfully accused."" Leinenweber also stated that Patel had come to the US seeking a better life but now faced unjust charges.Meanwhile, Shand’s attorney, Lisa Lopez, argued that Shand was an unwitting participant in the smuggling scheme. ""Mr Shand was used by Mr Patel. And being used does not equate under the law to being guilty of conspiracy,"" Lopez stated, asserting that Shand and the migrants had been misled by Patel’s network.The jury, consisting of eight men and six women with two alternates, was seated on Monday afternoon. Prior to selection, Shand’s defence team argued to exclude graphic photos of the frozen bodies, stating they could unfairly influence the jury.Prosecutors, however, maintained that the images were essential in illustrating the lack of preparation for extreme weather. US District Judge John Tunheim ruled that the photos could be shown in court.Prosecutors describe Harshkumar Patel and Shand as part of a larger international smuggling network that reportedly helped migrants secure Canadian student visas, arranged travel, and then attempted to smuggle them into the US, primarily via Minnesota and Washington state.Court documents indicate that Patel, who had entered the US illegally after multiple visa rejections, recruited Shand at a casino in Deltona, Florida. Over five weeks, the two allegedly worked together to smuggle five groups of Indian nationals across the border, discussing weather conditions in their messages. In one December 2021 exchange, Shand messaged Patel, describing the temperature as ""cold as hell"" and asking, ""They going to be alive when they get here?""In January, Shand allegedly reminded Patel to ensure migrants were properly dressed for the harsh conditions. Prosecutors say Shand later admitted that Patel paid him around USD 25,000 for his role in these crossings.Jagdish Patel, the deceased father, hailed from Dingucha, a village in Gujarat, India, where he and his family lived with his parents, who were local schoolteachers, according to Indian news reports.The US Border Patrol reported over 14,000 apprehensions of Indian nationals in the past year. According to Pew Research Center, an estimated 725,000 Indians currently live in the US without legal status, behind only Mexican and Salvadoran populations.","The accused, Harshkumar Ramanlal Patel and Steve Shand, are on trial in Minnesota for allegedly transporting the family across the border in severe winter conditions.

The decision on Ukraine's use of the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) comes in the waning days of Joe Biden's presidency, before President-elect Donald Trump, who has said he would bring about a swift end to the war that many fear could force unpalatable concessions from Kyiv, assumes office.The longer-range missiles are likely to be used in response to North Korea's decision to send troops to support Kremlin forces, according to one of the people familiar with the development. Pyongyang's troops are apparently being deployed to help the Russian army drive Ukrainian forces out of Russia's Kursk region, where they launched an incursion in Aug.Military analysts said the impact on the battlefield, where Ukraine has been on the back foot for months, would depend on what limits remained. But while the shift may shore up the Kursk operation, it was unlikely to be a gamechanger overall.There also is no way to know how long the new policy will last. It was criticised by Richard Grenell, one of the closest foreign policy advisers of Trump.The effect depends on the rules set for the weapons' use. If strikes are allowed across all of Russia, they could significantly complicate Moscow's ability to respond to battlefield demands. If strikes are limited to the Kursk, Russia could relocate its command centres and air units to nearby regions. That would also mean many of the valuable targets Ukrainian officials have expressed desire to hit may still be beyond reach. Also, the supply of ATACMS is short. However, the decision may encourage the UK and France to allow Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles, aka SCALP missiles, with range of 250km.","Longer-range missiles likely to be used in response to North Korea's decision to send troops to support Kremlin forces.

In the evening, militants are seen patrolling streets and setting up checkpoints in Bannu, North and South Waziristan, Tank, Lakki Marwat, and Dera Ismail Khan.While these districts remain at mercy of militants from evening to morning, well-off people in other districts of the province frequently receive threatening WhatsApp texts and letters from Pakistani Taliban - or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) - with demands to pay or face attacks. The ones who refuse to pay ransom are often targeted with grenade attacks at their homes, shops and warehouses, apparently to show the group was serious about its threats.Faisal Khan, a lawyer in in Charsadda district, told TOI that he had got a threatening WhatsApp text earlier this month from an Afghanistan number with a demand to pay $50,000 (Pak Rs 1.4cr). Khan reported the threats to the police and also went to high-ranking officers to request protection and assistance. He claimed he was cautioned by ""allies in the govt"" that he ""should not count"" on them to keep him safe.Shahzaib, another person in the same neighbourhood who had received a similar text on TTP's letterhead last month, has paid after negotiating a deal through intermediaries. He eventually paid a reduced part of the $50,000 the militants initially demanded. ""TTP is demanding extortion from everyone they think can pay. Most, if not all, wealthy individuals have already paid.""Police sources said the main hurdle is tracking down extortionists.

Crisis in PoJK: Deforestation devastates environment and livelihoods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/crisis-in-pojk-deforestation-devastates-environment-and-livelihoods/articleshow/115412646.cms,"Representative Image

CHINARI: In Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), an alarming environmental crisis is rapidly unfolding. Once home to vast, lush forests, this region has seen its green cover decimated over the past several decades.The rapid deforestation, particularly in areas like Chinari, has only exacerbated the crisis. As the forests vanish, so does the natural filtration system that once regulated air quality and helped prevent erosion, leaving the land more vulnerable to environmental degradation.Arshad Rasheed, a local resident, shared a stark reminder of the dramatic change.""In this region, 75 per cent of the land was once covered by forests, but today that figure has dropped to around 10 per cent. Before 1947, the region's economy was heavily dependent on forest resources. After the region became part of PoJK, large-scale deforestation began, and the forest cover has been reduced from 75 per cent to just 10 per cent today"", he said.The consequences of this widespread deforestation are most severely felt by the local communities who once depended on the forests for their livelihoods.In Chinari, vast amounts of wood, remnants of the once-thriving forests, now lie rotting on the ground, untouched for decades.While the government has imposed a ban on cutting trees in an effort to preserve the remaining forest cover, this policy has inadvertently worsened the plight of local residents, many of whom are already struggling with poverty.Arshad explained the dilemma thus faced, noting, ""People living near the forests need fuel for cooking and heating, but the government has made no provision to address this need. While the ban on cutting trees was intended to protect the remaining forests, it ignores the fact that people depend on these resources for their daily survival. Today, locals are prohibited from cutting their own trees, yet their fuel needs are not being met by the government"".For the people of Chinari and other parts of PoJK, the issue is no longer just about conserving the environment.

"Amid Net censorship, Pakistan offers regulated VPNs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/amid-net-censorship-pakistan-offers-regulated-vpns/articleshow/115392568.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Amid a ban on unregistered virtual private networks (VPNs) across Pakistan — allegedly aimed at preventing their use by militant groups for financial transactions and violent activities — Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has launched a registration process for companies and freelancers to use their VPNs.The nationwide ban, imposed on interior ministry’s direction on Friday, has been widely viewed by observers and critics as a joint attempt by the govt and military to silence dissenting voices.Media sources have also suggested that the slowdown in internet speeds across Pakistan is linked to the govt’s installation of a national firewall. The firewall was deployed as Pakistani military faced severe online criticism for its alleged role in keeping former PM Imran Khan behind bars, while his party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, continued to face a harsh crackdown. The military, which denies interference in politics, has recently begun using the term ""digital terrorists"" to describe online critics.VPN usage has surged in Pakistan as users seek access to X (formerly Twitter), a platform blocked since February, along with numerous other websites. Authorities also claim that VPN software is being used to bypass restrictions on pornographic content.PTA said it had streamlined the VPN registration process for organizations and freelancers. Entities such as software houses, call centres, banks, embassies, and freelancers can now register their VPNs online through the PTA’s official website. The registration process is divided into four distinct categories: companies, freelancers, call centres, and video conferencing.""To date, more than 20,000 companies and freelancers have successfully registered their VPNs through this efficient process,"" PTA said in a statement on Saturday.According to PTA, the registration process involves completing an online form and providing basic details, including the national identity card number, company registration details, and taxpayer status. Freelancers must also submit proof of their association with a project or company, such as a letter or email confirmation.Also, applicants will need to provide an IP address for VPN connectivity. A fixed IP address can be obtained through internet service providers.After interior ministry circulated its letter calling for the VPN ban, Council of Islamic Ideology, a constitutional advisory body tasked with ensuring laws align with Islamic principles, declared VPN usage to be ""un-Islamic"" in a statement issued the same day.“The government and the state have the authority, from an Islamic perspective, to prevent all actions that lead to wrongdoing or facilitate it,” council’s chairman, Raghib Hussain Naeemi, was quoted as saying. ""Therefore, measures to block or restrict access to immoral and offensive content, including the banning of VPNs, are in accordance with Shariah.”","Pakistan Telecommunication Authority has launched a registration process for companies and freelancers to use their VPNs.

According to police, her body was dismembered into dozens of pieces and dumped in a drain in Punjab province.The crime occurred last week in Daska, Sialkot district, which is approximately 100 km from Lahore.A murder case has been filed against the suspects, and four individuals have been arrested in connection with the crime. The arrested include the mother-in-law, Sughran Bibi; her daughter, Yasmin; her grandson, Hamza; and a distant relative, Navid.Senior police officer Omar Farooq informed reporters that the suspects have confessed to killing Zara and dismembering her body.Zara Qadir, a woman in her 20s, went missing last week, and later, police discovered her dismembered body in three sacks, which was identified as hers.Zara, who was the daughter of a police officer, had married Qadir Ahmad four years ago, and they had a three-year-old son. She went to Saudi Arabia after her marriage and returned to Pakistan only a few months ago.Farooq said, ""In her confessional statement, Sughran Bibi said that she suspected Zara of allegedly practicing 'witchcraft,' and besides, her son Qadir had started sending money directly to Zara's bank account instead of to his mother.""He added that the four suspects smothered the pregnant Zara with a pillow while she was asleep and then proceeded to burn her face. Then, they dismembered her body into dozens of pieces before dumping it in a drain in three sacks.""Based on Zara's father's statement, where he suspected Sughran after she claimed Zara had run away with her lover upon her disappearance, we interrogated Sughran, who confessed to her crime,"" Farooq said.He mentioned that Sughran was also Zara's paternal aunt.Farooq stated that this was a case of extreme jealousy, as the mother-in-law and her daughter not only killed Zara but also dismembered her body out of hatred. He added that Sughran and Yasmin believed Zara's good looks were causing Qadir to favor her and ignore them in the process.","Zara Qadir, a woman in her 20s, went missing last week, and later, police discovered her dismembered body in three sacks, which was identified as hers.

The crisis has particularly affected Pakistan's Punjab province, where smog and hazardous air quality levels have created a public health emergency.Hospitals across Punjab have been overwhelmed, with Lahore recording the highest number of cases. Toxic smog forced over 75,000 people to seek medical help on a single day, further straining the healthcare system. Over the past month, Lahore alone reported 133,429 respiratory disease cases, including 5,577 asthma patients. Additionally, 5,455 of the 13,862 heart disease cases and 491 of the 5,141 stroke cases in the province were treated in Lahore. The crisis escalated in the past week, with 449,045 respiratory cases reported, along with 30,146 asthma cases, 2,225 heart disease patients, and 1,400 stroke victims.The government has taken several emergency measures, including closing schools, colleges, and parks, limiting market hours, and imposing bans on polluting vehicles and industrial activities. Despite these steps, air quality in cities like Lahore and Multan continues to deteriorate. Lahore’s Air Quality Index (AQI) consistently exceeds hazardous levels, often surpassing 1,000, while Multan recently recorded an alarming AQI of over 2,000.Residents are struggling to cope with the smog’s health impacts. For many, staying indoors offers little relief, and air purifiers remain unaffordable luxuries. Public and private schools have been ordered to close until November 24, with authorities also enforcing a three-day lockdown in Lahore and Multan to mitigate pollution. However, these measures have brought limited respite.Healthcare workers are stretched to their limits. Doctors report a significant increase in patients, particularly children and the elderly, suffering from breathing difficulties, coughing fits, and eye irritation. “This year, smog levels are much worse, and the number of affected patients is far greater,” said Dr Qurat ul Ain, a medical practitioner in Lahore. She advises residents to wear masks and avoid outdoor exposure.The smog’s primary causes include industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and seasonal agricultural stubble burning, exacerbated by stagnant weather conditions. Climate activist Alia Haider described the city as “stuck in its own poison” and criticised the lack of effective long-term solutions. As smog continues to blanket Pakistan’s major cities, millions remain at risk, awaiting meaningful action to address the worsening environmental crisis.","Over 1.91 million people with respiratory illnesses have been admitted to government hospitals in Pakistan over the past month.

Thick blanket of sky-soiling smog

Lahore, the city with over 14 million people surrounded by industrial factories, has hit record pollution levels this month. The toxic smog affecting Lahore and other parts of Pakistan has worsened, with more than 15,000 cases of respiratory and viral infections reported in a single day, Ary News reported on Thursday.According to Swiss group IQAir, Lahore’s pollution index reached a staggering 1165, while New Delhi and surrounding areas hovered around 350.Hospitals in Lahore are experiencing an influx of patients presenting symptoms including dry cough, respiratory distress, pneumonia, and chest infections.The primary government healthcare facilities have recorded substantial patient numbers: Mayo Hospital attended to over 4,000 individuals, Jinnah Hospital treated 3,500 patients, Gangaram Hospital received 3,000 cases, and Children's Hospital managed more than 2,000 patients.Healthcare professionals in Pakistan have highlighted the increased risk to children and individuals with underlying conditions such as asthma and cardiac ailments, Ary News reported.The atmospheric pollution has triggered a surge in various ailments, including pneumonia, chest infections, and dermatological conditions.The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that air pollution can lead to strokes, heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory issues. Children, babies, and the elderly are especially vulnerable to these health risks.PM2.5, the fine particulate matter that poses the greatest danger, is the chief pollutant in Lahore’s air. It originates from fossil fuel combustion, dust storms, and wildfires, and has been linked to asthma, heart and lung disease, cancer, and cognitive impairment in children.Pakistani authorities are implementing comprehensive measures to address this environmental crisis. According to Pakistani media outlets, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority of Pakistan officially classified smog as a ""calamity"" and implemented emergency protocols.The pollution, mainly caused by industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and agricultural stubble burning, has triggered health emergencies. As a result, schools have been closed, outdoor activities banned, and significant health concerns are mounting. The hazardous air poses serious risks, especially to children, the elderly, and those with respiratory conditions.Also read: Pakistan restricts outdoor activities, market hours to curb air pollution-related illness The government's response includes a three-month ban on wedding celebrations and new transport department regulations to combat smog across the province.

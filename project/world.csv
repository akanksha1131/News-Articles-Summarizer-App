A 40-year-old man was killed by a shark while fishing with his family near Australia's Great Barrier Reef , officials and local media reported. The incident happened on Saturday afternoon near Humpy Island , Australia.""The man was fishing with family members when he was bitten by a shark,"" Australia's Queensland state police said in a statement. Emergency services confirmed the shark bit the man on the neck, causing life-threatening injuries. He died about an hour and a half later at the scene.Local media identified the victim as Luke Walford , a youth pastor at the Cathedral of Praise church in Rockhampton, Queensland. Police could not confirm if he was spearfishing at the time, though social media photos from 2021 show him holding large fish while wearing a wetsuit on a boat.A Queensland ambulance spokeswoman told news agency AFP that Walford died from a ""significant life-threatening wound to his neck.""Humpy Island is part of the Great Barrier Reef's Keppel Bay Islands National Park and is known for camping, diving, and snorkeling.The last fatal shark attack in Australia occurred in December 2023, when a 15-year-old boy was killed by a suspected great white shark in South Australia. According to a national database, Australia has recorded over 1,200 shark incidents since 1791, with more than 250 fatalities. Most serious shark bites involve white sharks, bull sharks, and tiger sharks.","A 40-year-old man was killed by a shark while fishing with his family near Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

The lawsuit

Charges against Ortiz

Accusations against Walmart

Walmart's statement

A woman in Horry County, US state of South Carolina, has sued Walmart and a delivery driver, alleging the driver was found ""pleasuring himself"" in her driveway after delivering groceries in July.The lawsuit, filed on December 19, claims Alvin B Ortiz exposed himself in his vehicle after delivering groceries on July 8. The incident occurred around 9:10 am local time in an Intracoastal Waterway community . The woman, identified as “Jane Doe,” alleges that Ortiz, 39, remained in his car in her driveway for 10–15 minutes after the delivery. When she approached his vehicle, she says she saw “his pants pulled down” and him “pleasuring himself.”The lawsuit says the woman retreated into her home with her child and called a neighbor for help. The neighbor confronted Ortiz, who then allegedly drove away, yelling “he was coming back to ‘f--- everyone up.’” The woman reported the incident to the police, who subsequently contacted the Walmart where Ortiz was employed.Ortiz was arrested on July 9 and charged with indecent exposure, according to the lawsuit. He was released on bond the next day, and court records indicate his case remains pending.The lawsuit accuses Walmart of failing to conduct adequate background checks and holds the company responsible for the actions of its employee while on duty. The woman seeks compensation for “past and future mental pain and suffering, mental, emotional, and psychological damage, and loss of enjoyment of life,” including medical expenses.Walmart told WMBF News “the safety of our associates and customers is always a top priority” and mentioned that the company’s lawyers “are reviewing the complaint and will respond appropriately to the court.”","A woman in Horry County, US state of South Carolina, has sued Walmart and a delivery driver.

"Irony! Laura Loomer rants against Indians, ends up asking for donations on app built by Indian techies: 'She can't escape them'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/irony-laura-loomer-rants-against-indians-ends-up-asking-for-donations-on-app-built-by-indian-techies-she-cant-escape-them/articleshow/116733477.cms,"Laura Loomer shared a link to a donation platform asking her followers to support.

In a surprising turn of events, far-right activist Laura Loomer , known for her controversial rants, found herself inadvertently supporting the very tech platform created by two Indian entrepreneurs , just days after launching a tirade against Indians.Following a series of racist and xenophobic remarks about Indians, Loomer took to social media, asking her followers to support her financially after being banned on major payment platforms like Cash App, Venmo, and PayPal. In response to an inquiry about how fans could donate, she shared a link to the donation platform Buy Me a Coffee , claiming it would help her in her ongoing battle against ""Big Tech.""""I’m banned on Cash App, Venmo, and PayPal because these people want to strangle me and have been subjecting me to their caste system for YEARS,"" Loomer wrote, venting her frustration about the bans. However, Loomer failed to realize that Buy Me a Coffee is a platform founded by two Indian tech entrepreneurs, Jijo Sunny and Joseph Sunny—whom she had just blasted in a previous rant.Buy Me a Coffee was created to allow creators to connect with their audiences and receive financial support directly. The platform's founders designed it to give creators a simple way to receive payments and interact with their fans. It seems the irony was lost on Loomer, who, while railing against Indians for allegedly undermining the US, was unknowingly promoting a platform built by them.In an amusing twist, Jijo Sunny, one of the founders of Buy Me a Coffee, took the opportunity to respond to Loomer's inadvertent promotion of the platform. With a knowing wink, he quipped, ""Sometimes the best way to silence hate is by showing the world how far we’ve come—no matter where we’re from.""The controversy traces back to Loomer's reaction to the appointment of Sriram Krishnan , an Indian-American tech executive, as Senior Policy Advisor for Artificial Intelligence at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Loomer used the announcement as a springboard for a barrage of offensive remarks against Indians, falsely portraying Krishnan as part of a ""caste system"" conspiracy and attacking the contributions of Indian immigrants to the US.Her remarks, which included calling Indians ""third-world invaders"" and making disparaging comments about Indian hygiene, sparked backlash across social media. Yet, it appears that the tech world—particularly platforms like Buy Me a Coffee, developed by the very people Loomer had targeted—remained blissfully unaffected by her rhetoric.As Loomer continues to clash with the platforms she claims to oppose, the irony of her support for Buy Me a Coffee serves as a reminder of the complex and often contradictory relationships between tech, politics, and prejudice. For many, it highlights the stark contrast between the vitriol of her rhetoric and the reality of the tech landscape she seems so keen to decry.","Far-right activist Laura Loomer shared a link to a donation platform asking her followers to support.

It’s called building a career, you work your way up.""In order to go forward we must change our education system, create a culture that respects hard work and productivity, cut government waste/spending/regulations in order to produce a healthy robust economy that lowers inflation and pays higher wages to an American workforce, so that H1-B is no longer needed and can be done away with.""Decades of America LAST bad decisions in Washington wove a giant web of America LAST policies that created systems and structures that must be torn down and rebuilt to put America FIRST,"" Greene said underlining that there is no rift between America First and H-1B.","Republican veteran Marjorie Taylor Greene chose team Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy in the ongoing H-1B row.

In a fiery exchange on X (formerly Twitter), Elon Musk and Steven Mackey , apparently a Trump supporter, found themselves at odds over the ongoing debate surrounding H-1B visas and immigration reform . The controversy ignited when Mackey shared a video clip of Musk discussing the limits of traditional education and critical thinking, which Musk framed as a “mental straight jacket” that limits creativity.Mackey, in the context of the heated H-1B visa debate, shared Musk’s comments with the caption, “Stop trying to optimize something that shouldn’t exist. Let’s optimize H1-B.”” He used Musk’s words to make a point about the need for reforms to the H-1B visa program, which has come under scrutiny for its handling of skilled worker immigration in the US.Mackey’s tweet quickly went viral, drawing both support and backlash. In response, Musk, known for his strong opinions, fired back with a blunt and defiant reply, which many perceived as an aggressive defense of the H-1B program.“The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX , Tesla , and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,” Musk wrote. He then added, “Take a big step back and F*** YOURSELF in the face. I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend.”The heated exchange didn’t end there. Mackey, attempting to clarify the situation, posted a follow-up message. “There seems to be a lot of confusion about this interaction,” he said. “I personally am the biggest fan of Elon on the planet and I always will be. I’m also capable of disagreeing with people I deeply respect and admire.”Mackey further elaborated that while he was agnostic about the future of the H-1B visa program, he acknowledged the existence of “extreme abuse” within the system that needed to be addressed. He called for a fair and balanced resolution to the issue, expressing hope that Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy , and the Dogecoin community could contribute to the reform debate in a meaningful way.This clash highlights the ongoing tension surrounding immigration policies, particularly in the tech sector, where the H-1B visa program has been a focal point. While Musk’s stance seems to champion the importance of skilled foreign workers , his exchange with Mackey has raised questions about the future direction of U.S. immigration reform.","Elon Musk and Steven Mackey found themselves at odds over the ongoing debate surrounding H-1B visas and immigration reform.

Biden reportedly regrets dropping out of US presidential race.

No blame on Kamala

Pressure to withdraw

Breaking 'transitional president' promise

Acknowledging mistakes

Dissatisfaction with the attorney general

US President Joe Biden regrets leaving the presidential race and believes he could have defeated President-elect Donald Trump in the 2024 election, according to sources who spoke with The Washington Post. Biden reportedly expressed these regrets to confidantes recently, claiming he was pressured by the Democratic Party to withdraw from the race in July.Biden and some of his aides have recently told confidantes that the president should have remained in the race and could have secured a second term, The Washington Post reported on Saturday, citing multiple anonymous sources familiar with the discussions.Biden's withdrawal followed low poll numbers and a poorly received debate performance on June 27, 2024, in which he provided unclear responses and appeared to struggle with his words. Vice president Kamala Harris , who ran as the Democratic presidential nominee, subsequently lost to Trump in the general election. Sources say Biden has not blamed Harris or her campaign.“Aides say the president has been careful not to place blame on Harris or her campaign,” the Washington Post report said.The president previously hinted at party pressure in an August interview with CBS News Sunday Morning, suggesting concerns from House and Senate Democrats about their own reelection chances. He also expressed confidence in a potential victory against Trump during a September appearance on The View.Many Democrats attribute Harris’s loss to Biden’s reluctance to exit the race earlier.“Biden ran on the promise that he was going to be a transitional president, and in effect, have one term before handing it off to another generation,” Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut) told The Washington Post. “I think his running again broke that concept — the conceptual underpinning of the theory that he would end the Trump appeal; he would defeat Trumpism and enable a new era.”Some advisors acknowledge a disconnect between Biden's governing style and current political dynamics. “The president has been operating on a time horizon measured in decades, while the political cycle is measured in four years,” Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, told the outlet.Biden has recently acknowledged mistakes, including his debate performance and the handling of pandemic relief checks. He and his aides also reportedly believe they could have improved public morale during the pandemic.The Washington Post also reports Biden has expressed dissatisfaction with Attorney General Merrick Garland, claiming he was both too aggressive in prosecuting his son, Hunter, and too slow in pursuing charges against Trump related to the January 6th riots, charges that were later dismissed.","Biden and some of his aides have recently told confidantes that the president should have remained in the race and could have secured a second term.

According to the New York Post, the allegations also stated that Biski tried to kiss the student there after touching her breasts, but the girl pulled away and ""promptly"" left.He would also ask the girl to play board games with other children at his house. According to the report, she once showed up to discover that she was the only student there. Biski allegedly lavished the girl with expensive presents, including his favorite childhood book, a flute that was only meant to be loaned to students, new clothes, and money, including $200 for Ugg boots.He texted the teenager around 700 times, including 82 times when they were in school, according to the SCI.The girl informed authorities that Biski instructed her to store his number under a false name, ""Arthur Dent,"" ""so as not to arouse suspicion.""A different student informed SCI that he thought the alias was that of ""Harvey Dent,"" a villain from Batman whose alter persona was ""Two-Face.""According to court records and the SCI investigation, Biski made the student touch his erection while groping and kissing her in his school office and telling her, ""That's how you make me feel.""In addition to giving the girl coveted solos and ""outstanding"" college reference letters, Biski assigned her to play lead flute in the school band, according to the student.She claimed that he engaged in these activities as a component of his grooming routine.She informed police that after she graduated, Biski would reportedly ""pester"" her into visiting his home to have sex when his wife and two children were away.The twisted texts kepts also continued.“No Halloween celebration?,” She was in her first year of college when he texted her, ""No slut outfit?""“No ‘I’m little red riding hood the whore.'”In another instance he texted, “I have risked everything for you. My job. My home. My kids. Everything.”The student informed detectives that she viewed Biski as a ""father figure"" and was ""disgusted"" by his actions.However, the student claimed that the sexual contact was consensual and that it happened after she turned 17, therefore the NYPD closed a criminal case against Biski.The SCI accused the teacher of engaging in ""egregious, manipulative, and predatory"" behavior.Biski was fired by the city Department of Education after the student came forward in June 2022, but according to documents, he continued to get $99,578 in fiscal year 2024 while working for the city until last year.A DOE spokesperson stated that he has ""irrevocably resigned.""SCI not only suggested that Biski be fired, but it also urged DOE to change school policies about teachers texting children using private phone numbers.The SCI has advised DOE to prohibit staff from reaching students on social media and on their cell phones. It has discovered at least 89 instances in the last five years of DOE staff members engaging in inappropriate text and online discussions with pupils.The 25-year-old former pupil sued Biski last year, accusing him of sexual assault and harassment.

Elon Musk's war against Republicans



President-elect Donald Trump Saturday broke his silence over the ongoing H-1B row and said he has been a believer in this program. Speaking to the New York Post, Trump said, “I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them.""“I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times.

Earlier, Donald Trump criticized the H-1B program and restricted the access to foreign worker visas during his first term. But recently, he said if anyone graduated from US college, universities, they should get green cards automatically.The shift over the H-1B stance made the row crucial as Trump administration may bring about some changes regarding the H-1B visa program through which companies can hire foreign workers. And Elon Musk becoming a prominent decision maker, his stance on extending H-1B visa became a reason for concern to the America First activists.The H-1B issue became a major flashpoint forcing Elon Musk to declare war on Republicans who are criticizing H-1B. “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla, and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,"" Elon Musk said. “Take a big step back and F**K YOURSELF in the face. I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend,” he added, paragraphing a memorable line from the 2008 comedy “Tropic Thunder.”","President-elect Donald Trump broke his silence over the ongoing H-1B row and said he has been a believer in this program. “I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas.

President-elect Donald Trump took to Truth Social, alleging that the Democrats had paid celebrities to lend their public support to Vice President Kamala Harris.In a post on Saturday, Trump claimed the Democrats had spent millions to secure endorsements from high-profile figures such as Beyoncé, Oprah Winfrey, and MSNBC host Al Sharpton.“Are the Democrats allowed to pay $11,000,000, $2,000,000, and $500,000 to get the ENDORSEMENT of Beyoncé, Oprah, and Reverend Al? I don’t think so,” the former president wrote.He went on to criticise the involvement of these figures, stating, “Beyoncé didn’t sing, Oprah didn’t do much of anything (she called it ‘expenses’), and Al is just a third rate Con Man.”Beyoncé and Oprah had both appeared alongside Harris during the campaign trail, with Oprah recently insisting that she “was not paid a dime” for her involvement in a live-streamed event, though the campaign did cover production fees, The Hill reported.Sharpton, the prominent civil rights activist and MSNBC host, interviewed Harris in October. He is also the founder of the National Action Network, a non-profit organisation that received a $500,000 donation from Harris’ campaign shortly before the interview. Sharpton subsequently organised a get-out-the-vote rally for Harris, just three days after the segment aired.An MSNBC spokesperson told the Washington Free Beacon that the network was unaware of the donations to the National Action Network. The network has declined to comment further on the matter, citing its policy of not discussing ""personnel matters.""Trump, in his Saturday post, questioned the legality of the donation, suggesting that it might be in violation of campaign laws.""So what is going on here??? Totally against the law, and I have heard there are many others!!!"" he wrote, continuing his criticism of Harris' campaign spending.Throughout the 2024 election cycle, Trump has frequently taken issue with Harris’ media appearances, including a CBS News interview in which he claimed the network altered her responses before airing.","Donald Trump took to Truth Social to criticise Vice President-elect Kamala Harris' campaign spending.

NYC Subway Fire: 'Scorched beyond recognition' NYC subway horror victim still unidentified. What's next?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/scorched-beyond-recognition-nyc-subway-horror-victim-still-unidentified-whats-next/articleshow/116748315.cms,"The identity of the victim who was set on fire in the NYC subway is not yet known.

The victim of the horrific subway fire incident is yet to be identified as the woman's body was scorched beyond recognition . The New York Post reported that the police are now considering using anthropological facial reconstruction to solve the case. The process of recreating the face is one of the few options available for investigators, who have been trying to use DNA analysis in the five days since the horrifying murder.Almost a week after the horrific incident in which Guatemalan illegal migrant Sebastian Zapeta Calil set a sleeping woman on fire in an NYC subway car, the identity of the woman has not been established. NYPD found a walker from the site indicating that the victim had mobility issues for which she could not immediately respond to the fire and could only get up when she was completely burnt.Social media users wrongly identified the woman as one Amelia Carter and an AI-generated image went viral while in reality the investigators are trying out all options available to identify the woman. No relatives or friends came forward claiming to have known the victim -- indicating that she was probably a homeless person.“Facial recognition or approximation comes in when you’re really trying to shake the trees, because you’ve kind of hit a dead end, nothing’s showing up database, days and weeks have gone by and you want to call in the public to say, ‘Does anybody know who this person is?'” said Nathan Lents, a professor of Biology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.“Getting DNA from a badly burned body can be challenging, but a lot of times ‘badly burned’ just means badly on the outside and beyond visual recognition,” said Lents.“There may be plenty of bones and internal soft tissue that is accessible for DNA extraction, unless the body has been completely incinerated, as in a cremation.”Authorities announced Friday they were making strides with the DNA extraction, but not enough to identify the victim.“As many of you know, the criminal court complaint and the indictment at this time indicates the death of a Jane Doe. The police and the medical examiner’s office and many investigators are working to identify her,” Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said at a press conference. “The body was badly burned, and so advanced fingerprinting efforts are being made, as well as advanced DNA evidence to identify her. We have made some progress in that area, but I’m not at liberty to get into specifics now,” he said.","The identity of the woman who was set on fire in the NYC subway is not yet known.

The boy, identified as Balach, son of Sabrullah, is from the Panjgur district, and his family members claimed that he was forcibly taken from his home ten days ago during a raid by Pakistani forces.According to The Balochistan Post, Balach was reportedly subjected to physical abuse before being taken away while still injured. Authorities have yet to comment on the incident, which has sparked concern among local and international human rights organisations.The Pakistani military's repeated targeting of the family has been documented, with previous incidents including a raid on their residence where property was damaged and two hand grenades were thrown outside, though no injuries were reported.According to local sources, the forces have conducted regular raids on the house, subjecting the family to continuous intimidation, as per the report.In another incident, Pakistani forces detained a man identified as Fazal Bashir in the coastal city of Gwadar. Fazal, a resident of Hirabad area in Kech district, was detained on December 23, and his location remains unidentified, according to The Balochistan Post.His family has sought assistance from human rights organisations to determine his whereabouts, worried about his safety. The persistent issue of enforced disappearances in Balochistan continues to draw attention, with local activists and human rights organisations demanding accountability and the release of missing persons.Despite continuous calls for justice, these incidents highlight the ongoing accusations against Pakistani security forces in the region.The families of Balach and Fazal have requested authorities to investigate their cases and provide information about their missing relatives.Balochistan continues to witness systematic abductions and killings, affecting various segments of society including activists, politicians, journalists and civilians, who are reportedly taken by security forces, according to news agency ANI.The Pakistani military faces frequent accusations of using enforced disappearances as a tactic against insurgents and separatist groups. Human rights organisations and Baloch nationalist groups argue that these abductions aim to suppress opposition.These disappearances often lead to torture and extrajudicial killings, intensifying the human rights situation in the region, the report added.","A 13-year-old boy and a man have gone missing in Balochistan.

May 9 Riots and aftermath

International outcry

Pakistan's response

Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots that targeted military sites and other facilities following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan This brings the total number of convictions related to the unrest to 85, according to announcements from the military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).Among those sentenced is Hassan Niazi , Khan’s nephew, who received a 10-year prison term for his alleged role in the attack on the Lahore Corps Commander’s residence, also known as Jinnah House.The ISPR stated that the Field General Court Martial handed down the sentences after reviewing evidence and ensuring due process. “Sequel to the announcement of the May 9 punishments... the Field General Court Martial has promulgated the punishments to the following remaining 60 culprits after examining all evidence, ensuring the provision of all legal rights to the convicts, completion of due process, and the appropriate legal proceedings,” the ISPR announced.The convicted individuals face sentences ranging from two to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment. They have the right to appeal the decisions under Pakistan's Constitution.The unrest on May 9 erupted after Imran Khan’s arrest in a corruption case. Supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party allegedly attacked key military installations, including the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, the Corps Commander’s House in Lahore, and an ISI office in Faisalabad.In response, authorities detained hundreds of individuals, and 103 were handed over to military courts for trial, sparking widespread criticism of the opaque judicial process.The convictions have drawn sharp rebukes from international entities, including the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union. Critics argue that the use of military courts to try civilians undermines judicial independence and transparency.“These military courts lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees,” the US State Department said. Similarly, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCO) criticized the lack of transparency and independent oversight in the trials, emphasizing the importance of adhering to fair trial standards under international law.The European Union also expressed concern, highlighting that Pakistan’s actions contradict its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and commitments tied to the GSP+ trade program.The Pakistani government has defended the use of military courts, citing the Supreme Court’s decision that allowed the military to proceed with trials of civilians involved in the riots. The Foreign Office reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to international human rights obligations, asserting that the trials were conducted in accordance with national laws.The ISPR emphasized that the convictions reflect the military’s resolve to uphold justice and maintain the authority of the state, stating, “The Nation, Government, and Armed Forces remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding justice and ensuring that the inviolable writ of the state is maintained.”","Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots.

Pakistan Airstrikes Afghanistan: Kabul claims Pak airstrikes killed 46 civilians in Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/kabul-claims-pak-airstrikes-killed-46-civilians-in-afghanistan/articleshow/116661701.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The interim Afghan Taliban govt claimed on Wednesday that 46 people, mostly women and children, were killed in airstrikes by Pakistani fighter jets on civilians in eastern Afghanistan late Tuesday night.Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province near Pakistan’s volatile South Waziristan tribal district, on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). This has been the fourth time in the past few years that Pakistan has conducted airstrikes inside Afghanistan, and the second time since March 2024.“Last night (Tuesday), Pakistan bombarded four points in Barmal district of Paktika province. The total number of dead is 46, most of whom were children and women,” said Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson for the Afghan Taliban govt. He added that six others, mostly children, were wounded.Condemning the airstrikes, the Afghan defence ministry called them “barbaric” and a clear “aggression”. It stated that several refugees, including women and children, were killed and injured. “The Pakistani side should understand that such arbitrary measures are not a solution to any problem,” Enayatullah Khowarazami, spokesperson for Afghanistan’s defence ministry, wrote on social media platform ‘X’. “The Islamic Emirate (Afghan Taliban regime) will not leave this cowardly act unanswered, but rather considers the defence of its territory and sovereignty to be its inalienable right,” he added.The strikes took place hours after Pakistan special representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq met interim Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul, intending to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long gap. The deteriorating ties, however, are likely to worsen following Tuesday night’s airstrikes, analysts said.Pakistan alleges the Afghan government harbours armed groups, particularly the TTP, which conducts cross-border assaults against Pakistani security forces. In one of the worst recent assaults on security forces, the TTP had claimed responsibility for the killing of at least 16 Pakistani soldiers in South Waziristan last week.Kabul, however, denies providing shelter to armed groups or allowing their territory to be used for cross-border attacks.Border tensions between the two countries have surged since the Taliban regime took control in 2021, with Pakistan experiencing a revival of militant activity along its western border. Deadly air attacks by Pakistan’s military in Afghan border regions in March, which the Taliban claimed killed eight civilians, had sparked confrontations along the the disputed border between the two countries.","Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province. This has been the fourth time in the past few years that Pakistan has conducted airstrikes inside Afghanistan.

Tensions have grown since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021, with Pakistan accusing Kabul of harbouring militants responsible for attacks on Pakistani soil. Kabul has denied the allegations.The latest strike follows a recent raid claimed by the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) near the Afghan border, which Islamabad intelligence said killed 16 soldiers.On the same day as the air strikes, high-ranking Taliban officials were meeting with Pakistan's special envoy for Afghanistan in Kabul.

In response, the Afghan Taliban denies these allegations, asserting that civilians, not militants, were targeted in the latest strikes.“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan considers this a brutal act against all international principles and blatant aggression and strongly condemns it,” said the Afghan ministry of defence. “The Islamic Emirate will not leave this cowardly act unanswered but rather considers the defense of its territory to be its inalienable right.”Islamabad contends that many TTP leaders and fighters have fled to Afghanistan, finding refuge in border provinces under Taliban protection. Afghan officials, however, have refuted these claims, stating that the victims of the bombings were primarily displaced civilians.The strikes came just after Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan’s special representative for Afghanistan, visited Kabul for discussions on trade and bilateral relations.

The sanctions had frozen any US property owned by the targeted entities and barred US nationals from doing business with them.“Pakistan does not harbour any intention in which its nuclear system is aggressive, it is 100% in Pakistan’s defence. It is just intended for deterrence purposes and nothing else,” Sharif told cabinet members during a meeting.Noting that his foreign affairs ministry had given a “comprehensive response” to Washington on the matter, Sharif said, “This programme is not mine, nor any political party’s; it belongs to the 240 million people of this country, and it is dear to them. There will be no compromise on this programme, and the entire nation is united on this issue.”According to a US state department factsheet, the Islamabad-based NDC had sought to obtain components for Pakistan’s long-range ballistic-missile programme and missile-testing equipment. It stated the NDC “is responsible for the development of Pakistan’s ballistic missiles,” including the Shaheen family of missiles.The US sanctions were preceded by high-level military engagements between China and Pakistan.

Copying Cirus

MUMBAI: A little-known incident in the history of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme is a purported attempt made by the country in the early ’70s to copy the design of India’s Cirus reactor — a 40 MW thermal neutron research facility, which first achieved criticality at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Trombay, near Mumbai, on July 10, 1960. An acronym for Canada India Reactor Utility Services, Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million, according to news reports.Pakistan’s attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan , a man who played a role in the neighbouring country’s nuclear weapons programme. In his book “Eating Grass: The Making Of The Pakistani Bomb”, published in 2012 by the Stanford University Press, Feroz wrote, “Munir Ahmed Khan, later chairman of the PAEC [Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission], recalled that in October 1965 he had met Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto [the then Pakistan foreign minister] in Vienna. Munir explained to him that he had been to India’s Cirus facility at Trombay in 1964 and saw for himself that India was well on its way to making the [nuclear] bomb. Bhutto asked Munir to meet Ayub Khan in December during Ayub’s upcoming visits to the United Kingdom and the United States and try to convince the president of the urgency of a weapons programme.” The country eventually carried out its first nuclear weapons tests on May 28 and 30, 1998.Feroz’s disclosure, though now 12 years old, assumes immediate significance in the context of the US last week announcing fresh sanctions on Pakistan’smissile development programme. For the first time, the measures target Pakistan’s state-run National Development Complex, for its role in the country’s mission development programme. US deputy NSA Jon Finer has said, “Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology… If these trends continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.”Feroz’s writing about the Cirus reactor is important because the plutonium for India’s Smiling Buddha project — the country’s first nuclear weapons test at Pokhran on May 18, 1974 — was from this reactor.According to Feroz, “Pakistani leadership wanted the rights to copy technological designs for its indigenous programme without incurring penalties and while remaining on the ‘good side’ of the international system.” He recalled: “While work to commission KANUPP [Karachi Nuclear Power Complex] went on, Munir Ahmed Khan said that there would be a secret team headed by a nuclear official, Sardar Ali Khan, to work on replicating India’s Cirus reactor.The author quotes Pervez Butt, who was purportedly part of the secret “copying’’ team and was chairman of PAEC between 2001 and 2005, as telling him, “Our team worked tirelessly, I did the mechanical part. When we merged our work and presented, Munir Khan could not believe it.”Feroz, however, has questioned Pakistan’s decision to copy the design of the Cirus reactor because there were some fundamental differences between Cirus and Kanupp.The team had modified the basic Cirus design.","Pakistan's attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan. Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million.

Meaningful dialogue based on positive intentions should be held,"" PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said.He stressed that the potential talks should have a defined timeframe, adding that the dialogue must progress positively considering the sensitivity of the situation.National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq had taken the lead by offering on Wednesday that he was ready to host the two sides and facilitate their parleys.He welcomed the newly constituted committee and invited the government and opposition for talks, saying ""the speaker's office is always open for members"", according to a statement issued by the NA Secretariat.The speaker called on members of both committees to meet on Monday morning, adding that he would meet them at his chambers in Parliament House.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram said his party accepted the speaker's invitation to meet. He said their committee will attend the meeting on Monday.Akram said the PTI founder will be informed about the progress of the meeting and he will decide whether to cancel the civil disobedience movement .The talks are being held after the PTI had threatened to give a call for civil disobedience.The party posted on X from the account of the jailed former prime minister regarding the call for civil disobedience movement, which was initially shared on December 19, stating that the campaign will be launched if the government doesn't make progress on the party's demands by Sunday.""I had presented two demands to the government, the release of under-trial political prisoners and the establishment of a judicial commission for a transparent investigation into the events of May 9, 2023 and November 26, 2024,"" the post quoted PTI founder Khan. It further stated that both of these demands ""are legitimate"".""If the government fails to take any action on them by Sunday, the first phase of the civil disobedience movement - 'remittance boycott' - will be launched,"" it said.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram also reiterated that the civil disobedience drive would be launched tomorrow (Monday) if the party's demands go unmet.However, the issue of civil disobedience has been apparently put on hold for some time while allowing the two sides to address the differences through political means.Khan, 72, on December 5 had warned of a civil disobedience movement from December 14 if his demands about the release of political prisoners facing trial and the formation of a judicial commission to probe the events of May 9, 2023, and November 26 this year were unmet.Meanwhile, Pakistan's military courts sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for attacking military installations during riots which erupted following the arrest of Khan in May last year, the Army announced on Saturday.On May 9, 2023, Khan's PTI supporters allegedly attacked several military installations, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and the ISI building in Faisalabad, to vent their anger against the arrest of their party founder in a corruption case.Hundreds of suspects were arrested in the countrywide swoop and at least 103 were handed over to the military authorities for trial due to their involvement in attacks on military installations.Khan's party has launched multiple protests through 2023 and 2024 demanding the release of their supreme leader, the latest being in November 2024.The former prime minister, currently lodged at the Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, was arrested in August last year and faces multiple cases since his government was toppled in April 2022.","The committee includes deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan.

"1,566 terror attacks killed 924 in Pakistan over past 10 months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/1566-terror-attacks-killed-924-in-pakistan-over-past-10-months/articleshow/116551393.cms,"KARACHI: Ten years have passed since Ajoon Khan's son died in a ghastly attack by the Pakistani Taliban that killed about 150 people, mostly children, at a military-run school in Peshawar, in northwestern Pakistan. But the pain of loss is unrelenting - it grows only deeper with time. Khan, a lawyer, said he could never forget the parents sobbing and pleading outside the school gates.The brutal assault on the school in Peshawar led to rare political unity in support of a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy for Pakistan and a vast military operation in the country's former tribal areas near Afghanistan. The efforts forced militants to retreat across the border and brought a degree of relative peace to Pakistan. Large-scale terrorist attacks were significantly reduced, with fatalities dropping from 2,451 across 1,717 attacks in 2013 to 220 in 146 attacks in 2020. But the hard-won gains are now in jeopardy.Over the past few years, violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan. Experts attribute the increase to the Afghan Taliban's seizure of power in neighbouring Afghanistan in Aug 2021.Last week, the interior ministry reported that 924 people, including civilians and law enforcement personnel, had been killed in 1,566 terrorist attacks across the country over the past 10 months. It said 341 terrorists had been killed during the period.Early on Saturday, sixteen soldiers were killed in northwest Pakistan in an attack by Islamist militants, a senior police official in the South Waziristan region said. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack, giving a higher figure for the number of personnel killed, Reuters reported.Experts and security officials have identified a range of challenges impeding Pakistan's progress against terrorism: political instability, weak governance, dwindling public support, economic constraints and reduced US counterterrorism assistance after the end of the 20-year war in Afghanistan.""The greatest challenge lies in mobilising the necessary financial resources and manpower for operations across such vast regions,"" said Muhammad Amir Rana, director of the Pak Institute for Peace Studies, a security think tank in Islamabad. The source of the problem for Pakistan, experts say, is found across the border, in Afghanistan.The Taliban administration in Kabul, the Afghan capital, denies accusations of harbouring militants from TTP. But Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace, said the TTP had been given ""a permissive safe haven in Afghanistan,"" which had allowed it to become ""resilient and lethal.""Pakistani security officials privately acknowledged that they had misjudged how the new Taliban rulers of Afghanistan would handle TTP. The officials had anticipated that the Taliban leaders would help curb the TTP in return for the covert support that Pakistan had provided them during the US-led war. Instead, the Taliban in Kabul have provided the TTP with resources and advanced American-made weapons and equipment seized after the collapse of the US-supported Afghan govt, according to a senior security official in Islamabad who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The TTP has gone on to unleash a wave of attacks inside Pakistan as it wages a campaign whose aim is to overthrow the govt. Among them was a suicide bombing in January 2023 that killed over 100 people at a mosque in Peshawar.Pakistani security forces have also been locked in a conflict with ethnic separatist groups in Balochistan, an arid province bordering Afghanistan and Iran that is home to the Chinese-run port Gwadar. nyt","Violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan.

A Pakistani paramilitary soldier died and seven others sustained injuries during cross-border fire exchanges with Afghan forces, according to a security source on Saturday. Meanwhile, hundreds of Afghans demonstrated against the deadly Pakistani air strikes carried out last Tuesday that sparked the clashes.Officials from both nations reported sporadic fighting, including the use of heavy armaments, occurring overnight between border forces along the frontier separating Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and Afghanistan 's Khost province.These exchanges of fire followed accusations by Afghanistan's Taliban authorities that Pakistan had caused 46 fatalities, mostly women and children, in air strikes near the border in Paktika province this week.A senior Pakistani security source indicated they had targeted ""terrorist hideouts"", although Islamabad has not formally acknowledged conducting the bombardment.""One frontier corps (FC) soldier has been reported dead, and seven others have been injured,"" a senior security source at the border informed AFP, noting that clashes occurred in at least two locations in Pakistan's Kurram border district.The Afghan defence ministry said on X that ""several points"" across the Pakistani border ""where the attacks in Afghanistan were organised were targeted in retaliation"".A Khost provincial official informed AFP that residents evacuated border areas due to the clashes, but reported no casualties among Afghan forces.In Khost city's provincial capital, hundreds of Afghans protested against Pakistan on Saturday, demanding accountability for civilian casualties.Protester Najibullah Zaland expressed their desire for global economic pressure on Pakistan to prevent such incidents.""We gathered here today to raise our voices to the world,"" he told AFP.

Lessons in gun safety

Rapper OG 2 LOW has ignited a firestorm on social media after an unsettling incident during a live recording of the "" 1 on 1 W/ Mike D "" podcast. The rapper, known for his candid storytelling, accidentally shot himself while discussing his career and future on the show, leading to immediate shock and concern among viewers and the podcast crew.The moment unfolded unexpectedly as OG 2 LOW was in the middle of an engaging anecdote when a muffled ""pop"" interrupted his story. Viewers were left stunned when it became clear that the sound was the result of a gun accidentally going off in the rapper's pocket. The pistol discharged, injuring OG 2 LOW in the leg. The injury, though not life-threatening, caused a stir, and live-streamed footage of the incident quickly spread across social media platforms.""Who got shot?"" host Mike D immediately asked, his voice tinged with shock, before confirming that OG 2 LOW was the only one hurt. Despite the surprise, the rapper appeared alert and composed, further assuring fans that the injury was not severe. The incident, however, left the room in an eerie silence before the live recording resumed.Fans and online commentators were quick to draw comparisons to the infamous 2008 incident involving former NFL player Plaxico Burress. The wide receiver unintentionally shot himself in the thigh while at a nightclub, sparking an ongoing debate about gun safety. With OG 2 LOW's accident unfolding on a public platform, the parallels were hard to ignore.The live footage soon went viral, with clips circulating widely on platforms like Twitter and Instagram. Memes flooded social media, some expressing relief that the injury wasn’t worse, while others criticized the rapper for carrying a weapon during an interview. ""How does that even happen?"" one Twitter user commented. ""This ain’t the first time a celeb shot themselves, but it’s the most shocking.""The incident prompted an outpouring of opinions on gun safety. Some called for better regulations on carrying firearms in public spaces, while others expressed concern over the potential dangers of untrained individuals possessing weapons.In the aftermath of the accident, OG 2 LOW and Mike D reassured fans that everyone was safe. ""Right now, man, we’re just being grateful that everyone is safe, everyone is good,"" OG 2 LOW said, reflecting on the chaos that had just unfolded.Mike D lightened the mood by adding, ""We had to take a small break. We had a pop, a moment, you know what I’m saying? It’s never happened on '1 on 1 with Mike D.' But tonight, with my brother Tulo, every time we get together, we make history. So, I guess we just made history, y’all.""Despite the lighthearted remarks, the incident remains a sobering reminder of the importance of gun safety.The shooting has reignited discussions about responsible gun ownership and safety, particularly in public settings. While OG 2 LOW's injury was minor, similar incidents have had far more serious consequences. In Burress’s case, the accidental discharge of his weapon resulted in a jail sentence and public scrutiny. Later, Burress became an advocate for gun safety, stressing the importance of proper licensing and training.Experts argue that stricter adherence to gun safety regulations is crucial, especially for high-profile individuals. Public figures, often seen as role models, are under heightened scrutiny regarding their actions and behavior, including their handling of firearms."," OG 2 LOW accidentally shot himself during a live recording of the ""1 on 1 W/ Mike D "" podcast.

"José Andrés celebrated with US Presidential Medal of Freedom, but photo with Trump’s would-be assassin sparks debate",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jos-andrs-celebrated-with-us-presidential-medal-of-freedom-but-photo-with-trumps-would-be-assassin-sparks-debate/articleshow/116955842.cms,"Biden Gives Medal Of Honor to José Andrés

Renowned chef and humanitarian José Andrés received the prestigious Presidential Medal of Freedom during a White House ceremony on Saturday. The Spanish-American chef, known for revolutionizing the tapas scene in the US and leading the World Central Kitchen initiative, was honored alongside other luminaries, including Hillary Clinton , Bono, and Lionel Messi. However, his moment of triumph is now overshadowed by a shocking photo of Andrés with Ryan Wesley Routh, the man who attempted to assassinate incoming President Donald Trump in September.The disturbing image shows Andrés with Routh, who allegedly tried to kill Trump while the former president was golfing at his West Palm Beach club. Secret Service agents foiled the assassination attempt when they saw Routh carrying a gun, though he hadn’t fired. The situation unfolded quickly as Routh fled the scene, dropping his AR-15-style rifle, only to be captured by nearby police.While the photo of Andrés with Routh has raised eyebrows, the chef’s legacy remains firmly rooted in his humanitarian work. Andrés founded World Central Kitchen (WCK), a nonprofit organization that feeds people in disaster zones. His work has earned him widespread recognition, including the National Humanities Medal , which he received from the White House in 2016.The Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded by President Joe Biden, recognizes outstanding individuals in fields ranging from science and politics to civil rights and entertainment. Despite the unexpected controversy, Andrés stands firm in his commitment to making the world a better place through food and charity.","José Andrés received the Presidential Medal of Freedom during a White House ceremony on Saturday.

Conservative outrage erupted on Fox & Friends over the Biden administration ’s latest round of Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients, with hosts and pundits sparing no words in their condemnation. The list included controversial figures like Hillary Clinton and billionaire George Soros , whose inclusion triggered particularly fiery reactions.On Saturday morning’s broadcast, host Rachel Campos-Duffy warned her co-host, Joe Concha, to brace himself. “Joe, gird yourself,” she said. “Today, Biden is going to present—get this—Hillary Clinton, George Soros, and 17 others with the Presidential Medal of Freedom!”Soros, long vilified by conservatives for his extensive funding of progressive causes, was labeled by Campos-Duffy as the “most evil man.” His financial support for political accountability and media projects has made him a prime target for far-right critics, with many accusing him of attempting to manipulate global politics.The reaction was swift and vehement. Elon Musk called the selection a “travesty,” while Steve Bannon , a vocal opponent of Soros, described the award as a badge of honor for a man he believes epitomizes everything wrong with the current administration. “Soros and Hillary to get the nation’s highest civilian award from the illegitimate Biden regime today,” Bannon lamented.The backlash continued to build as social media erupted with critiques, with users questioning why such divisive figures were being honored with the prestigious medal. For many conservatives, the decision underscored their view of a White House that favors the political left, offering the Medal of Freedom as a symbol of political loyalty rather than merit.Despite the criticism, the White House defended its selections, emphasizing the significant contributions of the honorees to public service, human rights, and global democracy. However, for many on the right, including Fox & Friends hosts, the inclusion of Soros in particular was a bridge too far, prompting a fiery condemnation of what they see as Biden’s attempt to honor figures they view as divisive and controversial.","Conservative outrage erupted on Fox & Friends over the Biden administration ’s latest round of Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients.

Israel confirmed on Saturday that negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal had resumed in Qatar, as rescuers said more than 30 people had been killed in fresh bombardment of the territory.The civil defence agency said a dawn air strike on the home of the al-Ghoula family in Gaza City killed 11 people, seven of them children.images from the neighbourhood of Shujaiya showed residents combing through smoking rubble. Bodies including those of small children were lined up on the ground, shrouded in white sheets.As the violence raged, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz confirmed that indirect negotiations with Hamas had resumed in Qatar for the release of hostages seized in the October 2023 attacks.The minister told relatives of one of the hostages, woman soldier Liri Albag, that ""efforts are under way to free the hostages, notably the Israeli delegation which left yesterday (Friday) for negotiations in Qatar"", his office said.Katz said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had given ""detailed instructions for the continued negotiations"".He was speaking after Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, released a video of Albag in captivity in Gaza.In the undated, three-and-half-minute recording that AFP has not been able to verify, the 19-year-old conscript called in Hebrew for the Israeli government to secure her release.In response, her family issued an appeal to Netanyahu, saying: ""It's time to take decisions as if it were your own children there.""A total of 96 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.Campaign group the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the latest video was ""firm and incontestable proof of the urgency of bringing the hostages home"".Hamas had said late on Friday that the negotiations were poised to resume.The militant group, whose October 7, 2023, attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war, said they would ""focus on ensuring the agreement leads to a complete cessation of hostilities (and) the withdrawal of occupation forces"".Mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been engaged in months of effort that have failed to end nearly 15 months of war.In December, Qatar expressed optimism that ""momentum"" was returning to the talks following the US election of Donald Trump, who takes office in 16 days.But Hamas and Israel then accused each other of setting new conditions and obstacles.As the clock ticks down to the handover of power in Washington, the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden notified Congress of an $8 billion arms sale to Israel, a source familiar with the plan said on Saturday.""The department has informally notified Congress of an $8 billion proposed sale of munitions to support Israel's long-term security by resupplying stocks of critical munitions and air defence capabilities,"" the official said.The United States is Israel's largest military supplier.- 'Everything was shaking' -Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said the Ghoula home in Gaza City ""was completely destroyed"" by the dawn strike.""It was a two-storey building and several people are still under the rubble,"" he said, adding Israeli drones had ""also fired on ambulance staff"".Contacted by AFP, the Israeli army did not immediately comment.""A huge explosion woke us up.

A decorated soldier, a hidden struggle

A silent cry for help

A tragic final symbol

Pain unspoken

The tragic death of Green Beret Matthew Livelsberger , who died by suicide in a Tesla Cybertruck explosion outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on New Year’s Day, has shed light on the mental toll of war. The decorated Special Forces soldier had confided in his ex-girlfriend about the emotional scars he carried after serving in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province.Livelsberger, 37, was a five-time Bronze Star recipient , including one with a “V” for valor under fire. His military career, marked by extraordinary bravery, was also shadowed by post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ). ""Just some concussions,"" he told his ex-girlfriend, Alicia Arritt, in text messages, downplaying the trauma of combat, reported AP.Arritt, a former Army nurse, recalled how Livelsberger spoke of the exhaustion and sleepless nights that followed him home. ""He kept reliving the violence,"" she said. The soldier's anguish was reflected in a graphic tattoo he shared with her—two skulls pierced by bullets, symbolizing the lives he took in Afghanistan.Livelsberger and Arritt met in 2018 through a dating app. Their shared military background created a bond, with Arritt often serving as his confidant. She described him as a man deeply affected by the horrors of war but hesitant to seek help due to the stigma within his Special Forces unit. "" Mental health was seen as a weakness,"" she said.Despite his struggles, Livelsberger recently reached out for treatment for depression through the Army, according to an anonymous US official. However, the toll of years of silent suffering was apparent.In his final days, Livelsberger reconnected with Arritt, sending her cheerful messages and videos of the Tesla Cybertruck he would later use in the explosion. Arritt believes his actions carried symbolic meaning. ""He felt things very deeply, and I could see him using the truck and the location as a metaphor,"" she said.Authorities confirmed that the explosion was not a terrorist act. In notes left behind, Livelsberger referred to his death as a ""wakeup call"" and a way to ""cleanse the demons"" of war.Arritt, who treated traumatic brain injuries during her Army service, recognized symptoms of memory loss and withdrawal in Livelsberger early on. ""He struggled, but he hid it well,"" she said. She also lamented the military’s failure to provide timely mental health support.On January 1, Livelsberger detonated the Cybertruck, which was loaded with fireworks, fuel, and mortar rounds, before taking his own life. Seven people were injured in the explosion.","Green Beret Matthew Livelsberger, 37, died by suicide in a Tesla Cybertruck explosion outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on New Year's Day.

Hate-driven crime

In a haunting phone call recorded days after Blaze Bernstein went missing in January 2018, his father Gideon Bernstein reached out to Samuel Woodward, the last person known to have seen his son alive. The exchange, marked by apparent concern from Woodward, later unravelled as a chilling piece of evidence in a case that revealed hate, violence, and deception.Blaze Bernstein, a 19-year-old pre-med student at the University of Pennsylvania, disappeared while visiting his family in Lake Forest, California, during winter break. On January 3, 2018, Blaze had gone out to meet Woodward, a former high school classmate, after connecting on social media. When Blaze failed to return home, leaving behind his glasses, wallet, and packed bags for his return to college, his family grew alarmed.In desperation, Blaze’s father used social media to track Woodward and initiated a phone call, which his daughter Beaue recorded. According to, Gideon told Woodward, “We haven’t heard from him all day. He missed an appointment today, and then we started getting concerned. You’re the first real clue to the puzzle here.”Woodward responded with apparent empathy, saying, “Yeah, I feel like [expletive], honestly, I’m sorry. I want to find Blaze as much as you do.” He went on to describe their evening, claiming Blaze suggested meeting another friend at Borrego Park. According to Woodward, Blaze walked off into the night, leaving him waiting by a restroom.The story raised more questions than answers. As Blaze’s family pressed for clarity, their instincts led them to alert authorities, who soon placed Woodward under surveillance.Six days after Blaze went missing, his body was found in a shallow grave at Borrego Park. The brutal nature of his death shocked investigators and the community. Blaze had been stabbed multiple times in the face, neck, and knee, with defensive wounds indicating a desperate fight for his life.Woodward was brought in for questioning and later arrested. Asreported, a search of his home uncovered evidence tying him to violent neo-Nazi ideologies, including a bloodstained mask, knife, and anti-gay and anti-Semitic materials.Prosecutors contended that Woodward’s actions were motivated by hate, presenting evidence of his association with the Atomwaffen Division , a neo-Nazi extremist group. They argued that Woodward targeted Blaze because he was gay and Jewish, a claim Woodward denied.In court, Woodward’s defence shifted blame to personal struggles, including a diagnosis of autism and confusion about his sexuality. His attorney claimed the killing was a panicked reaction to a perceived invasion of privacy, alleging without evidence that Blaze was attempting to photograph him during an intimate moment.Woodward was convicted of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement in July 2024 and sentenced to life without parole in November. Blaze’s parents, Jeanne Pepper Bernstein and Gideon Bernstein, expressed relief at the outcome but noted the enduring pain of losing their son.“While he rots in prison, we will be here on the outside, celebrating the life of Blaze,” Jeanne said during the sentencing.","Blaze Bernstein, a 19-year-old pre-med student at the University of Pennsylvania, disappeared while visiting his family in Lake Forest, California, during winter break.

New Orleans attack: Why Isis jihadis use vehicles as 'mowing machine',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-orleans-car-attack-shamsud-din-jabbar-isis-islamic-state/articleshow/116919548.cms,"Jabbar’s case is particularly unsettling because of his background. Once a decorated soldier, he served in Afghanistan before transitioning to a civilian career at Deloitte, a major consulting firm.

, a 42-year-old Texas native and US army veteran, used a rented pickup truck to mow down revelers on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, killing 14 and injuring dozens. The New Orleans tragedy unfolded with chilling efficiency. Surveillance footage showed Jabbar maneuvering his rented F-150 Lightning around barricades, accelerating into a dense pedestrian zone in the heart of the city’s tourist district. Witnesses described chaos and carnage as the truck plowed through the crowd, flying an Islamic State ( Isis ) flag from its rear. Moments later, Jabbar was dead following a shootout with police, but the shockwaves of his act reverberated across the country.

( ) flag from its rear. Moments later, Jabbar was dead following a shootout with police, but the shockwaves of his act reverberated across the country. The FBI labeled the attack an act of terrorism after discovering that Jabbar had pledged allegiance to Isis hours before the massacre. An Isis flag was found in the truck, and investigators confirmed he acted alone.

Jabbar was killed in a shootout with police moments after his rampage.

Why it matters

The tragedy has renewed scrutiny on the enduring influence of jihadist propaganda and the challenges of preventing lone-wolf attacks.

The New Orleans massacre is the deadliest Isis-inspired attack on US soil in years, underscoring the ongoing threat of ""mowing machine"" tactics—using vehicles as weapons of mass destruction.

Adding to the complexity, Jabbar’s profile defies typical expectations for jihadist recruits. A former soldier with a corporate job and no known connections to organized terror groups, his radicalization journey raises critical questions about how Isis’s online propaganda resonates with vulnerable individuals in the West.

His descent into radicalism took family and friends by surprise. His half-brother, Abdur Jabbar, described him as “charismatic” and “loving,” with no outward signs of anger or hatred.

However, personal struggles may have made Jabbar susceptible to Isis’s influence. He had faced financial difficulties following a divorce and was dealing with the aftermath of his father’s stroke. A series of religious audio recordings made by Jabbar a year before the attack, posted on SoundCloud, reveal his adoption of increasingly radical views, including condemning music and intoxicants.

Zoom in: Isis’s 'mowing machine' strategy

The concept of using vehicles as weapons first gained traction with al-Qaida, which in 2010 published a guide in its Inspire magazine detailing how to maximize casualties in such attacks. Isis later expanded on these ideas, emphasizing the psychological impact of ramming attacks.

reflects the tactic's gruesome intent: to plow through dense crowds, causing maximum carnage. Isis’s 2016 publication described using heavy vehicles like trucks to target pedestrian areas, using vivid language like “crushing bones” to inspire fear, a study by the Mineta Transportation Institute said.

These attacks are devastatingly effective because they require minimal resources. A rented truck is readily available in any city, and the spontaneity of such attacks makes them difficult to detect or prevent.

Low barriers to entry: Unlike bombings or shootings, vehicle ramming requires no specialized equipment or extensive planning.

Attackers blend into normal traffic until the moment of action, catching law enforcement off guard. Experts say Isis has shifted its focus from organizing coordinated operations to inspiring lone actors through online platforms. Social media and encrypted messaging apps like Telegram have become critical tools for recruitment, allowing individuals to feel part of a global community without ever meeting another member of the group.

Psychological vulnerability: Experts suggest that personal crises, such as Jabbar’s divorce and financial troubles, can create fertile ground for radical ideologies to take root.

Experts suggest that personal crises, such as Jabbar’s divorce and financial troubles, can create fertile ground for radical ideologies to take root. Decentralized terror: Jabbar’s attack exemplifies Isis’s decentralized strategy, where individuals act in its name without direct orders, making detection even harder.

The big picture: A global pattern

According to the study by the Mineta Transportation Institute, vehicle ramming attacks have seen a marked increase globally since 2014, coinciding with a surge in jihadist propaganda advocating their use.

70% of the 184 documented vehicle attacks between 1963 and 2019 occurred after January 2014. These incidents resulted in 481 fatalities, highlighting the lethality of this tactic. Notably, jihadist-motivated attacks, which constituted just 10% of the total incidents, were responsible for 30% of all fatalities, underscoring their disproportionately high impact, the study said.

Geographically, the United States has experienced 39 vehicle attacks, resulting in 25 deaths, while countries like France and the United Kingdom have seen deadlier incidents. The 2016 Bastille Day attack in Nice remains the most catastrophic, with 86 fatalities, and illustrates the devastating potential of these low-tech methods.

Urban centers with dense pedestrian traffic are particularly vulnerable, and rental vehicles—used in 9% of all documented attacks—account for 29% of fatalities due to their strategic targeting of high-profile events and crowded areas. These statistics underline the enduring and global nature of the threat posed by vehicle ramming.

Between the lines

Jabbar’s attack is part of a broader resurgence of Isis-inspired violence. Although the group’s territorial ""caliphate"" was dismantled in 2019, its ideological influence persists, particularly among disaffected individuals in the West.

A reconstituted threat: Isis has increased its operations in Africa and Afghanistan, using social media to amplify its message globally.

Unrelenting propaganda: The group has also exploited global events, such as the Israel-Gaza conflict, to bolster recruitment and fuel anger among sympathizers.

The contagion effect of such attacks—where one incident inspires others—poses a long-term challenge for counterterrorism efforts.

The group’s ability to inspire violence across continents underscores the enduring appeal of its narrative of grievance and apocalyptic vision. In the aftermath of the New Orleans attack, SITE Intelligence Group reported celebratory chatter among Isis supporters online, with one user declaring, “If it’s a brother, he’s a legend. Allahu Akbar.”

New Orleans officials have vowed to improve crowd protection with more barriers and checkpoints. However, experts warn that no system is foolproof.Preventing such attacks requires addressing the root causes of radicalization.

Dramatic speaker vote: Trump pushes Johnson to victory but challenges loom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dramatic-speaker-vote-trump-pushes-johnson-to-victory-but-challenges-loom/articleshow/116943016.cms,"In a dramatic turn of events, President-elect Donald Trump played a pivotal role in securing the speaker’s post for Louisiana Republican Mike Johnson. With just two Republican lawmakers, Representatives Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Keith Self of Texas, standing in the way, Trump stepped in from the golf course Friday afternoon to personally convince them to support Johnson, CNN reported.The intervention proved crucial as Johnson ultimately secured the 218 votes needed to retain the speaker's position and lead a narrowly divided chamber into the new year. While the official record shows that Johnson achieved the required votes on the first attempt, the outcome was uncertain until the last moment, highlighting the political drama and the influence Trump continues to wield over the Republican Party.Two sources familiar with the conversation revealed that Trump urged the lawmakers to prioritize party unity, warning that voters would have little patience for the dysfunction that could arise if Republicans failed to rally behind a single speaker, CNN reported.This episode highlighted the significant challenges President-elect Donald Trump would face in governing over the next two years, despite Republicans controlling both the White House and Congress.With narrow majorities in the House and Senate, Trump will require near-unanimous support from his party or bipartisan cooperation to fulfill the sweeping changes he promised voters. Failing to secure this could impede his ability to deliver on his agenda.The situation will become even more precarious if the Senate confirms Reps. Mike Waltz of Florida and Elise Stefanik of New York to serve in the administration as national security adviser and United Nations ambassador, respectively, which would further reduce the Republican margin in the House.These difficulties are compounded by the struggles House Republicans have faced since regaining the majority in 2022, underscoring the challenges Trump will need to overcome to maintain party unity and achieve his policy goals.“Governing is messy sometimes,” Republican Representative Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma told CNN. “And I think we’ve proven that not only today, but over the last two years. But we’ll get there.”Trump has already encountered the constraints of his influence within his own party. Prior to the holiday break, he attempted but failed to convince House Republicans to increase the country's borrowing limit during a funding vote that nearly led to a government shutdown.Trump’s influence within his party has faced several setbacks. His allies were unable to sway the vote for the next Senate majority leader, a position that went to South Dakota Sen John Thune, a former critic of the incoming president.Additionally, Trump couldn’t convince Florida Gov Ron DeSantis to appoint his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, to the Senate seat currently held by Marco Rubio, whom Trump has selected as secretary of state. Trump also abandoned efforts to appoint former Rep Matt Gaetz as attorney general due to strong opposition from Senate Republicans.However, securing Mike Johnson’s victory marked an important early test of Trump’s ability to navigate a closely divided chamber, where individual lawmakers hold significant power.","President-elect Donald Trump played a pivotal role in securing the speaker’s post for Louisiana Republican Mike Johnson.

Cybertruck explosion in Vegas: Green beret Matthew Livelsberger left note calling it 'wake-up call for US',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cybertruck-explosion-in-vegas-green-beret-matthew-livelsberger-left-note-calling-it-wake-up-call-for-us/articleshow/116955823.cms,"Matthew Livelsberger who served in the US military since 2006, called his act a wake-up call for the US. According to the authorities, Livelsberger, a US Army Green Beret, suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

The final note: A call to arms?

Behind the explosion: A troubled soldier's last act

Symbolism or spectacle?

A nation divided

A fiery explosion outside Trump International Hotel on New Year’s Day, involving a Cybertruck and a decorated Green Beret, has left behind a note that paints a complex portrait of a man battling inner demons while issuing a dire warning to the nation.Matthew Livelsberger , 37, blew himself up in a rented Tesla Cybertruck outside the Las Vegas landmark, injuring seven bystanders and sparking immediate speculation over his motives. However, a handwritten note found on his iPhone sheds light on the incident, with Livelsberger emphatically stating: “This was not a terrorist attack. It was a wake-up call.”In his note, Livelsberger described the US as “terminally ill” and accused its leaders of enriching themselves at the nation’s expense. “Americans only pay attention to spectacles and violence,” he wrote. “What better way to get my point across than a stunt with fireworks and explosives?”Directly addressing fellow service members and veterans, Livelsberger pleaded: “TIME TO WAKE UP! We are being led by weak and feckless leadership.” Despite the explosive location—outside a Trump-branded hotel—and the high-profile Cybertruck used in the act, Livelsberger expressed no animosity toward Trump, whom family members say he supported.The FBI revealed Livelsberger was the sole fatality in the blast, which he orchestrated with chilling precision. Before igniting the vehicle, he inserted a handgun into his mouth and pulled the trigger, moments before the Cybertruck erupted. Law enforcement also dispelled conspiracy theories, confirming that the vehicle was not set to self-driving mode.Livelsberger’s family told investigators that he was a “patriotic American” and a Trump supporter. Yet, his note points to deeper personal struggles, including PTSD, guilt from combat, and recent heartbreak. Reports surfaced that his second wife had left him days before the explosion.An ex-girlfriend revealed he had suffered a traumatic brain injury during his service in Afghanistan, which led to memory loss, relationship challenges, and guilt over battlefield actions.The choice of a Cybertruck—a symbol of Elon Musk ’s tech revolution—and the Trump hotel fueled speculation of political undertones. Yet Livelsberger’s note muddies these waters, suggesting a broader frustration with American society and governance.“This wasn’t just a cry for help,” a senior FBI official told reporters. “It was a deliberate, symbolic act aimed at sending a message to a divided nation.”As investigations continue, Livelsberger’s actions have sparked debates on mental health among veterans, the state of American politics, and the desperate lengths to which some go to be heard.While the explosion outside the glitzy Trump International Hotel may fade from headlines, the question remains: Was Livelsberger’s dramatic act a wake-up call—or just another moment lost in the noise of America’s spectacle-driven culture?","Matthew Livelsberger, 37, blew himself up in a rented Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on New Year's Day.

Unverified claims and conspiracy theories

No connection to New Orleans attack

A soldier's burden

Matthew Livelsberger , a decorated Special Forces soldier, sought treatment for depression in the months leading up to a shocking suicide bombing involving a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas this week. The 37-year-old, who reportedly battled PTSD, guilt from combat, and family issues, had expressed a desire to seek further help, according to his ex-girlfriend, Army nurse Alicia Arritt.“He wanted to get more help,” said Arritt, 39, who dated Livelsberger from 2018 to 2021. “I think it was even harder for him, being on active duty — the shame and the stigma,” reported New York Post.Livelsberger left a haunting note in his charred cellphone, recovered after the explosion, which read: “I needed to cleanse my mind of the brothers I’ve lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took.” FBI officials noted on Friday that Livelsberger “likely” suffered from PTSD and had ongoing “family issues.”Despite attending three mental health counseling sessions between August and December, it remains unclear whether he was assessed as a risk for suicide or violence.Arritt revealed that Livelsberger, proud of his nearly two decades in the military, had suffered multiple concussions during combat and undergone back surgery due to injuries sustained from parachute jumps. Still, he struggled with sleeping, focusing, and maintaining relationships.Livelsberger left his Colorado home on December 26 after his wife, with whom he shared a baby daughter, left him over cheating allegations, according to sources. He then rented a Tesla Cybertruck through the Turo app and drove to Las Vegas. Hours before the explosion, video footage from the vehicle’s cameras captured him calmly clearing dirt off the bumper while wearing a T-shirt with the logo of fireworks manufacturer Black Cat.On January 1, Livelsberger packed the Cybertruck with explosives and fireworks before shooting himself in the head and triggering the blast. Several people in the hotel’s valet area sustained injuries from the explosion.Arritt, who treated veterans with brain injuries at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, described Livelsberger as a man burdened by his military service. She recalled asking him about his injuries when they first met, to which he replied, “Just some concussions.”Livelsberger had also emailed claims about national security threats before his death. In an email revealed on The Shawn Ryan Podcast, the soldier alleged that federal officials were working with China to develop drones, which he called “the most dangerous threat to national security.” Officials are still verifying the email’s legitimacy.Federal authorities ruled out any link between Livelsberger’s bombing and another New Year’s Day attack in New Orleans. In that incident, ISIS-affiliated ex-soldier Shamsud-Din Jabbar drove a truck into a Bourbon Street crowd, killing 14 people before being shot dead by police.Livelsberger’s tragic story highlights the challenges faced by veterans struggling with mental health issues and the lasting impact of combat trauma . His ex-girlfriend reflected, “He was so proud of his service, but I think it came with a lot of guilt. He carried a heavy burden, and he wanted to make it right.”The FBI continues to investigate the incident and Livelsberger’s final days.","Matthew Livelsberger, a decorated Special Forces soldier, sought treatment for depression in the months leading up to his suicide bombing.

Younger Americans ditch booze for mocktails,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/younger-americans-ditch-booze-for-mocktails/articleshow/116952418.cms,"NEW YORK: The US Surgeon General's warning of an increased risk of cancer from drinking alcohol may end up resonating most with younger Americans - who in recent years were already turning to mocktails and juices instead of alcoholic drinks, reports news agency Reuters.It is unclear whether Surgeon General Vivek Murthy's suggestion to update warning labels on the risks of alcohol will be acted upon by Congress, but, over the last decade, the youngest adults have been drinking less.Brooklyn resident Amy Hudson, 35, said she cut back on drinking alcohol from multiple times a week to less than three times a month after she started having chronic migraines in 2021. ""I found mocktails to be a good way to get antioxidants while incorporating anti-inflammatory foods into my diet,"" Hudson said. Ingredients like pineapple, cherry juice and ginger have helped manage her migraines, she said.In 2023, 49.6% of Americans between ages 18 and 25 had used alcohol in the last month, according to US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration national survey figures, down from 59.6% from 2013.Sean Goldsmith, chief executive officer of non-alcoholic beverage e-commerce platform The Zero Proof, said the surgeon general's announcement comes as ""more and more people are realising that drinking alcohol is not good for you."" He is in one of his busiest seasons of the year - ""Dry January,"" a month where some people choose to abstain from alcohol following the holiday season.About 90% of The Zero Proof's shoppers are alcohol drinkers looking for healthier beverages, Goldsmith said.

One student also requested a change in pronouns. Geraghty, however, refused, citing her religious beliefs and constitutional rights.Logan Spena, a legal counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom , the organisation representing Geraghty, said, “The school tried to force Vivian to accept and repeat the school’s viewpoint on issues that go to the foundation of morality and human identity, like what makes us male or female, by ordering her to personally participate in the social transition of her students.”The teacher’s stance led to her resignation, but the legal battle continued. In August, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio ruled that the district’s pronoun policy was “not neutral” and forcing Geraghty to use the students’ preferred names and pronouns amounted to “compelled speech.”“The First Amendment prohibits that abuse of power, and Jackson Local School District officials have learned that comes at a steep cost,” Spena added.Under the terms of the settlement, Geraghty will receive $450,000.

Authorities soon identified Jorgenson, her boyfriend, as a suspect. He had been seen on surveillance footage leaving Starren's apartment with duffle bags and a suitcase. After searching the apartment, investigators found traces of blood, which led them to Jorgenson’s storage unit in Woodbury, where Starren’s remains were found in coolers and a large bag.Jorgenson’s connection to Xayavong came to light when police learned of a previous relationship between the two. Xayavong had been missing since July 2021, and her remains were found in a separate storage locker in Coon Rapids. DNA found on a tote bag confirmed Jorgenson’s involvement.Jorgenson admitted to killing Xayavong during an argument at his Shoreview home. After killing her, he dismembered her body and placed the remains in the Coon Rapids storage unit.“These heinous acts of cruelty took the lives of two young women and forever altered the future of their friends and family,” said Ramsey County Attorney John Choi.As part of a plea deal, Jorgenson will serve two concurrent 40-year sentences, the maximum for second-degree murder.

PESHAWAR: Gunmen ambushed a Pakistan convoy travelling to bring aid to a region besieged by sectarian fighting on Saturday, local government said, wounding several officials despite a ceasefire announced three days ago.The Kurram region of northwest Pakistan has been wracked by Sunni-Shiite violence for decades, but around 200 people have been killed since a fresh bout of fighting broke out in November.As feuding tribes have battled with machine guns and heavy weapons, the remote and mountainous region bordering Afghanistan has been largely cut off from the outside world.After a truce was called on January 1, the convoy was attacked as it travelled to collect the first aid delivery of food and medicine sent by road since November, officials said.Kurram's deputy commissioner was wounded ""along with two other administration officials, two policemen and two Frontier Corps soldiers"", local government official Motasim Billah told AFP.He said the attack took place around 11.00 am (0600 GMT).The deputy commissioner ""came under an attack by unidentified miscreants"" but his ""condition is out of danger"" according to Muhammad Ali Saif, the spokesman of northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.""The convoy has been temporarily halted due to security concerns,"" he added in a statement.Numerous ceasefires have been touted by the provincial government since the latest fighting broke out, only to be broken with renewed clashes hours later.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement the attack was ""a conspiracy"" intended to undo the ceasefire agreed on New Year's Day following a council of tribal leaders from both sides.""Mischievous elements carried out the firing to harm the peace agreement,"" he said in a statement.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country but Shiites make up between 10 and 15 percent of the population.The communities live side-by-side in Kurram, but feuding is regularly re-sparked over land disputes before igniting along sectarian divides.This current round of violence started in November when two separate convoys of Shiite Muslims travelling under police escort were ambushed, with 40 people killed.",Kurram region of northwest Pakistan has been wracked by Sunni-Shiite violence for decades.

Gohar confirmed that all ongoing discussions are solely with the government, Dawn reported.According to Gohar, the PTI leadership initially pursued discussions with the military, acknowledging the army's significant role in decision-making in the country. These contacts were heading in a ""positive direction"" until the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan in a new case.Gohar detailed that Khan had been granted bail in the Toshakhana case, which involved the controversial purchase of a Bulgari jewellery set, but was soon rearrested on charges related to the September 2024 protest, leading to the collapse of talks with the military.""Now, the PTI is not holding backdoor talks with the establishment,"" Gohar said. However, he emphasised that the possibility of future talks with the military has not been completely closed, leaving room for potential negotiations later. This statement reflects PTI's focus on engaging in dialogue exclusively with the government at this juncture.The PTI chairman also responded to rumours about an alleged offer to move Imran Khan from Adiala Jail to his residence in Banigala. Gohar swiftly dismissed the claims, reiterating that Khan views his detention as illegal. ""There is no point in considering such an offer,"" Gohar stated, aligning with Khan's position on the matter. The PTI leader's refusal to entertain any conditional release further reinforces the party's stance on his unjust incarceration, reported Dawn.Furthermore, Gohar rejected the idea of a trilateral meeting between Imran Khan, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP's Asif Ali Zardari, which had been suggested by PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah to resolve the nation's ongoing political crises. He characterised the proposal as ""idealistic,"" citing the irreconcilable differences between the political figures involved.""I might see this day [talks between the three leaders] in my life, but for now, this isn't possible,"" Gohar remarked, indicating that such a dialogue is highly unlikely at the present time.Meanwhile, in Peshawar, PTI's Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram addressed the issue of the ongoing talks with the government. He assured that the expected judgment in the £190 million case on January 6 would not derail the negotiations.""The talks will continue, keeping in view the government's seriousness,"" Akram stated, emphasising that the party had not linked the verdict to the discussions. He also spoke about the release of PTI workers who had been sentenced by military courts, clarifying that their freedom had no connection to the ongoing talks with the government.""Our workers were released because they were innocent, and it was not possible to further keep them in jail,"" Akram asserted.The PTI has also been actively engaged in a civil disobedience movement , which began with an appeal to overseas Pakistanis not to send remittances. Akram suggested that the impact of this action would begin to show within two months. He said the PTI would evaluate the situation and consider withdrawing the movement if the government met their demands, such as releasing all imprisoned party members and forming a judicial commission to probe the May 9 and November 26 protests, Dawn reported.""The civil disobedience movement is necessary for a country where the Constitution, laws, and human rights are violated and lawmakers are abducted,"" Akram explained, underscoring the PTI's ongoing commitment to reform. He also criticised the internet disruptions, warning that they would negatively affect Pakistan's digital economy, particularly the youth who contribute significantly to the sector.","Gohar Ali Khan confirms that all ongoing discussions are solely with the government.

The deadly attack had sparked further violence and road closures in the district, restricting access to medicine, food and fuel in the area as casualties in fighting between Sunni and Shia tribes surged to 136. The conflict had forced the closing of the only road connecting Parachinar, Kurram’s headquarters, with the provincial capital of Peshawar.“Travel and security arrangements are being made for the convoy (of passengers) leaving on Saturday,” Pakistan govt spokesperson Muhammad Ali Saif said on Friday, warning that any armed aggression would be prosecuted as terrorism.The KP administration had recently formed a grand jirga, or council of political and tribal elders, which reached a peace deal between the warring Shia and Sunni tribes on Wednesday following weeks of negotiations. Under the peace agreement, both sides have agreed on the demolition of bunkers and the handover of heavy weapons to the authorities.“Both sides will give a coordinated plan of action within 15 days for the collection of weapons,” Saif said, adding that bunkers already existing in the area will be dismantled within a month.After the demolition of bunkers, according to the official, any party that launches an attack will be considered a “terrorist” and action will be taken against it.Another provision of the peace agreement states that anybody who violates the terms of the agreement by employing weapons against the other would face a Pakistani Rs 10 million ($35,933) fine. It stated that families displaced by the recent hostilities would be rehabilitated.Shia Muslims dominate parts of Kurram although they are a minority in the rest of Pakistan, which is majority Sunni.

The data highlights severe air quality issues in Pakistan, significantly threatening public health.Lahore, home to over 11 million people, continues to grapple with dire air pollution, largely attributed to vehicle emissions, industrial activities, and crop burning, The Express Tribune reported.The smog crisis has led to widespread respiratory ailments, with recent figures revealing over 1.8 million individuals have fallen ill in the past month due to smog-related issues. Of these, approximately 1,29,229 have required hospital treatment for respiratory conditions, while 61,00,153 have been diagnosed with cardiothoracic conditions, underscoring the grave health impacts.In Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city and bustling economic hub, the AQI of 164 reflects persistent pollution from heavy traffic, industrial zones, and port activities. Despite initiatives to curb pollution, the city remains in the “unhealthy” category, raising concerns for residents, especially those with pre-existing health conditions.Yasir Hussain, director of the Climate Action Centre (CAC), emphasised the role of vehicular emissions in exacerbating air pollution during a press conference at the Karachi Press Club. He noted that vehicle emissions are responsible for 60 per cent of Karachi’s pollution and 80 per cent of Lahore’s, with both cities experiencing severe environmental and health consequences.The air quality crisis has coincided with a measles outbreak in the region, further straining healthcare systems. Doctors have warned of the disease’s high contagion rate and urged parents to ensure timely vaccinations for children aged between nine months and 1.5 years to prevent fatalities.Lahore’s hazardous air pollution has prompted authorities to consider stricter measures, while experts have highlighted the need for regional cooperation to tackle the transboundary nature of air pollution.","Lahore has been ranked as the world’s most polluted city, with an AQI of 354 classified as “hazardous,” while Karachi is listed 13th with an “Unhealthy” AQI.

Rescue officials confirmed the injuries, which resulted from celebratory gunfire during the early hours of January 1, 2025, ARY News reported.The incidents took place in various areas of Karachi, including Liaquatabad, Tariq Road, Shah Faisal, Orangi Town, Gulshan-e-Iqbal, Azizabad, and Korangi. In Liaquatabad, three people were injured by stray bullets.Tariq Road and Shah Faisal reported incidents where two women sustained injuries due to celebratory firing.

A Parsi family that knows all about booze in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/a-parsi-family-that-knows-all-about-booze-in-pakistan/articleshow/116842907.cms,"In 1947, when the British transferred power to India and Pakistan, many businesses also changed hands. One of them was Murree Brewery , among the oldest distilleries in Asia, which was then largely owned by a British family. The Bhandaras of Lahore became its new owners. They were a Parsi family that had thrived in the liquor business.Isphanyar Bhandara now runs Pakistan's top brewery. He recently made a brief halt in New Delhi on his way to Nepal. ""It's my tenth visit to India,"" the businessman-politician said cheerfully, a Pakistan flag lapel pin on his coat the only green in his otherwise blue attire.Liquor business is heavily regulated in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. About 96% of the country's population is Muslim. The brewery, accordingly, points out on its website, ""Under the country's laws Pakistan Muslims are prohibited from consuming alcoholic drinks. Non-Muslims and foreigners require a consumption permit.""Nonetheless, the business has been rewarding for the Bhandaras. ""The forbidden fruit is always sweet,"" said Isphanyar. ""We make beers from Australian barley. Our vodkas and single malts are also doing very well. It's all about quality. We also make and export fruit juice and are heavily into (bottled) water,"" he added.Success though hasn't been limited to the arena of trade. Isphanyar is also a member of the Pakistan National Assembly . His father was a central minister under Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s and an MP during the Pervez Musharraf regime.But, as a community, the Parsis have wilted. In 1947, Isphanyar says, about 20,000-25,000 of them lived in Pakistan. Like in India, they played a major role in nation-building, especially in cities like Karachi. They were among the top businessmen and jurists and were engaged in philanthropic work. In the 19th century, Parsis were also among the early cricketers of Karachi. According to an article in scoreline.org, a team of Parsi cricketers toured England in 1886. In 1952, when Pakistan's cricket team toured India, southpaw batter Rusi Dinshaw was part of the squad, although he didn't get to play a Test.""Today, we are less than 1,000,"" says Isphanyar. ""Most of the Parsi population is in its 80s or 90s, a bit like the Japanese. There are very few young Parsis in Pakistan today,"" he said.Many left due to economic reasons, others due to law and order issues. One such migrant was the renowned writer Bapsi Sidhwa, whose novel, Ice Candy Man, was made into a feature film called 'Earth' by director Deepa Mehta. Sidhwa passed away in Houston on Dec 25 last year; she was Isphanyar's aunt.The 54-year-old businessman gets raw material and machinery from India. ""A lot of companies in Pakistan do. The problem is, it is via Dubai,"" he said. But there are other reasons why he wants more trade between the two neighbours.""We can disagree on Kashmir, put it on the back burner. We don't have to concede our position and India doesn't have to concede theirs. But we should keep the baggage of history aside and look at the common good of the common people. We should open the Wagah border,"" he said.More business will benefit the underprivileged, he believes. ""We need it for the common man - dal, roti, cheeni, stuff like that. It will lower the inflation in Pakistan. I've made my presentations to our Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saab. I'm keeping my fingers crossed,"" he said.Not many know that the brewery - it gets its name from the scenic resort town - was set up in 1860, just three years after the 1857 revolt, to mainly service British troops. Edward Dyer, father of Reginald Dyer, the perpetrator of the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre, was its first manager. By 1890, water shortage and other logistical issues had forced the distillery to shift to the Rawalpindi area, where it continues to be headquartered.There was a time when Murree Beer was sold in India. ""In fact, Pakistan railways had put up tracks inside the brewery that used to carry beer to places like Kabul, Amritsar and, of course, to Karachi port,"" he said. But the state of politics and, consequently, policies, changed in Pakistan in the late 1970s when, exceptions aside, alcohol was banned. But as reputed Dawn columnist Nadeem Paracha wrote in 2013, ""Despite the violence and the eventual prohibition on the (open) sale of alcohol and bars in Pakistan in April 1977, Pakistanis never did stop drinking.""About two decades back, a possible joint venture project proved abortive. ""In 2006, when Vijay Mallya (former chairman of United Spirits) visited Pakistan to watch a cricket match, the prospect of doing something together was broached with my father. But politics did not allow them to come together,"" he said.Political relations between the two countries have further dipped now. But Isphanyar is an optimist. He wants the situation to improve. And more Indo-Pak trade , he insists, is the way to begin.","In 1947, when the British transferred power to India and Pakistan, many businesses also changed hands.

However, during the first five months of FY25, textile exports reached USD 7.607 billion, reflecting a 10.51 per cent increase compared to the same period last year Express Tribune reported.In the first 11 months of 2024, textile exports totaled just USD 15.43 billion.

The primary cause was ongoing political instability, which has persisted for more than two years. Khokhar remarked, ""We have lost at least 40 per cent of our export orders because buyers, hesitant to trust Pakisttextile millers due to political challenges, are shifting their orders to Vietnam.""Others noted that Pakistan also missed the chance to secure orders that were diverted from Bangladesh due to its political turmoil.

However, our millers have been unable to meet the demand because of price differences.""According to the Express Tribune report a significant portion of the demand was once again redirected to Vietnam, as Pakistani millers lacked product diversification. Hanif highlighted, ""Vietnam is far more advanced in the textile and other sectors. They offer a wide range of products and are able to offer lower prices.""Pakistan was once the top choice for international buyers due to its competitive prices. However, the country has consistently struggled with product diversification. Over the past decade, the government, textile millers, analysts, and foreign buyers have all emphasized the need for diversification.While a few millers are making efforts, the industry as a whole remains far from developing the new products required by European Union and American buyers. The government's support in this area has also been lackluster. Some economists caution that ongoing political tensions, along with stringent measures from the finance ministry and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), could severely harm the sector, which remains the largest source of export revenue.""The local industry has not been growing for years, so how can we expect product diversification or an increase in export revenue?"" asked Ahmad Aziz Subhani, an economist based in the UAE.Recently, the FBR included the textile sector in the standard tax regime, requiring millers to pay a 2 per cent advance tax instead of the previous 1 per cent. Furthermore, they are now obligated to submit all their business information to the FBR.Subhani stated that following the tax increase, many Pakistani textile companies have been relocating to Dubai. ""So far, about 400 companies have set up offices in Dubai and registered with the Dubai Chamber of Commerce. This will likely lead to under-invoicing of export orders by several Pakistani millers, further reducing export revenue,"" he added.The report further stated that many textile industry leaders highlight that the sector is heading in the wrong direction.""We are struggling with high energy costs, which have led to a reduction in mills and a shift of orders to Vietnam. We are uncertain about how many billions of dollars we've lost because of this,"" said Ashraf Ali, a textile retailer based in Faisalabad. He further mentioned that a cotton crisis is looming, as nearly half of the spinning units have shut down due to a liquidity shortage and delays in the FBR's release of sales tax refunds.""We should expect a rise in yarn prices and a shortage of the product in 2025,"" Ali added. The industry is also awaiting the start of Trump's second term, as many factors depend on the policies the incoming US president will implement.Many millers argue that any restrictions, whether due to political instability or other factors, would have a detrimental impact on Pakistan's textile industry. They also pointed out that the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East could further escalate tensions and affect the global economy.In summary, textile exports for the current fiscal year are likely to decline or remain flat due to the various challenges the industry is facing. The sector has almost given up on reaching its USD 25 billion export target, as they believe that without a clear textile policy and the active involvement of key stakeholders in decision-making, achieving this goal would remain an unrealistic aspiration. (ANI)","Pakistan's textile industry, which was once poised to achieve higher export earnings, started to lose its momentum. The primary cause was ongoing political instability, which has persisted for more than two years. Pakistan was once the top choice for international buyers due to its competitive prices.

cross-border militancy

Diplomatic efforts amid rising hostilities

What lies ahead?

Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border, leaving at least eight individuals dead and 13 others, including civilians, injured on the Afghan side. The ongoing conflict, which persisted into late Saturday night, comes amidst the growing strain between the two nations, once considered allies.The violence followed an intense exchange of fire, reportedly triggered by Pakistan's targeted airstrikes on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan's eastern Paktika province earlier in the week. Pakistani security officials claim the strikes were a response to a failed infiltration attempt by militants from Afghanistan.According to Pakistani sources, militants attempting to breach the border on Friday night were repelled by Pakistani forces. The following morning, these militants allegedly joined Afghan forces to launch coordinated attacks on Pakistani border posts using light and heavy weapons. The attacks targeted several areas, including Ghozgarhi, Matha Sangar, Kot Ragha, and Tari Mengal.Pakistani forces retaliated, reportedly inflicting significant losses and forcing the attackers to abandon their posts. However, the violence also claimed the life of one Frontier Corps soldier and left 11 others injured.Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of harboring TTP militants who have intensified attacks on Pakistani security forces in recent months. These attacks, particularly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan regions, have heightened security concerns in Islamabad.While urging the Afghan government to take decisive action against the TTP, Pakistan said that dialogue between the two nations could not occur amidst ongoing violence.While these diplomatic calls were failing, tensions flared after Pakistan's airstrikes in the Barmal district of Paktika on December 24, which reportedly killed at least 46 individuals, including women and children. The Taliban's ministry of defense condemned the strikes, describing them as an attack on civilians and vowing retaliation.The airstrikes came on the same day a Pakistani delegation led by Special Representative Muhammad Sadiq met Afghan leaders in Kabul in an attempt to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long hiatus. However, the Afghan government lodged a formal protest over the airstrikes, accusing Pakistan of targeting civilians rather than militants.The escalating conflict comes against the backdrop of strained relations following the TTP's termination of a ceasefire with Pakistan in November 2022. Since then, attacks by the TTP have claimed the lives of numerous Pakistani soldiers, further deteriorating ties between the neighbors.The renewed border violence, marked by both airstrikes and ground clashes, shows a growing distrust between Kabul and Islamabad. While Pakistan continues to demand action against the TTP, the Afghan Taliban denies harboring militants and accuses Pakistan of targeting civilians under the guise of counterterrorism operations.","Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border.

GWADAR: The inauguration of the New Gwadar International Airport (NGIA) has been delayed for the third time due to ongoing security concerns in the region.Originally scheduled to begin operations on January 1, 2025, the airport, which is a key part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), will now remain closed indefinitely, the Balochistan Post reported.Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has also cancelled its first commercial flight, which was set to coincide with the opening, according to reports from The Balochistan Times.The NGIA, a major infrastructure project funded by China at a cost of USD 250 million, is designed to accommodate large aircraft such as the Airbus A380. The airport's original opening date of August 14, 2024, was planned to coincide with Pakistan's Independence Day celebrations but was postponed due to protests organised by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC).The second delay followed a series of deadly attacks by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which targeted key CPEC-related infrastructure, including highways, railway bridges, and mineral transport vehicles, as reported by The Balochistan Post.This latest delay highlights the growing security risks posed by Baloch separatist groups that oppose Chinese investments in the region.The BLA, a major armed group advocating for Baloch independence, has repeatedly targeted Chinese projects and nationals in Pakistan. Notable attacks include a 2018 suicide bombing on a bus carrying Chinese engineers, assaults on the Chinese Consulate in Karachi, and a 2023 attack in Gwadar that killed 13 people, including four Chinese nationals.The BLA has also warned foreign nationals to avoid Balochistan, calling it a ""war zone,"" according to The Balochistan Post.In response to these threats, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Balochistan government have decided to review security arrangements before proceeding with the airport's opening. The BLA's Majeed Brigade has vowed to continue its campaign against Chinese interests, further complicating Pakistan's efforts to maintain stability and attract foreign investment to the region.","The inauguration of the New Gwadar International Airport has been delayed for the third time.

Fazal, a resident of Hirabad area in Kech district, was detained on December 23, and his location remains unidentified, according to The Balochistan Post.His family has sought assistance from human rights organisations to determine his whereabouts, worried about his safety. The persistent issue of enforced disappearances in Balochistan continues to draw attention, with local activists and human rights organisations demanding accountability and the release of missing persons.Despite continuous calls for justice, these incidents highlight the ongoing accusations against Pakistani security forces in the region.The families of Balach and Fazal have requested authorities to investigate their cases and provide information about their missing relatives.Balochistan continues to witness systematic abductions and killings, affecting various segments of society including activists, politicians, journalists and civilians, who are reportedly taken by security forces, according to news agency ANI.The Pakistani military faces frequent accusations of using enforced disappearances as a tactic against insurgents and separatist groups.

Myanmar to release prisoners to mark Independence Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/myanmar-to-release-prisoners-to-mark-independence-day/articleshow/116932375.cms,"BANGKOK: Myanmar's military government will release more than 6,000 prisoners and has reduced other inmates' sentences as part of a mass amnesty on Saturday marking the 77th anniversary of independence from Britain.It wasn't immediately clear if those released would include any of the thousands of political detainees locked up for opposing army rule since the military seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. That takeover was met with massive nonviolent resistance, which has since become a widespread armed struggle.State-run MRTV television reported that Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the military government, granted amnesties covering 5,864 prisoners from Myanmar, as well as 180 foreigners who will be deported. Mass prisoner releases are common on holidays and other significant occasions in Myanmar.The foreigners to be released could include four Thai fishermen who were arrested by Myanmar's navy in late November after patrol boats opened fire on Thai fishing vessels in waters close to their maritime border in the Andaman Sea. Thailand's prime minister has said she expects the four to be released on Independence Day.The terms of release warn that if the freed detainees violate the law again, they will have to serve the remainder of their original sentences in addition to any new sentence.In a separate report, it said Min Aung Hlaing had commuted the life sentences of 144 prisoners to 15 years imprisonment. The report provided no details about them.The report also said that all other prisoners will have their sentences reduced by one sixth, except those convicted under the Explosive Substances Act, the Unlawful Associations Act, the Arms Act and the Counter-terrorism Law, all laws which are often used against opponent military rule.Myanmar did not release many details of the prisoners being freed, but many were held on charges related to protests, including Section 505(A) of Myanmar's penal code, which makes it a crime to spread comments that create public unrest or fear or spread false news.Prisoner releases began on Saturday but can take a few days to be completed. At Insein Prison in the country's biggest city of Yangon, which is notorious for decades for housing political detainees, relatives of prisoners gathered at the gates from early morning.There was no sign that the prisoner release would include Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been held virtually incommunicado by the military since its seizer of power.The 79-year-old Suu Kyi is serving a 27-year sentence after being convicted of a series of politically tinged prosecutions brought by the military.Her supporters and independent analysts say the cases against her are an attempt to discredit her and legitimize the military's seizure of power while keeping her from taking part in the military's promised election, for which no date has yet been set.According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a rights monitoring organization, 28,096 people have been arrested on political charges since the army takeover.Of those arrested, 21,499 people were still in detention as of Friday, the AAPP reported. At least 6,106 civilians have been killed by security forces in the same period, the group says. Its tally does not include all casualties from combat.Myanmar became a British colony in the late 19th century and regained its independence on Jan. 4, 1948.In the capital Naypyitaw, Myanmar's military government celebrated the anniversary with a flag-raising ceremony at City Hall.","Myanmar's military government will release more than 6,000 prisoners and has reduced other inmates' sentences as part of a mass amnesty.

Marco Rubio condemns Hamas









US Central Command accused Hamas operatives of looting an aid truck, which was traveling as part of a humanitarian convoy delivering needed assistance from international partners, in the southern Gaza Strip on Saturday.CENTCOM shared a drone video showing the attack on the truck and said that the Operatives attacked the driver and stole the aid and truck after moving the driver to the road’s median.In a statement, CENTCOM said the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) — which is based in Kiryat Gat — “observed suspected Hamas operatives looting an aid truck traveling as part of a humanitarian convoy delivering needed assistance from international partners to Gazans in northern Khan Younis.”The CMCC was alerted to the incident through video surveillance from an American MQ-9 drone flying over Gaza as part of monitoring of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. “Operatives attacked the driver and stole the aid and truck after moving the driver to the road’s median. The driver’s current status is unknown,” CENTCOM said.The CENTCOM said that over the past week, international partners have delivered more than 600 trucks of commercial goods and aid into Gaza daily.This incident undermines these efforts. Nearly 40 nations and international organizations represented at the CMCC are working together to help flow humanitarian, logistical and security assistance into Gaza.Secretary of State Marco Rubio sharply condemned Hamas on Saturday after a US military drone video surfaced showing suspected operatives of the terror group looting a truck carrying humanitarian aid bound for civilians in Gaza.“Hamas continues to deprive the people of Gaza of the humanitarian aid they desperately need,” Rubio wrote on X. “This theft undermines international efforts in support of President Trump’s 20 Point Plan to deliver critical assistance to innocent civilians.”Rubio said Hamas remains “the impediment,” accusing the terror group of blocking relief intended for civilians. “They must lay down their arms and stop their looting so that Gaza can have a brighter future,” he added.The CMCC opened on Oct. 17 in southern Israel as a central hub for Gaza aid just days after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas went into effect.The centre serves as the main hub for Gaza stabilisation efforts and includes an operations floor designed to track real-time developments inside Gaza.Data published in August by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) showed that most of its aid entering the war-torn Gaza Strip had been looted inside the Palestinian territory.","US Central Command accused Hamas operatives of looting an aid truck, which was traveling as part of a humanitarian convoy delivering needed assistance from international partners. “Operatives attacked the driver and stole the aid and truck after moving the driver to the road’s median,” CENTCOM said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125028457,imgsize-4552968,width-400,resizemode-4/us-military-shares-drone-footage-showing-hamas-operatives-looting-aid-from-gaza-convoy-image-credit-x.jpg"

Panic and chaos gripped passengers on a London-bound train on Saturday evening after a mass stabbing left ten people hospitalised, nine with life-threatening injuries. Witnesses described scenes of terror as a man armed with a large knife moved through the carriages, sending passengers fleeing for their lives.One passenger told Sky News he saw a man “extremely bloodied” stumble through the carriage shouting, “They’ve got a knife, I’ve been stabbed.” He said, “That person ended up collapsing on the floor. They were taken to an ambulance pretty much straight away.” Others recalled people sprinting through the train to escape as the attacker moved through carriages.Wren Chambers, who was also on board, told the BBC they ran to the front of the train after seeing a man bolt past with a bloody arm, shouting “they’ve got a knife, run.” “We were pretty scared once we knew what was happening,” Chambers said. “We were able to get off the train unharmed.”When the train came to an emergency stop in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, armed officers stormed the station. A witness described seeing police “directing their weapons at a man on the platform with a large blade.” The suspect was eventually “tasered and restrained,” said another passenger, Gavin.“He then was waving a knife, quite a large knife, and then they detained him. I think it was a Taser that got him down in the end,” he told Sky News.Passengers described “blood everywhere” and people hiding in toilets as the attack unfolded. One told The Times that others were getting “stamped on” in the rush to escape. Another described the horror as “like something from a film — really violent.”British Transport Police confirmed ten people were taken to hospital, nine with “life-threatening injuries.” Counter-terrorism officers are assisting with the investigation, though the motive remains unclear. The national “Plato” emergency response protocol used for potential terror attacks was activated.Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the incident “appalling” and “deeply concerning,” praising emergency services for their swift action. “My thoughts are with all those affected,” he said.Police arrested two suspects at the scene and continue to examine the train, which remains cordoned off as a major crime scene. The East of England Ambulance Service said it deployed a “large-scale response,” including air ambulances and tactical teams.Cambridgeshire mayor Paul Bristow said he was aware of “horrendous scenes,” adding that his “thoughts and prayers” were with those injured.","A mass stabbing on a London-bound train left ten people hospitalised, nine with life-threatening injuries.

"Inside Epstein’s money trail: Unsealed files expose Wall Street, Russian bank connections",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/inside-epsteins-money-trail-unsealed-files-expose-wall-street-russian-bank-connections/articleshow/125027862.cms,"Prince Andrew’s Royal Life ENDS: King Charles Forces Brother Out After Epstein Scandal





In the Jeffrey Epstein case, another document was released that reveals his financial transactions with Wall Street figures, including two accounts that were linked to Russian banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank.Judge Jed Rakoff ordered the records unsealed as part of a lawsuit between the US Virgin Islands and JPMorgan Chase, following requests by The New York Times and Wall Street Journal.In 2023, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $290 million to settle a class action lawsuit from survivors of Epstein and an additional $75 million to settle with the USVI, where Epstein owned an island. There was no admission of wrongdoing in these settlements, CNN reported.JPMorgan Chase filed a suspicious activity report with the US Treasury Department on September 26-2019 flagging more than $1 billion in transactions linked to Jeffrey Epstein from October 2003 until July 2019, according to newly unsealed court records.The bank wrote in the SAR it was flagging the transactions because of negative media about Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking of minors, media reports of allegations Epstein misappropriating money as an investment adviser, his use of multiple accounts, the Russian banks, and his relationships with two US presidents.Epstein was arrested in July 2019 and charged with sex trafficking underaged girls. He died weeks later by suicide in the Metropolitan Correctional Center while awaiting trial. Judge Jed Rakoff ordered the records unsealed as part of a lawsuit between the US Virgin Islands and JPMorgan Chase, following requests by The New York Times and Wall Street Journal.There was no admission of wrongdoing in these settlements. The documents are the latest in a slow release of materials tied to Epstein as public demand for accountability and transparency about Epstein has gone global.The Justice Department remained under pressure to release more information about its investigation into Epstein, and House lawmakers were taking depositions for their investigation.Included in the hundreds of pages of unsealed documents are emails between Epstein and Jes Staley, a former top official at JPMorgan Chase, who in 2021 resigned as head of Barclays bank following media scrutiny over his long relationship with Epstein.This year, Staley said he didn’t know about Epstein’s involvement with underaged girls but admitted in court that he had sex with one of Epstein’s assistants.Among the pages are emails between Epstein and Staley, with Epstein suggesting he could set up meetings for Staley to recruit new clients including the co-founders of Google and heads of nations.None of the individuals were accused of any wrongdoing. Prior to Epstein’s death in 2019, JPMorgan filed a number of SARs involving the disgraced financier’s accounts, and the documents show banking officials shared news articles about Epstein’s alleged activities.JPMorgan closed its accounts with Epstein in 2013, five years after Epstein pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges and reached a non-prosecution agreement with the US attorney’s office in the Southern District of Florida. The newly unsealed records include the SARs, including one dating as far back as 2002, as well as the last one filed in September 2019.“Generally, the only new material here is the SARs themselves. Those basically summarise financial information produced in litigation, much of which has been public for years. The SARs do confirm what’s been inferred all along: the bank filed SARs about Epstein early on, and specifically when it exited Epstein from the bank in 2013 – and repeatedly between 2013 and 2019, as required,” said Patricia Wexler, a spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase.“It does not appear that anyone in the government or law enforcement acted on those SARs for years.” In the batch of documents, there’s a letter from the US attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida which in 2007 sought records from Bear Stearns, one of Epstein’s banks that was later acquired by JPMorgan, as part of its then investigation into Epstein that resulted in the non-prosecution agreement.One of the biggest Wall Street names mentioned on the list of transactions on the 2019 SAR is Leon Black, a long-time associate of Epstein, who has maintained that Epstein gave him financial advice.“After an exhaustive investigation more than four years ago, the Dechert law firm concluded that Mr. Black paid Epstein only for tax and estate planning advice that saved him and his family billions of dollars. To imply that Epstein somehow had influence over Black is false and patently absurd,” Susan Estrich, an attorney for Black, said in a statement. “Indeed, it was Mr. Black who fired Epstein because he was disruptive and believed the fees for his services were excessive. The Dechert Report also found that Mr. Black had no knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activities.”The unsealed records include emails between Staley and Epstein about meeting in 2010 with then Prince Andrew. The then-Prince emailed Staley, “Wishing you a very happy Christmas and New Year.” Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, has asked JPMorgan for banking records and suggested officials turned a blind eye to Epstein’s conduct to make millions of dollars in fees from his accounts.In a recent response, the bank denied knowledge of Epstein’s activities, writing, “with the exception of former JPMC executive Jes Staley, the bank’s executives (current and former) are respected professionals who acted with integrity and would never have allowed Epstein to remain a client if they knew of his ongoing crimes.” “The Firm deeply regrets having had Epstein as a client and would never have continued doing business with him if it believed he engaged in ongoing criminal conduct,” the bank also said.",JPMorgan Chase filed a suspicious activity report with the US Treasury Department on September 26-2019 flagging more than $1 billion in transactions linked to Jeffrey Epstein. The bank wrote in the SAR it was flagging the transactions because of negative media about Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking of minors.

Pakistan and Afghanistan finally agreed on Thursday to uphold a ceasefire during peace talks in Istanbul, according to Turkey, after the earlier discussions between the two sides had collapsed.The two countries had faced their most serious military confrontations since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul, with deadly clashes this month triggering Pakistani airstrikes, Afghan retaliatory fire and the closure of key crossings used for trade and transit, Reuters reported.""Afghanistan, Pakistan, Türkiye and Qatar held meetings in Istanbul from 25-30 October 2025 aimed at solidifying the ceasefire which was agreed by Afghanistan and Pakistan in Doha on 18-19 October 2025 with the mediation of Türkiye and Qatar.

What does the new e-passport rollout actually mean?

New e-passport = chip inside: The upgraded passport contains an electronic chip with digitised passport data to speed up immigration clearance and improve security. Applicants will be able to upload a digital, ICAO-compliant photo, signature and supporting documents through the new portal.

No extra biometrics or fees: The Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate in Dubai stated explicitly that biometric collection rules and passport fees remain unchanged for applicants in the UAE. If you’ve given biometrics for a recent passport, you will not be asked again just because of the e-passport introduction.

Who issues them: The Embassy and Consulate will process applications through the Passport Seva Portal (GPSP 2.0) with support from BLS International for on-the-ground services. Missions say they can handle large volumes around 1,600 passports a day across the UAE to speed renewals and new issues.

No change in services for Indians in UAE

Conclusion





Indian expats in the UAE can finally put the rumours to rest. During a press conference held on October 30, 2025 by the Embassy of India in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate General of India in Dubai, officials clarified that the rollout of India’s new chip-enabled e-passport will not involve any extra biometrics, new procedures, or fee changes for applicants in the UAE. The announcement came amid widespread speculation about additional requirements for the upgraded passport system.The e-passport looks like a regular passport but comes with a secure embedded chip containing the holder’s personal and biometric data. This upgrade enhances security and helps speed up global immigration checks, making travel simpler and safer.Key features of the e-passport include:The initiative is an important part of India’s ongoing mission to modernise travel documents, strengthen cyber-security measures, and align with global digital passport standards.For Indian residents in the UAE, the e-passport rollout will feel no different from the current process. Applicants will continue to use the same channels — including BLS centres, VFS services (where applicable), and the embassy or consulate counters, without the need for new appointments, extra document checks, or revised fees. The missions also urged the community to rely only on official updates from the Embassy or Consulate, reminding expats not to fall for misinformation circulating on social media.The clarification from the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate in Dubai has offered much-needed reassurance to the UAE’s Indian community. With no added fees, no extra biometrics, and no change in the application process, the transition to e-passports is set to be smooth and stress-free for expats.

The White House turned into a haunted mansion with a presidential twist on Thursday night, as President Donald and Melania Trump hosted a Halloween spectacle straight out of a comic book.Superheroes, dinosaurs, and even pint-sized Trumps and Melanias stormed the South Lawn — while the First Couple, skipping costumes, made a dramatic entrance to the spooky strains of Thriller, AP image.They handed out chocolate to hundreds of costumed children, just hours after the president returned from a five-day swing through Asia.The Trumps took a particular liking to three siblings dressed as a Secret Service agent, the President and the First Lady.Trump gave his doppelganger a high-five before asking the trio to turn around and pose for photographs. The President pointed to the young girl and appeared to mouth, “Melania,” to reporters.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller were among the administration officials partaking in the festivities.Leavitt and her husband, Nicholas Riccio, brought their 1-year-old son in an adorable jack o’lantern outfit.Miller, wearing a suit and tie, was spotted trying to wrangle his young son, who appeared to be in a ghost costume, while his wife, Katie, held their other child, both dressed as skeletons.One of the most unusual costumes belonged to a boy who came dressed as a filthy toilet, with a “wide load” sign on the back. Trump seemed amused by the party pooper and gave him a chocolate bar. One of the most clever ensembles may have been a family who outfitted their wagon to look like a McDonald’s drive-thru.The Halloween event is an annual White House tradition. Last year, former President Joe Biden awkwardly pretended to bite several infants in the rope line, including one dressed up as a chicken.Perhaps the most memorable Trump Halloween moment took place in 2019, when he placed a candy bar on the head of a kid in a Minion costume during his first term. Trump did it again this year, with a youngster in an unidentified costume with particularly flat headgear.","The White House turned into a haunted mansion with a presidential twist on Thursday night.

Thanksgiving travel at risk

What Happens if the Shutdown Continues?

Military:

Federal civilian workers:

Air traffic controllers:





Nearly a month into the shutdown, food banks across the country were straining to meet rising demand from hundreds of thousands of federal workers who were furloughed or working without pay and were bracing for an even bigger surge as benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program were set to lapse on Nov. 1.More than one in eight Americans depended on food stamps from SNAP, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Recipients received an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card to buy groceries, and many families relied on those benefits as their main source of money for food, CBS news reported.The Community Table Food Bank in Arvada, Colorado, was so inundated with people on Thursday that it had to temporarily close. Before it did, Danielle Brann, a SNAP recipient, obtained essentials including ham and crackers and cans of spaghetti sauce.“The line started at 9 o’clock this morning and I don’t remember ever seeing it this busy. I mean they’re turning people away. So it’s more of a demand for sure,” Brann said.In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, the Loaves and Fishes Food Pantry also had to turn people away on Tuesday because food was leaving the shelves faster than it could be restocked.Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that Americans could face a travel “disaster” as Thanksgiving approaches next month without an end in sight to the govt shutdown.Their comments came after Vance hosted a roundtable of aviation, travel and union leaders at the White House, during which they aired their concerns with the current state of the industry and worked out potential, temporary solutions to ease the strain on Federal Aviation Administration employees who were being forced to work without pay to ensure Americans could fly safely, two White House officials told CNN.“Look it could be a disaster. It really could be, because at that point you’re talking about people have missed three paychecks. They’ve missed four paychecks. How many of them are not going to show up for work?” Vance said.“That’s going to lead to massive delays. We want people to be able to get home for Thanksgiving. We want people to be able to travel for business,” he continued.Air traffic control staffing problems spiked over the weekend, raising concerns about growing disruption Duffy added, “Our traffic will be snarled, but it will be a disaster in aviation.”More than a million active-duty service members in the United States would have missed their pay cheques on Friday if the Trump administration will not intervene, BBC reported.About a quarter of military families were considered food insecure, and 15% relied on Snap or food pantries, according to research firm Rand. Meanwhile, the Military Family Advisory Network estimated that 27% of families had £380 or less in emergency savings.The Pentagon said it had accepted a $130m gift from a wealthy donor to help pay salaries during the shutdown, which worked out to $100 for each of the 1.3 million service members expecting to be paid.The White House planned to pay the troops on 31 October by using money from a military housing fund, a research-and-development account and a defence procurement fund, according to Axios.Earlier this month the administration made payroll by moving $6.5bn from military research. More than 160 families told the National Military Family Association that they had been underpaid during the shutdown, some by hundreds of dollars and others by thousands.If the shutdown continues, then some 4.5 million paycheques would have been withheld from civilian employees, representing about $21bn in missing wages, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.Furloughed employees were typically paid after shutdowns ended, although Trump had threatened to withhold pay and was attempting to fire thousands of workers, a move being challenged in court.Thousands of air traffic controllers missed their first paycheques this week. And if it continues, then the flight delay will also continue.Because they are considered essential workers, the workers must continue to do their jobs without pay during the shutdown. Since 1 October, numerous controllers have called in sick and now many report they are getting second jobs.","More than one in eight Americans depended on food stamps from SNAP, according to the US Department of Agriculture.

November 2025 fuel prices

What’s Driving the November price Buzz?

Oil prices dropped to around $65 a barrel, raising hopes for a price cut.

Then global supply tensions and sanctions sent prices jumping again up by nearly 5% in one day.

What will become cheaper if prices drop in November?

Daily Commutes Get Cheaper: If you drive to work five days a week, your monthly fuel spend could drop by AED 15–40, depending on distance and car type. It may not feel like a jackpot but over a year, that’s a few brunches saved.

School Runs for Parents: Parents doing multiple school pick-ups and drop-offs will feel this the most. With fewer refills, you save not just dirhams… but also those “Why are we stopping for petrol again?” kid complaints.

Delivery & Ride-Hailing Services: Talabat, Deliveroo, Careem, Uber, RTA taxis, chauffeur services, all rely heavily on petrol costs. If fuel drops, operating costs drop and sometimes customers enjoy lower delivery fees or promo rides.

Business Transport & Logistics: Couriers, small business vans, carpenters, maintenance and AC technicians, all feel the heat when fuel rises. Cheaper petrol can mean:

Lower service charges Fewer fuel surcharges Better deals for customers

Weekends and Road Trips Become More Tempting: Lower fuel prices = guilt-free drives to Abu Dhabi, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah or Hatta. A small drop in fuel cost could shave off AED 5–15 per road trip enough to justify that karak stop.

Explained: Why Saudi Arabia rejected Lionel Messi’s offer to join the Pro League,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/explained-why-saudi-arabia-rejected-lionel-messis-offer-to-join-the-pro-league/articleshow/124983032.cms,"Inter Miami forward Lionel Messi. (AP Photo)

Why Saudi rejected Messi's offer





Socrates

“Messi’s team contacted me and expressed his desire to play in Saudi Arabia during the MLS break to stay active and prepare for the 2026 World Cup,” Hammad said. “I presented the offer to the minister of sports, but he rejected it, confirming that the Saudi league would not serve as a preparation platform for other tournaments.”

Beyond the desert dream





enduring competitiveness

temporary stage

“Messi set certain conditions and wanted to reunite with former Barcelona teammates,”

“while Ronaldo embraced the challenge of adapting to a new culture when he joined Al Nassr in 2022.”

Foot Mercato

“We brought the greatest player in history to our city, and now he’s chosen to stay, this strengthens our dream of building a lasting football legacy,”

A league with growing confidence

Ronaldo’s enduring bond with Saudi Arabia

“My family always supports my decisions, and we're happy here in Saudi Arabia. The people treat us in an incredibly warm way. That's why we want to live here and build our lives here.”

“I will stay two more years as a football player, but also for life because my contribution to this country is not only for football... I want to be part of the country's growth forever.”

“We don't need to prove anything to anyone. I'm here on the Red Sea because I love it. My family and I feel at peace here... I love the culture. I'd just say: come and see it for yourself.”

The message behind the rejection









For a league once defined by its hunger for global validation, the Saudi Pro League seems to have entered a new phase, one of self-assurance. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has spent vast sums luring superstars such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, and Karim Benzema, positioning itself as football’s bold new frontier.So when Lionel Messi ’s team came knocking, proposing a short-term deal for the Argentine icon to play in Saudi Arabia during the Major League Soccer (MLS) off-season, one might have expected the Kingdom to seize the chance with open arms.Instead, the offer was politely but firmly declined.The revelation came from Abdullah Hammad, CEO of the Mahd Sports Academy, who shared the details during thepodcast hosted by Thmanyah. He said Messi’s representatives had approached him during the Club World Cup, suggesting a temporary four-month stint while the MLS paused.The decision marked a subtle but significant statement, a league once reliant on marquee names to attract attention now choosing principle over spectacle.Hammad compared the offer to David Beckham’s brief loan spell at AC Milan during his MLS years but noted that Saudi Arabia’s vision differs. The Roshn Saudi League, he said, is building, not acting as afor global stars between seasons.The episode also revealed contrasting philosophies between Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.Hammad observed,Messi, who left Paris Saint-Germain in 2023, joined Inter Miami instead, where he recently extended his contract until 2028. According to, the deal is worth around €11 million annually, with bonuses pushing it close to €17 million, alongside major partnerships with Apple and Adidas, and a share of MLS streaming revenues.said Inter Miami co-owner David Beckham.The rejection of Messi’s offer underscores how far Saudi football has come. Once seen as a lavish detour for ageing stars, the Pro League is now asserting itself as a serious sporting ecosystem with its own ambitions, not merely a rest stop for players between continents.The country’s vast investment in football, coupled with plans to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup , reflects a long-term commitment to the sport’s growth. As Hammad put it, “The Saudi league would not serve as a preparation platform for other tournaments,” a line that captured both the maturity and the intent of a nation charting its own course.If Messi’s chapter in Saudi football never began, Ronaldo’s story continues to deepen. Earlier this year, after extending his Al Nassr contract until 2027, he declared Saudi Arabia his permanent home.In an interview shared via Al Nassr’s YouTube channel following the contract extension, Ronaldo said:He described the Kingdom as “a land of peace and safety,” adding:Saudi Arabia’s decision to turn down Messi wasn’t just about sport, it was about symbolism. The Kingdom’s football leadership appears determined to shift from buying fame to building legacy.If Messi’s approach had carried a sense of ambition and permanence rather than a brief off-season stint, the outcome might have been different. But as it stood, the offer didn’t align with the Pro League’s current direction, one that now prioritizes consolidation over spectacle.","Lionel Messi was offered a short-term deal to play in Saudi Arabia during the Major League Soccer (MLS) off-season.

We’ve offsetting steps now, says US treasury secy on rare-earth curbs









Gyeongju (South Korea): China's decision to impose export controls on rare earths was a ""mistake"" and drew attention to Beijing's ability to use them as a coercive tool, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview published Saturday.Beijing announced new controls in Oct on export of technologies related to rare earths. ""China has alerted everyone to the danger. It's one thing to put the gun on the table. It's another to fire shots in the air,"" Bessent told Financial Times.The restrictions were a major sticking point in trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington, and China said it would halt them after presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump met this week on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in the South Korea this week. Rare earths are crucial for defence, automobile, consumer electronics and other industries.The controls had rattled markets and snarled supply chains in the strategic sector, a key source of international leverage for Beijing.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said China would not be able to pull the same move again, saying: “We have offsetting measures. I think the Chinese leadership were slightly alarmed by the global backlash to their export controls.”Bessent, who is in South Korea for the APEC summit, discussed supply chains and semiconductors with him, Taiwan’s representative to the meet said. Lin Hsin-i, a former economy minister, said they had a 40minute meeting and talked about tech cooperation.","Beijing announced new controls in Oct on export of technologies related to rare earths.

Is Barack Obama supporting Zohran Mamdani in NYC Mayoral Race? Inside their 30-minutes call,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-barack-obama-supporting-zohran-mamdani-in-nyc-mayoral-race-inside-their-30-minutes-call/articleshow/125027638.cms,"Zohran Mamdani Hits Back At Islamophobia, Says 'No More Silence' In NYC Mayoral Race





Former US President Barack Obama seems to be supporting assembly member Zohran Mamdani for the New York mayoral election.According to the New York Times, Obama called Mamdani on Saturday, praising his mayoral campaign and offering to serve as a “sounding board” for the candidate. The two spoke for about 30 minutes in what is believed to be their second phone conversation since June.Mamdani has shaken up the New York City mayoral race by winning the Democratic nomination over former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is now running as an independent. He led in polls against both Cuomo and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.Obama has not formally endorsed a mayoral candidate but publicly supported California Democrats’ Proposition 50 on redistricting.He is campaigning in Virginia and New Jersey for Democratic gubernatorial candidates Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill respectively.According to two people familiar with the matter, Obama told Mamdani he was invested in his success and discussed early challenges of staffing a new administration and delivering on pledges such as an affordability agenda.“Your campaign has been impressive to watch,” Obama said, noting Mamdani’s effective social media and voter outreach strategies.He also offered to be a sounding board and spoke of meeting in person at a later date. Mamdani reportedly thanked Obama for the call.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters this week, “We’re continuing to talk,” when asked if he would vote for Mamdani, Newsweek reported.In an October 28 memo the National Republican Congressional Committee said, “[House Minority Leader] Hakeem Jeffries’ endorsement of Zohran Mamdani confirms what NRCC polling and research already showed: the Democratic Party has been hijacked by the radical left. Mamdani is a socialist hostile to America, supports an agenda ripped directly from the pages of the Communist Manifesto, is openly anti-police, and is funded by groups with ties to terrorist organizations like Hamas. His platform, defunding police, raising taxes, and embracing socialism, is out of step with what the American people want and need.”Patrick Gaspard, an adviser to Mamdani and former political director on Obama’s 2008 campaign, told the Times, “The fact that he [Obama] placed that phone call to us [Mamdani]—and then the news of that call making its way into the world—was a very important signaler to many in the political establishment, the business establishment, to average voters that helped credential Zohran Mamdani.”New York Attorney General Letitia James said in an X post on Saturday, “It was great to join @ZohranKMamdani in Brooklyn today for service at Hanson Place SDA Church. This is the last weekend to vote early before Election Day, New York! Get out and vote and let’s make @ZohranKMamdani the next Mayor of New York City!”Meanwhile, independent candidate Andrew Cuomo wrote on November 1, “The gap is closing fast -- we can feel it on the ground everywhere from the Bronx to Staten Island. At this rate, we win the race. Keep going strong.” Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa posted on October 31, “Two names, one mask: Mamdani = Cuomo. New Yorkers know this. Vote Curtis Sliwa and end the horror show.”","Zohran Mamdani has shaken up the New York City mayoral race by winning the Democratic nomination over former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.

US President Donald Trump threatened US military intervention in Nigeria and will halt the aid if the Nigerian government “continues to allow the killing of Christians.”In a post on Truth Social, Trump instructed the Department of War to prepare for possible action in Nigeria“If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, “guns-a-blazing,” to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,” the president said.“I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action.”He added, “WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!” On Friday, Trump designated Nigeria as a “country of particular concern,” a legal status from the US State Department for countries “responsible for particularly severe violations of religious freedom,” saying that “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria.”On Friday, Trump threatened possible sanctions against the West African nation, declaring it a “country of particular concern” in terms of religious freedom — a classification Nigeria’s president pushed back on.Nigeria’s population of 220 million, the largest in Africa, is largely split between Christians and Muslims, with insurgent groups like Boko Haram seeking to impose a version of Islamic rule that has led to persecution of both faiths.In response to the president’s claims, Nigeria’s president, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, posted that to label his country as religiously intolerant “does not reflect our national reality. Religious freedom has been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so.”Trump’s threats on Truth Social follow Senator Ted Cruz’s accusations earlier this month that Nigeria was enabling a “massacre” of Christians and citing rising attacks against the group.The bipartisan United States Commission on International Religious Freedom has also urged the US govt to designate Nigeria a country of particular concern in its 2025 annual report, noting persecution of both Christians and Muslims.The Texas senator introduced legislation to sanction Nigerian officials who are “ignoring and even facilitating the mass murder of Christians by Islamist jihadists.”In August, the US began deploying a naval and military presence in the southern Caribbean, off the coast of Venezuela, conducting lethal strikes against small vessels in international waters, alleging narcotics-smuggling activity.The Department of Defense and the Nigerian Embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Associated Press has reported that attacks in Nigeria have varied motives, from religiously motivated assaults targeting both Christians and Muslims to regional and communal clashes.While Christians are among those targeted, analysts told the AP that most victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria’s predominantly Muslim north.","US President Donald Trump threatened US military intervention in Nigeria.

'She Has No Plans To Convert': JD Vance Clarifies Amid Row Over Remark On Wife's Faith





British Muslim journalist Mehdi Hasan weighed in on Vice President JD Vance’s comments about his Indian-origin wife Usha’s Hindu faith, saying conservative Hindus who sided with Donald Trump ’s MAGA movement are now realising that Christian nationalists are not their friends.In a recent interview, Vance said he hopes his wife, Usha — who grew up in a Hindu household — is “one day moved by the same thing that moved me in church.” His comments drew criticism for being dismissive of her religion and for echoing Christian nationalist rhetoric.The Hindu American Foundation (HAF) responded to Vance, urging him to reciprocate and engage with Hinduism if Usha is expected to follow Christian ideals.In a post on X, the organisation said Hinduism “doesn’t share the need to wish your spouse comes around to see things as you do in terms of religion,” describing it as “inherently inclusive and pluralistic.”HAF also pointed out the “outpouring of anti-Hindu sentiment online,” much of it from “explicitly Christian sources.”As uproar mounted, Vance hit back, calling the backlash “disgusting” and accusing detractors of “anti-Christian bigotry.”He defended himself, saying, “My wife encouraged me to re-engage with my faith… She is not a Christian and has no plans to convert, but like many interfaith couples, I hope she may one day see things as I do.”Vance was responding to a post that read: “It’s weird to throw your wife’s religion under the bus, in public, for a moment’s acceptance by groypers.”Hasan then joined the debate, replying to the Hindu Foundation and arguing that Vance’s remarks were a wake-up call for conservative non-Christian minorities.In a post on X, Hasan wrote: “Conservative Jews and conservative Hindus who threw in with Trump and the GOP are now belatedly realising what some of us tried to warn them: that the Christian nationalists of the MAGA GOP are not their friends.”",British Muslim journalist Mehdi Hasan weighed in on Vice President JD Vance's comments about his Indian-origin wife Usha’s Hindu faith.

'Not At Gun Point': JD Vance Blasts Democrats Amid Shutdown Impasse; 'Cruel Presidency' | Watch

Here’s how the story unfolded:

Stein began selling hot dogs outside his apartment complex, near a construction zone frequented by workers.

Photos of him wearing a grey business suit while serving customers spread quickly across Instagram, where the hashtag #HotDogLawyer began trending.

Many users described him as a symbol of dignity and adaptability in the face of political and economic uncertainty.

Within days, Stein’s stand had long queues, with customers stopping by for both food and selfies.

Stein reportedly said he was “just making the best of a bad situation” and that “serving food beats sitting at home waiting for Congress.”

Social media reacts: ‘Mr IRS agent running a cash business’





When government paychecks stopped, one US tax lawyer picked up a pair of tongs. As the federal government shutdown stretches close to a month, an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) attorney, Isaac Stein, has become an unlikely social media sensation after being spotted selling hot dogs in his office suit from a street cart. His story, now viral on Instagram and TikTok, highlights the growing frustration and financial strain among federal workers caught in the political deadlock.The US government shutdown, now nearing its fourth week, has left thousands of federal employees either furloughed or working without pay. The stalemate stems from a budget dispute between Congress and the White House over spending priorities and funding allocations.For many government workers, this marks one of the longest and most disruptive shutdowns in recent years. Agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and parts of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have been partially paralyzed, with many employees turning to side jobs or savings to make ends meet.Isaac Stein, a 36-year-old lawyer from Washington, D.C., who works for the IRS, decided to use his downtime creatively.Unable to report to work or collect his salary, Stein opened a hot dog cart near a construction site, still dressed in his professional suit and tie. Within hours, his photos and videos titled “Hot Dogs and the Tax Man” began circulating on social media, drawing millions of views and comments applauding his resourcefulness.According to local reports from The Washington Post and CNN, Stein had been running the food cart part-time for nearly two years as a hobby before it became his full-time fallback. But with the shutdown suspending his federal duties indefinitely, he decided to take the business public.On Instagram, comments poured in, blending humour, irony, and admiration. Many joked that the IRS lawyer had gone from auditing cash businesses to running one himself, with one viral remark reading, “Mr IRS agent running a cash business.” Others praised his creativity, saying wearing a suit instead of casual clothes was “genius marketing,” while some quipped that he was cleverly “using his business attire as a business expense. ”A few users wondered aloud, “Is he reporting tips?” and “Let’s make sure he reports his cash tips,” poking fun at his day job. Not everyone was sympathetic — some said they wouldn’t “start bawling their eyes out for an IRS employee,” while others found the sight oddly fitting, noting he looked exactly like what they imagined an IRS attorney would. Some even thought the post looked like satire, asking if it was “ripped from The Onion,” while others remarked that he probably “should have money saved up. ”","Isaac Stein, a 36-year-old lawyer from Washington, D.C., who works for the IRS, decided to use his downtime creatively.

JD Vance’s comments on Usha’s religion raise a question: Can MAGA base accept his Hindu-Indian wife?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vances-comments-on-ushas-religion-raise-a-question-can-maga-base-accept-his-hindu-indian-wife/articleshow/125019425.cms,"From Hug To Heartache? Erika Moment Fuels JD Vance–Usha Split Talk | Watch





A fresh row erupted inside the MAGA movement after JD Vance revealed he hopes his wife, Usha Vance, will one day embrace his Christian faith despite her Hindu upbringing. The episode raises a critical question: how will a movement that prizes religious identity accept a spouse from a different faith?Vance made the comments at a conservative event, saying he and his wife — who married in 2014 and have three children — had decided to raise their kids as Christians. “Do I hope eventually that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved in by church? Yeah, honestly I do wish that,” he said. “But if she doesn’t, then God says everybody has free will and so that doesn’t cause a problem for me.”For many MAGA supporters, alignment of religion and culture is non-negotiable. Vance’s wife, however, comes from a Hindu Indian-American background. The vice president’s comments prompted immediate pushback from Hindu-American voices, who accused him of religious insensitivity and pandering to Christian nationalists.Vance later attempted to clarify that he respects his wife’s beliefs and rejected claims that his comments were bigoted. “My wish for her is grounded in love,” he said, adding that she “is the most amazing blessing I have in my life.” But the question remained whether the message would resonate within a base that often views cultural and religious conformity as a test of loyalty.The timing of the controversy matters. Vance is widely seen as a rising star in the MAGA movement and a potential contender for higher office; every personal detail is under intense surveillance.A spouse’s background, once a private matter, has now become a public litmus test for acceptability inside a movement that often prizes religious and cultural homogeneity.Vance faces a deeper challenge than policy or persona: he must reassure a faith-driven base that his interfaith marriage does not dilute the cultural purity they expect.Conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza defended Vance, saying it was normal for Christians to hope their loved ones share their faith. Turning Point USA figures and attendees also appeared to back Vance, applauding his remarks and describing them as “heartfelt” and “honest.”However, major top GOP leaders — including Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Tucker Carlson, and Donald Trump Jr. — have not publicly weighed in on the controversy.","JD Vance said he hopes his wife will one day embrace his Christian faith.

COP30 snub: US to skip top-level presence in Brazil; Donald Trump ‘directly engaging’ with leaders on energy issues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cop30-snub-us-to-skip-top-level-presence-in-brazil-donald-trump-directly-engaging-with-leaders-on-energy-issues/articleshow/125017542.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

America Is All In





The United States will not send any top officials to the COP30 climate talks in Brazil later this month, a White House official confirmed on Saturday, as President Donald Trump focuses on boosting fossil fuels rather than global climate negotiations.Trump, who withdrew from the Paris Agreement for the second time after returning to the White House in January, had already been expected to skip the leaders’ summit ahead of the annual UN climate conference in Belém.However, it now appears no senior American negotiators will attend the talks scheduled from November 10 to 21 either.“The US is not sending any high-level representatives to COP30,” a White House official said on condition of anonymity, as cited by news agency AFP.“The president is directly engaging with leaders around the world on energy issues, which you can see from the historic trade deals and peace deals that all have a significant focus on energy partnerships”, the source added.Brazil has said fewer than 60 world leaders have confirmed attendance for the November 6–7 summit.The leaders of France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Norway, Colombia, Chile, Cape Verde and Liberia are expected to attend, while China will be represented by Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang.The move comes as Trump’s administration continues its rollback of multilateral climate commitments. “The Green New Scam would have killed America if President Trump had not been elected to implement his commonsense energy agenda – which is focused on utilizing the liquid gold under our feet,” White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said, as per The Guardian.She added that Trump “will not jeopardise our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals.”Earlier this year, the US state department closed its climate office, and the post of climate envoy was scrapped. The administration has also used its diplomatic leverage to promote fossil fuel interests, even threatening countries that supported the UN’s carbon pricing system under the International Maritime Organisation.While the federal government steps back, more than 100 US state and local leaders, including governors and mayors, are still expected to attend COP30.“We are showing up in force,” said Gina McCarthy, co-chair of thecoalition, according to AFP. “Local leaders here have authority to act on their own behalf, to take climate action at home and abroad.”The absence of a high-level US delegation comes as many countries struggle to finalise new emissions targets before the summit. Former US climate negotiator Todd Stern said, “The president has made it clear he wants to withdraw from the Paris agreement so it doesn’t surprise me they aren’t sending anyone because they aren’t engaged in this.”In all, 170 delegations are accredited for COP30, which is set to take place amid global political turmoil that many fear could overshadow the climate crisis.","The United States will not send any top officials to the COP30 climate talks in Brazil later this month, a White House official confirmed on Saturday.

'One Arrow, Two Targets': Indian Navy Sends Subtle Warning Message to China and Pakistan





Pakistan, heavily dependent on the waters of the Indus basin, faces a acute risk of insufficient water storage after India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) earlier this year, according to the Ecological Threat Report 2025.The report, released by the Institute for Economics and Peace, a Sydney-based independent and non-profit think tank, says the suspension gives India the ability to control the westward flow of the Indus and its tributaries into Pakistan. The move came after India decided to put the treaty in abeyance as a punitive measure following the Pakistan-sponsored Pahalgam terror attack on April 22 this year.This marks a major setback for Pakistan, whose agriculture depends 80 per cent on the Indus River system. The report highlighted that Pakistan’s dams can currently hold only about 30 days of Indus flow, leaving the country highly vulnerable to disruptions.“Pakistan lacks sufficient storage to buffer variations,” the report warned, adding, “If India were truly to cut off or significantly reduce Indus flows, Pakistan’s densely populated plains would face severe water shortages, especially in winter and dry seasons.Indeed, about 80 per cent of Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture depends on Indus basin rivers.”While India’s infrastructure limits its ability to completely stop river flows, even small disruptions could have ""disastrous"" short-term effects on Pakistan’s farm sector.In May, India carried out “reservoir flushing” operations at the Salal and Baglihar dams on the Chenab River without notifying Pakistan. This process, used to remove silt by draining reservoirs, had been restricted under the treaty due to the risk of sudden downstream changes.The impact was immediate: parts of the Chenab River in Pakistan’s Punjab ran dry for several days when India shut the dam gates and later released sediment-filled torrents upon reopening them.The Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960 and mediated by the World Bank, has long acted as a key tool for water-sharing and conflict resolution between the two countries. It governs the use of the Indus River and its six major tributaries -- five on the left bank and one on the right.","India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) earlier this year.

Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) second-in-command Amjad, a key figure in the banned militant group, was killed along with three other militants when security forces foiled an infiltration attempt from Afghanistan into Pakistan, the army said on Thursday.According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), cited by PTI, the militants tried to cross the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Bajaur district on Wednesday night when their movement was detected.“The troops effectively engaged and thwarted the militants' attempt to infiltrate,” the statement said, adding that four militants, including high-value target Amjad alias Mazahim, were “sent to hell.”Amjad, who served as deputy to TTP chief Noor Wali and headed the group’s Rehbari Shura, was among Pakistan’s most wanted militants, carrying a bounty of Rs five million. The ISPR said he was “actively involved in perpetuating numerous terrorist activities inside Pakistan while residing in Afghanistan.”The army also urged the interim Afghan government to take “concrete measures to ensure that Afghan soil is not used by militants to perpetrate terrorism against Pakistan.”Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded the security forces for eliminating the TTP commander and his aides. Prime Minister Shehbaz said the security forces, through their professional expertise, eliminated the highly wanted TTP commander Amjad and thwarted “the nefarious designs of the enemies of Pakistan's sovereignty.” He added, “We will continue to defeat the elements that harm innocent people. ”The operation in Bajaur came a day after six Pakistani soldiers, including a captain, were martyred during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district, where seven terrorists were also gunned down.Formed in 2007 as an umbrella organisation of several militant outfits, the TTP seeks to impose its strict version of Islam across Pakistan. The group, believed to have close ties with al-Qaeda, has claimed responsibility for numerous deadly attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad and the 2009 assault on army headquarters.","Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) second-in-command Amjad, a key figure in the banned militant group, was killed along with three other militants.

'Pakistan’s patience has run its course'



Growing tensions on the border







Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with the United States that allows the use of drones within its territory, TOLOnews reported, citing Afghan and diplomatic sources. The acknowledgment, made during the latest round of Pakistan-Afghanistan peace talks in Turkey.According to TOLOnews, the Pakistani delegation said it “cannot break” the agreement with Washington that authorises drone operations. Afghan negotiators, in response, demanded written guarantees that Pakistan would not allow US drones to use its airspace or strike Afghan territory. Sources familiar with the talks, cited by TOLOnews said Pakistan’s delegation initially agreed to these conditions but later reversed its position after receiving instructions from Islamabad, saying it had “no control over US drones and could not ensure action against ISIS. ” Qatari and Turkish mediators were reportedly taken aback by the sudden shift in stance.The Afghan side reiterated that the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) issue was Pakistan’s own internal problem. “The Islamic Emirate has repeatedly emphasised, and again reaffirmed, that insecurity in Pakistan is a domestic matter,” TOLOnews quoted its delegation as saying, adding that Afghanistan remains committed to ensuring no group uses its soil to harm other nations.The disclosure came as four days of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement. Pakistan’s information minister Attaullah Tarar said the dialogue “failed to bring about any workable solution,” blaming Kabul for refusing to act against militants responsible for cross-border attacks. “Pakistan’s patience has run its course,” Tarar said, adding that Islamabad “would continue to take all possible measures necessary to protect our people from terrorism. ”Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif issued a strong warning to the Taliban regime, vowing that Islamabad could “strike deep into Afghanistan” if further attacks occurred. “If their territory is used and they violate ours, we will retaliate — we surely will,” Asif told reporters. In a separate post on X, he cautioned Kabul against testing Pakistan’s “resolve and capabilities at its own peril and doom.”The breakdown in talks follows weeks of escalating border clashes that left dozens dead. Pakistan’s military earlier this month struck what it described as TTP hideouts inside Afghanistan, prompting retaliatory attacks that killed Pakistani soldiers. Though a ceasefire brokered by Qatar on 19 October remains technically in effect, all major crossings between the two countries remain closed, with hundreds of trucks stranded.Islamabad insists that the Afghan Taliban continues to shelter militants who launch attacks in Pakistan, a charge Kabul denies. The UN has expressed concern over the failed negotiations, urging both sides to avoid renewed fighting.","Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with the United States that allows the use of drones within its territory, TOLOnews reported.

Escalation Fears Mount As Pakistan-Afghanistan Talks End Without Conclusion In Turkey

Operation Sindoor







Days after Jaish-e-Mohammed announced the formation of its first-ever women's wing, 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat', the JeM's chief Masood Azhar has released a 21-minute audio message from group's Bahawalpur headquarters, Markaz Usman o Ali, outlining a detailed plan for training, indoctrinating, and deploying women under the new unit, as local media reported.According to media reports, in the audio, Azhar explains how women will be recruited, trained, and integrated into his long-term ""global jihad"" mission, mirroring the structure of JeM's long-running male training programme.Azhar declares that just as men undergo the 15-day ""Daura-e-Tarbiat"" course, women joining 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat' will be trained through an induction course named ""Daura-e-Taskiya"", conducted at Markaz Usman o Ali in Bahawalpur.For the past two decades, JeM's ""Daura-e-Tarbiat"" has served as the primary indoctrination stage for male recruits, convincing them that jihad against India guarantees paradise. Azhar now intends to extend the same ideological training to women.In his speech, the wanted terrorist promises that any woman who joins Jamaat-ul-Mominaat “will go straight to paradise from her grave after death.”He added that women completing the first course will advance to a second stage, ""Daura-Ayat-ul-Nisah,"" which will teach how Islamic texts ""instruct women to conduct jihad.""Justifying the formation of a female brigade, most-wanted terrorist Azhar claimed, ""The enemies of Jaish have put Hindu women into the army and set up female journalists against us,"" declaring that he is ""mobilising his women to compete and fight against them.""He asserts that JeM’s male Mujahids will work alongside this new female unit, saying the women’s brigade will ""spread Islam across the world.""Azhar also announces that Jamaat-ul-Mominaat branches will be opened in every district of Pakistan , each headed by a District Muntazima responsible for recruiting local women. He lays down strict communication rules, stating, ""Women joining the brigade must not speak to any unrelated men through phone or messenger, except their husbands or immediate family members.""According to IANS, the women’s wing will be led by Sadiya Azhar, sister of Masood Azhar. Her husband, Yusuf Azhar, was killed during Operation Sindoor on May 7, when Indian forces targeted JeM’s previous base, Markaz Subhanallah.""His other sister Samaira Azhar, and Afeera Farooq, widow of Pulwama attacker Umar Farooq, are also part of the leadership,"" sources confirmed, adding that “they are tasked with conducting daily online sessions to motivate and recruit women.”JeM has since verified these details in a new poster naming Umme Masood (real name Samaira Azhar) as the instructor for online classes, conducted five days a week from October 25.Azhar further reveals that Jamaat-ul-Mominaat includes “4–5 women whose male relatives were killed in encounters with the Indian Army,” who will inspire new recruits under a campaign called “Shoba-e-Dawat.”He urges women cadres to read his book “Ae Musalman Behna” (O Muslim Sister) as part of their indoctrination.It is significant that 14 members of Masood Azhar’s family were killed in India’s Operation Sindoor, including Yousuf Azhar, Jameel Ahmed, Hamza Jameel, and Huzaifa Azhar. Azhar now claims that his elder sister Hawa Bibi also died in the same strike.In the audio, an emotional Azhar recounts that he had conceptualised the idea of a women’s brigade with his sister before her death.In retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians, India launched a major military operation targeting Pakistan-based terror infrastructure. The counterterror action, named Operation Sindoor, struck nine key terror hubs across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The strikes destroyed major bases of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), including their headquarters in Bahawalpur and Muridke, which were reduced to rubble by precision airstrikes carried out by the Indian armed forces.In response, Pakistan attempted retaliation by launching multiple drones and missiles towards Indian territory the following night. However, India’s advanced air defence systems swiftly intercepted and neutralised the incoming threats, preventing any casualties or damage.India then answered this provocation with targeted strikes on crucial Pakistani airbases, including the strategically significant Nur Khan Airbase and Rahim Yar Khan Airbase.The heightened military tensions between the two neighbours were eventually de-escalated following a mutual peace agreement, initiated by Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO).Since then, these outfits have reportedly relocated to Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) region to avoid further strikes. Their leaders have been issuing propaganda messages and appeals for funds to rebuild their networks.Media sources also reveal that Masood Azhar has been aggressively collecting donations. During his September 27 address at Markaz Usman o Ali, he publicly appealed for financial support.JeM is now collecting a donation of 500 PKR from every woman enrolling in the new course and requiring them to fill out online registration forms.Earlier, on October 8, Masood Azhar formally announced the formation of Jamaat-ul-Mominaat, followed by an event titled “Dukhtaran-e-Islam” in Rawalakot, PoK, on October 19, aimed at drawing women into the organisation.While groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, Hamas, and LTTE have long deployed women in combat and suicide missions, organisations such as JeM, LeT, and Hizbul Mujahideen had largely avoided such practices -- until now. Security agencies believe JeM’s latest move signals its intent to train and deploy female suicide bombers in future terror operations.","Jaish-e-Mohammed announces formation of women's wing, 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat' JeM's chief Masood Azhar releases 21-minute audio message from group's Bahawalpur headquarters, Markaz Usman o Ali.

What Afghanistan said







Pakistan has issued a stark warning to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan after the peace talks in Turkey failed to bear any outcome on Tuesday. Boasting Pakistan's defence arsenal, its Pakwarned that ""not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. ""“Let me assure them that Pakistan does not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. If they wish so, the repeat of the scenes of their rout at Tora Bora, with their tails between the legs, would surely be a spectacle to watch for the people of the region,” Dawn reported Asif saying.Kabul has blamed Pakistan for the failed peace talks in Turkey after Islamabad disagreed ""to stop violating Afghan airspace and prevent US drone flights,"" Tolo News reported citing sources.The violence, which left more than 70 people dead and wounded hundreds more, erupted after a series of explosions in Kabul on October 9, attacks that Taliban authorities have attributed to Pakistan. The two sides had been engaged in peace talks in Istanbul at the time.Pakistan information minister Attaullah Tarar on Wednesday informed in a post on X that the talks between the two nations had no conclusion as the ""Afghan side gave no assurances, kept deviating from the core issue.""""Regrettably, the Afghan side gave no assurances, kept deviating from the core issue and resorted to blame game, deflection and ruses,"" AFP quoted Tarar saying. ""The dialogue thus failed to bring about any workable solution.""Adding to this, Asif took a more firm stance warning Afghanistan against any ""terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan"".“We have borne your treachery and mockery for too long, but no more. Any terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan shall give you the bitter taste of such misadventures. Be rest assured and test our resolve and capabilities, if you wish so, at your own peril and doom,” Dawn quoted Asif saying.Though there has been no direct statements from Kabul's side, media reports stated that the talks broke down as ""Pakistani delegation reportedly presented demands that were also unacceptable to both sides.""According to Tolo News, sources said Islamabad pressed the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan to formally classify the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as a terrorist organization and to act against the group.Reacting to this, Afghanistan defence minister Mawlawi Mohammad Yaqoob Mujahid, said, “Pakistan and other countries use the label of terrorism for political purposes against their opponents.”However, a Pakistani security source said the Afghan delegation initially agreed to act decisively against the TTP but repeatedly backtracked under instructions from Kabul, AFP reported.Following the October 9 Kabul explosions, the Taliban launched a border offensive—prompting Pakistani strikes in response. A 48-hour ceasefire collapsed before a new truce was reached on October 19 in Doha, with Qatar and Turkey mediating.

Pakistan repeats old claims





Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday warned Afghanistan that if the attack on Islamabad continues, then they will give a 50 times stronger response, and accused Kabul of acting as a puppet for India.The remarks came after peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul dramatically collapsed.Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, Asif Kabul, using Pakistan’s familiar playbook of deflection, claimed that Kabul was merely a puppet in India’s hands.He said “I would compliment their delegation, but the people in Kabul pulling the strings and staging the puppet show are being controlled by Delhi.""""India is compensating for its defeat on their western border through Kabul. The junta there (in Afghanistan) has elements that have visited India and visited their temples,"" Asif claimed. ""India wants to engage in a low-intensity war with Pakistan. To achieve this, they are using Kabul,"" he added.When asked to comment on threats by Afghanistan that they would “attack Islamabad” in the event of further hostilities, Asif replied: “If Afghanistan even looks at Islamabad, we will gouge their eyes out.“They can employ the use of terrorists and they already are. Over the past four years, they have been using terrorists,” he added.“There should be no doubt that Kabul is responsible for the terrorism in Pakistan. Kabul is a tool for Delhi. If they want to, God forbid, attack Islamabad, we will give a befitting response. A response 50 times stronger,” the defence minister said.Kabul had previously rejected Islamabad’s accusations as unfounded.Still, the Pakistani minister praised the Afghan negotiators for their cooperation — even as he directed sharp criticism at the Kabul leadership.This is not the first time. Earlier also, Pakistan claimed India was behind a recent assault in Afghanistan. Ministry of external affairs dismissed Pakistan’s accusations that India was behind a recent assault in Afghanistan, saying Islamabad’s record of harbouring terrorism was well knownAt the weekly press briefing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “Three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbours for its own internal failures. Three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories.""The remarks followed the collapse of the latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Turkey. According to Afghan and Pakistani sources cited by Reuters, both sides had earlier agreed to a ceasefire on October 19 in Doha but failed to make progress in Istanbul.Each country blamed the other for the stalemate. The discussions, mediated by Turkey and Qatar, concluded on Monday without any breakthrough.","Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif warned Afghanistan that if the attack on Islamabad continues, then they will give a 50 times stronger response.

Afghanistan Stops Border Operations Against Pakistan Following Mediation By Gulf Countries





Negotiations between Afghanistan and Pakistan to secure a lasting truce after their bloodiest clashes in years were deadlocked Tuesday, with a Pakistani security source saying a ""last-ditch effort"" was under way. Dozens were killed on both sides of the border in the worst such violence since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.The one-time allies have had frosty relations since then, with the Taliban govt denying accusations from Islamabad that it harbours militant groups which stage attacks in Pakistan. After an initial 48-hour ceasefire between the neighbours lapsed, a second truce emerged on Oct 19 after talks in Doha, mediated by Qatar and Turkiye, though its terms remain unclear. Talks in Istanbul began Saturday and aimed to establish long-term peace.A Pakistani security source said the Afghan Taliban delegation initially agreed to Islamabad's call for ""credible and decisive action"" against the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan militant group. But the Afghan side ""reversed its position repeatedly after instructions from Kabul"", said the source, who was not authorised to discuss the peace talks publicly.Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif had warned on Saturday that failure to reach a deal could lead to ""open war"". Abdul Mateen Qani, spokesman for Afghanistan's interior ministry, said that any attack would be met with a response ""that will serve as a lesson for Pakistan and a message for others"".","Dozens killed on both sides of the border in the worst such violence since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.

In a rare confession, Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with a ""foreign country"" which allowed it to carry drone strikes on Afghanistan soil, Tolo News reported citing source. It has sought retreat from the Turkey talks asking the Afghan side to ""accept that Pakistan has the right to carry out attacks on Afghan soil during TTP assaults. ""The report, however, did not reveal the ""foreign country"" under question.It further said that because of the agreement, Pakistan ""cannot prevent such strikes because breaking the agreement is not possible.""According to the report, the source claimed there was a lack of coordination within the Pakistani delegation, suggesting that rather than putting forward a coherent case, they seemed more inclined to backtrack and walk away from the talks.The Islamic Emirate’s delegation has argued that the TTP matter is Pakistan’s own longstanding internal issue, not something that concerns Afghanistan.This came after reports suggested that there was a deadlock in the Pakistan-Afghanistan truce talks with both the nations blaming each other for failure to reach a deal.There has been no official comment about the status of the talks.","Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with a ""foreign country"" which allowed it to carry drone strikes on Afghanistan soil.

Twin Trouble For Pak! After India, Afghanistan May Restrict River Water Supply To Pakistan

Pak, Afghan play the blame game







Pakistan, Afghanistan peace talks in Turkey have hit an impasse with both the nations pointing fingers at each other for failure to reach a deal, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday. Istanbul has been consistent in its efforts to end the deadlock, however, there has been no immediate confirmations whether a fourth day of talks would be held.The Istanbul talks form a key element of a wider diplomatic effort to defuse months of rising friction between Islamabad and Kabul over cross-border militancy and alleged safe havens, long-standing flashpoints that have only intensified since the Taliban reclaimed power in Afghanistan four years ago.There has been no official statement about the status of the talks.Pakistan and Afghanistan have blamed each other for the deadlock, as efforts to build on last month’s ceasefire remain stalled. Both sides accused the other of lacking seriousness in talks aimed at easing cross-border tensions that recently erupted into deadly clashes.Pakistani security officials involved in the negotiations said Kabul was refusing to accept what Islamabad considers “logical and legitimate” demands -- assurances that Afghan soil would not be used for attacks in Pakistan, according to AP.They argued that the Taliban delegation had been reluctant to commit to concrete guarantees and repeatedly sought guidance from Kabul before making decisions.The Afghan side, however, countered those claims. While Kabul did not immediately issue a formal response, state-run broadcaster RTA asserted that Afghanistan has “made every effort to hold constructive talks,” but that “the Pakistani side does not seem to have this intention.” The accusation mirrors Pakistan’s criticism and underscores a widening diplomatic rift.Despite the stalemate, Turkish officials and other international mediators have been working to preserve the ceasefire brokered in Doha on October 19, after fighting along the border left dozens of soldiers, militants and civilians dead on both sides.","Pakistan and Afghanistan have blamed each other for the deadlock, as efforts to build on last month’s ceasefire remain stalled.

Should India Engage With Taliban Amid Pak-Afghan Truce? Ex-Diplomat Explains| India Connect





The latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan has reportedly hit a stalemate, with Islamabad accusing the Afghan Taliban of taking an “illogical and detached” position on key security issues, including cooperation against cross-border militancy, Geo News reported.The second phase of discussions, held in Istanbul on Saturday, came a week after the initial negotiations in Doha following an October 16 ceasefire that ended the deadliest border clashes between the two sides since the Taliban seized power in 2021.Citing official sources, Geo News said Pakistan presented “clear, evidence-based and solution-oriented” demands urging Kabul to act against militant groups operating from Afghan soil. However, the Taliban delegation allegedly remained “unwilling to cooperate or acknowledge ground realities.”The talks in Istanbul, mediated by Turkey’s intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin, focused on creating a joint monitoring mechanism to curb militant movement across the border and facilitate smoother trade. Radio Pakistan reported that both sides also discussed the possibility of a long-term political framework to stabilise relations.According to reports, Turkey is attempting to bridge the gap by helping the Taliban delegation understand the seriousness of Pakistan’s security concerns. Islamabad has reportedly conveyed its final position, warning that any tolerance or shelter for militants targeting its territory “will not be acceptable.”Sources told Geo News that progress in the talks now hinges entirely on the Taliban’s attitude and readiness to cooperate in good faith. Pakistani officials described the Taliban’s responses during the exchanges as “illogical and detached from ground realities,” further deepening doubts about Kabul’s sincerity.During the discussions, Pakistan pressed the Taliban regime to dismantle terrorist networks and prevent militant infiltration. Kabul’s delegation submitted a written response to Islamabad’s proposals late Sunday night.The ongoing negotiations mark the second round of peace efforts, following the Doha talks where both sides agreed to a ceasefire mediated by Qatar and Turkey after intense cross-border clashes.The conflict saw multiple days of heavy clashes across the border of two neighbours. Pakistani forces claimed they killed over 200 Taliban fighters, while 23 soldiers lost their lives, according to media reports. Following the violence, key border crossings were shut, citing security concerns.Meanwhile, Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif has warned of an “all-out war” if the peace efforts fail.","The latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan has reportedly hit a stalemate.

She claimed that remaining in Bangladesh, which was battling widespread protests against Hasina, would have endangered her life and the ""safety of those around her"".“Staying would not only have put my life in danger, but also the lives of those around me,"" she said, speaking in an exclusive interview with The Independent.Despite fleeing the country and the Awami League being banned in Bangladesh, she maintains that she is still committed to “restoring democracy” in the country.Hasina described the August protests in Bangladesh as a “violent insurrection.”“As a leader, I ultimately take leadership responsibility, but the claim that I ordered or wished for the security forces to open fire on the crowds is simply wrong,"" she said.She added that she blames the high number of casualties on “breakdowns in discipline among security forces on the ground.” Hasina said her government had launched an independent inquiry into the initial killings, which was later shut down by the interim administration that replaced her.She said that she would “neither be surprised nor intimidated” if Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) sentenced her to death, calling the proceedings “a sham trial” motivated by political revenge.“The ICT is a sham court presided over by an unelected government consisting of my political opponents. Many of those opponents will stop at nothing to get rid of me,"" Hasina said, as cited by The Independent.What began last July as a movement by university students demanding the removal of job quotas for relatives of independence war veterans soon grew into a nationwide uprising in Bangladesh, which ultimately led to Hasina fleeing the country.Hasina disputed the widely reported death toll from the student-led protests, saying that “the 1,400 figure is useful to the ICT for propaganda purposes but is probably inflated.”Meanwhile, the interim government's chief prosecutor, Tajul Islam, has called Hasina the “mastermind and principal architect” behind the alleged crimes against humanity during the student-led uprising.","Ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said she fled the country on August 5 last year “out of necessity” She claimed that remaining in Bangladesh, which was battling widespread protests against Hasina, would have endangered her life and the ""safety of those around her"" Hasina described the August protests in Bangladesh as a “violent insurrection”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124988908,imgsize-637906,width-400,resizemode-4/sheikh-hasina-ani.jpg"

Afghanistan’s interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani has issued a stern warning to Pakistan, saying Kabul’s patience should not be mistaken for weakness as both sides agreed to maintain a fragile ceasefire after days of failed negotiations.Haqqani warned that if Afghanistan’s patience was tested again, the country would deliver a “crushing” response. “Defending our territory is among our priorities,” he said. “Yet despite all this, the path of understanding remains open. But if someone commits aggression, we have fought the emperors of the world and it is no difficulty for us to defend our territory,” the interior minister said as quoted by TOLOnews.Haqqani added that Afghanistan may lack long-range missiles or heavy weapons but has “strong resolve and determination in the battle against aggression.” Without naming Pakistan, he accused some nations of violating the sovereignty of others “to preserve their interests.” “Afghans have proved themselves in the battlefield,” he warned. “If our patience is tested again, our response will be very crushing,” he said, as per TOLOnews.His comments came soon after Turkey announced that Pakistan and Afghanistan had agreed to uphold a ceasefire following days of tense talks in Istanbul, mediated by Turkey and Qatar. The ceasefire deal, confirmed on Thursday, aims to prevent further border clashes that have recently left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. The two sides are set to reconvene in Istanbul on November 6 to finalise a monitoring and verification mechanism, including penalties for any violation of the agreement.Despite the progress, the border remains shut, with hundreds of trucks and refugees stranded on both sides.

Pakistani officials reiterated that their main demand was for Afghanistan to take “clear, verifiable and effective action” against militant groups operating on its soil.Tensions spiked earlier this month when Kabul accused Pakistan of launching airstrikes inside Afghanistan, including one that hit a market in the east.

NEW DELHI: Ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday said she lives freely in New Delhi, and “would love to go home” but remains cautious, given her family’s violent past.“I would of course love to go home, so long as the government there was legitimate, the constitution was being upheld, and law and order genuinely prevailed,” Hasina told Reuters in her first media engagement after her dramatic fall from power last year.The 78-year-old Awami League chief fled to India in August 2024 after a deadly student-led uprising ended her 15-year rule. An interim government led by Muhammad Yunus has ruled Bangladesh since Hasina’s ouster and has promised to hold elections in February 2026.Sitting in the Indian capital, Hasina said she won’t return to Bangladesh under any government formed through elections that exclude her party.Hasina further warned that millions of Awami League supporters would boycott next year’s national election, after the party was barred from contesting the polls.“The ban on the Awami League is not only unjust, it is self-defeating,” she said in emailed responses to Reuters.“The next government must have electoral legitimacy. Millions of people support the Awami League, so as things stand, they will not vote. You cannot disenfranchise millions of people if you want a political system that works,” she added.Once praised for transforming Bangladesh’s economy, Hasina now faces charges of crimes against humanity over a brutal crackdown on student protests in mid-2024.A verdict from the International Crimes Tribunal is expected on November 13, Reuters reported.A United Nations report estimates that up to 1,400 people were killed and thousands more injured, mostly by security forces’ gunfire, during the unrest between July 15 and August 5, marking Bangladesh’s deadliest violence since the 1971 war of independence.“These proceedings are a politically motivated charade,” Hasina said, denying the allegations. “They’ve been brought by kangaroo courts, with guilty verdicts a foregone conclusion. I was mostly denied prior notice or any meaningful opportunity to defend myself,” she added.Despite her exile, Hasina remains hopeful about her party’s future.“It’s really not about me or my family,” she said. “For Bangladesh to achieve the future we all want, there must be a return to constitutional rule and political stability. No single person or family defines our country’s future.”",Ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina says she lives freely in New Delhi.

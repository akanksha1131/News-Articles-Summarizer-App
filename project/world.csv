Political overtones

FAREWELL FEMA?: President Trump visits town ‘treated badly’ by Democrats

US President Donald Trump on Friday toured disaster-stricken areas in North Carolina and California, criticising the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) and considering ""getting rid of"" it.In North Carolina, still reeling months after Hurricane Helene devastated the state, Trump floated the idea of eliminating FEMA altogether. He proposed channelling federal disaster funds directly to states instead, a move he argued would reduce bureaucracy and speed up recovery efforts.""FEMA has been a very big disappointment,"" Trump said during a visit to the Asheville area. ""It's very bureaucratic. And it's very slow. I'd like to see the states take care of disasters—let them handle the tornadoes and hurricanes and everything else. That would be quicker and cheaper.""North Carolina residents shared harrowing stories with Trump about wading through floodwaters and battling insurance companies to rebuild their lives. Trump vowed to improve their situation, blaming the Biden administration for delays in recovery efforts.""You are not forgotten any longer,"" Trump said during a briefing on recovery efforts. ""You were treated very badly by the previous administration.""While FEMA has distributed $319 million in financial assistance to the state, Trump criticised the agency's overall response, calling it inadequate. Some residents, like Laurie Carpenter of Newland, North Carolina, welcomed Trump's visit, believing he might accelerate recovery efforts. Others, like Sarah Wells Rolland of Asheville, were more sceptical, citing concerns about long-term support.Later in the day, Trump travelled to wildfire-ravaged Los Angeles, where he met California governor Gavin Newsom on the tarmac. Despite their contentious history, the two leaders struck a conciliatory tone, with Newsom acknowledging Trump's past support during the COVID-19 pandemic.""We're going to need your support. We're going to need your help,"" Newsom told Trump, emphasising the urgency of wildfire recovery.Trump's comments on FEMA suggest he is considering reducing the federal government's role in disaster response. The agency, which helps coordinate relief efforts and provide financial assistance during emergencies, has faced scrutiny from Trump and conservative allies who view its operations as inefficient.Michael Coen, former FEMA chief of staff under President Biden, defended the agency, saying, ""The American people expect the federal government will be there for them on their worst day, no matter where they live.""Trump’s appointment of Cameron Hamilton, a former Navy SEAL with limited disaster management experience, as FEMA's acting director has also raised eyebrows.Trump’s disaster tours in North Carolina, a key battleground state, and California, a Democratic stronghold, carried clear political undertones. He used the visits to highlight his administration's efforts while criticizing his predecessor's handling of disasters.","US President Donald Trump toured disaster-stricken areas in North Carolina and California.

Viral post links Barack Obama and Jennifer Aniston

Michelle Obama’s absence fuels speculation

No official word yet

A wave of rumours surrounding former US President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama has taken social media by storm, fueled by discussions of a possible separation and an alleged connection between Barack Obama and actress Jennifer Aniston . Amid this, Megyn Kelly, host of The Megyn Kelly Show , addressed the rumours and said ""it would be a political earthquake"" if it were true.Kelly's social media posts on X and Instagram rapidly spread, drawing attention to the potential consequences of such a separation. ""I don't know whether it is true,"" she said, ""but if it is, it truly would be a political earthquake in Democratic circles, never mind America.""In her video, Kelly further emphasised the rarity of presidential divorces, saying ''I don't remember a presidential divorce in modern history.''A post on X has added fuel to the fire, claiming that Jennifer Aniston is romantically involved with Barack Obama. The post alleged that a friend of Aniston revealed the relationship during a casual conversation at a gathering. ""He's with Jennifer Aniston. My old manager, now a friend, is connected to her inner circle. At a gathering with Jennifer's friends, the affair came up casually -- Jennifer herself admitted it. They were sitting with a psychic, which makes it sound surreal, but it's definitely not a secret among her closest friends,"" the message read.The message has since gone viral, sparking heated debates and widespread speculation. Social media users were quick to point out that the rumours align with earlier tabloid claims, despite Aniston's public denial during an October appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live. Laughing off a magazine cover story suggesting a romance with Barack Obama, Aniston called the claims ""absolutely untrue"" but joked that she wasn't offended by them.The rumours of a split gained traction when Michelle Obama was noticeably absent from key events, including the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter.Michelle’s team later clarified that she was on an extended vacation in Hawaii during the Carter funeral. However, reports suggesting that she has distanced herself from Washington, life and spends little time with Barack have added to the speculation.As the rumours continue to swirl, neither Barack nor Michelle Obama has commented publicly on the matter. Similarly, Jennifer Aniston has not addressed the latest claims.","A wave of rumours surrounding former US President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama has taken social media by storm.

Donald Trump Jr has a stark warning for any Republican who votes against Tulsi Gabbard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-jr-has-a-stark-warning-for-any-republican-who-votes-against-tulsi-gabbard/articleshow/117525757.cms,"2020 Democratic Debate - SNL

Why Gabbard has an uphill battle



Donald Trump Jr. issued a stark warning to Republican senators ahead of the confirmation hearing for Tulsi Gabbard, President Trump's nominee for Director of National Intelligence (DNI). In a tweet, Trump Jr. wrote, “Any Republican Senator who votes against @TulsiGabbard deserves a primary. No more Deep State b******!!!!”The Senate Intelligence Committee is set to hold a hearing on January 30 to assess Gabbard’s qualifications. The hearing follows delays from Senate Democrats, who cited incomplete background checks, ethics disclosures, and other paperwork on the controversial nominee.If confirmed, Gabbard—a former Democratic congresswoman—would oversee all 18 US intelligence agencies. However, her nomination has sparked sharp debate in Washington. Critics point to her lack of intelligence experience and her controversial relationships with US adversaries.Gabbard faced scrutiny for meeting with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2017, shortly after allegations emerged that Assad used chemical weapons against his own people. She has also been a vocal defender of whistleblower Edward Snowden and has echoed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rhetoric regarding the war in Ukraine.Despite these concerns, Gabbard has sought to build bipartisan support, notably reversing her stance on Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Once critical of the program, Gabbard now supports its use to allow US intelligence agencies to monitor foreign nationals abroad without a warrant.“If confirmed as DNI, I will uphold Americans’ Fourth Amendment rights while maintaining vital national security tools like Section 702 to ensure the safety and freedom of the American people,” Gabbard said in a statement earlier this month.Her shift on Section 702 has garnered support from prominent Republican lawmakers, including Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton (R-Ark.).The upcoming hearing is expected to be contentious, as senators from both parties weigh Gabbard's qualifications and past actions against her recent pledges to support national security initiatives.Tulsi Gabbard's lack of formal intelligence experience is a major concern for her nomination as Director of National Intelligence (DNI), given the critical oversight role of managing the US's 18 intelligence agencies. While her military and congressional background is notable, critics argue it may not sufficiently prepare her for the complexities of the intelligence domain.Her foreign policy stances have drawn bipartisan criticism. Gabbard's 2017 meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, known for human rights abuses, and her controversial comments on US-funded biolabs in Ukraine, perceived as echoing Russian propaganda, have raised serious questions about her judgment.Gabbard’s perceived sympathies toward adversarial nations, including Russia and Syria, have further fueled skepticism about her ability to provide unbiased intelligence assessments. These perceptions stem from her public statements and diplomatic interactions that some view as overly conciliatory.Read: The obscure cult that could ruin Tulsi Gabbard's chances The most contentious issue is her association with the Science of Identity Foundation (SIF), a religious organization described by critics as cult-like. Allegations that SIF leader Chris Butler exerted influence over her political career raise concerns about potential undue external influence in her decision-making.Her shifting political allegiances, including her departure from the Democratic Party and endorsement of Donald Trump, have raised eyebrows. This evolution in her political stance has alienated members of both parties, complicating her confirmation prospects.Ethical and financial concerns have also emerged. Delays in her confirmation hearings are attributed to incomplete ethics paperwork, and scrutiny of her financial disclosures, including media earnings and book deals, has sparked questions about potential conflicts of interest.Bipartisan opposition presents a significant hurdle for Gabbard’s nomination. Senators from both sides, including Republican Susan Collins and Democrat Tammy Duckworth, have voiced reservations, reflecting widespread unease about her suitability for the DNI role.Public and intelligence community skepticism adds to the challenges. Figures like John Bolton have openly criticized her nomination, citing her controversial past and perceived vulnerabilities, which many argue make her unfit to manage the nation’s intelligence operations.","Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman, is President Trump's nominee for Director of National Intelligence (DNI) The Senate Intelligence Committee is set to hold a hearing on January 30 to assess her qualifications.

Angry H-1B tweet or Hindu faith? Why was Vivek Ramaswamy really fired from DOGE?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/angry-h-1b-tweet-or-hindu-faith-why-was-vivek-ramaswamy-really-fired-from-doge/articleshow/117526472.cms,"Poll Do You Agree with Vivek Ramaswamy’s Comments on H-1B Visa Holders? No Yes

The H-1B Tweet Controversy



Denials and Allegations



Elon Musk’s Role in the Shakeup



DOGE’s Ambitious Goals



The Role of Race and Faith



Prominent Indian-Americans in MAGA



A Cultural and Political Crossroads



The abrupt exit of Indian-American billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy from the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) has raised questions about the factors leading to his ouster. Was it his controversial tweet about H-1B visas and American mediocrity, his Hindu faith, or deeper political struggles involving tech magnate Elon Musk ? The incident shines a spotlight on political ambition, cultural identity, and the challenges of fitting into a movement grappling with its inclusivity.Ramaswamy ignited a firestorm in December with a tweet criticizing what he described as America’s “cultural veneration of mediocrity.” In his post, he argued that the US had deprioritized academic excellence in favor of social conformity, tracing this trend back to cultural shifts in the 1990s. He suggested this cultural failing—not an innate IQ gap—was why top tech companies often hired foreign-born engineers over native-born Americans.He used examples from pop culture, pointing to the glorification of prom queens and star athletes over valedictorians and science champions as indicative of a society celebrating “normalcy” over intellectual achievement. Immigrant families, he argued, placed a higher premium on academic excellence, which accounted for their dominance in STEM fields.Ramaswamy called for a “cultural reset,” urging America to refocus on intellectual pursuits and academic competition while cautioning that the nation risked losing its edge to countries like China. While some praised his comments as a much-needed wake-up call, others accused him of elitism and undermining American workers by advocating for high-skilled immigration reforms.This polarizing tweet placed Ramaswamy in the crosshairs of MAGA’s anti-immigration faction, compounding existing frustrations within Trump’s team.The situation escalated when National File published an article claiming that Ramaswamy had linked his departure from DOGE to backlash over his tweet. The report, attributed to journalist Patrick Howley, quoted Ramaswamy allegedly confirming that his tweet was a factor in his exit. “Obviously,” he was reported to have said.Ramaswamy vehemently denied the claims, calling the allegations “lies” in a post on X (formerly Twitter). “Dude, I have no idea who you are, never got a text from you, and would never reply if I did,” he wrote. Reacting to the ongoing speculation, he doubled down: “Lies. Never spoke to these clowns.”Despite his denials, rumors persisted that the tweet was the final straw for Ramaswamy’s position at DOGE. While his remarks alone may not have been enough to force his departure, insiders suggest they exacerbated tensions with Elon Musk, who played a pivotal role in his removal.Elon Musk’s growing influence within DOGE—and the broader Trump administration—has been a contentious subject. As co-chair of DOGE, Musk is seen as the driving force behind its agenda, frequently clashing with Washington’s bureaucratic norms. According to sources, Musk grew increasingly frustrated with Ramaswamy’s attempt to balance his role at DOGE with a gubernatorial campaign in Ohio.“Musk has an iron grip on DOGE,” a Republican strategist told Politico. “And when he decided Ramaswamy wasn’t a fit, it was only a matter of time.”Reports indicate Musk viewed Ramaswamy’s dual ambitions as a distraction from DOGE’s mission. “You can’t have one foot in DOGE and the other in politics,” one insider quoted Musk as saying. The tweet criticizing America’s mediocrity only amplified these frustrations, making it easier for Musk to push Ramaswamy out.Ironically, Musk himself has courted controversy, including agreeing with a X user who called Trump supporters “r****” in a tweet. Despite this, his position within DOGE remains unchallenged, further highlighting his unparalleled influence.DOGE was launched as a cornerstone of Trump’s second-term agenda, tasked with streamlining government and cutting federal bureaucracy. Its ambitious goals included eliminating entire agencies, modernizing federal technology, and reducing federal jobs by 75%—a plan Trump claimed could save $2 trillion. Musk, however, recently revised expectations, admitting that even $1 trillion in savings might be optimistic.Ramaswamy, known for his business acumen and conservative principles, was initially seen as a key figure in achieving these goals. However, his polarizing views and blunt communication style quickly alienated members of Trump’s inner circle.“They wanted him out before the tweet—but kicked him to the curb when that came out,” a source told Politico. Ramaswamy’s December post was viewed as the tipping point, compounding Musk’s frustrations and sealing his fate.Ramaswamy’s ouster also highlights the challenges Indian-Americans face within MAGA’s nativist factions. Despite their alignment with conservative ideals such as free markets and innovation, figures like Ramaswamy remain outsiders in a movement that often views multiculturalism as a threat. Ramaswamy has often found himself defending his own faith amongst MAGA adherents.The experience of Usha Vance, the Hindu wife of Vice President JD Vance, illustrates this tension. During Vance’s inauguration, Usha’s presence drew both admiration and crude attacks from MAGA’s fringes. Comments like “Christ is King, not some stinky Indian idol” reveal the discomfort many within the movement feel toward non-Christian identities.Ramaswamy’s unapologetic Hinduism has also drawn criticism. His references to the Bhagavad Gita are viewed by some evangelicals as antithetical to MAGA’s Christian nationalist ethos. As one commentator put it, “Ramaswamy is the perfect candidate on paper, but his Hinduism keeps him at arm’s length.”Ramaswamy is not alone in navigating MAGA’s complicated relationship with Indian-Americans. Other prominent figures include: Kash Patel , who became a hero within MAGA for his role in battling the “deep state” but remains a polarizing figure.• Dr Jay Bhattacharya, the Stanford professor who opposed COVID-19 lockdowns and emerged as a leading voice in MAGA’s pandemic skepticism. Sriram Krishnan , tapped by Trump to advise on artificial intelligence but criticized for supporting immigration reforms that MAGA’s nativists oppose.While these figures symbolize MAGA’s strategic embrace of diversity, their presence often sparks backlash among the movement’s more nativist wings.Ramaswamy’s departure from DOGE reflects broader challenges facing Trump’s administration. While DOGE’s goals are ambitious, its lack of formal authority and mounting legal challenges raise questions about its viability. Critics argue that the initiative may amount to little more than political theater.For Ramaswamy, the fallout from his ouster complicates his political aspirations. As he pivots to a gubernatorial run in Ohio, he must contend with perceptions of being sidelined by Musk and suspicions about his commitment to MAGA’s America First agenda.Musk’s influence, meanwhile, continues to grow. While some view him as a visionary capable of transforming government, others warn of the risks of concentrating so much power in a single tech billionaire. Musk’s dominance over DOGE, coupled with Trump’s reliance on him, raises concerns about a “tech oligarchy” shaping US policy.","The abrupt exit of Indian-American billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy has raised questions about the factors leading to his ouster.

Trump and Newsom exchange words upon meeting in Los Angeles

US President Donald Trump and California governor Gavin Newsom set aside their ongoing feud on Friday to discuss recovery efforts for the recent devastating wildfires in Southern California. They met face-to-face for the first time since the inauguration earlier this week and amid the wildfires that scorched thousands of acres, destroyed more than 10,000 structures, and claimed nearly 30 lives.The two leaders met on the tarmac at Los Angeles International Airport as Trump arrived to survey the damage. Newsom, waiting to greet Trump as he exited Air Force One, extended a handshake, which Trump punctuated with a trademark arm tug.""Thank you first for being here. It makes a great deal to all of us,"" Newsom told Trump during the meeting. ""We're going to need your support, we're going to need your help.""Newsom also recalled Trump's assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""You were with California during COVID, I don’t forget that,"" he added.The encounter marked the first in-person interaction between Newsom and Trump since Trump's inauguration on Monday. The meeting comes after weeks of sharp exchanges, with Trump repeatedly criticising Newsom and other Democratic leaders for the severity of wildfire damage in the state.Earlier on January 8, Trump referred to the governor as ""Gavin Newscum"" in a social media post, accusing him of mismanagement and blaming California’s fire policies for the widespread destruction. ""This is all his fault!!!"" Trump wrote.Despite these attacks, Trump struck a more cooperative tone during his visit. ""I think you’re going to see some very good progress,"" Trump said about the recovery efforts. ""We want to get the problem fixed. It's like you got hit by a bomb.""However, he also reiterated his previous criticisms of California's fire management, saying, ""We'll get it permanently fixed so it can't happen again.""","President Donald Trump and California governor Gavin Newsom met for the first time since the inauguration.

Or, for hundreds or even thousands of dollars more, you can buy a used phone with a cracked screen and dirt-filled speakers, from someone on the internet. It just depends on how much you love TikTok.When the app stopped working in the US on Saturday after Supreme Court backed a law that effectively banned it, some users deleted the app from their phones. The next day, the app started working again when President Trump said he was planning an executive order to pause enforcement of the law. But, as of Thursday, Apple and Google, which had removed TikTok from their app stores to comply with the law, had not made it available again.The uncertainty about whether the app will return to app stores has caused some people who never removed the app to view their phones like golden tickets, coveted by anyone who misses thumbing through TikTok's algorithm or had followings they can't reach after they hastily removed the app.It was not immediately clear how many people deleted TikTok and whether it will return to app stores. But people such as Piotr Gustab, 37, are seeing opportunity in the uncertainty. Gustab listed his iPhone 15 Pro with TikTok downloaded onto it for $3,000 on Facebook Marketplace. That's about three times the cost of a brand-new iPhone 16 Pro. On Thursday, he had an offer for $1,200, still more than almost every brand-new iPhone and nearly twice as much as a refurbished iPhone 15 Pro without TikTok.""UNLOCKED WITH TIKTOK,"" an ad on Poshmark reads ($3,500). ""iPhone 14 Pro UNLOCKED! W/ TikTok,"" a listing on eBay calls out ($3,000). On Facebook Marketplace, sellers include screen recordings to verify that TikTok is installed on the phone. ""This app is worth a lot,"" said Izell Malloy, 20. He said he was offered $5,700 on Facebook Marketplace for his iPhone with TikTok on it.Perhaps iPhone listings asking for $30,000 are not realistic. Even users going through the most severe TikTok withdrawals would be hard-pressed to buy a used phone for the price of a 2025 Toyota Prius. There are safer options. TikTok is still accessible on web browsers, and users on Reddit say they have found a workaround to download the app. If TikTok goes dark again, the app is ""just a piece of art.""

Trump’s complicated legacy

Vice President JD Vance: We need a culture that celebrates life at all stages

Tens of thousands of anti-abortion activists , reportedly joined by masked neo-Nazis, gathered on Friday in Washington for the 52nd annual ' March for Life ' rally. Buoyed by recent victories in restricting abortion access and US President Donald Trump 's return to the White House, the event marked a pivotal moment for the ""pro-life"" movement.The rally celebrated the group’s biggest triumph in 2022 when the conservative-majority Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, a landmark decision that had guaranteed abortion rights across the United States for nearly five decades.Trump, addressing the crowd through a pre-recorded video message, promised unwavering support for their cause during his second term, pledging to ""protect the historic gains"" made by the anti-abortion movement. ""In my second term, we will again stand proudly for families and for life,"" he declared.The rally, held on the National Mall, was attended by high-profile Republicans, including Vice President JD Vance , House speaker Mike Johnson , and Florida governor Ron DeSantis. DeSantis reinforced the movement’s ideology, calling the sanctity of life an ""enduring truth"" and the foundation of society.While the rally aimed to celebrate their achievements, it was not without controversy. Members of the far-right neo-Nazi group Patriot Front marched alongside other attendees, brandishing Christian symbols and military-style flags. The group, which espouses white supremacist conspiracy theories, sparked unease as they joined the event.The presence of the neo-Nazi group drew sharp criticism, given their history of violent demonstrations, including the infamous 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Trump’s past comments on that rally, where he claimed there were ""some very fine people on both sides,"" resurfaced, reigniting debates over his relationship with extremist groups.Organisers of the March for Life stressed that the movement's goal extends beyond changing laws to altering cultural attitudes. “We want to make abortion unthinkable,” one organiser said, underscoring their commitment to shaping the national conversation around reproductive rights .Since Roe's reversal, individual states have become battlegrounds for abortion legislation. Many conservative-led states have introduced sweeping bans, leaving nearly a third of women aged 18 to 44 living in areas where abortion is largely inaccessible, according to data from Politifact.Despite these restrictions, national polls consistently show that a majority of Americans support access to safe abortion, highlighting the divide between public opinion and legislative actions.Trump, who has claimed credit for the Supreme Court’s decision, remains a polarising figure in the anti-abortion movement. While he has described himself as the ""most pro-life president ever,"" his stance on key issues, including a federal abortion ban, has wavered.During his campaign, Trump avoided backing federal restrictions and even criticised Florida's six-week abortion ban. However, his administration’s actions, such as appointing three conservative justices instrumental in overturning Roe and pardoning anti-abortion activists jailed for clinic blockades, have cemented his legacy within the movement.As Trump embarks on his second term, his promises to support anti-abortion efforts have reignited debates on the future of reproductive rights in America. But with polls showing growing discontent over restrictive abortion laws, the movement faces challenges in reconciling its legislative victories with public opinion.The march concluded with participants heading toward the Supreme Court and US Capitol complex, a symbolic nod to the movement’s continued fight in state and federal arenas. For now, the ""pro-life"" movement is savouring its victories while preparing for the next chapter in the battle over abortion rights.","Anti-abortion activists gathered in Washington for 52nd annual'March for Life'Rally celebrated the group’s biggest triumph in 2022 when the conservative- majority Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s National Assembly approved on Thursday amendments to the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), granting govt unbridled powers to regulate and control social media platforms, including the authority to send users to prison for spreading disinformation.The bill was hastily passed after opposition lawmakers staged a walkout to denounce the law. The legislation sparked widespread protests, particularly among journalists, with critics saying the govt is seeking to further suppress freedom of speech.The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, introduced in the National Assembly on Wednesday, would establish an agency with the authority to order the immediate removal of “unlawful and offensive” content from social media, such as content critical of judges, the armed forces, parliament, or provincial assemblies. Individuals and companies who post such content may also be blocked on social media.The law requires social media platforms to register with the new Social Media Protection and Regulatory Authority, and those that do not comply may face temporary or permanent bans. The bill also makes misinformation a criminal offence punishable with three years in prison and a Pakistani Rs 2 million fine ($7,150).Govt’s decision to ratify the bill comes nearly a year after Pakistan blocked the platform ‘X’ ahead of an election that Imran Khan’s opposition party claims was rigged. ‘X’ is still restricted in the country, but many individuals use virtual private networks to get around it, much like in other countries with strict internet censorship.The law also broadens the definition of prohibited content to include material that promotes violence, bigotry, or defamation, as well as content that is harmful to national security.The legislation was passed with overwhelming support in the National Assembly, despite protests from members of the press.As the bill was introduced, journalists staged a walkout from the press gallery in protest, condemning what they called restrictions on press freedom and the potential for govt overreach in regulating online discourse.The Peca amendments also pave the way for a new social media protection tribunal to expedite cases involving online crimes, with the tribunal required to resolve cases within 90 days.Furthermore, the bill proposes the dissolution of the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) cyber crime wing, with its responsibilities transferring to the newly established National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency.Opposition leaders have voiced strong concerns over the amendments, accusing the government of using the law to suppress dissent and limit freedom of expression online. The current govt, however, maintains that the changes are necessary to safeguard the public from harmful and illegal content that could disrupt national security.","Pakistan's National Assembly approved amendments to the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) The bill was hastily passed after opposition lawmakers staged a walkout to denounce the law.

The Federal Union of Journalists president, Afzal Butt, called the law an attempt to ""suppress the media, social media and journalists.""While the government claims the law is necessary to combat the spread of misinformation and hate speech, critics argue it will be used to silence dissent and control public discourse. This move comes at a time when press freedom in Pakistan is already under increasing pressure. Journalists report facing state pressure, and many media outlets have been instructed to avoid mentioning Imran Khan by name.","Pakistan's lower house of parliament passed a new law on Thursday. The law grants sweeping powers to the government to control online content. It gives officials the power to block content deemed ""unlawful and offensive"" Spreading ""disinformation"" is now a criminal offence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117491235,imgsize-624269,width-400,resizemode-4/117491235.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's national assembly on Thursday endorsed controversial changes to the cyber laws that could include up to three years in jail and fines of Rs 2 million for spreading fake news, amid a boycott by the opposition parties and journalists present to cover the proceedings. The prevention of electronic crimes (Amendment) bill 2025 was tabled in the lower house a day ago by law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar.The bill, also called Peca in its abbreviated form, was referred to a relevant committee, which returned it to the house and minister for industries and production Rana Tanveer Hussain presented it for voting.Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers had already staged a walkout in protest against the incarceration of party founder Imran Khan. Lawmakers from the opposition Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl also opposed the bill.Reporters present in the parliament gallery to cover the proceeding also walked out to protest the bill as they considered it an infringement on the freedom of speech . The protest was organised by the parliamentary reporters association.The bill proposes a new provision, Section 26(A), to penalise the perpetrators of online ""fake news"".""Whoever intentionally disseminates, publicly exhibits, or transmits any information through any information system, that he knows or has reason to believe to be false or fake and likely to cause or create a sense of fear, panic or disorder or unrest in general public or society shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend upto three years or with fine which may extend to Rs2 million ($7,150) or with both,"" it read.It also proposes the establishment of the social media protection and regulatory authority, which would perform a range of functions related to social media such as education, awareness, training, regulation, enlistment, blocking and more.It said that anyone ""aggrieved by fake and false information"" would be able to approach the authority to remove or block access to the content in question, adding that the authority would issue orders no later than 24 hours after the request.The bill also proposes that any part of parliamentary proceedings or those of the provincial assemblies that were ordered expunged would not be streamed or made available for viewing on social media platforms in any manner, with every effort made to release a fair account of the proceedings.They further said social media platforms would maintain an effective and transparent procedure for handling complaints about unlawful or offensive online content, adding that they would also supply users with an easily recognisable, directly accessible and permanently available procedure for submitting complaints about unlawful or offensive online content.The bill additionally proposes the constitution of a social media complaint council to receive and process complaints made by aggrieved parties against violation of any provision of the cybercrime law.The Joint Action Committee (JAC), a body representing journalists' groups, including the Pakistan federal union of journalists (PFUJ) and the All Pakistan newspapers society (APNS), issued a joint statement condemning the amendment.""The joint action committee rejected any Peca amendments that are passed or approved without consultation with media bodies,"" the statement read.The JAC requested the government not to pass any amendments to the bill ""without proper consultation with all stakeholders"".Digital rights activist Farieha Aziz termed the passage an ""attempt to further control access to information and limit expression under the garb of fake news"". She added that ""the manner in which legislation is being bulldozed goes to show it is all a numbers game"".The bill will become a law if passed by the senate or the upper house in the same form as passed by the national assembly and then signed by the president.Separately, the national assembly also passed 'The Digital Nation Pakistan Bill, 2024'', moved by minister of state for information technology Shaza Khawaja.The bill aims to create a digital identity for citizens to centralise social, economic and governance data and to provide for the transformation of Pakistan into a digital nation, enabling a digital society, digital economy and digital governance.However, the PTI criticised the bill, saying that it may compromise the data of citizens.",Pakistan's national assembly has endorsed controversial changes to the cyber laws. The changes could include up to three years in jail and fines of Rs 2 million for spreading fake news.

Pakistan Drought: Pakistan drought dents winter harvest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-drought-dents-winter-harvest/articleshow/117485910.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)

LAHORE: A winter drought is ravaging crops in Pakistan's breadbasket, farmers said Thursday, with the region parched by a 40 per cent drop in rainfall.Pakistan, home to more than 240 million people, ranks among the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which scientists say is making extreme weather events more common and more severe.The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) says the farming heartland of eastern Punjab province saw 42 per cent less rainfall than normal between the start of September and mid-January.""The lack of rains has had a major financial impact on farmers, whether they have a big holding or a small one,"" Fruit and Vegetable Exporters Association Punjab chairman Malik Asghar told AFP.""Potato is a staple in my area. The average is very low this year. Usually, we could easily get 100 to 120 sacks per acre. This winter we have only gotten about 60 sacks per acre.""The agriculture sector contributes nearly a quarter of Pakistan's GDP and employs 37 per cent of the national labour force, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization.But Asghar said many small farmers ""were already giving up"" and looking for employment elsewhere.""This spell of dry weather will have a very adverse reaction on them,"" he said.Sindh, Pakistan's most urbanised province located in the south, witnessed rainfall 52 per cent below normal levels according to the PMD, while Balochistan in the west saw a 45 per cent drop.""Mild drought"" prevailed in most of Punjab, all of Sindh and around half of Balochistan in January according to the PMD, which predicts rapidly onsetting ""flash droughts"" in the warmer months to come.Wheat farmer Ishfaq Ahmad Jatt said his harvest in the Multan area of central Punjab has been ""badly affected"" by the dearth of rain.""Even five years ago we used to get winter rains for a week at a time. They were light rains but they were enough for us,"" the 45-year-old said.""If it doesn't rain soon, you can expect production to drop by as much as 50 per cent.""Pakistan generally relies on water from the Indus river which bisects the country from north to south, where it empties into the Arabian Sea.However, analysts say a fast-growing population, climate change, poor resource management and an over-reliance on a single water source are all spurring scarcity.The drought comes less than three years since record monsoon rains caused devastating floods that left nearly a third of the country under water, including the major agricultural areas of Sindh and Punjab.The country also suffers from choking smog in the winter season, caused by poor quality vehicle fuel and farmers burning off crop remnants, with cold weather trapping pollution close to the ground.Rain typically offers temporary reprieve by dampening down airborne particles, but the dry weather has seen Punjab province blanketed by smog with hazardous health effects.","A winter drought is ravaging crops in Pakistan's breadbasket, farmers say.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan senators are demanding an apology from billionaire Elon Musk , a lawmaker told AFP on Thursday, accusing him of "" anti-Pakistan propaganda "" as he seeks regulatory approval for his Starlink service in the country.Musk's Starlink satellite internet service has applied for a licence to operate in Pakistan but is awaiting clearance before users will be allowed to log on.A senate committee on information technology and telecommunications met Wednesday to hear updates from officials assessing his application.But committee chair Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan told AFP ""Several senators denounced"" Musk's ""anti-Pakistani propaganda"" in recent comments he made on his social media platform X.Musk has repeatedly highlighted claims that men of Pakistani origin were responsible for a spate of historic rape cases targeting mostly white girls in England.""It was said that approval should be given on condition of his apology,"" Khan told AFP.""We are not saying it should be a pre-condition but it was a part of the discussion and we can only give our recommendations to the government,"" she added.Musk began launching attacks against the UK government this month after it resisted calls for a national inquiry into the historic abuse cases.In Rotherham, a town of 265,000 inhabitants, a gang drugged, raped and sexually exploited at least 1,400 girls over a 16-year period from 1997, a public inquiry concluded in 2014.A series of court cases eventually led to the conviction of dozens of men, mostly of South Asian origin. The victims were vulnerable, mostly white, girls.An Indian lawmaker made a post on 8 January saying: ""They aren't ASIAN Grooming Gangs but PAKISTANI grooming gangs. Why should Asians take the fall for one absolute rogue nation?""Musk commented with a message saying: ""True"".The historic abuse cases regularly prompt debate in the UK, where some claim they are used to enflame Islamaphobia while others say they are being quashed to prevent debate.Whilst Musk's electric vehicle and space ventures made him a billionaire, he has recently emerged as a political figure affiliated with newly inaugurated President Donald Trump Trump has tasked Musk, the world's richest man, with slashing billions of dollars of federal government spending as head of a new ""department of government efficiency "".","Pakistan senators demand an apology from billionaire Elon Musk.

Pakistani government proposes sweeping controls on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-government-proposes-sweeping-controls-on-social-media/articleshow/117485419.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's opposition said on Thursday the government is seeking to further suppress freedom of speech a day after it proposed sweeping controls on social media that could include blocking platforms and sending users to prison for spreading disinformation. The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act , introduced in the National Assembly by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on Wednesday, would create an agency with the power to order ""unlawful and offensive content"" blocked from social media, and to ban individuals and organizations from social mediaSocial media platforms would be required to register with the new Social Media Protection and Regulatory Authority, and those failing to comply with the law could face temporary or permanent bans.The law also makes spreading disinformation a criminal offense, punishable by three years in prison and a fine of 2 million rupees (USD 7,150).The move comes nearly a year after Pakistan blocked the X platform ahead of an election that the opposition party of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan says was rigged. X is still blocked in the country, although many people use virtual private networks to access it, like in other countries with tight internet controls.Khan has a huge following on social media, especially X, where supporters frequently circulate demands for his release. Khan has been behind bars since 2023, when he was arrested for graft. Khan's party also uses social media to organize demonstrations.The leader of the opposition denounced the proposed legislation, saying it was aimed at further suppressing freedom of speech. Omar Ayub Khan, who is not related to the imprisoned former premier, said the bill could ""lay a foundation for the suppression of voices advocating for constitutional rights"".The new agency would be able to order the immediate blocking of unlawful content targeting judges, the armed forces, parliament or provincial assemblies. The law also forbids uploading remarks from parliament that have been struck from the record.Pakistani media has faced growing censorship in recent years. Journalists have said they face state pressure to avoid using Imran Khan's name, and most TV stations have begun referring to him only as the ""founder of the PTI"" party.Human rights defenders and journalists' unions have vowed to oppose the law, but with the government holding a majority, its passage is all but assured.Afzal Butt, president of the Federal Union of Journalists, said the law was an attempt to suppress the media, social media and journalists.The government says the law is necessary to limit the spread of disinformation.","Pakistani government proposes sweeping controls on social media.

ISLAMABAD: Zalmay Khalilzad , the former US special envoy for Afghanistan during Donald Trump’s first term as president, said on Monday that Afghan deputy foreign minister Shir Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai ’s remarks calling upon his government to scrap the ban on education for women was a “promising development”.Stanikzai’s rare public criticism coincided with ongoing international pressure on Afghanistan ’s leaders to lift restrictions on women’s access to public life in general and to allow girls to attend secondary schools and beyond. He made a direct public appeal to the country’s reclusive leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, to lift the ban and called the exclusion of girls from education an “injustice” on part of the Islamic Emirate against half of Afghanistan’s 40-mn population.“The whole world has a problem with us on this issue. They criticise us for it. But the path we have taken is a matter of our own liking, not the Sharia,” Stanikzai said.Welcoming the stance, Khalilzad highlighted that Stanikzai is an important IEA official who played a key role in the Doha negotiations . As special envoy for Afghanistan, Khalilzad was lead negotiator during the Doha talks.He also asked Afghan religious scholars and leaders of the Islamic Emirate who privately oppose the ban on girls’ education to make their opposition public. Further, he emphasised that schools and universities should be reopened by the beginning of the new solar year, in late March.After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021, Akhundzada had imposed his strict interpretation of Sharia law through dozens of decrees, mainly restricting girls’ access to education beyond the sixth grade and banning the majority of women from working or participating in public life.Last August, the Taliban announced a new law on the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice, which bars women from traveling or using public transportation without a male guardian. The law requires women and girls to cover their faces in public and prohibits them from singing in public or letting their voices be heard outside the house.","Afghan deputy foreign minister Shir Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai called upon his government to scrap the ban on education for women.

ISLAMABAD: The first commercial flight landed at Pakistan’s new Gwadar International Airport on Monday following a months-long delay in the opening of the Beijing-funded facility in volatile Balochistan province.The airport’s opening was postponed from Aug 14 to the end of 2024 due to a security review sparked by a series of deadly attacks by separatist militants in Balochistan, in Pakistan’s southwest. Then, on Jan 10, the airport was due to open, but this was again delayed.“The $246-million Chinese-backed project is expected to grow into one of Pakistan’s biggest airports and serve both domestic and international travel,” the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA) said in a statement.“Pakistan achieved a landmark moment in its aviation history on Monday as the first commercial flight successfully landed at the new Gwadar International Airport,” the statement read, adding the new airport is poised to play a pivotal role in connecting Pakistan to global markets and facilitating trade, tourism, and economic development.PIA Flight PK-503 departed from Karachi at 9.50 am and touched down at the airport at 11.15 am, carrying 46 passengers. In a video shared by PAA, the PIA flight was seen being greeted by a traditional water salute by water bowsers as it landed.China has pledged more than $65 billion for infrastructure, energy, and other projects in Pakistan under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ). As part of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Pakistan is also creating a deep-water port near the new Gwadar airport, a joint venture between Pakistan, Oman, and China that is nearing completion. Chinese people and projects have been frequently attacked in the past by separatists who view Beijing as a foreign invader trying to gain control of impoverished but mineral-rich Balochistan, the site of a decades-long insurgency.Recent attacks, including one in Oct 2024 in which two Chinese workers were killed in a suicide bombing in Karachi, have forced Beijing to publicly criticise Pakistan for security lapses. In recent months, the media has widely reported that China wants its own security forces on the ground to protect its nationals and projects, a demand Islamabad has long resisted.","PIA Flight PK-503 departed from Karachi at 9.50 am and touched down at the airport at 11.15 am, carrying 46 passengers.

Inauguration ceremony

Economic and strategic significance

Challenges in Balochistan

Future prospects

Pakistan’s largest airport, funded and constructed by China in the restive Balochistan province , officially became operational on Monday, marking a significant milestone in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative.The inaugural ceremony at Gwadar International Airport witnessed the arrival of a Pakistan International Airlines flight from Karachi. Defense Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif and Chinese officials were present, celebrating the $230 million project, which has a capacity to handle 400,000 passengers annually.The event followed the virtual inauguration of the airport earlier this year by Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.Built under Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the airport aims to bolster trade and attract international investment. It complements the deep-sea port in Gwadar, positioning the coastal city as a key regional trade hub.“The airport will play a crucial role in improving the economy, fostering international investment, and bringing prosperity to Balochistan,” Asif stated during the ceremony.The airport, spanning 4,300 acres, can accommodate various aircraft, including ATR 72, Airbus A-300, and Boeing 747, for both domestic and international routes, according to the Ministry of Planning and Development.The project’s completion faced delays due to increased attacks by separatists in Balochistan, who oppose Chinese investments and accuse them of economic exploitation. The region has long been plagued by an insurgency demanding greater autonomy or independence.Ethnic Baloch groups have criticized the development projects, claiming they benefit outsiders while leaving local communities marginalized.Despite the challenges, Gwadar International Airport symbolizes deeper Pakistan-China ties and reflects China’s strategic interest in the region. The airport is expected to enhance connectivity, trade, and tourism while contributing to the broader goals of the Belt and Road Initiative.As the largest airport in Pakistan by area, the Gwadar facility is set to become a vital link in regional and international trade, though its success depends on addressing ongoing security and political concerns in the province.","Gwadar International Airport is Pakistan’s largest airport, funded and constructed by China in the restive Balochistan province.

ISLAMABAD: A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab’s Sialkot district, Pakistani media reported on Saturday.The place was built by Chaudhry Zafarullah Khan , Pakistan’s first foreign minister and an Ahmadi by faith, in his native town of Daska, Sialkot. A renowned lawyer in British India, he was a crucial champion for the Ahmadi cause in significant trials.This historical structure was razed on Jan 16, two days after local authorities claimed that an extension of the structure was illegal as it encroached 13 feet onto a public road, a claim rejected by community members.Despite this, Amir Mahmood, spokesperson for the marginalised community, said they had complied with the govt notice and a wall was constructed on the inner side on Jan 15, but the area’s assistant commissioner, accompanied by police, proceeded with the demolition the next day and flattened the entire structure. “It is clear that using the illegal encroachments as an excuse, the administration targeted and demolished the Ahmadi community’s place of worship,” Mahmood said, adding the structure had not been altered or extended since its original construction by Khan’s family before Partition. He blamed the local administration for continuously targeting the community’s properties and ignoring their grievances.The operation lasted from 7pm until 11pm, and electricity to the place of worship and neighbouring areas was also cut off. The action was not strictly administrative as during the entire time, locals said, a number of people had gathered chanting provocative slogans against the persecuted community. This was the latest in a series of actions targeting Ahmadis. According to data, at least 22 of their places of worship were destroyed across Punjab in 2024.","A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab.

The Taliban on Friday rejected a court move to arrest two of their top officials for persecuting women, accusing the court of baseless accusations and misbehaviour.The International Criminal Court 's chief prosecutor Karim Khan announced Thursday he had requested arrest warrants for two top Taliban officials, including the leader Hibatullah Akhundzada.Since they took back control of the country in 2021, the Taliban have barred women from jobs, most public spaces and education beyond sixth grade.A foreign ministry statement condemned the ICC request.The court was making baseless accusations against Afghanistan's leadership at a time of peace in the country and people had ""breathed a sigh of relief.""The ministry alleged the court had turned a blind eye to decades of war and crimes against humanity committed by foreign forces and their allies. ""This misbehaviour further destroys the weak credibility of the said structure (ICC) and makes its status and position at the international level completely meaningless,"" the statement said.The ministry warned the court against imposing its interpretation of human rights and ignoring the religious and national values of others.Earlier Friday, an Afghan women's group had hailed the court's move.The Afghan Women's Movement for Justice and Awareness celebrated the ICC decision and called it a ""great historical achievement.""""We consider this achievement a symbol of the strength and will of Afghan women and believe this step will start a new chapter of accountability and justice in the country,"" the group said.An official in the former Western-backed administration said the Taliban leadership was likely to exploit the decision for propaganda purposes by framing it as proof of their strong faith and resilience.""They may tell their followers that their beliefs are so powerful they have provoked the collective opposition of global powers,"" Mohammad Halim Fidai said on the X platform. Fidai was a governor of four provinces before the Taliban takeover in August 2021 and now lives outside Afghanistan. ""This decision could inadvertently serve as a badge of honor or credibility for them.""Also Friday, the UN mission in Afghanistan said it was a ""tragedy and travesty"" that girls remain deprived of education.""It has been 1,225 days - soon to be four years - since authorities imposed a ban that prevents girls above the age of 12 from attending school,"" said the head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, Roza Otunbayeva.

Bangladesh says it won't bail out factories linked to Sheikh Hasina,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-says-it-wont-bail-out-factories-linked-to-sheikh-hasina/articleshow/117520609.cms,"Former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina (Credits: ANI)

DHAKA: Bangladesh's interim government has said it will not bail out garment factories linked to a senior ally of autocratic ex-premier Sheikh Hasina , a move set to throw thousands out of work.Beximco, the South Asian nation's largest conglomerate, operates more than a dozen garment factories collectively employing more than 40,000 people in Bangladesh's key export industry.Its detained co-founder Salman F Rahman was a close adviser to Hasina, who fled the country in August following the student-led revolution that toppled her government.Work at Beximco's factories has since ground to a halt and employees have staged protests demanding the caretaker government come to their rescue.""We have no other option but to fully shut down the factories as the government cannot manage them,"" Sakhawat Hossain, the interim government's labour minister, told a news conference late on Thursday.""The workers' request to nationalise the factories is also not feasible,"" he said, urging workers to seek employment elsewhere.The government has blamed Beximco's monumental unpaid loan balance as the reason behind its refusal to take over the conglomerate.Bangladesh's central bank has valued the firm's outstanding loans and liabilities at more than $4.1 billion.""The government considered resuming operations at the factories, viewing them as national assets with significant involvement in employment and exports,"" commerce minister Sheikh Bashir Uddin told reporters.""Despite the substantial amount of defaulted loans, we approached the issue with compassion. However, we have not received sufficient cooperation from the owners.""Rahman was taken into custody shortly after Hasina fled to neighbouring India, where she has remained since her ouster.Abdul Qaiyum, a senior officer of the Beximco Industrial Park, said the conglomerate's bank accounts had been frozen, preventing work at the factories.""We need some loans,"" he told AFP.Beximco had requested a bridging loan of around $33 million to continue operating, according to Bangladeshi newspaper reports.Workers at the firm's factories took to the streets on Wednesday to demand the government help save their jobs, vandalising numerous vehicles in their protest.Sakhawat said the government had paid the salaries of Beximco workers up to the end of December and would ensure they receive other benefits.""Those involved in vandalism will face consequences,"" he said.","Bangladesh's interim government will not bail out garment factories linked to a senior ally of autocratic ex-premier Sheikh Hasina.

Tackling waste on the snow capped peaks

Nepal has announced a 36 per cent increase in permit fees for climbing Mount Everest, raising the total amount from $11,000 to $15,000. This decision comes along with a set of strict new measures aimed at addressing garbage pollution at the world's highest peak.The new regulations, which include increased royalties for climbers and mandatory waste management protocols, will come into effect from September 1 later this year. The last revision to Everest climbing fees was implemented in 2015.Under the updated rules, the fee for foreign climbers attempting Everest via the popular southern route during the spring season (March-May) will increase from $11,000 to $15,000 per person.For the autumn season (September-November), fees will rise from $5,500 to $7,500.Meanwhile, winter (December-February) and monsoon (June-August) permits will cost $3,750, up from $2,750.The decision has also impacted Nepali climbers, with their autumn royalty fees doubling from NPR 75,000 to NPR 150,000.The validity of climbing permits has also been shortened from 75 days to 55 days, a move aimed at better managing expeditions, as per the Kathmandu Post. However, expeditions booked for spring 2025 will not be affected.To combat the growing problem of pollution, climbers will now be required to bring their human waste back to base camp using biodegradable bags for proper disposal. While toilet facilities exist at base camps, higher camps often lack such infrastructure, and unsustainable practices, such as digging pits or leaving waste behind, have led to significant environmental damage.The revised rules also prohibit climbers from bringing items not listed in their permit documentation issued by the department of tourism. This is part of a broader initiative to reduce waste, which includes efforts by local authorities to enforce the use of biodegradable waste bags for peaks above 8,000 metres.During last year’s climbing season, nearly 2,000 people gathered at Everest Base Camp, with 421 permits issued to fee-paying climbers. The season saw around 600 successful summits and an estimated 100 tonnes of waste was generated.During the last spring season, the local government under Khumbhu Pasand Lhamu rural municipality enforced the use of biodegradable waste bags and ended up selling 1,700 bags. This move has now been mandated for climbers scaling peaks that are more than 8,000 meters of height.Indu Ghimire, a joint secretary at Nepal's tourism ministry, emphasised the need for better waste management, enhanced safety for high-altitude workers, and increased government revenue as key goals of the new policy.She further added that the new regulations would be concentrating on garbage management, improving social security for high-altitude workers and boosting government revenue.","Nepal has announced a 36 per cent increase in permit fees for climbing Mount Everest, raising the total amount from $11,000 to $15,000.

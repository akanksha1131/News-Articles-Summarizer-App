Palisades fire burns homes in wealthy Los Angeles neighborhood,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/palisades-fire-burns-homes-in-wealthy-los-angeles-neighborhood/articleshow/117039189.cms,"A residential neighborhood on fire in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles. (Philip Cheung/The New York Times)

A fast-moving wildfire ripped through an affluent area of Los Angeles, destroying homes and forcing thousands of people to evacuate as firefighters warned that conditions would worsen overnight.About 30,000 people were ordered to leave their homes on Tuesday after a brush fire erupted in the Pacific Palisades community , causing panic and traffic gridlock, with some abandoning their cars on narrow hillside roads. The blaze reached and jumped the Pacific Coast Highway at Will Rogers State Beach, according to KABC Channel 7 Eyewitness News.California Governor Gavin Newsom said “many structures” had been destroyed by the flames. “By no stretch of the imagination are we out of the woods,” he said, adding that firefighters were anticipating other blazes to erupt throughout the region that was being raked by severe winds.The blaze was at almost 3,000 acres and remains uncontained. More than 13,000 structures are under threat, Kristin Crowley, the chief of the Los Angeles Fire Department, said at a press conference. No injuries have been reported.The US National Weather Service has issued red flag warnings that extend from central California’s coast to the US-Mexico border. Beverly Hills, Hollywood Hills, Malibu and the densely-populated San Fernando Valley are facing a “particularly dangerous situation” — the most severe fire alert level.Widespread and damaging gales are expected to worsen overnight, with isolated wind gusts in mountains and foothills reaching as strong as 100 miles per hour (161 kilometers), according to the National Weather Service.Winds are expected to peak Tuesday through early Wednesday afternoon, with the strongest gusts expected to scour the San Fernando Valley and the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. Weather forecasters have told residents to expect downed trees and power lines, as well as widespread power outages.Anthony Marrone, fire chief for Los Angeles County, warned that it’ll be very difficult to use aerial resources to fight the fire at night if the winds pick up because water and fire retardant becomes ineffective.“Flying during the night is more dangerous than flying during the day,” he said.The blaze erupted as Southern California braced for what forecasters called a “life-threatening and destructive” Santa Ana wind storm that could last for days. The region has received almost no rain for months, leaving grass and brush primed to burn.During the day on Tuesday, Los Angeles residents found themselves witnessing scenes that were befitting of a disaster film.From the Venice Beach Boardwalk, a fire-fighting plane could be seen skimming above the ocean, scooping up water and returning to the Palisades to drop it. Surfers bobbed in the Pacific, watching the smoke from afar.In Santa Monica, cyclists and runners on a beachfront bike path stopped in their tracks as the piercing blare of emergency alerts burst from their cell phones. The ridge line of the Santa Monica Mountains was almost completely obscured by smoke.The fire threatened the Getty Villa, a museum with a collection of Greek and Roman antiquities. “Some trees and vegetation on site have burned, but staff and the collection remain safe,” Katherine E. Fleming, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust, said in a statement.Longtime Venice resident Mike Kerns, 62, was walking out of a doctor’s appointment in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood at 11 a.m. and noticed a plume of smoke coming from the mountain above. About 10 minutes later, he looked back at the plume and saw the whole mountain below it engulfed.“It was like a movie,” Kerns said. “Like the end of the world.”Evacuation orders were issued for east Malibu and the entire Pacific Palisades neighborhood — where the median home sells for $3.4 million, according to Zillow.Edison International’s Southern California utility — the largest in the region — shut off electricity to about 17,700 homes and businesses in an effort to prevent wildfires. The company said it may need to cut power to an additional 438,000 customers if Santa Ana winds become exceptionally strong.The municipal electric utility, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said around 28,000 customers are without power as of 5 p.m. local time.The winds are expected to weaken somewhat starting Wednesday afternoon, but may not die down completely until Saturday at the earliest, according to the weather service.“Hell of a way to start the New Year,” Newsom said at the Tuesday afternoon press conference. “There is no fire season, it’s a fire year,” he added.","About 30,000 people were ordered to leave their homes on Tuesday after a brush fire erupted in the Pacific Palisades community.

'Snowball’s chance in hell': Trudeau rejects Trump’s call for Canada-US merger,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/snowballs-chance-in-hell-trudeau-rejects-trumps-call-for-canada-us-merger/articleshow/117038378.cms,"Outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that there is ""a snowball's chance in hell"" of Canada ever merging with the United States in response to US President-elect Donald Trump's provocative call to use ""economic force"" to achieve his ambitious, though unlikely, plan of annexing Canada.The tension escalated after Trump, in a press conference following his election victory, suggested that Canada could become the 51st state. ""You get rid of that artificially drawn line and you take a look at what that looks like,"" Trump said, adding that such a merger would improve national security, given that the US already protects Canada.Trudeau, however responded on X, ""There isn't a snowball's chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States.""He also pointed to the strong bilateral ties between the two nations, noting that trade and security cooperation are essential to both countries' prosperity. ""Workers and communities in both our countries benefit from being each other's biggest trading and security partner,"" Trudeau said.Foreign minister Melanie Joly accused Trump of ""a complete lack of understanding"" of Canada. ""Our economy is strong. Our people are strong. We will never back down in the face of threats,"" Joly added in her post.Trump's provocative comments extended beyond Canada, with the incoming president threatening military action to secure the Panama Canal and Greenland. The US president-elect also reiterated his plan to impose a 25% tariff on Canadian imports when he assumes office on January 20. This move, experts warn, could devastate Canada's economy, as it relies heavily on trade with the United States, sending approximately 75% of its exports south of the border.While Trump distanced himself from military options, suggesting instead that ""economic force"" would be the tool for achieving his vision.The verbal clash comes amidst Trudeau announcing his resignation as Canada’s Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party, marking the end of nearly a decade at the helm of Canadian politics.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there is ""a snowball's chance in hell"" of Canada ever merging with the United States.

Ex-soldier who exploded Tesla Cybertruck used ChatGPT to plan attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ex-soldier-who-exploded-tesla-cybertruck-used-chatgpt-to-plan-attack/articleshow/117038205.cms,"Nearly a week after the New Year’s Day explosion outside the Trump International Hotel, Las Vegas police disclosed that the decorated army soldier Matthew Livelsberger who carried out the attack had used generative AI, including ChatGPT, in planning criminal acts.Las Vegas police disclosed that his writings indicated no intent to harm others. However, his use of AI tools to gather information for the attack marks a troubling first.Las Vegas metropolitan police department Sheriff Kevin McMahill described the use of generative AI in the attack as a ""game-changer”.""This is the first incident that I’m aware of on US soil where ChatGPT was utilised to help an individual build a particular device,"" McMahill said during a press conference.An investigation into Livelsberger’s ChatGPT search history revealed that he had sought information on explosive targets, ammunition speed, and the legality of fireworks in Arizona.OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, responded to the incident in a statement, asserting its commitment to responsible AI use. “ChatGPT provided only publicly available information and warned against harmful or illegal activities. We are cooperating with law enforcement to support their investigation,” the statement read.Livelsberger’s writings and actions suggest the explosion was intended as a dramatic “wake-up call” for what he perceived as the nation’s societal and political troubles. A journal titled “Surveillance Log”, recovered by investigators, showed he believed he was under law enforcement surveillance despite having no criminal record or FBI tracking. In his notes, he expressed concerns about being labeled a terrorist and insisted he had no intention of causing harm to others.During his drive to Las Vegas, Livelsberger stopped to refuel the Cybertruck with racing-grade fuel, which later dripped from the vehicle. The truck, laden with 60 pounds of pyrotechnic material and 70 pounds of birdshot, exploded after a flash believed to be the firearm he used to end his life ignited the fuel vapor.Seven individuals sustained minor injuries in the blast, but the Trump hotel suffered virtually no damage.Law enforcement also disclosed the existence of a six-page document in Livelsberger’s possession, which has not been made public as it may contain classified material. Investigators are still reviewing a laptop, smartphone, and smartwatch found at the scene.Livelsberger had reportedly considered alternative targets, including the Grand Canyon’s glass skywalk, but changed his plans for reasons yet unknown. His letters reflected deep political and societal grievances, touching on issues such as the war in Ukraine and the perceived decline of the United States.In one note, Livelsberger urged Americans to “rally around” President-elect Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, emphasising that he bore no ill will toward Trump. Instead, he described his act as a means to “cleanse” his mind of the burdens of war and the lives he had taken.","Las Vegas police disclosed that Matthew Livelsberger had used generative AI, including ChatGPT, in planning criminal acts.

Aftershocks and historical seismic activity

A powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.1 struck the remote Tibetan plateau near the Nepal border on Tuesday, leaving at least 126 dead and over 180 injured in its wake, news agency AFP reported. The tremor, which hit Tingri County in Tibet's Xigaze City , caused buildings to collapse, roads to fracture, and sent goods tumbling off supermarket shelves, sparking panic across the region. Dozens of aftershocks followed, further complicating rescue operations.Footage captured in Shigatse showed shoppers fleeing as goods toppled, while rescue workers scoured mounds of debris in a desperate hunt for survivors. China’s ministry of emergency management confirmed at least 1,000 homes were damaged, leaving streets littered with rubble and cars crushed under fallen debris.The earthquake struck at 9.05 am local time, at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). Its epicentre was in Tingri County, a sparsely populated area with just under 7,000 residents across 27 villages. Reports indicate significant damage to infrastructure, with authorities deploying over 3,000 rescuers and activating emergency relief measures.As rescue operations continue, the death toll stands at 126, with more than 180 injured. Many remain trapped under rubble, while freezing temperatures and ongoing aftershocks complicate rescue efforts. Shigatse, one of Tibet's holiest cities, suffered significant damage, reminiscent of its plight during the 2015 Nepal earthquake Chinese President Xi Jinping called for “all-out efforts” to rescue trapped residents, minimise casualties, and secure shelter for displaced families. The central government dispatched 22,000 disaster relief items, including winter supplies like tents and quilts, to the region, which experiences harsh winters at altitudes exceeding 4,000 metres.In Nepal, the tremors were strongly felt in the capital, Kathmandu, 230 kilometres away, and other northern districts, forcing residents to flee to open spaces. Though no fatalities were reported in Nepal, minor damage to buildings was recorded, particularly in high-altitude areas like Solukhumbu near Mount Everest.Approximately 50 aftershocks were recorded within hours, with magnitudes reaching up to 4.5. The Tibetan plateau, situated at the collision zone of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, is highly prone to earthquakes. Past disasters in the region include the devastating 2015 earthquake that killed nearly 9,000 people in Nepal and caused significant damage in Tibet.Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama expressed condolences, saying he was ""deeply saddened"" by the loss of life and destruction. Meanwhile, the Chinese military deployed drones and air support to assess the disaster zone, with Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing overseeing relief efforts on-site.","A magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit Tibet on Tuesday, causing severe damage in Tingri County.

The bigger picture

In a candid interview with LBC’s Tom Swarbrick, Errol Musk , father of billionaire Elon Musk, had a simple message for critics: stop listening to his son’s tweets. Errol’s remarks come after Elon Musk waded into UK politics , accusing Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of failing to tackle grooming gangs during his tenure as Director of Public Prosecutions—a claim that drew sharp rebukes from British leaders.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer wasn’t holding back, calling Elon “desperate for attention” and accusing him of spreading lies and “whipping up intimidation.” Starmer said online attacks, particularly those aimed at safeguarding minister Jess Phillips, crossed a line.Errol, however, seemed unimpressed by his son’s foray into British political discourse. “He’s just a person,” he said. “The fact that he has money or something, he’s a billionaire or something to that effect... Tell him to get lost.”But the elder Musk wasn’t all criticism. He defended Elon’s interest in the UK, citing a deep familial connection to England. “I took him there when he was six. He even celebrated his 30th birthday in England by renting a castle for a week,” he reminisced.Despite his affection for the UK, Errol Musk warned of a “draconian” trend in British politics, adding, “If you’re a student of history, and I am, you’d realise what’s going on there.”Meanwhile, Starmer slammed Musk’s online behavior, particularly his support for jailed far-right activist Tommy Robinson. Starmer said such figures aren’t interested in justice, accusing Robinson and his supporters of promoting street violence rather than protecting victims.Starmer praised Jess Phillips’ dedication to safeguarding victims of sexual abuse, saying, “Jess has done a thousand times more than they’ve even dreamt about.”Home Secretary Yvette Cooper highlighted progress in tackling child sexual exploitation , noting a 25% increase in arrests made by a police taskforce last year. She credited the Conservative government’s efforts, particularly through advanced analytics programs targeting organized exploitation networks.Labour MP Paul Waugh added a sobering note, condemning those who have treated child rape as a “political game” rather than an “appalling crime.”As the political sparring continues, one thing is clear: Elon Musk’s tweets have stirred the pot in UK politics, much to the chagrin—and occasional amusement—of his father.","Errol Musk, father of billionaire Elon Musk, had a simple message for critics: stop listening to his son’s tweets. “The fact that he has money or something, he's a billionaire or something to that effect...

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Poll What’s Your Opinion on Merging the US with Its Neighboring Countries? No, It Would Lead to Political Complications Yes, it Could Boost Economic and Political Power

Make America Great Again isn't just a political or economic slogan. Contours of a ""Greater America,"" a geographical and cartographic entity began to take shape on Monday, at least in the public sphere, after US President-elect Donald Trump in all seriousness urged Canada to merge with the United States and renewed the idea of buying Greenland from Denmark.As if to demonstrate he is not joking or trolling, Trump also revealed that his son Don Jr will be traveling to Greenland on Tuesday. ""I am hearing that the people of Greenland are “MAGA.” My son, Don Jr, and various representatives, will be traveling there to visit some of the most magnificent areas and sights. Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our Nation. We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside World,"" he posted on his social media platform.In a separate post, he also invited Canada to merge with the United States, saying if it did so, ""there would be no Tariffs, taxes would go way down, and they would be TOTALLY SECURE from the threat of the Russian and Chinese Ships that are constantly surrounding them.""""Many people in Canada LOVE being the 51st State. The United States can no longer suffer the massive Trade Deficits and Subsidies that Canada needs to stay afloat. Justin Trudeau knew this, and resigned,"" Trump wrote hours after Trudeau, whom he has often taunted, resigned.""Together, what a great Nation it would be!!!"" Trump declared, while also invoking MAGA in the case of Greenland in a message that read ""I am hearing that the people of Greenland are “MAGA”... MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!""A geographical entity that adds Canada and Greenland to the United States would create a Northern Hemispheric nation of nearly 22 million square kilometers larger than Russia, which it would face across the Arctic north pole. Russia is currently the world's largest country of approximately 17 million sq km.Trump's MAGA acolytes talked up the idea, including posting videos of a Greenlander disgruntled with the territory's current affiliation with Denmark and wanting Washington to buy out Greenland. “The people of Greenland should decide their future and I think they want to be part of America!” Trump surrogate Elon Musk said on X, formerly Twitter.But leaders in both Greenland and Canada scoffed at the proposal. Greenland is “not for sale and will never be for sale,” Prime Minister Múte Egede, the territory's prime minister said, despite his stand of pressing for independence from Denmark. Aaja Chemnitz, another Greenlandic politician, expressed disbelief that there are people who “believe that happiness will be achieved if we become American citizens.”Canadians too have pushed back at the idea. Even Pierre Poilievre, leader of Canada’s Conservative party more aligned with Trump Republicans, said last week that his message to incoming President Trump is that ""first and foremost Canada will never be the 51st state of the U.S.""While Trump's stab at folding Canada into the United States is a relatively new idea, his bid to buy Greenland first surfaced during his first term when he is said to have commissioned a feasibility study. According to accounts in the book “The Divider: Trump in the White House, 2017-2021,” members of his team, including then National Security Adviser John Bolton and his aide Fiona Hill, engaged in secret talks with Denmark and produced an options memo that included ideas like an enhanced security arrangement but not outright purchase or leasing that Trump was keen on.","US President-elect Donald Trump in all seriousness urged Canada to merge with the United States and renewed the idea of buying Greenland from Denmark.

A swipe at Mexico and tariff threats

Trudeau’s resignation sparks merger talk

Historic waters, bold claims

In a statement as audacious as it was provocative, President-elect Donald Trump declared on Tuesday his intention to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America.” The announcement, accompanied by criticisms of Mexico’s trade and immigration policies, has already stirred controversy on both sides of the border.“We’re going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America,” Trump told reporters. “What a beautiful name. And it’s appropriate. It’s appropriate. Mexico has to stop allowing millions of people to pour into our country.”Trump asserted that the US does “most of the work there” and claimed the gulf “belongs” to America. The Republican leader added that an official announcement would come “at a future date pretty soon.”The comments were part of Trump’s broader critique of Mexico, which he labeled “a very dangerous place, essentially run by the cartels.” He also reiterated his long-standing grievances about the US’s trade deficit with both Mexico and Canada, threatening to impose steep tariffs on both countries.“And we’re going to put very serious tariffs on Mexico and Canada ,” Trump said, accusing Canada of being a drug trafficking route. “The drugs that are coming through are at record numbers.”Trump’s remarks didn’t stop with Mexico. He floated the idea of a US-Canada merger following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s resignation on Monday. “Canada... they come through Canada too,” he said, alluding to drug routes, before suggesting a potential unification of the two nations.The Gulf of Mexico, a body of water spanning over half a million square miles, has been recognized on European maps since the 1500s. Trump’s proposal to rename it has sparked criticism from historians and foreign policy experts, who note that such a move would likely face significant international backlash.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo and outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have both spoken with Trump about his tariff threats in recent months. Neither leader has commented on the proposed renaming or merger suggestion, but political analysts predict that Trump’s statements could further strain North American relations .With his inauguration just weeks away, Trump’s comments have set the stage for a contentious start to his administration.","US President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America” He also threatened to impose steep tariffs on Mexico and Canada.

China’s winter surge of flu-like HMPV cases puts nations on edge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/hmpv-cases-in-china-hmpv-symptoms-covid-19-flu-like-hmpv-cases/articleshow/117022356.cms,"The new attention on HMPV — just one among a host of germs that causes the common cold — is likely due to improved virus detection capabilities in China and other countries.

Poll Do You Think HMPV Cases Will Increase Globally? No, Containable Yes, Likely to Spread

China’s winter illness season is less severe compared to the year before, according to data from its health authority. But the proliferation of a long-standing though little-known pathogen called human metapneumovirus ( HMPV ) has been raising alarm both at home and in other countries.Cases of hMPV are on a steady rise and the pathogen has been identified as a main cause of respiratory illness and hospitalizations this winter, said the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. While not a new virus, hMPV appears to also be vexing governments across the region, with India, Malaysia and Hong Kong reporting cases in recent days.Indonesia and Vietnam said they are closely monitoring the HMPV situation in China, asking the public not to panic.The new attention on HMPV — just one among a host of germs that causes the common cold — is likely due to improved virus detection capabilities in China and other countries after the Covid pandemic, during which governments spent millions on testing infrastructure and companies raced to develop better virus detection kits. And five years after SARS-CoV-2 sent the world into lockdown, outbreaks of illness in China attract outsized attention and are often the subject of misleading social media posts.In 2023, pneumonia cases in Chinese children prompted the World Health Organization to ask Beijing to share information about respiratory pathogens in circulation.HMPV, first discovered in the Netherlands in 2001, has become far easier to detect and is among a suite of respiratory pathogens that common-used testing kits now screen for.Lab testing for pathogens including hMPV used to take a long time, with results often confirmed long after a patient already recovered. “Testing these days can identify the virus causing infections within half an hour so patients will quickly find out and that’ll trigger more learning and attention,” Hu Yang, a physician at Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, told the National Business Daily last month.Although HMPV can make people very sick, the current situation is “very different” to the Covid-19 pandemic which was completely new to humans, said Professor Jill Carr, a virologist at Flinders’ University’s College of Medicine and Public Health.Its symptoms are mild in most cases, include coughing, fever, running nose and sore throat. There is no vaccine for the virus and it can cause pneumonia or even lead to hospitalization in high-risk groups such as children, elderly with chronic diseases, and patients receiving immunosuppressive treatments.China will continue to see multiple pathogens fueling its winter illness outbreak through spring, the country’s CDC said last month.",Little-known pathogen called human metapneumovirus ( HMPV ) has been raising alarm both at home and in other countries.

Bangladesh interim govt revokes Sheikh Hasina's passport over violence during July protests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-interim-govt-revokes-sheikh-hasinas-passport-over-violence-during-july-protests/articleshow/117030251.cms,"Also read:

The interim government of Bangladesh has revoked the passports of 97 individuals, including ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina , citing their alleged involvement in killings during the July uprising and incidents of enforced disappearances, local media reported.Of the total, 22 passports were revoked due to alleged connections to enforced disappearances, while 75, including Hasina’s, were tied to the violence during the July uprising, which reportedly resulted in hundreds of deaths. The announcement follows an arrest warrant issued by the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) against Hasina and 11 others for enforced disappearances. The tribunal has ordered their arrest and scheduled their appearance in court on February 12.The ICT’s chairman, Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mojumder, issued the warrant, emphasising the need for a comprehensive investigation. The Inspector General of Police has been tasked with ensuring the accused are apprehended and presented before the tribunal.This is the second arrest warrant issued against Hasina, who fled to India following the collapse of her Awami League-led government amid unprecedented anti-government protests in August. Complaints of crimes against humanity and genocide during the July-August mass uprising have further intensified legal scrutiny.Prosecutors allege that Hasina’s administration established a culture of state-sponsored enforced disappearances. Chief Prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam told reporters that elite law enforcement units such as the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) were frequently used to abduct individuals, with many victims never returning.Last month, the interim government formally requested Hasina’s extradition from India. While New Delhi acknowledged receiving the request, it has refrained from commenting publicly.The ICT has recorded multiple cases against Hasina, including accusations of genocide and crimes against humanity. A commission established by the interim government has reported 1,676 complaints of enforced disappearances during her tenure, alleging that 27% of victims remain unaccounted for.","Interim government revokes passports of 97 individuals, including ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

Trump's bid to rename Gulf of Mexico to the ‘Gulf of America.’ Can he do that?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-bid-to-rename-gulf-of-mexico-to-the-gulf-of-america-can-he-do-that/articleshow/117039456.cms,"Can Trump rename the Gulf of Mexico?



How did the Gulf of Mexico get its name?



US President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday announced his bid to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the ""Gulf of America"" ""pretty soon"" after he takes charge in the Oval office.“We’re going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America,” Trump said.“What a beautiful name. And it’s appropriate. It’s appropriate. Mexico has to stop allowing millions of people to pour into our country,” he added.Trump asserted that the US does “most of the work there” and claimed the gulf “belongs” to America. The Republican leader added that an official announcement would come “at a future date pretty soon.”Soon after Trump's remarks, Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Green said in an Interview with a podcast that she would direct her staff to draft legislation to rename the Gulf of Mexico. Green said that she would take care of funding for new maps and administrative policy materials throughout the federal government.Meanwhile, changing names of international waterbodies is not a unilateral decision and countries might not go along.The International Hydrographic Organisation works to ensure all the world's seas, oceans and navigable waters are surveyed and charted uniformly, and also names sone of them. There are instances where countries refer to the same body of water or landmark by different names in their own documentation.It can be easier when a landmark or body of water is within a country's boundaries. In 2015, then-President Barack Obama approved an order from the Department of Interior to rename Mount McKinley — the highest peak in North America — to Denali, a move that Trump has also said he wants to reverse.There's a long-running dispute over the name of the Sea of Japan among Japan, North Korea, South Korea and Russia.South Korea claims that the current name wasn't commonly used until Korea was under Japanese rule. At an International Hydrographic Organization meeting in 2020, member states agreed on a plan to replace names with numerical identifiers and develop a new digital standard for modern geographic information systems.The Persian Gulf has been widely known by that name since the 16th century, although usage of “Gulf” and “Arabian Gulf” is dominant in many countries in the Middle East. The government of Iran threatened to sue Google in 2012 over the company's decision not to label the body of water at all on its maps.There have been other conversations about bodies of water, including from Trump’s 2016 opponent. According to materials revealed by WikiLeaks in a hack of her campaign chairman’s personal account, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton in 2013 told an audience that, by China’s logic that it claimed nearly the entirety of the South China Sea, then the US after World War II could have labeled the Pacific Ocean the “American Sea.”The body of water has been depicted with that name for more than four centuries, an original determination believed to have been taken from a Native American city of “Mexico.”In 2012, a member of the Mississippi Legislature proposed a bill to rename portions of the gulf that touch that state's beaches “Gulf of America,” a move the bill author later referred to as a “joke.” That bill, which was referred to a committee, did not pass.The Gulf of Mexico, a body of water spanning over half a million square miles, has been recognized on European maps since the 1500s. Trump’s proposal to rename it has sparked criticism from historians and foreign policy experts, who note that such a move would likely face significant international backlash.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo and outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have both spoken with Trump about his tariff threats in recent months. Neither leader has commented on the proposed renaming or merger suggestion, but political analysts predict that Trump’s statements could further strain North American relations.With his inauguration just weeks away, Trump’s comments have set the stage for a contentious start to his administration.","US President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday announced his bid to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the ""Gulf of America"" ""pretty soon"" after he takes charge in the Oval office.

""And it will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone. All hell will break out.

""There should have never been the attack of October 7. People forget that. But there was, and many people were killed.""President Biden's administration has spent months attempting to secure the hostages' release. Despite several promising moments, negotiations have faltered due to Hamas's rejections and Israeli objections to proposed arrangements.Middle East experts expressed uncertainty about Trump's statements. Daniel Kurtzer, a former US ambassador to Israel, questioned the substance behind the threats. Given Israel's extensive military campaign against Hamas over 15 months, the potential impact of additional US or Israeli actions remains uncertain.Aaron David Miller, previously a state department analyst, questioned Trump's ability to influence both Hamas and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu in achieving a resolution.Steve Witkoff, Trump's designated Middle East envoy, spoke optimistically about ongoing negotiations, acknowledging collaboration with the Biden administration whilst attributing progress to Trump's influence. Witkoff mentioned plans to return to Doha for continued talks.The transition between administrations has affected hostage negotiations, with families urging cooperation between Biden and Trump officials. Both teams appear focused on using the inauguration deadline to pressure Hamas for releases, with Biden's team maintaining communication with Trump's representatives regarding negotiation developments.","US President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday warned the Hamas if the group failed to release all the hostages free by his Inaugration Day, January 20.

Biden cancelled his visit

Windstorm to continue for several days

'We are safe and out'

Fire jumped from one side to other, road blocked

US firefighters on Tuesday battled to contain a fast-moving wildfire tearing through the celebrity-studded hillsides of Los Angeles, as powerful winds swept across Southern California.The flames, visible for miles, prompted frantic evacuations, with residents abandoning cars and fleeing on foot as gridlocked roads became impassable.According to LA Fire Department chief Kristin Crowley, the fire threatens nearly 26,000 people across more than 10,000 households and over 13,000 structures. Residents reported distressing scenes of people fleeing with their children and pets, amid tears and screams.A fire in western Los Angeles's Pacific Palisades area quickly spread across nearly 2 square miles (just over 5 square kilometers), creating a prominent smoke column visible throughout the city.Residents in Venice Beach, located about 6 miles (10 kilometers) away, reported spotting the flames. The wildfire was one of several burning across the region.Authorities closed portions of Interstate 10 and the Pacific Coast Highway to non-essential traffic to facilitate evacuations. However, other routes remained impassable, compelling some residents to leave their vehicles and await rescue.The area that borders, approximately 20 miles (32 kilometres) west of downtown LA, comprises densely populated hillside streets with houses along winding roads near the Santa Monica Mountains, extending towards the Pacific Ocean beaches.Approximately half a million utility customers faced possible power cuts to minimise fire risks from equipment.Due to unpredictable weather conditions, Outgoing US President Joe Biden cancelled his visit to Riverside County, California, where he was scheduled to announce two new national monuments. Instead, Biden will deliver his speech in Los Angeles.According to the Associated Press, the most severe winds were anticipated between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. Weather experts indicated the windstorm would continue for several days, with potential gusts reaching 100 mph (160 kph) in mountainous regions and foothills, particularly concerning in areas lacking recent rainfall.According to the National Weather Service, the wind event, expected to reach its peak early Wednesday, could be the strongest Santa Ana windstorm affecting Los Angeles and Ventura counties in over ten years.The winds will rapidly dry vegetation, creating an extended period of fire danger, according to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California, Los Angeles and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. ""We really haven't seen a season as dry as this one follow a season as wet as the previous one,"" Swain said on Monday.Regions at risk of extreme fire conditions include the scorched remains of last month's wind-driven Franklin Fire, which devastated 48 structures—primarily homes—in and around Malibu.Actor James Woods shared video footage showing flames consuming bushes and moving past palm trees on a hillside near his residence. The intense orange flames surged through the landscaped gardens between houses.""We were blessed to have LA fire and police depts doing their jobs so well. We are safe and out. There are several elementary schools in our neighborhood and there was an enormous community effort to evacuate the children safely. Can not speak more highly of the LA fire and LAPD,"" Woods posted on X.Pacific Palisades resident and actor Steve Guttenberg requested people who left their vehicles to leave their keys, enabling movement of cars to create access for fire engines.""This is not a parking lot. I have friends up there and they can't evacuate. I'm walking up there as far as I can moving cars,"" Guttenberg told KTLA. Video footages circulating show bulldozers clearing abandoned vehicles that were blocking the roads.Local resident Kelsey Trainor described how their neighbourhood's sole access route became completely blocked. They experienced falling ash whilst fires burned alongside the road.""We looked across and the fire had jumped from one side of the road to the other side of the road,"" Trainor told the Associate Press.""People were getting out of the cars with their dogs and babies and bags, they were crying and screaming. The road was just blocked, like full-on blocked for an hour,"" he added.","Fire threatens nearly 26,000 people across more than 10,000 households and over 13,000 structures.

Expansionist ambitions

In a controversial news conference at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, President-elect Donald Trump refused to rule out using military action to seize control of Greenland and retake the Panama Canal , citing “economic security” as his primary concern, Daily Beast reports.Responding to a question from The New York Times’ David Sanger, Trump was asked if he could assure the world he would not use “military or economic coercion” to claim the two regions. “No, I can’t assure you on either of those two,” Trump said, adding, “But I can say this, we need them for economic security .”Trump has made no secret of his interest in Greenland. On Monday, he took to Truth Social , declaring, “Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our Nation. We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside World. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!”His comments follow a visit by Donald Trump Jr. to the island earlier this week. However, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen firmly dismissed the idea, reiterating that Greenland is not for sale.Trump’s expansionist vision doesn’t stop at Greenland. During the same news conference, he floated the possibility of renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America” and hinted at using “economic force” to exert control over Canada .“Because Canada and the United States, that would really be something. You get rid of that artificially drawn line, and you take a look at what that looks like, and it would also be much better for national security,” Trump said.A day earlier, Trump taunted Canadians on Truth Social after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau resigned. “Many people in Canada LOVE being the 51st State,” he wrote. “The United States can no longer suffer the massive Trade Deficits and Subsidies that Canada needs to stay afloat. Justin Trudeau knew this, and resigned.”While outlining his ambitions, Trump also complained about slow-dripping taps, uncomfortable electric heaters, and politically motivated prosecutors, blaming these issues on President Joe Biden.Despite his bold ideas, Trump made it clear he does not plan to use military force against Canada, preferring economic strategies instead.","President-elect Donald Trump refused to rule out using military action to seize control of Greenland and retake the Panama Canal.

Alcohol-induced blackouts: Accused blames drinking for memory loss of crime

In court: Accused pleads not guilty, requests medical supervision

In a harrowing case that has shocked Brooklyn, a Guatemalan immigrant accused of brutally setting a woman on fire aboard a subway train was so intoxicated that he didn’t even recognize his own actions when shown video footage of the crime, newly released court records reveal.Sebastian Zapeta-Calil , 33, allegedly had no memory of the December 22 attack on 57-year-old Debrina Kawam, a New Jersey woman, who was fatally burned while sleeping on the F train. According to transcripts from his stationhouse interview, the accused murderer was horrified when shown footage of the incident, reported the New York Post.“Oh damn, that’s me!” Zapeta-Calil allegedly exclaimed when the video played. “No, the truth is I don’t remember. Oh my goodness!”The Guatemalan national, who appeared visibly distressed, wiped his eyes and lowered his head as he processed the footage. His reaction — a combination of confusion, disbelief, and apparent shame — was captured in the newly unsealed interview, which took place hours after the chilling crime.The disturbing incident unfolded in the early hours of December 22. Police say Zapeta-Calil, heavily intoxicated, sat next to Kawam, who was sleeping on the train at the Stillwell Avenue-Coney Island station. Without warning, he flicked a lighter and set her clothes on fire, before fanning the flames and callously watching her burn. Authorities say the woman was left to suffer in agony as the accused looked on.In a haunting twist, Zapeta-Calil told detectives that his black-out drinking was the cause of his actions, admitting to a long history of binge drinking. “Sometimes when I drink and erase the memory, I don’t know, right?” he allegedly told officers, referring to his frequent alcohol-fueled lapses in memory.“I drink in the afternoons. When I wake up, I’m already at the house, already sleeping. Or sometimes, I wake up, and I’m already at the train station,” Zapeta-Calil explained during his interview. “I was drunk. I don’t remember how I got on the F train. When I reacted, I was already on it.”Zapeta-Calil, who entered the United States illegally five years ago, was no stranger to trouble with the law. Authorities said he initially tried to cross the US-Mexico border in 2018 but was turned away. Undeterred, he snuck back into the country and eventually settled with relatives before finding his way into New York’s shelter system. His lawyer confirmed in court that he had been living in the US as an undocumented migrant, working as a roofer while frequently indulging in heavy drinking.According to his statements, the night before the horrific attack, he had been drinking heavily in a Queens bar. After drinking beer and tequila, he continued to drink alone before heading to the train. “When I woke up, I was already on the F train,” he said.Later that morning, around 8 or 9 am, Zapeta-Calil allegedly got off at the Coney Island station, approached the sleeping Kawam, and set her on fire. He was arrested hours later near Columbus Circle, his intoxicated state still apparent.In court on Tuesday, Zapeta-Calil, wearing an orange jumpsuit and jacket, pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and arson. His defense attorney requested that he be placed under medical supervision while being held without bail. ""I am very sorry,"" Zapeta-Calil reportedly told detectives. “I didn’t mean to. But I really don’t know. I don’t know what happened, but I’m very sorry for that woman.”While the case has sparked widespread outrage, it has also raised troubling questions about the consequences of untreated alcoholism and the potential dangers of a system that failed to prevent his repeated offenses. As Zapeta-Calil’s court case moves forward, the community is left grappling with the horrific reality of the crime and the chilling disconnect between the accused’s drunken state and his horrific actions.Zapeta-Calil is scheduled to return to court in March, as prosecutors continue to build their case against him. For now, the city holds its breath, waiting for justice to be served in a case that has both horrified and mystified the public.","Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, 33, allegedly had no memory of the December 22 attack on 57-year-old Debrina Kawam, a New Jersey woman, who was fatally burned while sleeping on the F train.

Trump trolls Canada as 51st state — But what if it actually happened?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-trolls-canada-as-51st-state-but-what-if-it-actually-happened/articleshow/117034868.cms,"Donald Trump. (AP)

A Blue-State Behemoth?

Could Trump really pull it off?

The ""What if"" factor

President-elect Donald Trump has once again turned heads with his latest comments about Canada — this time suggesting the country should join the US as its 51st state. Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump jokingly mused about the merger, saying, ""Canada and the United States. That would really be something. They should be a state.""Trump went on to elaborate that such a union wouldn’t involve military action but rather “economic force,” implying that a more integrated North American economy could be a win for both nations. A day prior, he fueled the conversation further with a social media post, claiming that “many people in Canada LOVE being the 51st State.”The former president emphasized the potential benefits, touting a union as a way to eliminate tariffs, lower taxes, and protect Canada from external threats, particularly from Russian and Chinese naval forces. ""Together, what a great nation it would be!"" he declared.While this is all part of Trump’s ongoing trolling of Canada, the idea of it becoming the 51st state has sparked some serious hypothetical questions. Would it really work? And what would it mean for US politics?If Canada did somehow become part of the United States, the political ramifications could be significant. With a population of over 40 million, Canada would immediately become the largest state in the Union, surpassing California. But the political shift might be even more profound.Canada has a history of left-leaning governments, with the Liberal Party in power for much of the last century. As a result, political analysts believe Canada would likely lean toward the Democratic side, boosting the party’s influence in the US Congress and presidential elections, reported Fox News.“It would be a massive political boon for Democrats,” said veteran Republican strategist Dave Carney. ""The voters who have supported Canada’s Liberal governments would probably vote for Democrats.""Political experts predict Canada’s inclusion would reshape US electoral dynamics. With two Democratic senators and millions of electoral votes, Canada would make a strong case for Democratic dominance. As Rich Lowry, editor-in-chief of National Review, warned, ""Canada would be a blue-state behemoth, matching California in population and, presumably, in reliably Democratic politics,"" reported Fox News.While the idea remains far-fetched, some believe Trump’s bold statements are part of a larger strategy aimed at negotiating with Canada. Carney, who has advised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and worked on numerous Republican presidential campaigns, suggests that Trump is playing a long game with these remarks.“Trump uses tools that no one would ever think of,” Carney said. ""He’s able to leverage soft power to get people to pay attention and push his agenda forward."" Indeed, Trump’s comments could be seen as a way to influence discussions with Canada on trade and security issues, reported Fox News.What if, against all odds, Canada actually joined the US? Political scientists like Wayne Lesperance predict that it would tip the scales in favor of the Democratic Party. ""With 40 million voters and a congressman and senator delegation that’s more likely to oppose Trump, this would be a huge shift,"" Lesperance said.Democratic strategist Van Jones echoed this sentiment, calling Canada “a huge blue state” and even welcoming the hypothetical notion. ""If Canada wants to come here and rescue us, I am more than happy.""But let’s be real. While the idea of Canada becoming the 51st state is more fantasy than reality, it’s a scenario that has ignited plenty of political speculation and intrigue. So far, it seems like just another one of Trump’s playful provocations—but who knows? In his world, anything’s possible.","President-elect Donald Trump has suggested that Canada should join the US as its 51st state.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday announced that the federal government has decided to cut the number of affiliated agencies by half, abolishing 1,50,000 jobs, as part of a sweeping cost-cutting and efficiency drive.""We are reducing the federal government's size step by step. So far, 80 departments have been consolidated into 40,"" Aurangzeb said at a press conference where he highlighted the government's goal to complete these reforms by June 2025.He added that 60% of vacant positions have been abolished, which comes to 150,000 government jobs.He said that right-sizing was part of the restructuring initiative launched in mid-2024 by a committee formed under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to rationalise expenditures and improve performance.According to the minister, the committee was to look into 43 ministries and their subordinate agencies. He said that the federal government's annual expenditure on these departments was Rs900 billion.He said that the six ministries that the government had initially selected for right-sizing included Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan, States and Frontier Regions (SAFRON), IT and Telecom, Industries and Reproduction, National Health Services and Capital Development Authority (CAD).He said that the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON are being merged and CAD is being abolished.According to the minister, in the second phase, out of the 60 subordinate institutions of the Ministry of Science and Technology, Commerce Division, Housing and Works, and National Food Security Research, 25 institutions will be abolished, 20 will be reduced in size and nine will be merged.""We took four ministries in the second phase and after that, we have now taken five more ministries,"" he said, adding that those selected for the third phase were ministries of federal education and professional training, information and broadcasting, power division, finance division, and national heritage and culture.He said that work had been done over the past several years to reduce the size of the federal government, but ""the problem was that if you wanted to do everything possible at once, it couldn't be done, so we decided to do it gradually, in stages.""The minister said the federal government also plans to transfer hospitals to provincial administrations. ""This is not just about cutting costs; it's about improving efficiency,"" he said.Aurangzeb also said that the plan was to shift Pakistan's economic framework towards export-driven growth, supported by digitalisation and technology initiatives and the prime minister is expected to inaugurate a new technology-related program in Karachi soon.He said that the government's focus on macroeconomic stability helped the key indicators to improve and Pakistan was standing at a promising economic juncture due to various government efforts.The size of the Pakistani government came into the crosshairs after the sharp increase in expenditures and questions were being raised over it.The current government has been taking steps and reducing the size and expenses. It abolished the traditional pension system for government employees last year and reduced the pension benefits for the current employees.","Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb announced that the federal government has decided to cut the number of affiliated agencies by half. 60% of vacant positions have been abolished, which comes to 150,000 government jobs.

What is the case?

'Imran Khan broke all records'

A Pakistani court has postponed the verdict announcement in GBP 190 million Al-Qadir Trust corruption case against former Prime Minister Imran Khan. The verdict is now scheduled for January 13, according to Islamabad accountability court staff.The delay was attributed to Judge Nasir Javed Rana's leave, the court staff said. Both the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) prosecutor and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder's lawyers have been informed about the postponement. This marks the second delay in the case. The verdict, initially reserved on December 18, was first scheduled for December 23The case alleges that Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, received land and billions of rupees from Bahria Town. In exchange, they allegedly legalized £190 million returned to Pakistan by the UK during Khan's tenure in office.In December 2023, the NAB filed a corruption reference against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, Bushra Bibi, and several others. The investigation focused on the alleged acquisition of hundreds of acres of land for the Al-Qadir University Trust, which reportedly caused a GBP 190 million loss to the national treasury.The charges state that Imran Khan and other accused individuals misappropriated PKR 50 billion (equivalent to GBP 190 million at the time), transferred by the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) to the Pakistani government, ARY News reported.As part of the investigation, NAB filed a corruption reference against Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, and six others in connection with the Al-Qadir University project, which was initially registered on December 26, 2019.Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif recently reiterated the corruption allegations against Khan in this case. “There has been a lot of corruption in the last 75 years, but Imran Khan broke all records,” Asif said, further alleging that Khan and his associates were heavily involved in corrupt activities.","The verdict is now scheduled for January 13, according to Islamabad accountability court staff.

Does Pakistan minister's comment on Ghazni signal foreign policy shift?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/does-pakistan-ministers-comment-on-ghazni-signal-foreign-policy-shift/articleshow/116973163.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan's old antic to taunt India by naming its missiles after Afghan invaders has taken an unexpected turn in the wake of a new conflict with Afghanistan.The controversy ignited when Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif described Mahmud of Ghazni - a figure celebrated in Pakistan's historical narrative - as ""merely a plunderer"". His remark, delivered during a televised interview, stunned many in a country where school textbooks have long celebrated Mahmud for his raid on the Somnath temple in India in 1026. This dispute put the spotlight on naming of missiles after figures who invaded India to rile the country.Pakistan has named its missiles after Ghazni who raided and destroyed the legendary Shiv Mandir at Somnath, after Ahmad Shah Abdali who won the third battle of Panipat after defeating the Marathas and massacring thousands of them, and after Muhammad Ghori who defeated Prithviraj Chauhan.The choices of invaders from Afghanistan were deliberately meant to not only rile India but also leave no doubt that Pakistan's ballistic missile programme was India-centric, a narrative that resonated domestically, while deflecting international scrutiny.Asif is a hardliner himself. This time, however, he seemed to target a different audience. His comment came amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistan recently conducted airstrikes in Afghanistan, claiming it targeted Pakistani Taliban operatives allegedly harboured by the Afghan Taliban. Analysts suggest Asif's critique of Mahmud was less about historical revisionism and more an attempt to antagonize the Afghan Taliban.The Afghan govt promptly denounced Asif's statements as reckless. Within Pakistan, the remarks sparked a polarizing debate. Some welcomed the re-evaluation of Mahmud's legacy, while others, including members of Asif's own political party, rebuked him. Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, a former information minister, urged Asif to consult Romila Thapar's work on Somnath. Thapar, a respected Indian historian, posits that Mahmud's attack was motivated by economic and political factors rather than religious zeal, challenging the colonial-era framing of it as a Hindu-Muslim conflict.As the controversy lingers, it raises a provocative question: If Mahmud of Ghazni is no longer regarded as a hero, should the Ghaznavi missile be renamed? This debate transcends mere symbolism, hinting at broader shifts in Pakistan's foreign policy, historical narratives, and regional positioning, amid growing international and domestic pressures.","Defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif described Mahmud of Ghazni as ""merely a plunderer"" His comment came amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

World Bank to approve $20 billion programme for Pakistan: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/world-bank-to-approve-20-billion-programme-for-pakistan-report/articleshow/116966227.cms,"Representative image.

Key focus areas of the framework

Reducing child stunting



Combating learning poverty



Enhancing climate resilience



Decarbonising the environment



Expanding fiscal space



Boosting private investment to improve productivity



Approval from World Bank

Shielding projects from political shifts

Pioneering 10-year partnership

Private sector lending boost

Shifting World Bank strategy

Implementation through rolling business plans

The World Bank is set to approve a $20 billion package for Pakistan, marking the launch of a 10-year initiative to shield development projects from political instability. The programme, "" Pakistan Country Partnership Framework 2025-35 "", will target crucial areas of improvement in Pakistan’s most neglected sectors, with a focus on long-term, stable development, according to reports from Pakistan-based daily newspaper The Express Tribune.The framework will focus on six areas:These priorities have garnered broad support across Pakistan’s political spectrum, making them more likely to remain stable throughout the 2025-2035 period, which is expected to include at least three general elections.The framework is scheduled for approval by the World Bank board on January 14, 2025, following which, the World Bank’s vice president for South Asia, Martin Raiser, is expected to visit Islamabad to discuss the programme’s implementation. This initiative is seen as a long-term solution to protect development projects from Pakistan’s volatile political environment.According to the World Bank’s assessment, this strategy ""will help shield the programme from the country's volatile polity and frequent swings in priorities and requests that follow government changes.""The official documents reveal that past transitions in government have led to the ""fragmentation of the World Bank portfolio and diluted impacts."" A key official, who was part of the framework development, said that the World Bank picked Pakistan as the first country where it would introduce the 10-year partnership strategy.""The World Bank's total indicative lending envelope for fiscal year 2025 to 2035 will total around $ 20 billion,"" as per a draft of the framework quoted by the Express Tribune.Of this, $14 billion will come from the World Bank’s concessional arm, the International Development Association (IDA), while the remaining $6 billion is expected to be provided through the relatively expensive International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).However, these loans rely on several factors, including the evolution of IDA funding, Pakistan’s performance under the Sustainable Development Finance Policy, and the country’s debt vulnerability indicators.In addition to the $20 billion in loans to the Pakistani government, the framework also aims to facilitate $20 billion in private sector lending through the World Bank’s two other arms: the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). This brings the total value of the World Bank’s engagement in Pakistan to $40 billion. However, the official loans to the government will remain capped at $20 billion.This new lending initiative marks a significant shift in the World Bank’s approach. Rather than focusing on smaller, short-term projects, the framework will concentrate on larger, more impactful investments. It will phase out lending to 10 less impactful sectors like transport, power transmission, telecoms, tertiary healthcare, and higher education, which are seen as less impactful in terms of long-term development.Instead, the World Bank will focus on ""larger projects on average, more frequent scale-ups and expansions, and less pilots and one-off operations"", according to the planning document.The implementation of the 10-year framework will be guided by two-year rolling business plans, which will be agreed upon by both the World Bank and the Pakistani government. By concentrating on long-term, high-impact areas, the World Bank’s new strategy aims to help Pakistan tackle its most pressing socio-economic challenges.","The World Bank is set to approve a $20 billion package for Pakistan, marking the launch of a 10-year initiative to shield development projects from political instability.

Gohar confirmed that all ongoing discussions are solely with the government, Dawn reported.According to Gohar, the PTI leadership initially pursued discussions with the military, acknowledging the army's significant role in decision-making in the country. These contacts were heading in a ""positive direction"" until the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan in a new case.Gohar detailed that Khan had been granted bail in the Toshakhana case, which involved the controversial purchase of a Bulgari jewellery set, but was soon rearrested on charges related to the September 2024 protest, leading to the collapse of talks with the military.""Now, the PTI is not holding backdoor talks with the establishment,"" Gohar said. However, he emphasised that the possibility of future talks with the military has not been completely closed, leaving room for potential negotiations later. This statement reflects PTI's focus on engaging in dialogue exclusively with the government at this juncture.The PTI chairman also responded to rumours about an alleged offer to move Imran Khan from Adiala Jail to his residence in Banigala. Gohar swiftly dismissed the claims, reiterating that Khan views his detention as illegal. ""There is no point in considering such an offer,"" Gohar stated, aligning with Khan's position on the matter. The PTI leader's refusal to entertain any conditional release further reinforces the party's stance on his unjust incarceration, reported Dawn.Furthermore, Gohar rejected the idea of a trilateral meeting between Imran Khan, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP's Asif Ali Zardari, which had been suggested by PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah to resolve the nation's ongoing political crises. He characterised the proposal as ""idealistic,"" citing the irreconcilable differences between the political figures involved.""I might see this day [talks between the three leaders] in my life, but for now, this isn't possible,"" Gohar remarked, indicating that such a dialogue is highly unlikely at the present time.Meanwhile, in Peshawar, PTI's Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram addressed the issue of the ongoing talks with the government. He assured that the expected judgment in the £190 million case on January 6 would not derail the negotiations.""The talks will continue, keeping in view the government's seriousness,"" Akram stated, emphasising that the party had not linked the verdict to the discussions. He also spoke about the release of PTI workers who had been sentenced by military courts, clarifying that their freedom had no connection to the ongoing talks with the government.""Our workers were released because they were innocent, and it was not possible to further keep them in jail,"" Akram asserted.The PTI has also been actively engaged in a civil disobedience movement , which began with an appeal to overseas Pakistanis not to send remittances. Akram suggested that the impact of this action would begin to show within two months. He said the PTI would evaluate the situation and consider withdrawing the movement if the government met their demands, such as releasing all imprisoned party members and forming a judicial commission to probe the May 9 and November 26 protests, Dawn reported.""The civil disobedience movement is necessary for a country where the Constitution, laws, and human rights are violated and lawmakers are abducted,"" Akram explained, underscoring the PTI's ongoing commitment to reform. He also criticised the internet disruptions, warning that they would negatively affect Pakistan's digital economy, particularly the youth who contribute significantly to the sector.","Gohar Ali Khan confirms that all ongoing discussions are solely with the government. He rejects the idea of a trilateral meeting between Imran Khan, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP's Asif Ali Zardari. The PTI has also been actively engaged in a civil disobedience movement.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116936745,imgsize-666244,width-400,resizemode-4/116936745.jpg"
Travel to Pakistan’s restive Kurram district resumes after 42 days,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/travel-to-pakistans-restive-kurram-district-resumes-after-42-days/articleshow/116925061.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The first convoy of passengers is set to leave for Pakistan’s remote northwestern district of Kurram, on the Afghan border, on Saturday after travel to the region was stopped in Nov 2024 owing to sectarian violence that has cost more than 130 lives in recent weeks.Tribal and sectarian clashes, which initially started as a land dispute, have rocked the tribal district of over 600,000 people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province since 52 Shia passengers travelling to and from the region were killed by armed men on Nov 21. The deadly attack had sparked further violence and road closures in the district, restricting access to medicine, food and fuel in the area as casualties in fighting between Sunni and Shia tribes surged to 136. The conflict had forced the closing of the only road connecting Parachinar, Kurram’s headquarters, with the provincial capital of Peshawar.“Travel and security arrangements are being made for the convoy (of passengers) leaving on Saturday,” Pakistan govt spokesperson Muhammad Ali Saif said on Friday, warning that any armed aggression would be prosecuted as terrorism.The KP administration had recently formed a grand jirga, or council of political and tribal elders, which reached a peace deal between the warring Shia and Sunni tribes on Wednesday following weeks of negotiations. Under the peace agreement, both sides have agreed on the demolition of bunkers and the handover of heavy weapons to the authorities.“Both sides will give a coordinated plan of action within 15 days for the collection of weapons,” Saif said, adding that bunkers already existing in the area will be dismantled within a month.After the demolition of bunkers, according to the official, any party that launches an attack will be considered a “terrorist” and action will be taken against it.Another provision of the peace agreement states that anybody who violates the terms of the agreement by employing weapons against the other would face a Pakistani Rs 10 million ($35,933) fine. It stated that families displaced by the recent hostilities would be rehabilitated.Shia Muslims dominate parts of Kurram although they are a minority in the rest of Pakistan, which is majority Sunni. The volatile region has a history of sectarian conflict, with militant Sunni groups previously targeting Shias, triggering retaliatory attacks by rival groups in the area.",First convoy of passengers is set to leave for Pakistan’s remote northwestern district of Kurram on Saturday.

Lahore has been ranked as the world’s most polluted city, with an AQI of 354 classified as “hazardous,” while Karachi is listed 13th with an “Unhealthy” AQI of 164, according to IQAir’s latest Air Quality Index (AQI) rankings. The data highlights severe air quality issues in Pakistan, significantly threatening public health.Lahore, home to over 11 million people, continues to grapple with dire air pollution, largely attributed to vehicle emissions, industrial activities, and crop burning, The Express Tribune reported.The smog crisis has led to widespread respiratory ailments, with recent figures revealing over 1.8 million individuals have fallen ill in the past month due to smog-related issues. Of these, approximately 1,29,229 have required hospital treatment for respiratory conditions, while 61,00,153 have been diagnosed with cardiothoracic conditions, underscoring the grave health impacts.In Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city and bustling economic hub, the AQI of 164 reflects persistent pollution from heavy traffic, industrial zones, and port activities. Despite initiatives to curb pollution, the city remains in the “unhealthy” category, raising concerns for residents, especially those with pre-existing health conditions.Yasir Hussain, director of the Climate Action Centre (CAC), emphasised the role of vehicular emissions in exacerbating air pollution during a press conference at the Karachi Press Club. He noted that vehicle emissions are responsible for 60 per cent of Karachi’s pollution and 80 per cent of Lahore’s, with both cities experiencing severe environmental and health consequences.The air quality crisis has coincided with a measles outbreak in the region, further straining healthcare systems. Doctors have warned of the disease’s high contagion rate and urged parents to ensure timely vaccinations for children aged between nine months and 1.5 years to prevent fatalities.Lahore’s hazardous air pollution has prompted authorities to consider stricter measures, while experts have highlighted the need for regional cooperation to tackle the transboundary nature of air pollution.","Lahore has been ranked as the world’s most polluted city, with an AQI of 354 classified as “hazardous,” while Karachi is listed 13th with an “Unhealthy” AQI.

Bangladesh's former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia left for London on Tuesday night for medical treatment .Zia, a political rival of ousted PM Sheikh Hasina , went abroad on a special air ambulance sent by Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.The 79-year-old's personal physician AZM Zahid Hossain told news agency AP that Qatar's emir arranged a special aircraft with medical facilities for the former prime minister.Enamul Haque Chowdhury, a close aide of Zia, told reporters that the air ambulance flew Zia to London, where her eldest son Tarqique Rahman has been in exile since 2007. Rahman is also the acting chairman of Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and is expected to lead the party toward the election.Zia's planned visit to London comes when Dhaka is embroiled in uncertainty, with Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus-led interim government in charge of the country since Hasina's ouster on August 5 last year.The BNP has been negotiating with the Yunus-led government for a quick election.The party initially demanded polls in three months, but later said it wanted to allow the interim government more time. However, the party is now pressing for an election sometime this year.Zia was sentenced to 17 years in jail under Hasina's rule in two corruption cases stemming from 2001-2006 when she was prime minister.In November, easing the way for Zia's political comeback, the Bangladesh high court acquitted the former prime minister severing a 7-year sentence in a corruption case.Zia was lodged in the Old Dhaka Central Jail on February 8, 2018, after a special court sentenced her to five years in prison in the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case.On October 30, 2018, the high court raised her punishment to 10 years. However, later, she was convicted in the Zia Charitable Trust corruption case.Amid the Covid outbreak, the government temporarily released Zia from jail after 776 days through an executive order, suspending her sentence on March 25, 2020, with conditions that she would stay in her Gulshan house and not leave the country.After Sheikh Hasina was ousted from Bangladesh in the wake of a mass uprising against her government, Zia was completely freed by an order of Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin.Zia served as the prime minister of Bangladesh from March 1991 to March 1996, and again from June 2001 to October 2006.","Khaleda Zia left for London on Tuesday night for medical treatment.

US President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that Elon Musk 's SpaceX will ""soon"" launch a mission to bring home two American astronauts stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) for months.Veteran Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams arrived at the ISS in June aboard Boeing's Starliner for what was meant to be an eight-day stay.However, technical issues with the spacecraft forced Nasa to delay their return.The space agency initially planned for SpaceX to bring them back in February, but the mission was pushed to late March as the company prepares a new vehicle.""I have just asked Elon Musk and SpaceX to “go get” the 2 brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden Administration.

US president added, without confirming a launch date.Elon Musk, a key financial backer of Trump's campaign and now a full-fledged member of US administration, confirmed on X that the president had urged SpaceX to expedite the astronauts' return.SpaceX has been running crew rotations to and from the ISS every six months. Meanwhile, Wilmore and Williams have remained in good spirits, with Nasa assuring they have ample supplies and are enjoying their extended stay.While their prolonged mission is unusual, it has yet to surpass the record set by astronaut Frank Rubio, who spent 371 consecutive days in orbit in 2023 after a coolant leak disabled his Russian return capsule.","US President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that Elon Musk's SpaceX will ""soon"" launch a mission to bring home two American astronauts stranded on the International Space Station.Veteran Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams arrived at the ISS in June aboard Boeing's Starliner for what was meant to be an eight-day stay.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117666297,imgsize-730857,width-400,resizemode-4/117666297.jpg"
Americans Renouncing US Citizenship: More Americans in Canada renouncing US citizenship amid Trump’s second term: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/more-americans-in-canada-renouncing-us-citizenship-amid-trumps-second-term-report/articleshow/117663783.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

Expatriation numbers expected to surge

A growing number of Americans living in Canada are renouncing their US citizenship, citing financial and political motivations, as per a report by CBC News.Lawyers specialising in expatriation have reported a significant rise in inquiries since Donald Trump was reelected US president in November, with experts predicting 2025 to be a record year for expatriation.According to CBC News, the trend of US citizens severing ties with their homeland has been increasing since 2014, when the Foreign account tax compliance Act (FATCA) took full effect. FATCA requires foreign financial institutions to report on the foreign assets of US account holders, creating complex tax filing obligations for US citizens abroad.Alexander Marino, director of US tax law at Moodys Tax Law in Calgary, explained that tax compliance burdens and estate taxes are the primary reasons for renunciation. However, political factors play a growing role. “For a lot of people, the election results are a bit of the straw that broke the camel’s back,” Marino was quoted by CBC News, adding that interest in renunciation spiked sharply after Trump’s reelection.One high-profile example is Douglas Cowgill, a former dual citizen from Wisconsin, now based in British Columbia. As reported by CBC News, Cowgill officially renounced his US citizenship in 2023, citing long-term financial and personal motivations.""I had to look at it from the perspective of what lies ahead of me for the next 20 to 30 years, and definitely that is a life here in Canada,"" Cowgill said. He moved to Canada in 2012, became a dual citizen in 2019, and decided to renounce during the pandemic when cross-border visits with his Canadian wife became challenging.Cowgill also noted that political dissatisfaction drives many expatriates to renounce. “They see the US going in a direction that they’re not satisfied with,” he added.Renunciation is not a simple process. Applicants must undergo immigration filings, tax compliance submissions, and a formal interview at a US embassy or consulate, where they take an oath of renunciation. The $2,350 US administrative fee and potential exit taxes further complicate the decision.Lawyers like Cowgill and Marino have seen a business boom. According to CBC News, Cowgill’s firm, Cross Border Visas, reported a near-doubling of monthly inquiries by late 2023. Similarly, Moodys Tax Law plans to increase its renunciation webinars from seven to 12 in 2025 to meet growing demand.The US Federal Register publishes quarterly lists of those who renounce their citizenship. Numbers surged after Trump’s first election in 2016, rising from about 4,100 names in that year to approximately 6,900 in 2017—a more than 50 per cent increase.While expatriation dipped to 5,500 individuals in 2022, Marino expects 2025 to surpass previous records. CBC News attributes this increase to political polarisation and financial burdens, particularly among left-leaning US expats in Canada.","A growing number of Americans living in Canada are renouncing their US citizenship, citing financial and political motivations.

Trump invites Israel's Netanyahu to meet with him at the White House next week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-invites-israels-netanyahu-to-meet-with-him-at-the-white-house-next-week/articleshow/117664739.cms,"Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu (File photo)

WADI GAZA: President Donald Trump has invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House next week as the first foreign leader to visit in Trump's second term, Netanhayu and the White House said Tuesday.The announcement came as the United States pressures Israel and Hamas to continue a ceasefire that has paused a devastating 15-month war in Gaza. Talks about the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, which aims to end the war, begin next Monday.The White House letter shared by Netanyahu's office, dated Tuesday, said ""I look forward to discussing how we can bring peace to Israel and its neighbors, and efforts to counter our shared adversaries.""The meeting on February 4 is a chance for Netanyahu, under pressure at home, to remind the world of the support he has received from Trump over the years, and to defend Israel's conduct of the war. Last year, the two men met face-to-face for the first time in nearly four years at Trump's Florida Mar-a-Lago estate.Israel is the largest recipient of US military aid, and Netanyahu is likely to encourage Trump not to hold up some weapons deliveries the way the Biden administration did, though it continued other deliveries and overall military support.Netanyahu also wants Trump to put more pressure on Iran, and renew efforts to deliver a historic normalization agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a rival of Iran and the Arab world's most powerful country.Even before taking office this month, Trump was sending his special Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to the region to apply pressure along with the Biden administration to get the current Gaza ceasefire achieved.But Netanyahu has vowed to renew the war if Hamas doesn't meet his demands in negotiations over the ceasefire's second phase, meant to discuss a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a ""sustainable calm.""Over 375,000 return to northern Gaza Under the deal, more than 375,000 Palestinians have crossed into northern Gaza since Israel allowed their return on Monday morning, the United Nations said Tuesday. That represents over a third of the million people who fled in the war's opening days.Many of the Palestinians trudging along a seaside road or crossing in vehicles after security inspections were getting their first view of shattered northern Gaza under the fragile ceasefire, now in its second week.Trump this week suggested that Egypt and Jordan take in Palestinians from Gaza, at least temporarily, so that ""we just clean out that whole thing"" - which Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians swiftly rejected, fearing Israel would never allow a return.Instead, Palestinians were determined to pitch makeshift shelters or sleep outdoors amid the vast piles of broken concrete or perilously leaning buildings. After months of crowding in squalid tent camps or former schools in Gaza's south, they would finally be home.""It's still better for us to be on our land than to live on a land that's not yours,"" said Fayza al-Nahal as she prepared to leave the southern city of Khan Younis for the north.At least two Palestinians set off for the north by sea, crowding into a rowboat with a bicycle and other belongings.Hani Al-Shanti, displaced from Gaza City, looked forward to feeling at peace in whatever he found, ""even if it is a roof and walls without furniture, even if it is without a roof."" One newly returned woman hung laundry in the ruins of her home, its walls blown out.Next steps Under the ceasefire, the next release of hostages held in Gaza, and Palestinian prisoners from Israeli custody, is set to occur on Thursday, followed by another exchange on Saturday.In the ceasefire's six-week first phase, a total of 33 hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, that ignited the war should be released, along with almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.Israel this week said a list provided by Hamas confirmed the fears that eight of the 33 hostages to be freed are dead, bringing fresh grief to Israeli families who have long pressed the government to reach a deal to bring everyone home before time runs out.On Tuesday, one of the first hostages to be released under the current ceasefire - just the second in the war - shared a glimpse of life in captivity.Naama Levy, 20, wrote on social media that she spent most of the first 50 days alone before being reunited with other soldiers kidnapped from her military base on October 7, well as other civilian captives.""We strengthened each other until the day of our release, and also afterwards,"" she wrote.Aid flows in A surge in humanitarian aid into Gaza continued under the ceasefire.""In this past week alone, approximately 4,200 trucks carrying aid have entered the Gaza Strip following inspections,"" said Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel.Under the deal, 600 trucks of aid are meant to enter per day.The government of Qatar, a mediator in the ceasefire talks, said Tuesday that while complaints have been raised by both sides, no confirmed ceasefire violations have occurred that could cause the agreement to collapse.The ceasefire is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas. Militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the October 7 assault and abducted another 250.Israel responded with an air and ground offensive that has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.","President Donald Trump invites Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House next week.

In her debut press briefing on Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the Trump administration 's decision to end birthright citizenship , calling it ""unconstitutional"".The executive order, signed by President Donald Trump shortly after taking office, denies automatic citizenship to children of migrants who are in the US illegally or on temporary visas. It applies to births from February 19 onward and does not apply retroactively.Leavitt, the youngest press secretary in US history, responded to legal challenges from 22 state attorneys general by reaffirming the administration’s stance. ""This administration believes that birthright citizenship is unconstitutional,"" she said, pledging to take the issue to the Supreme Court The press briefing also highlighted the administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement efforts. Leavitt warned potential border-crossers to “think again” as she detailed recent ICE operations .“The 3,500 arrests that ICE has made so far since President Trump came back into office,” she said, pointing out that all detainees are considered criminals.When asked about those without violent offenses, she doubled down: “All of them, because they illegally broke our nation's laws, and therefore, they are criminals as far as this administration goes.”Leavitt also addressed economic policy, confirming that tariffs on Canada remain on schedule for February 1, with additional duties on Mexico and China under consideration. “I spoke with the president Monday night, and he indicated February 1 was ‘still on the books’ for the introduction of damaging duties,” she stated.The administration also plans to impose tariffs on foreign-made semiconductors , computer chips, and pharmaceuticals to encourage domestic manufacturing.","White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt is the youngest press secretary in US history.

What is Doomsday Clock?

Concerns over Global issues

AI: Risks and potential benefits

The "" doomsday clock ,"" which represents how close humanity is to global disaster , moved one second closer to midnight on Tuesday. This comes as concerns over nuclear war , climate change , and public health have increased since US President Donald Trump began his second term.The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists , which created the clock during the Cold War, set the time at 89 seconds to midnight. This is the closest it has ever been. The last change was in 2022, when the clock was set to 90 seconds to midnight after Russia invaded Ukraine. The clock was originally set at seven minutes to midnight in 1947.""In setting the Clock one second closer to midnight, we send a stark signal: Because the world is already perilously close to the precipice, a move of even a single second should be taken as an indication of extreme danger and an unmistakable warning that every second of delay in reversing course increases the probability of global disaster,"" the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists said in a statement.Factors included nuclear weapons threats, the climate crisis, biological threats, and disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence (AI).It said, ""The United States, China, and Russia have the prime responsibility to pull the world back from the brink. The world depends on immediate action.""""At 89 seconds to midnight, the doomsday clock stands closer to catastrophe than at any moment in its history,"" said Juan Manuel Santos, former president of Colombia and chair of The Elders, a group of former world leaders.""The clock speaks to the existential threats that confront us and the need for unity and bold leadership to turn back its hands,"" he said at a news conference in Washington.""This is a bleak picture. But it is not yet irreversible,"" he added.The Doomsday Clock is a symbol that measures how close humanity is to global destruction due to dangerous technologies. It shows the time remaining until ""midnight,"" representing disaster. The clock is adjusted each year by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists to alert the public and encourage action.When it was first introduced in 1947, the clock's time was based on the threat of nuclear weapons, which Bulletin scientists saw as the biggest risk to humanity. In 2007, the Bulletin also began considering the impact of climate change when setting the clock.The clock was set the furthest from midnight in 1991, at 17 minutes, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the signing of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.A few days into his second term, Trump has already changed the approach to international cooperation.Santos welcomed Trump’s commitment to diplomacy with Russia and China. Trump has promised to end the Ukraine war by negotiating with both sides, which could ease concerns about the use of nuclear weapons.However, Santos pointed out that the US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization had increased global risks.The world has faced another year of extreme temperatures and natural disasters. Santos warned that other countries might follow the US in reducing climate efforts. ""If the United States, the world's largest economy, is not going to make an effort to limit the carbon emissions, why should I?"" he said.Santos also mentioned the fading public memory of Covid-19 and its effects. ""We have to remind them what happened -- and what will happen will be worse, according to all the scientists,"" he said.Public health expert Suzet McKinney, a member of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists board, warned that artificial intelligence could increase the risk of biological weapons.""As nation-states around the world and even our own government engage in practices that are sure to encourage rogue behavior and/or cripple our ability to curb the spread of infectious diseases, novel or otherwise, we cannot hide our heads in the sand,"" she said.Physicist Robert Socolow, who is also on the board, said the recent development of the Chinese intelligence firm DeepSeek could reduce energy consumption in AI technology. He compared the breakthrough to past progress in semiconductor chips that made computing more efficient.However, experts also cautioned that artificial intelligence could make misinformation worse.""All of these dangers are greatly exacerbated by a potent threat multiplier -- the spread of misinformation, disinformation and conspiracy theories that degrade the communication ecosystem and increasingly blur the line between truth and falsehood,"" said Daniel Holz, chair of the board.","The Doomsday Clock is a symbol that measures how close humanity is to global destruction due to dangerous technologies.

'Well-educated': Donald Trump's 'border czar' Tom Homan criticises migrants' knowledge of rights during ICE operations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/well-educated-donald-trumps-border-czar-tom-homan-criticises-migrants-knowledge-of-rights-during-ice-operations/articleshow/117661501.cms,"File photo: Tom Homan (Picture credit: ANI)

Tom Homan , US President Donald Trump’s “border czar” and former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), expressed frustration over the challenges ICE agents face in sanctuary cities due to immigrants being ""well-educated"" about their rights.Speaking on American news network CNN, Homan complained that initiatives like Chicago's ""Know Your Rights"" campaign hinder ICE's ability to arrest undocumented immigrants .“For instance, Chicago—very well-educated,“ Homan continued. ”They‘ve been educated on how to how to defy ICE, how to hide from ICE. I‘ve seen many pamphlets from many NGOs: ’Here‘s how you escape ICE from arresting you. Here‘s what you need to do.’""“They call it ‘Know Your Rights.’ I call it ‘how to escape arrest,’” Homan added.Despite these challenges, Homan remained resolute. ""If we gotta play that cat and mouse game, that’s what we’re going to do ‘til every one of them’s gone,” he said.Under Trump's renewed immigration policies, ICE operations have ramped up in major cities, including Chicago, Miami, and Newark. According to NBC News, ICE has arrested over 4,800 individuals since Trump returned to office, with the administration promising even more aggressive measures in the coming weeks.Concerns have been raised about ICE's activities in sensitive locations such as schools, with Homan justifying such operations by citing public safety and national security threats. Critics argue that targeting educational institutions spreads fear among students and undermines trust in local communities.In an appearance on Megyn Kelly ’s YouTube show, Homan entertained the idea of offering financial incentives for immigrants to ""self-deport."" Kelly suggested providing a financial payout to encourage voluntary departures, a proposal Homan said was under consideration but did not elaborate on.The heightened deportation measures have sparked outrage, with celebrities like Selena Gomez publicly condemning the administration’s actions. Gomez, whose family has Mexican roots, posted an emotional message on Instagram, expressing sorrow for the affected families. Though the posts were later deleted, her words highlighted the human cost of the intensified ICE operations.Homan dismissed criticisms, including from public figures, stating on Fox News: “If they don’t like it, they should go to Congress and change the law. We’re going to do this operation without apology.”","Tom Homan, former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), expressed frustration over the challenges ICE agents face in sanctuary cities.

Allegations against Sheryl Sandberg and Jeff Zients

Delaware court’s sanctions: Key legal findings

Sheryl Sandberg’s response and public defense

The Cambridge Analytica scandal and Meta’s ongoing legal battles

Sheryl Sandberg , the former Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Meta, is currently embroiled in a growing series of legal and professional difficulties. Following a public fallout with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg , who reportedly criticized her handling of company policies, Sandberg now faces a legal battle stemming from allegations related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal . The latest development involves a Delaware court sanctioning Sandberg for allegedly deleting critical emails tied to a shareholder lawsuit.In the wake of Sheryl Sandberg’s departure from Meta in 2022, tensions between her and the company’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, have surfaced in the public domain. Recent reports indicate that Zuckerberg criticized Sandberg for her role in the company's controversial policies regarding culture and inclusivity during a meeting with Stephen Miller, a senior advisor to former President Donald Trump. This public rift marks a significant moment in Meta’s ongoing challenges with internal leadership and corporate policy. Zuckerberg’s criticisms came just days before the news broke of Sandberg’s involvement in a legal case concerning her actions related to Facebook’s data privacy issues.The legal case against Sheryl Sandberg and former Meta board member Jeff Zients stems from a shareholder lawsuit filed in late 2024. As per reports, the shareholders claim that Sandberg and Zients used personal email accounts to discuss matters related to a 2018 lawsuit. The lawsuit alleged that Facebook's leadership, including Sandberg, violated the law and their fiduciary duties concerning user privacy. The plaintiffs contend that Sandberg and Zients communicated on personal email platforms—specifically Gmail accounts—while discussing the legal case. These discussions allegedly included topics related to Facebook’s handling of user data, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal.In addition to using personal email accounts, the plaintiffs assert that Sandberg and Zients deleted emails from these accounts despite an existing court order instructing them to preserve all relevant documents. The shareholders’ claims are based on the notion that such actions not only contravened legal obligations but also undermined the transparency necessary to address the privacy concerns raised by the Cambridge Analytica incident.The Delaware court, which is overseeing the shareholder lawsuit, recently issued a ruling in response to the allegations. The judge found the claims credible, specifically noting that Sandberg used a personal Gmail account under a pseudonym to communicate about the case. The court also highlighted inconsistencies in Sandberg’s responses to interrogatories and questions posed by the plaintiffs. These inconsistencies suggested that she may have intentionally deleted emails, as opposed to relying on an automatic deletion function that could have explained the missing messages.As a consequence, the judge raised the burden of proof required for Sandberg’s defense. Instead of the typical ""preponderance of the evidence"" standard, Sandberg must now meet a higher threshold—""clear and convincing"" evidence—if she intends to defend herself against the allegations. This shift in legal standards makes it more challenging for Sandberg to successfully prove her case. Furthermore, the court awarded certain legal expenses to the plaintiffs, further escalating the financial and reputational stakes for Sandberg.In response to the court’s findings, a spokesperson for Sandberg has denied the allegations, asserting that ""all work emails were preserved on Facebook’s servers."" Sandberg’s legal team argues that the claims made by the plaintiffs are unfounded and that any deletions were inadvertent or irrelevant to the case.Despite these defenses, the court’s decision to raise the burden of proof and the ongoing legal developments have added significant pressure on Sandberg. The case has not only brought her personal actions into the spotlight but has also drawn attention to Meta’s broader issues with data privacy and transparency.The allegations against Sandberg are inextricably linked to the infamous Cambridge Analytica scandal, which remains one of the most significant data privacy issues in modern corporate history. In 2018, it was revealed that Facebook had allowed the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to harvest the personal data of millions of users without their consent.This violation of user privacy led to widespread public outrage and regulatory scrutiny. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigated the company and, in 2019, imposed a historic $5 billion fine on Meta for violating a 2012 FTC order. The order had prohibited Meta (formerly Facebook) from collecting and sharing user data without clear consent. Additionally, Meta has faced regulatory challenges from European authorities, further compounding the company’s legal troubles.The shareholder lawsuit against Sandberg and Zients forms part of the broader fallout from these ongoing data privacy concerns. As former executives, Sandberg and Zients are now under intense scrutiny for their roles in the company’s actions during and after the Cambridge Analytica scandal.",Sheryl Sandberg is embroiled in a growing series of legal and professional difficulties.

My candidacy will engage an entirely new demographic of people into our party and into the Canadian political system.""“Dhalla made history as the first woman of Indian-origin elected as an MP for three terms and is now aiming to be the first Canadian prime minister of colour,” read a release from her campaign team.In her campaign release, Dhalla outlined her vision for the future. ""I look forward to standing up for Canadians and fighting for Canada. As leader, I will bring the party back into the hands of the members and return it to the centre with practical solutions to the challenges that Canadians are facing.

Dhalla, an Indian-origin former MP, represented the now-defunct riding of Brampton-Springdale from 2004 to 2011.

Tamil-Telugu Unity: Can JD Vance's team help make Vivek Ramaswamy the Governor of Ohio?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tamil-telugu-unity-can-jd-vances-team-help-make-vivek-ramaswamy-the-governor-of-ohio/articleshow/117637596.cms,"sambhar (a sour lentli-based stew).

A Yale Connection with Political Consequences



18-Year-Old Vivek Ramaswamy Takes Over the Graduation Stage, Demonstrating His Alpha Male Skills

Vivek's Avengers Assemble



Navigating a Crowded Field



The Fallout from DOGE



JD Vance’s Role



The Usha Factor



Challenges Ahead



There’s a running joke in desi circles that the Telugu vs Tamil fight was settled once and for all when the Trump-Vance ticket trumped Harris-Walz in the 2024 US Presidential election race. The received wisdom went that Harris, whose mother was Tamil, was trumped by the ""Hillbily"" JD Vance, who has become so by virtue of his marriage to Usha an honorary Telugu.For those not familiar with the dynamics, the Telugu-Tamil battle is as old as the time when the two states were both part of the Madras Presidency before being divided into two states ( Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh ) along linguistic lines. The Tamil-Telugu rivalry continues in all aspects, including cinema, the true origin of grandmaster Gukesh (is he a Tamilian because he learnt his chess in Chennai?) and who makes betterOf course, all that’s a joke because the two big representatives in the MAGA camp – Vivek Ramaswamy , whose parents came from Andhra Pradesh, and JD and Usha Vance – get along rather well and are buddies from their Yale days. In fact, in what will be a rare win for Vivek, who has only garnered negative headlines recently, the former presidential candidate is bringing on board JD Vance’s top operatives to launch his gubernatorial campaign in Ohio.Vivek Ramaswamy and JD Vance first crossed paths at Yale Law School, where they built a friendship rooted in mutual respect and shared ambitions.Both men emerged as unconventional conservatives, leveraging their outsider status to carve significant political and cultural influence. Vance’s journey from bestselling author of Hillbilly Elegy to Vice President of the US reflects his ability to connect with working-class voters. Ramaswamy , on the other hand, has made waves with his unapologetic defence of free-market principles, his critiques of “woke” culture, and his emphasis on intellectual achievement.Their partnership has now extended into the political arena, with Vance lending his top advisers to Ramaswamy’s campaign. The move underscores a shared vision for Ohio’s future and a broader strategy to solidify their influence within the Republican Party.Ramaswamy’s campaign team reads like a who’s who of Republican political operatives. Andy Surabian and Jai Chabria, who played pivotal roles in Vance’s Senate and vice-presidential campaigns, have joined the effort. Chabria, a seasoned Ohio strategist, will serve as the campaign’s general consultant. Surabian, a veteran of Trump’s earlier races, will oversee an outside political organisation aligned with Ramaswamy.The team also includes Tony Fabrizio, the pollster who contributed to Vance’s successful 2022 Senate bid and has worked on several Trump campaigns. Arthur Schwartz, a close ally of both Vance and Donald Trump Jr., is also on board. Additionally, veterans from Ramaswamy’s 2024 presidential run – Ben Yoho, Michael Biundo, and Chris Grant – will play significant roles in the campaign.These hirings reflect a strategic alignment between Ramaswamy and the broader Republican establishment. With advisers who have proven their mettle in high-stakes campaigns, Ramaswamy is well-positioned to navigate what is expected to be a competitive primary to replace term-limited Republican Governor Mike DeWine in 2026.Ramaswamy’s path to the governor’s mansion is far from guaranteed. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost has already declared his candidacy, tapping Justin Clark, a veteran of Trump’s campaigns, as his general consultant. State Treasurer Robert Sprague is also expected to enter the race soon. Both candidates have strong ties to Ohio’s political machinery, posing formidable challenges to Ramaswamy’s outsider bid.However, Ramaswamy’s national profile and ties to influential figures like Vance and Trump give him a unique edge. His ability to articulate a vision that resonates with Ohio voters while leveraging his connections to the MAGA movement will be critical to his success.Ramaswamy’s campaign comes on the heels of his departure from the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he served briefly before parting ways. His exit has been the subject of intense speculation, with some pointing to his controversial comments on immigration and academic excellence as contributing factors.In December, Ramaswamy sparked a firestorm with a tweet criticising what he described as America’s “cultural veneration of mediocrity.” He argued that the US had deprioritised academic excellence in favour of social conformity, suggesting this cultural failing was why top tech companies often hired foreign-born engineers over native-born Americans. The tweet polarised audiences, earning praise from some for its boldness while drawing criticism from others who accused him of elitism and undermining American workers.The controversy reportedly exacerbated tensions with Elon Musk, a key figure within DOGE and a close adviser to Trump. Sources suggest Musk viewed Ramaswamy’s gubernatorial ambitions as a distraction from DOGE’s mission to streamline federal bureaucracy, ultimately leading to his ouster.For JD Vance, supporting Ramaswamy’s bid is both a strategic and personal decision. As Vice President, Vance’s influence within the Republican Party has grown significantly, and his endorsement carries considerable weight. By aligning his team with Ramaswamy, Vance is flexing his political muscle and signalling his confidence in their shared vision for conservative governance.Vance’s involvement also reflects a broader effort to build a coalition of like-minded leaders who can advance the America First agenda. With his deep roots in Ohio and his close relationship with Ramaswamy, Vance’s support could prove decisive in shaping the outcome of the gubernatorial race.Another dimension of the Ramaswamy-Vance alliance is their shared connection to Usha Vance, JD Vance’s wife. A practising Hindu, Usha has faced both admiration and criticism within the MAGA movement, which often grapples with questions of inclusivity and multiculturalism. Her presence at Vance’s side has helped normalise non-Christian identities within a movement that has historically emphasised Christian nationalism.For Ramaswamy, who is unapologetically Hindu, this shared cultural identity underscores the complexities of navigating a movement that often views multiculturalism with suspicion. While his faith sets him apart from many in the Republican base, it also positions him as a symbol of the movement’s potential to broaden its appeal.As Ramaswamy prepares to launch his campaign, he faces a series of challenges that will test his political acumen and resilience. His polarising views on immigration, education, and cultural values will undoubtedly attract scrutiny from both opponents and allies. Additionally, his brief tenure at DOGE and his subsequent departure could become a focal point for critics seeking to question his commitment to the MAGA agenda.However, Ramaswamy’s strengths lie in his ability to articulate a compelling vision and connect with voters on issues that resonate deeply with them. His emphasis on intellectual achievement, free-market principles, and government efficiency aligns closely with the priorities of many conservative voters. By leveraging his national profile and the support of key figures like JD Vance, he has a strong foundation from which to build his campaign.",Vivek Ramaswamy and JD Vance first crossed paths at Yale Law School.

Moving to Substack

Jim Acosta , the veteran CNN anchor and former White House correspondent , has departed the network after nearly two decades. Announcing his resignation during his final broadcast, Acosta said he decided to leave rather than accept a shift to a midnight-to-2 am time slot, part of CNN’s recent programming reshuffle.Hours later, Acosta revealed his next move, launching an independent platform on Substack .During his last broadcast on CNN, Acosta delivered a pointed message, seemingly aimed at his longtime adversary, Donald Trump . “Don’t give in to the lies. Don’t give in to the fear. Hold on to the truth and hope,” he told viewers. Reflecting on his career, Acosta highlighted his coverage of former President Barack Obama’s 2016 visit to Cuba, where he interviewed Raul Castro, as a personal and professional milestone. He called it a lesson in resilience, stating, “It is never a good time to bow down to a tyrant.”As per The New York Post, Acosta, who is of Cuban descent , connected his experience to his commitment to holding power to account.Acosta announced his new venture via a video on X (formerly Twitter) shortly after leaving CNN. “I’m going independent, at least for now,” he said in the video, which introduced his new Substack platform, The Jim Acosta Show. He plans to use the platform to discuss politics and current events while fostering thoughtful conversations about pressing issues.According to The Wrap, Acosta joins a growing list of prominent journalists, such as Taylor Lorenz and Matt Taibbi, who have transitioned to Substack to pursue independent journalism . In his introductory message on the platform, Acosta reiterated his farewell message: “Do not give in to the lies. Do not give in to fear. Hold on to the truth, and hope.”Donald Trump, a frequent critic of Acosta during his presidency, reacted to the news of his departure with a scathing post on Truth Social, labelling Acosta a “major loser” and celebrating his exit as “good news.”However, Acosta replied to Trump’s post on social media platform X and wrote, “ Looks like somebody has ADS: Acosta Derangement Syndrome”.Earlier, CNN offered a gracious statement and praised Acosta for his commitment to journalistic freedoms, stating, “Jim has had a long, distinguished nearly 20-year career at CNN, with a track record of standing up to authority... We want to thank him for the dedication and commitment he’s brought to his reporting and wish him the very best in the future.”","Jim Acosta announces independent venture after leaving CNN, reacts to Trump’s ‘major loser’ comment.

'Will cause chaos': Trump administration offers 7-month salary to 3 million federal workers if they opt to resign by February 6,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/will-cause-chaos-trump-administration-offers-7-month-salary-to-3-million-federal-workers-if-they-opt-to-resign-by-february-6/articleshow/117660913.cms,"US President Donald Trump (AP)

The White House announced late on Tuesday that US federal employees are being offered buyouts equal to seven months of salary if they choose to leave their jobs by February 6. This is part of President Donald Trump's plan to restructure the US government.A memo from the office of personnel management outlines four directives for the federal workforce, including a requirement for most employees to return to full-time in-office work.The memo includes details of a "" deferred resignation programme "" for those opting to leave.It says, ""If you choose not to continue in your current role in the federal workforce, we thank you for your service to your country and you will be provided with a dignified, fair departure from the federal government utilising a deferred resignation programme. This programme begins effective January 28 and is available to all federal employees until February 6.""The memo also says, ""If you resign under this programme, you will retain all pay and benefits regardless of your daily workload and will be exempted from all applicable in-person work requirements until September 30.""President Donald Trump has repeatedly highlighted his commitment to disrupting Washington and has promised that his second term would further challenge traditional political norms. The impact of offering buyouts to a large number of federal employees, however, remains uncertain.The federal government employs over 3 million people, making it one of the largest workforces in the country. According to Pew Research Center data based on OPM figures, the average federal employee serves for 11.8 years. Even if a small portion of employees accept the buyout, it could lead to economic consequences and disruptions in federal services nationwide.Potential departures could affect a range of critical roles, including Veterans Affairs health workers, loan processors, military contractors, food inspectors, scientists monitoring water quality, and employees responsible for air travel and product safety. The scale and effects of such exits remain unclear.Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees union, criticized the buyout offer, describing it as a strategy to pressure employees viewed as disloyal to the administration into leaving. Kelley said, ""Purging the federal government of dedicated career federal employees will have vast, unintended consequences that will cause chaos for the Americans who depend on a functioning federal government.""The memo also includes instructions on how to accept the buyout program, saying: ""Upon review of the below deferred resignation letter, if you wish to resign: Select ‘Reply’ to this email. You must reply from your government account.""It adds: ""Type the word ""Resign' into the body of this email and hit 'send.'""",US federal employees are being offered buyouts equal to seven months of salary if they choose to leave their jobs by February 6.

There were also private individuals flying drones, Leavitt said.

RFK Jr is addicted to attention and power and discouraged parents from vaccinating their children while he innoculated his own children, the cousin said.“I have known Bobby my whole life; we grew up together,” wrote Kennedy. “It’s no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets because he himself is a predator.""“His basement, his garage, his dorm room were the centers of the action where drugs were available, and he enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks. It was often a perverse scene of despair and violence.”She praised Kennedy Jr . for “pulling himself out of illness and disease” but lamented the “siblings and cousins who Bobby encouraged down the path of substance abuse suffered addiction, illness, and death while Bobby has gone on to misrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life.”“I have never wanted to speak publicly about my family members and their challenges,” she wrote.Robert F. Kennedy Jr. can only lose three Republican votes, if all Democrats vote against him, and still be confirmed. He has two confirmation hearings, one on Wednesday and one on Thursday.A conservative group founded by former Vice President Mike Pence released an ad showing President Donald Trump calling Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “a radical left plant,” as the group urged Republicans to vote against Kennedy as nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary. Pence’s group, Advancing American Freedom, released a 57-second advertisement a day before Kennedy’s hearing begins, compiling Trump’s past criticisms of Kennedy, including the now-president calling Kennedy an “extreme liberal” and saying “don’t think you’re going to vote for him and feel good ... I’d even take [Joe] Biden over Junior.”","Caroline Kennedy wrote a letter to the senators ahead of his confirmation as the health secretary calling him a predator whose victims ranged from family members to the parents of sick children.

LONDON: Baloch leader Hyrbyair Marri brought attention to the ongoing horrors that the Pashtun and Baloch communities endure under Pakistan 's repressive control in a stirring statement to the Pashtun National Council (Jirga). Marri brought attention to the Pakiststate's systematic exploitation, enforced disappearances, and violence against various ethnic communities.""The sufferings of the Baloch and Pashtun under Pakistan's occupation are countless and unending,"" Marri stated, emphasizing the urgent need for unity between the two nations to resist colonial oppression.He recalled previous instances of solidarity, such as the treaty of kalat in 1758, in which Afghan and Baloch leaders promised to respect and support one another. He asked both groups to rekindle this spirit in their struggle for independence.Marri compared British imperialism to the colonial strategies that Pakistan acquired. He denounced Pakistan's continuous military actions in Balochistan , pointing to unlawful executions, torture, and enforced disappearances as means of quelling dissent. The Baloch leader cited the targeted profiling of Pashtuns and killings like the 1948 Barbra event in Charsadda, claiming that these practices were continuations of the British heritage of divide and conquer.Recalling how Pashtun tribes were utilized as frontline combatants in 1948 while Punjabi elites remained behind, he also denounced Pakistan's abuse of Baloch and Pashtun youth. He also drew attention to the fact that thousands of Baloch youths were forcibly drafted into the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and sent to die under pretences of religious salvation.Marri condemned Pakistan's racial profiling of Afghan refugees, primarily Pashtuns, and their forced deportation as a pressure tactic against Afghanistan. ""These people have lived here for generations, yet they are treated as disposable,"" he said.Calling for a renewed alliance between the Baloch and Pashtun nations, Marri declared, ""Our unity is the path to freedom. Together, we will break the chains of occupation and build a future rooted in justice, sovereignty, and peace.""","Baloch leader Hyrbyair Marri spoke to the Pashtun National Council (Jirga) Marri condemned Pakistan's systematic exploitation, enforced disappearances, and violence against various ethnic communities.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan criminalised online disinformation on Tuesday, passing legislation that enshrines punishments of up to three years in prison, a decision journalists say is designed to crack down on dissent.The law targets anyone who ""intentionally disseminates"" information online that they have ""reason to believe to be false or fake and likely to cause or create a sense of fear, panic or disorder or unrest"".The law was rushed through the national assembly with little warning last week before being approved by the senate on Tuesday as journalists walked out of the gallery in protest.Senior journalist Asif Bashir Chaudhry, a member of the Pakistan federal union of journalists , told AFP the government had assured reporters they would be consulted but said they were ""betrayed and backstabbed"".""We genuinely wanted a law against misinformation, but if it's not being done through open discussion but rather through fear and coercion, we will challenge it on every available platform,"" Chaudhry said.""Even under dictatorships, legislation was not forcefully rammed through parliament the way this government is doing now.""The bill will now be passed to the president to be rubber-stamped.Analysts say the government is struggling with legitimacy after an election plagued with rigging allegations and with Pakistan's most popular politician, former prime minister Imran Khan , in jail on a slew of corruption charges his party says are politically motivated.Khan's supporters and senior leaders have also faced a severe crackdown, with thousands rounded up.Social media site X has been shut down in the wake of elections last February, as posts alleging vote tampering spread on the platform.Khan's name is censored from television and editors have reported increasing monitoring of their programming.Senator Syed Shibli Faraz, a member of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, called the new law ""highly undemocratic"" and said it would ""fuel the political victimisation"" of their activists.However, government minister Tanveer Hussain said that the bill would focus on policing social media.""I am sure that in the future, the anarchy caused in society through social media will be controlled,"" he said.There has been a proliferation of ""disinformation"" laws, including criminal legislation, worldwide in the past decade enabling governments to control speech online and police ""fake news"", according to human rights organisation Article 19 .Such laws can impede journalism, according to the group, which promotes freedom of expression and information globally.","Law targets anyone who ""intentionally disseminates"" information online that they have ""reason to believe to be false or fake"" Law rushed through national assembly with little warning before being approved by the senate.

He sentenced the four men to death and also fined them 4.6 million Pakistani rupees (approximately $16,000). They were identified as Rana Usman, Ashfaque Ali, Salman Sajjad, and Wajid Ali.According to the court order, dated Jan 24, the four individuals were sentenced to death by hanging for using derogatory remarks against the Holy Prophet. They were also sentenced to life in prison for defiling the Holy Quran and to 10 years’ imprisonment for deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. “All the sentences shall run concurrently,” the order read.The prosecution lawyer said the case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used. The men’s lawyer, Manzoor Rahmani, criticised the court’s order, saying doubts and uncertainties that arise in such cases are ignored by the courts, likely due to fear of a religious backlash and potential mob violence against the judge if the accused is acquitted.“We are preparing our appeals against the decision and will go to the high court,” Rahmani said. A member of a support group formed by the families of the accused was quoted by media as saying the pattern of arrests and prosecutions in this case was consistent with previous ones.“We urge the government to establish a commission to investigate the rise in these cases before these young individuals spend the best years of their lives behind bars,” said the support group member.Critics say blasphemy accusations, whether true or false, often lead to lengthy prison sentences on death row and solitary confinement. The laws, according to them, are often abused to settle scores or used to target members of Pakistan’s religious minorities.Hundreds of people have been accused of blasphemy since the draconian laws were introduced by former dictator Gen Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan jailed former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , on Monday challenged in a high court their conviction in the Al-Qadir Trust case .

A Pakistani court on Monday awarded death penalty to four men for ""online blasphemy"" against the Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book Quran.The four were charged with spreading blasphemous content online against Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book.""They were sentenced to death... on Friday for spreading blasphemous content online against the Prophet Mohammed and the Quran,"" Rao Abdur Raheem, a lawyer from the legal commission on blasphemy Pakistan, a private group which brought the case to court, told news agency AFP.""Our case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used in this heinous act,"" he added.The four men were sentenced in Rawalpindi, the garrison city that neighbours the capital Islamabad.A member of a support group formed by the families, however, said to AFP that they would challenge the conviction.""The pattern of arrests and prosecutions in this case is consistent with previous ones,"" said the support group member, who spoke on condition of anonymity told the news agency.""We urge the government to establish a commission to investigate the rise in these cases before these young individuals spend the best years of their lives behind bars,"" the member added.Blasphemy laws in Pakistan are among the strictest in the world, carrying severe punishments, including the death penalty, for offences against Islam.These laws, primarily enshrined in Sections 295-298 of the Pakistan Penal Code, criminalise acts such as insulting the Prophet Muhammad, desecrating the Quran, or offending religious sentiments.These laws have often been criticised for being misused to target minorities, settle personal disputes, and incite mob violence. The lack of safeguards against false accusations has led to numerous cases where individuals face imprisonment, violence, or even extrajudicial killings without substantial evidence.The blasphemy laws have sparked national and international debates about human rights and freedom of expression in Pakistan.Activists argue that these laws suppress religious minorities, limit free speech, and create a climate of fear, while conservative groups strongly defend them as essential to protecting Islam.High-profile cases, such as those of Asia Bibi and Salman Taseer, have highlighted the deep divisions in Pakistani society regarding these laws. Successive governments have been reluctant to amend or repeal the legislation due to the risk of backlash from religious hardliners. As a result, blasphemy remains a highly sensitive issue, with calls for legal reforms often met with strong resistance.","Pakistani court awards death penalty to four men for ""online blasphemy"" against the Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book Quran.

LAHORE: A Pakistani court has awarded a death sentence and 80-year imprisonment to four persons for uploading blasphemous content on Facebook , an official said on Saturday. Additional Sessions Judge Mohammad Tariq Ayub on Friday convicted four suspects -- Wajid Ali, Ahfaq Ali Saqib, Rana Usman and Suleman Sajid -- for insulting Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), his companions, and his wives.The court official said the convicts uploaded blasphemous content on Facebook from four different IDs.""The judge after hearing arguments of both prosecution and defence and witnesses accounts awarded the death penalty and 80 years imprisonment to each of them on different counts,"" the official said.They were also slapped with a fine of PKR 5.2 million.Pakistan's Federal Investigation (FIA) Cybercrime registered a case under Section 11 of the PECA (Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act) and 295A, 295B, 295C, 298A, 109 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of Shiraz Farooqi, a citizen.According to Amnesty International , Pakistan's blasphemy laws are often used against religious minorities and others who are the target of false accusations, while emboldening vigilantes prepared to threaten or kill the accused.""There is overwhelming evidence that Pakistan's blasphemy laws violate human rights and encourage people to take the law into their own hands. Once a person is accused, they become ensnared in a system that offers them few protections, presumes them guilty, and fails to safeguard them against people willing to use violence,"" it said.Amnesty International added that in perversion of the justice system, the accused are often presumed to be guilty based on little or no evidence.""Once an accusation of blasphemy is made, the police can arrest the accused, without even checking to see if the charges make sense. Bowing to public pressure from angry crowds, including religious clerics and their supporters, they frequently pass cases on to prosecutors without scrutinising the evidence.

These incidents, once limited to rural communities, now frequently occur in urban areas nationwide.While the country is coping with bankruptcy and militants, the violence against women just add one more spot to Pakistan's reputation.Reports indicate that in Village Qabil Chachar near Obaro, District Ghotki, Bhoral Chachar fatally shot his daughter-in-law, Razia, and her alleged paramour, Majid Chachar. The perpetrator voluntarily surrendered to authorities with the weapon, admitting to shooting them upon discovering them together, Geo News reported.Authorities transported the deceased to a nearby hospital for post-mortem examination.In Bungul Dero, Larkana, a separate incident involved the killing of Riaz Brohi and Samina Brohi. The accused murdered the young man and his own wife in Nazar Muhalla before escaping. Police noted that Riaz Brohi had recently returned from Dubai.Despite strengthened legislation and advocacy efforts, these killings persist, often triggered by perceived transgressions of cultural and religious norms regarding female conduct, including alleged relationships or elopement.In Village Taj Muhammad Chandio near Kubbo Saeedkhan, District Qambar-Shahdadkot, Sultan Chandio shot his sister-in-law, Rukhsana Chandio, and her alleged companion, Bakhat Janwari, before fleeing.At Pir Jalil near Humayoun Police Station in Shikarpur, Zamir Maarfani fatally shot his wife, Khanzadi, citing Karo Kari before escaping.

BALOCHISTAN: Baloch activist Mahrang Baloch has called on human rights organisations to address the internet blackout in Dalbandin.

Such actions not only stifle freedom of expression and assembly but also set a dangerous precedent of suppressing dissent through force and digital censorship.""""I urge these organizations to pressure the authorities to restore internet services without delay and to ensure that the fundamental rights of the Baloch people to assemble peacefully and voice their concerns are respected. The international community must not remain silent in the face of these repressive measures, as their silence could embolden further human rights violations in the Balochistan,"" the post added.Notably, the internet blackout comes days before Baloch Genocide Remembrance Day , scheduled for January 25, when the people of Balochistan will come together to protest the ongoing atrocities.Serious concerns are being raised due to this history of repression, with fears that the government may use violence to suppress peaceful opposition in Dalbandin once again.The internet blackout heightens concerns among Baloch Youth Conference (BYC) organizers about a possible crackdown on the event. The shutdown severely limits the Baloch people's ability to record and share their experiences of human rights violations, as communication routes are cut off.On Thursday, Mahrang Baloch, in her post on X, said that Pakistauthorities have imposed an internet blackout in Dalbandin.

Pakistan’s parliament places curbs on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-parliament-places-curbs-on-social-media/articleshow/117496291.cms,"This is a representational image

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s National Assembly approved on Thursday amendments to the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), granting govt unbridled powers to regulate and control social media platforms, including the authority to send users to prison for spreading disinformation.The bill was hastily passed after opposition lawmakers staged a walkout to denounce the law. The legislation sparked widespread protests, particularly among journalists, with critics saying the govt is seeking to further suppress freedom of speech.The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, introduced in the National Assembly on Wednesday, would establish an agency with the authority to order the immediate removal of “unlawful and offensive” content from social media, such as content critical of judges, the armed forces, parliament, or provincial assemblies. Individuals and companies who post such content may also be blocked on social media.The law requires social media platforms to register with the new Social Media Protection and Regulatory Authority, and those that do not comply may face temporary or permanent bans. The bill also makes misinformation a criminal offence punishable with three years in prison and a Pakistani Rs 2 million fine ($7,150).Govt’s decision to ratify the bill comes nearly a year after Pakistan blocked the platform ‘X’ ahead of an election that Imran Khan’s opposition party claims was rigged. ‘X’ is still restricted in the country, but many individuals use virtual private networks to get around it, much like in other countries with strict internet censorship.The law also broadens the definition of prohibited content to include material that promotes violence, bigotry, or defamation, as well as content that is harmful to national security.The legislation was passed with overwhelming support in the National Assembly, despite protests from members of the press.As the bill was introduced, journalists staged a walkout from the press gallery in protest, condemning what they called restrictions on press freedom and the potential for govt overreach in regulating online discourse.The Peca amendments also pave the way for a new social media protection tribunal to expedite cases involving online crimes, with the tribunal required to resolve cases within 90 days.Furthermore, the bill proposes the dissolution of the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) cyber crime wing, with its responsibilities transferring to the newly established National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency.Opposition leaders have voiced strong concerns over the amendments, accusing the government of using the law to suppress dissent and limit freedom of expression online. The current govt, however, maintains that the changes are necessary to safeguard the public from harmful and illegal content that could disrupt national security.","Pakistan's National Assembly approved amendments to the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) The bill was hastily passed after opposition lawmakers staged a walkout to denounce the law.

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka announced the lifting of a five-year ban on vehicle imports Tuesday as the country showed further signs of emerging from its worst economic meltdown.Information minister Nalinda Jayatissa said buses, trucks and utility vehicles will be allowed in from Saturday under a phased removal of restrictions in place since 2020.""We are moving very cautiously because we don't want a surge of imports that will deplete our foreign reserves,"" Jayatissa told reporters in Colombo.""Depending on the demand, we will open imports of other categories of vehicles such as cars, motorcycles and three-wheelers.""He said the imports were necessary to generate much-needed tax revenue, and the government hoped to cap imports at about $1.2 billion this year.Current tax rates on vehicles are over 300 per cent.Sri Lanka spent $1.4 billion on vehicle imports in 2019, the last full year before the import ban was imposed in March 2020.The island nation earlier attempted to end the ban on commercial vehicle imports in August 2023, but importers were unable to open letters of credit while the country was still in default on its foreign debt.Sri Lanka formally ended its status as a bankrupt nation in December after securing debt restructuring deals with both bilateral and private creditors.Sri Lanka defaulted on its $46 billion external debt in April 2022 as the country ran out of foreign exchange to finance imports, causing painful shortages of food, fuel and medicines.Months of street protests led to the toppling of then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was accused of corruption and mismanagement.His successor secured a bailout loan from the international monetary fund , which has said that the South Asian nation is making a recovery but is still not out of the woods.","Buses, trucks and utility vehicles will be allowed in from Saturday under a phased removal of restrictions in place since 2020.

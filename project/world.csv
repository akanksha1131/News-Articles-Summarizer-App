TIANGUISTENGO: When a river that winds through the mountains of central Mexico suddenly turned into a crushing wall of water this week, it practically wiped the 400-person village of Chapula off the map.Residents only had time to shout, warning neighbors living along the riverbanks, and desperately seek shelter from the deadly flooding and landslides that have cut off 300 towns in central and eastern Mexico from the outside world.Thousands of soldiers and workers scrambled Tuesday to rescue civilians and unblock roads.""There's nothing left. It wiped out houses, it wiped out the bridge, it wiped out everything. The only thing left standing was the church and the warehouse where we were seeking refuge,"" said 21-year-old Stephanie Ramirez, who was part of a group of elderly, women and children who stumbled off a rescue helicopter Tuesday.The government confirmed that at least 64 people have died due to the torrential rains. Dozens are still missing and officials warn the full extent of the devastation in remote towns of a couple hundred to 1,000 residents remains unknown.The rains were triggered by the convergence of two tropical storms churning off Mexico's western coast, striking at the end of an unusually heavy rainy season that has left rivers overflowing and hillsides weakened.Ramirez and her grandmother were evacuated after days of hoping help would come. The rest of her family and dozens of their neighbors were still waiting to be evacuated. As more rain threatened to pour down, they sought shelter on a nearby hillside on the verge of collapsing next to the still-swollen river.""We have to get them out. They're in constant danger there,"" Ramirez said.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that one of the government's priorities was to open roads and ""to secure air bridges, food supplies, water, and check on how each person is faring.""Thousands of military and civilian personnel were working tirelessly on those efforts Tuesday, but in Chapula, residents decided to organise on their own. According to Ramirez, they called their relatives in the United States, ""and it was them who made arrangements to get us out of there little-by-little.""With help from residents of the nearby town of Tianguistengo, a private air bridge began operating, using a borrowed helicopter to evacuate groups of about half a dozen people at a time, while other residents organised bags of basic goods to carry on foot, with some soldiers, to neighboring villages that were still cut off.""We think it's about six or seven hours walking, but we want people to know that we're working ... that they can see we also care about their situation,"" said local resident Neptali Rodriguez.The hardest-hit states are Veracruz, Hidalgo and Puebla. In Hidalgo alone, where roughly half of the isolated villages are located, about 100,000 homes were damaged or destroyed by flooding rivers and mudslides. In Veracruz, where at least 29 people died, rainfall reached 24 inches in just four days. Veracruz Gov. Rocio Nahle said more than 300,000 people were affected in the state alone.On Tuesday, public officials were going door-to-door in cities like Poza Rica, Veracruz, where water from the overflowing Cazones River on Friday reached 13 feet (four meters) high in some areas. They were asking residents if anyone was missing.According to the National Civil Protection Coordination, 67 people were still unaccounted for as of Tuesday.Health teams had began fumigating affected areas to prevent outbreaks of dengue, a disease spread by mosquitoes.In Poza Rica, resident Roberto Olvera said an oil refinery alarm alerted him to rising waters.""It was terrifying, many people in the neighborhood couldn't escape,"" he said. Floodwaters there also left a black, oily residue believed to have come from nearby oil and gas installations, coating trees and rooftops.Dozens of health centers were damaged, including one in Alamo, Veracruz, where floodwaters reached two meters (6.5 feet), destroying all equipment. Local health director Marti Batres said medical staff are now working outdoors.While thousands of soldiers and rescue teams search for the missing and deliver aid, helicopters are ferrying supplies to isolated zones and private construction firms are helping to reopen key roads.Sheinbaum said there are enough resources to respond and that the government ""will spare no expense during this emergency.""",Thousands of soldiers and workers scrambled Tuesday to rescue civilians and unblock roads.

'Reasonable notice not given': Judge temporarily blocks land transfer for Trump's presidential library; cites 'violation' of Florida law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/reasonable-notice-not-given-judge-temporarily-blocks-land-transfer-for-trumps-presidential-library-cites-violation-of-florida-law/articleshow/124565225.cms,"US President Donald Trump

College questions petitioner's ‘motives’

Property a ‘developer’s dream’





A Florida judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked the planned transfer of prime downtown Miami land for the future Donald J Trump presidential library. The library is set to be built on a plot owned by Miami Dade College.Circuit Judge Mavel Ruiz said the college’s board of trustees, which initially gifted the “sizable plot” of real estate to the state, had violated a Florida government law. According to Ruiz, the board “didn’t give the public reasonable notice ahead of the vote last month.”“This is not an easy decision,” Ruiz told reporters from the bench, as reported by The Associated Press. She added, “This is not a case, at least for this court, rooted in politics.”The lawsuit was filed last month by activist Marvin Dunn, who alleged that the board violated Florida’s “Government in the Sunshine” law by failing to provide sufficient notice for its special meeting on September 23, when it voted to give up the land.As per Dunn’s complaint, the agenda released ahead of the meeting “simply stated the board would consider conveying property to a state fund overseen by Florida governor Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet,” but it “provided no details on which piece of property was being considered or why.”Dunn also noted that, unlike every other meeting the board had held this year, this meeting was not livestreamed.A week later, DeSantis, who is from Trump's Republican Party, and other top officials voted to transfer the land again, effectively putting the property under the control of the president's family.The case comes despite DeSantis signing a bill earlier this year pre-empting local governments from blocking the development of the library, a move aimed at overruling potential opposition in liberal-leaning counties or municipalities.Jesus Suarez, an attorney for Miami Dade College, argued that the college did “what was required under the law” and questioned Marvin Dunn’s “political motivations” for filing the lawsuit.“There is no requirement under Florida law that there be specificity on notice, because those trustees can come into that room and talk to each other about whatever they wish,” Suarez said.Attorneys for Dunn countered that no one who wasn’t already aware of the deal could have known what the board would decide.“The people have a right to know what they’re going to decide to do when the transaction is so significant, so unusual and deprives the students and the college of this land,” plaintiff’s attorney Richard Brodsky told The Associated Press prior to the judge’s decision.The nearly 3-acre (1.2-hectare) property has been described as a “developer’s dream” and is valued at more than $67 million, according to a 2025 assessment by the Miami-Dade County property appraiser. Other Florida locations had previously been considered for the library, including sites associated with Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton and Florida International University in suburban Miami.","Donald J Trump's presidential library is set to be built on a plot owned by Miami Dade College.

FULL: Trump’s 1st Attack On Putin Amid Russia’s Fury Over Tomahawk Missiles For Kyiv | ‘Looking Bad’





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday voiced disappointment with Russian President Vladimir Putin for continuing the war in Ukraine, calling it the ""biggest conflict since World War II.""“Look, I’m very disappointed because Vladimir and I had a very good relationship — probably still do. I don’t know why he continues with this war. This war has been so bad for him,” Trump told reporters during a bilateral meeting with Argentine President Javier Milei at the White House.“He’s going into four years of a war he should have won in one week. He’s lost 1.5 million soldiers, or close to it — all the things that happen in horrible wars. It’s the biggest thing that has happened since World War II in terms of death,” he added.Trump’s comments came ahead of his scheduled meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House on Friday. The two leaders are expected to discuss ongoing US support for Kyiv.Trump had previously hosted Putin for talks on Ukraine at a military facility in Anchorage, Alaska, on August 15. That meeting marked the first in-person encounter between the two leaders during Trump’s second term, which began in January. His administration has been seeking to broker an end to the conflict or at least a temporary ceasefire, with Trump appointing a special envoy (Steve Witkoff) for the effort.Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine began on February 24, 2022, when Moscow launched what it called a “special military operation.”","US President Donald Trump voiced disappointment with Russian President Vladimir Putin for continuing the war in Ukraine.

Qatar vs UAE : High-stakes AFC World Cup 2026 qualifier decider





The final Group A match turned into a virtual knockout between two Gulf rivals, with direct World Cup qualification on the line.

Qatar doubles lead with clinical second-half display





Qatar’s attacking intent paid off again midway through the second half, as Akram Afif pulled the strings in a dominant display.

Late drama and a glimmer for UAE

A red card, a tense injury-time rally, and a goal added intensity to a match that refused to settle quietly.

Implications and what comes next

Qatar’s victory seals history; UAE must regroup for the final hurdle.





In a high-stakes AFC World Cup 2026 qualifying clash on October 14, 2025, Qatar edged past the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with a 2–1 win at the Jassim bin Hamad Stadium in Doha. The result secured Qatar’s qualification to next year’s tournament in the United States, Mexico, and Canada — their first ever achieved through the standard qualification route — while UAE, needing only a draw, were pushed into the playoff round.The fourth-round Group A fixture of the AFC World Cup qualifiers saw Qatar, UAE, and Oman vying for a single guaranteed berth. Coming into the match, the UAE topped the group after defeating Oman 2–1 on October 12. That result knocked Oman out and meant UAE required only a draw against Qatar to qualify directly. Qatar, on the other hand, had no margin for error — only a win would send them through.Despite a cagey, goalless first half, Qatar came out sharper in the second period. They struck early and firmly in the 49th minute when Boualem Khoukhi rose above the UAE defense to head in a precise free-kick delivery from Akram Afif. The goal shifted the momentum as Qatar tightened their grip on the match.UAE, though visibly shaken, pushed back. They found some rhythm and created half-chances but lacked the final ball to threaten goalkeeper Salah Zakaria Abunada.Akram Afif, Qatar’s standout performer of the night, delivered his second assist in the 74th minute. This time, he sent in a curling cross from the left flank, which Pedro Miguel met at the far post with a commanding header to double Qatar’s lead. The second goal provided a crucial cushion, shifting pressure entirely onto UAE’s shoulders.At this point, UAE’s chances of direct qualification were slipping fast. Head coach Paulo Bento made tactical substitutions in a bid to inject pace and urgency into the attack. Eric Mendes was brought on and proved to be a threat in the box, particularly during a flurry of late attempts.Drama unfolded in the 87th minute when Qatar were reduced to 10 men. Substitute Tarek Salman was sent off following a VAR review for a reckless challenge on Eric Mendes. Referee Mohammed Abdulla Hassan added 15 minutes of stoppage time, giving UAE a narrow window for a comeback.Eight minutes into the extended injury time, UAE capitalized. Sultan Adil struck from inside the area, beating Abunada to pull a goal back and ignite belief. UAE continued to press with urgency. Eric Mendes came close with a shot from close range, but a vital save from Abunada preserved Qatar’s lead.Despite the late surge, the UAE could not find the equalizer they desperately needed.With this win, Qatar finished at the top of Group A in the fourth round and became the seventh Asian team to confirm a spot at the 2026 World Cup, joining Australia, Japan, Iran, South Korea, Uzbekistan, and Jordan. This also marks Qatar’s second World Cup appearance, but the first earned through qualifiers — their 2022 debut came as tournament hosts.For the UAE, the loss means progression to the fifth round of playoffs, where their hopes of reaching a first World Cup since 1990 remain alive but now hang on a much narrower path. Their earlier 2–1 victory over Oman gave them the edge heading into this final group-stage match, but the failure to hold on for a draw has extended their campaign.In parallel, Saudi Arabia secured their spot in the 2026 FIFA World Cup with a 0-0 draw against Iraq today in Jeddah. Despite finishing level on points, Saudi Arabia topped the group on goals scored. Iraq will face the UAE next month in a two-legged playoff for a chance at the intercontinental playoffs, keeping their World Cup hopes alive.","Qatar edged past the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with a 2–1 win at the Jassim bin Hamad Stadium in Doha.

Gaza crackdown: Hamas posts video of public execution of 'collaborators and outlaws'; 4 hostages’ remains return to Israel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/gaza-crackdown-hamas-posts-video-of-public-execution-of-collaborators-and-outlaws-4-hostages-remains-return-to-israel/articleshow/124561763.cms,"(Source: X)





Hamas published a video on Monday showing eight blindfolded and kneeling men being executed in the streets, branding them ""collaborators and outlaws.""The footage surfaced amid armed clashes between Hamas security units and Palestinian clans, on the fifth day of a US-brokered truce between Israel and the militant group.Hamas proceeded to take control of Gaza on Tuesday, even as US President Donald Trump vowed to disarm the group under a recently brokered ceasefire.The Israeli military confirmed that the remains of four more hostages held in Gaza were handed to the Red Cross, following the release of four others and the safe return of 20 surviving captives.In northern Gaza, as Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza City, Hamas’s black-masked police resumed street patrols. Hamas’s Brigades helped control crowds when freed prisoners arrived in Gaza on Monday. A new Hamas security unit, called the Deterrence Force, has been targeting armed clans and gangs, some of which are said to have Israeli support.Hamas has dominated Gaza since 2007 after defeating rival faction Fatah. Israel insists Hamas must not play any role in a future Gaza government, hand back the remains of 24 deceased hostages, and eventually disarm.Trump has warned that those who refuse to surrender their weapons will be forcibly disarmed. The US-brokered 20-point peace plan, endorsed by world powers at a Trump-led summit in Egypt, demands a demilitarised Gaza and no leadership role for Hamas.Meanwhile, Israeli families continued pressing for the return of the remains of 24 hostages still held by Hamas.The Israeli army confirmed four more bodies were transferred to the Red Cross and on their way to custody. The military identified two victims as Guy Iluz, an Israeli national, and Bipin Joshi, an agriculture student from Nepal. Two others were later named as Yossi Sharabi and Daniel Peretz.Trump celebrated the ceasefire during a visit to Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and later joined regional leaders in Egypt to sign a declaration aimed at cementing the truce.","Hamas published a video on Monday showing eight blindfolded and kneeling men being executed in the streets, branding them ""collaborators and outlaws"" The footage surfaced amid armed clashes between Hamas security units and Palestinian clans, on the fifth day of a US-brokered truce between Israel and the militant group.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124561949,imgsize-395662,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Was Mr. FAFO part of Hamas?







A well-known Palestinian protester and influencer, popularly known online as “Mr FAFO,” was reportedly killed on Sunday amid violent clashes between Hamas and rival Palestinian factions in Gaza.The 27-year-old Saleh al-Jafarawi became known as “Mr FAFO” — short for “F** Around and Find Out”* — in Israeli media because he allegedly celebrated the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, which killed over 1,200 civilians and saw many taken hostage. Later in the war, he was also filmed crying in reaction to Israel’s airstrikes.Mixed reactions poured in following Jafarawi’s death. Many Israelis cheered the news, calling him a Hamas propagandist who fuelled anti-Israel sentiment. On the other hand, pro-Palestinian activists mourned his loss, remembering him as a passionate voice who documented the struggle in Gaza.Footage circulating online reportedly showed his body, with reports suggesting he was killed while covering the incident.After celebrating the October 7 invasion, “Mr FAFO” made more videos in which he pretended to be a doctor, a wounded patient, a fighter, and a journalist.These videos went viral but drew widespread ridicule, especially from pro-Israel viewers, who saw them as fake, staged, and ""lazy propaganda"" rather than serious reporting.During the conflict, he faced accusations on social media of pocketing millions of dollars raised as donations for Gaza residents, including money reportedly intended to build a children’s hospital, reports Times of Israel.“Controversial Gaza activist, derogatorily called ‘Mr FAFO’ due to his performative antics and well known for his support of Hamas and raising an estimated $10 million to build a children’s hospital, only to pocket the money, Saleh Al-Jafarawi, was killed today by unknown assailants,” said Palestinian-American anti-Hamas activist Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib.Alkhatib added that Jafarawi was allegedly accompanying Hamas’s “Saham” unit during clashes with the Doghmosh clan in Gaza City, possibly acting as a cameraman. Hamas-affiliated channels have announced his death, possibly to incite violence against the clan. Alkhatib suggested three possible culprits: Hamas to seize his digital wallet and stir civil war; the Doghmosh clan in retaliation for Hamas raids; or anti-Hamas fighters targeting a terror propagandist. He added that Jafarawi’s body reportedly showed signs of torture.“For the last two years, I have followed Hamas content creator Saleh Al-Jafrawi (‘Mr FAFO’) with a mix of horror and admiration. I was engrossed. Mr FAFO had phenomenal energy, charisma, and creativity. Always popping up in a different costume, once a patient then a radiologist, a jihadist then a foreign correspondent, a ham actor but always with panache and chutzpah, constantly finding inventive ways to grab new audiences and tell his story,” said former Israeli spokesperson Eylon Levy.","27-year-old Saleh al-Jafarawi became known as “Mr FAFO” in Israeli media.

Sophie Grégoire, ex-wife of Justin Trudeau , posted an uncanny message on Instagram on Monday, day after photos surfaced online showing the former Canadian Prime Minister kissing pop singer Katy Perry aboard her yacht.The post hinted at moving on, with Grégoire postin: “The people, the places, even the moments that once felt, I don’t know, infinite—time asks us to not cling to them. And yet we do, I do, because to hold on feels safer than to let go.”Grégoire continued, “Love was never about possession. It was always about presence, the present moment. And when we release what we cannot keep, we make space for the truth of connection, intimacy, the memory, you know, for the lesson, for the way a single smile can echo across a lifetime.” She added, “Sometimes we forget that nothing we love was ever meant to be kept.”The couple shares three children—Xavier, Ella-Grace, and Hadrien. They announced their separation in August 2023 after 18 years of marriage.Trudeau, 53, has faced months of rumours linking him romantically with Katy Perry, 40, who split from actor Orlando Bloom in June.The rumours grew on Sunday after the Daily Mail shared photos of Trudeau and Perry kissing on her luxury yacht near Santa Barbara, California.“Maybe love’s deepest teaching is this—to stand open-hearted in the face of impermanence, to honour what has been and to trust that letting go is also a form of keeping inside us where no loss can erase it,” Grégoire said in the Instagram video. “That is love’s endurance. That is what carries us forward.”Trudeau and Perry were also seen together in Montreal in July, sharing a private dinner. Perry has a 5-year-old daughter, Daisy Dove Bloom, with Orlando Bloom and was previously married to comedian Russell Brand.Sources told the Daily Mail that the singer is “very, very interested in him. She says he's a real catch, a high-quality guy. She clearly likes him a lot. He likes her a lot.”Trudeau has not publicly commented on the relationship. Social media reactions to the yacht photos have been mixed, with some critics questioning his commitment to his family and Canada.","Sophie Grégoire, ex-wife of Justin Trudeau, posted an uncanny message on Instagram on Monday, day after photos surfaced online showing the former Canadian Prime Minister kissing Katy Perry aboard her yacht.

IDF launches Operation “Returning Home”



All dead hostages may not be back on Monday







Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday acknowledged divisions over the Gaza ceasefire deal but urged citizens to unite ahead of the expected release of hostages held by Hamas under the prisoner exchange agreement.“This is an emotional evening, an evening of tears, an evening of joy, because tomorrow our children will return to our borders,” Netanyahu said in a televised address, quoting a biblical verse. “Tomorrow is the beginning of a new path - a path of rebuilding, a path of healing, and, I hope, a path of united hearts.”The Prime Minister’s remarks came amid criticism from both sides of Israel’s political spectrum - from families of hostages who accused him of prioritising military goals over their release, and from right-wing members of his coalition who opposed freeing Palestinian prisoners.“This is a historic event that mixes sorrow over the release of murderers with joy over the return of hostages,” Netanyahu said.“I know there are many disagreements among us, but on this day ... we have every reason to put them aside, because together we achieved tremendous victories,” he added.Netanyahu also said Israel was ready to receive the hostages expected to be freed on Monday. “Israel is prepared and ready for the immediate reception of all our hostages,” he said in a separate statement issued Sunday.He added that while Israel had made “tremendous victories” during two years of conflict, the fight was not over: “Together we achieved tremendous victories, victories that amazed the whole world... But at the same time I must tell you, the fight is not over,” Netanyahu said. “Very large security challenges still lie before us.”Meanwhile, the Israel defense forces (IDF) announced the launch of Operation “Returning Home” to bring back the hostages. “In a few hours we will all be reunited - one people, embraced and united,” said Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, Israel’s Chief of the General Staff, in a statement posted on X.He said the operation followed two years of sustained military and diplomatic pressure. “The military pressure we applied over the past two years, together with the complementary diplomatic measures, constitute a victory over Hamas,” Zamir added. “We will continue to act in order to ensure the Gaza Strip no longer poses a threat to the State of Israel and its civilians.”An Israeli Military official said that they are expecting that not all dead hostages may return to Israel on Monday.""Unfortunately this is something we anticipate that not all fallen hostages will be returned tomorrow,"" the official told reporters during a briefing late on Sunday.Earlier Sunday, Shosh Bedrosian, spokeswoman for the prime minister's office, had said an ""international body"" would be established to locate the remains of captives not returned as part of Monday's exchange.Israel, however, will not send a representative to the US-led peace summit on Gaza scheduled Monday in Sharm el-Sheikh, co-hosted by President Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, according to a statement to AFP by Netanyahu’s spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian.(With inputs from agencies)",Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday acknowledged divisions over the Gaza ceasefire deal.

'A very rich gentleman offered': Trump asked if he could pay troops amid govt shutdown? His response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-very-rich-gentleman-offered-trump-asked-if-he-could-pay-troops-amid-govt-shutdown-his-response/articleshow/124565669.cms,"



Reeling under a government shutdown, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that a ""very wealthy gentleman"" has offered to pay the salaries of US troops if funding runs out.While talking to reporters, Trump said the government has money to pay the salaries of US soldiers, but the government is being forced into this position by the Democrats.""I do... I actually have a man who is a very wealthy person... a donor, a great gentleman, and he said, 'If there's any money necessary, shortfall, for the paying of the troops, then I will pay it,' meaning he will pay it,"" Trump said.""And I said... look, we are not gonna need it. We are going to take care of our troops, but this was a position that is being forced upon us by Democrats,"" he added.The US President's remarks came as the government shutdown is barreling toward its second week, leaving thousands of federal employees without pay as Washington’s funding battle drags on.Amid the standoff, the administration has begun laying off over 4,000 workers — a move seen as an attempt to ramp up pressure on Democrats. But despite the political brinkmanship, signs suggest the shutdown could stretch even longer, prompting speculation over whether it might break past records.With no resolution in sight, the shutdown is expected to continue indefinitely as Republicans and Democrats remain locked in a tussle over health care funding.The longest shutdown on record commenced on December 22, 2018, during President Donald Trump's first term at the White House. Democrats in Congress refused to support a spending bill that included Trump's 4,730 crore request for fencing on the US-Mexico border.Lawmakers ultimately approved a spending bill without funding for the border wall, which Trump signed into law on January 25, 2019, ending the shutdown.The government partially shut down on December 16, 1995, amid a clash between the Republican-controlled Congress and then-President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, over balancing the budget.At the heart of the dispute is a fight over whether subsidies under the Affordable Care Act should be extended. Democrats insist the support is vital to prevent insurance premiums from spiking, while Republicans argue that the spending bill must not include what they frame as “handouts” connected to immigration and health care.Clinton signed a bill to reopen the government on January 6, 1996. Some polls indicated that the public largely blamed Republicans in Congress for the shutdown, and some analysts suggested the dispute helped Clinton win reelection in 1996.","US President Donald Trump said a ""very wealthy gentleman"" has offered to pay the salaries of US troops if funding runs out.

The TOI correspondent from Washington:





US President Trump grumbled on Tuesday about a Time Magazine cover photo that he thought was unflattering despite “a relatively good story about me…”“But the picture may be the Worst of All Time. They ‘disappeared’ my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one. Really weird! I never liked taking pictures from underneath angles, but this is a super bad picture, and deserves to be called out. What are they doing, and why?” the US president posted on social media as he returned stateside from Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt.Back home, reviews of the president of a divided nation remained split. Trump’s MAGA followers celebrated his triumph — and his hair — amid smackdowns from critics. “You are the biggest nothing in the world … Stop fussing with your hair. Speak from your heart and start being human. That’s what you were made for, not golf,” the actor Martin Sheen , who has played a fictional president on screen, said at an event.On his way back, Trump also mused about his press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s lips, a subject that seems to fascinate him. “How’s Karoline? Is she doing good?” he asked reporters. “Should Karoline be replaced?” When one replied, “That’s up to you, Sir,” Trump said, “It’ll never happen. That face... and those lips, they move like a machine gun, right?”","US President Trump grumbled on Tuesday about a Time Magazine cover photo that he thought was unflattering despite “a relatively good story about me…” “They ‘disappeared’ my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124565559,imgsize-10710,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-10-15-072059.jpg"

LIVE: Trump awards Medal of Freedom posthumously to Charlie Kirk





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously to Charlie Kirk , the conservative activist who was killed last month while speaking at Utah Valley University. The event coincided with what would have been Kirk’s 32nd birthday and recognised his role in shaping a generation of young conservatives and influencing the nation’s politics.Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, was shot dead while addressing students. Trump, who had attended Kirk’s funeral in September and described him as a “great American hero” and “martyr” for freedom, was present at the ceremony along with vice president JD Vance, who had escorted Kirk’s widow Erika and his body back to Arizona on Air Force Two.“We’re here to honor and remember a fearless warrior for liberty, beloved leader who galvanized the next generation like nobody I’ve ever seen before, and an American patriot of the deepest conviction, the finest quality and the highest caliber."" He also said that Kirk had been assassinated for speaking the truth, living his faith, and fighting for a stronger America.The Presidential Medal of Freedom, established in 1963 by John F Kennedy, recognises individuals who make exceptional contributions to the nation’s security, cultural endeavours, or public and private initiatives.Trump has previously awarded the medal to figures including Tiger Woods, Lou Holtz, Arthur Laffer, Mariano Rivera, Rush Limbaugh, and posthumously to Babe Ruth and Elvis Presley.Tuesday’s ceremony followed Trump’s return from a diplomatic trip to Israel and Egypt, where he helped mark a ceasefire in Gaza.

‘Hostile act’: Trump says considering terminating business with China; threatens to end cooking oil trade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hostile-act-trump-says-considering-terminating-business-with-china-threatens-to-end-cooking-oil-trade/articleshow/124561385.cms,"Poll Do you think trade disputes like the US-China soybean issue hurt farmers the most? Yes, farmers face the biggest impact No, it affects the economy more broadly

Why it matters?



Is it soya war or something else







US President Donald Trump on Tuesday claimed that China is ""purposefully"" not buying the soybeans from their farmers, and this is the reason they are considering terminating the business with Beijing.Calling China's deliberate work an ""economically hostile act,"" Trump said that they can make the cooking oil themselves and don't need China for that.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, ""I believe that China purposefully not buying our Soybeans, and causing difficulty for our Soybean Farmers, is an Economically Hostile Act. We are considering terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil, and other elements of Trade, as retribution. As an example, we can easily produce Cooking Oil ourselves, we don’t need to purchase it from China.""The United States soya bean harvest is under way, and China, once the biggest buyer of American soybeans, hasn’t booked a single purchase, sending prices tumbling and farmers into panic.The abrupt halt mirrors Beijing's previous use of rare earth exports as leverage in trade wars. Now, it's soybeans.The United States, which exports approximately 61% of the world's soybeans, has recorded zero purchases from China for the current harvest, a sharp decline from Rs 1.05 lakh crore in purchases last year.This shift is part of an escalating trade dispute, with Beijing leveraging economic measures in response to President Trump's renewed tariffs. Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings, stated, “US soybeans now are not that important to China. That’s why Beijing can afford to use the import ban as a bargaining tool.”Additionally, the Trump tariffs have increased costs for fertilizer and equipment, thereby reducing farmers' profit margins. Farmers across the Midwest have begun storing crops, postponing sales, and observing declining futures markets. Morey Hill, a soybean grower from Iowa, told the Wall Street Journal, “There’s no incentive to sell right now.” Hill warned that without a timely agreement with China, the soybean market “might be a bloodbath. ” US farmers are currently grappling with higher expenses and a reduction in buyers.This isn't just about soy. This situation mirrors China's earlier strategy with rare earth minerals, used as leverage in negotiations with the Trump administration over export controls. Now, as the soybean harvest commences, Beijing is repeating this tactic. Lu Ting noted, “Beijing’s new bargaining chip is an import ban on US soybean,” as reported by Bloomberg.While soybeans may not possess the unique qualities of rare earths, they are essential for China's substantial hog and poultry industries. Escalating trade tensions have led China to increase soybean imports from South America, purchasing 2 million tons from Argentina in September alone.Dean Buchholz, a farmer concluding his final crop this year, expressed his discontent to the Wall Street Journal, saying, “I always thought I would farm till they threw dirt on top of me.” He added, “I can’t make it work to where it would be practical to keep going without me spending a boatload of money and keep putting myself into more debt.”Caleb Ragland, 39, a Kentucky farmer and president of the American Soybean Association, commented, ""The frustration is overwhelming."" The timing compounds the issue, as over half of US soybean exports typically occur between October and December, immediately following harvest.China is delaying purchases until February when Brazil's crop becomes available. Sarah Taber, a crop scientist and blogger from North Carolina, remarked, “We knew what Trump would do. And a lot of farmers just voted for him anyway.” Taber warned that if no agreement is reached by December, US soy exports could miss the entire global buying window.","The United States, which exports approximately 61% of the world's soybeans, has recorded zero purchases from China for the current harvest.

It was meant to be a celebratory day for Eric Trump, but it turned into an awkward moment on social media.US President Donald Trump proudly announced the release of his son’s new memoir, ""Under Siege: My Family’s Fight to Save Our Nation,"" on Truth Social, urging his followers to “get a copy” of what he called a “phenomenal book. ” He wrote, “Don’t forget to get a copy of my son Eric’s book, ‘UNDER SIEGE,’ which is breaking records everywhere. It’s a phenomenal book, that’s a must read for everyone—Congratulations Eric, you deserve it!!!”However, while the POTUS promoted the memoir online, his son’s in-person book signing told a different story. Eric posted a video from a bookstore in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, inviting people to pick up signed copies of his book. “Bunch of signed books here, first come first serve,” he said. “Come over to Barnes and Noble, Palm Beach Gardens, a bunch of signed books.”Social media users were quick to notice that the store appeared empty.Netizens started mocking the turnout, with one user commenting, “Looks empty,” and another saying, “No one has been waiting for you.” One quipped, “You couldn’t write a postcard, buddy,” while another added, “Your family had Gaza under siege and now you have our rights and freedoms under siege. That what this is about?”Eric Trump’s book retails for $22 and claims to offer “an unfiltered look at the highs and lows of life in the Trump world,” featuring stories from the campaign trail, The Celebrity Apprentice boardroom, and the Trump Organization.It also includes a foreword written by his father.However, Under Siege climbed to the top of Amazon’s best-seller chart on Tuesday, sharing the spotlight with 107 Days, a memoir by former US vice president Kamala Harris.Earlier in the month, Eric had faced backlash during his press tour when he appeared to promote the book while paying tribute to slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk.","US President Donald Trump announced the release of his son's new memoir, ""Under Siege: My Family’s Fight to Save Our Nation,"" on Truth Social.

Pakistan-Afghanistan Clashes: Heavy Fighting Along Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Border, Taliban Posts Damaged

Poll Should countries take stronger action to secure their borders against militant attacks? Yes, strict security is necessary No, dialogue and diplomacy are better





Pakistani troops engaged in heavy fighting with Afghan Taliban fighters on Tuesday night along the Kurram district border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The clashes came after the Taliban and militants linked to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan , called Fitna al-Khawarij by authorities, reportedly opened fire without warning.PTV News said several Taliban posts were heavily damaged, including at least one tank, and fighters fled their positions. Later reports added that additional posts and tank positions, including Shamsadar post, were destroyed, and a senior Fitna al-Khawarij commander was killed.Earlier, Pakistan’s foreign secretary Amna Baloch briefed resident ambassadors in Islamabad, stressing “Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns and its unwavering resolve to protect its territorial integrity and national security.”Over the weekend, Taliban forces allegedly attacked Pakistani border posts, killing 23 troops. Islamabad responded, claiming more than 200 Taliban and allied militants were killed. Kabul called the strike “retaliatory,” accusing Pakistan of air raids inside Afghan territory last week, which Pakistan has denied.","Pakistan-Afghanistan Clashes: Heavy Fighting Along Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Border, Taliban Posts Damaged.

Retaliatory Strike by Afghan Forces Kills 15 Pakistani Soldiers; Qatar Calls for Dialogue





NEW DELHI: Former Indian diplomat KP Fabian on Sunday described Pakistan’s foreign policy as a “failure” following its recent confrontation with Afghanistan, where Islamabad has been accused of carrying out strikes on Afghan territory.Speaking to news agency ANI, Fabian said Pakistan had acted as an aggressor and “played its hand badly,” resulting in deteriorating relations with Kabul.“This has happened when, maybe coincidentally, the Afghanistan Emirate foreign minister is in Delhi,” Fabian said, as per ANI.“The bad relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan cannot entirely be explained on the basis of the Durand Line. I think Pakistan played its hand badly, probably was overbearing. The proud Afghans resisted, and now the relationship is very bad,” he said.Fabian noted that Pakistan had carried out strikes on Kabul, prompting Afghanistan’s retaliation.“On the whole, Pakistani policy has been, more or less, a failure... It is abundantly clear that Afghanistan is keen on developing relations with India, which is the case with India too, and Pakistan is naturally upset,” he added.The Afghan ministry of defence has recently said that the armed forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan conducted “successful retaliatory operations” against Pakistani military positions along the Durand Line late Saturday night.In a statement cited by ANI, the ministry said the strikes were “in response to repeated violations of Afghanistan’s sovereignty by the Pakistani military and airstrikes on its territory.”According to news agency Associated Press (AP), Afghanistan claimed on Sunday that its forces had killed 58 Pakistani soldiers and captured 25 military posts in overnight operations along the border.Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Afghan forces were in control of the “official borders and de facto lines,” though Pakistan has not confirmed any casualties.Both the Torkham and Chaman border crossings remained closed on Sunday following the escalation. Pakistan, for its part, accused Afghan authorities of harbouring militants of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a charge Kabul has denied.Tensions between the two countries have worsened in recent months, with frequent border skirmishes and airstrikes deepening distrust. Saudi Arabia has called for “restraint and dialogue” to prevent further escalation in the region.","Former Indian diplomat KP Fabian on Sunday described Pakistan’s foreign policy as a “failure” following its recent confrontation with Afghanistan.

Pakistan Panics After Taliban Issues Warning, Accuses India of Using Afghanistan Soil for Terror





Pakistan has lodged formal objections with Afghanistan’s Ambassador in Islamabad over several ‘elements of the India‑Afghanistan joint statement’, particularly the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as 'part of India'.It also rejected remarks by Afghan foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi that “terrorism is an internal problem of Pakistan,” the Pakistani ministry of foreign affairs (MOFA) said.The foreign office said: “It was conveyed that the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as part of India is in clear violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the legal status of Jammu and Kashmir. The Joint Statement is highly insensitive to the sacrifices and sentiments of the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their just struggle for the right to self‑determination.”In addition, Islamabad strongly rebutted Muttaqi’s claim, saying: “Pakistan has repeatedly shared details regarding the presence of Fitna‑e‑Khawarij and Fitna‑e‑Hindustan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil against Pakistan with support from elements within Afghanistan.”The Pakistani statement added that deflecting responsibility by branding terrorism in Pakistan as an ""internal matter"" does not relieve Afghanistan’s interim government of its duty to ensure regional peace and security.It also urged that “unauthorised Afghan nationals residing in Pakistan” return to their country.These protests follow a joint statement issued on October 10 during Muttaqi’s visit to India, where both nations reiterated condemnation of terrorism emanating from regional countries, affirmed respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and affirmed that the Afghan government would not permit any group or individual to use Afghan territory against India.In that statement, external affairs minister S Jaishankar expressed gratitude for Afghanistan’s condemnation of the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir, while Afghanistan reaffirmed its support in counterterrorism.""Both sides emphasised respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The external affairs minister appreciated the Afghan side's understanding of India's security concerns. The Afghan foreign minister reiterated the commitment that the Afghan government will not allow any group or individual to use the territory of Afghanistan against India,"" the statement issued by the ministry of external affairs (MEA) read.Muttaqi is on a week-long visit to India (October 9–16), the first such high-level visit since the Taliban takeover in 2021.

Strategic hedging, not endorsement







NEW DELHI: In a diplomatic manoeuvre that could reshape regional equations, India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy. The decision was announced during Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s high-profile visit to New Delhi. On the same day, the Afghan foreign minister, from Indian soil, condemned Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, Afghanistan — the first of its kind that came against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Kabul and Islamabad.During the meetings, external affairs minister S Jaishankar underlined that India’s engagement “contributes to Afghanistan’s national development, as well as regional stability and resilience,” while announcing a fresh round of development projects across Afghan provinces. The upgrade of India’s technical mission to a full-fledged embassy signals a significant deepening of diplomatic ties without extending formal recognition to the Taliban regime.Later the same day, Muttaqi held a press briefing in New Delhi, sharply condemning Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, calling it a “provocative act” and a violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty. “Such issues cannot be resolved by strength.Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he said, stressing the widening rift between Kabul and Islamabad.India had shut its Kabul embassy in August 2021 after the Taliban’s return to power, maintaining only a skeletal presence through a technical team since June 2022 to oversee humanitarian aid. The embassy upgrade marks the deepest level of engagement between India and the Taliban since the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government. This move stops short of formal recognition but signals a decisive shift in India’s Afghanistan strategy.The timing of the announcement was significant. It came just hours after Afghanistan’s defence ministry accused Pakistan of bombing civilian areas in Paktika near the Durand Line. “Pakistan violated Afghanistan’s airspace, bombing a civilian market in the Marghi area of Paktika near the Durand Line and also violating Kabul’s sovereign territory,” the ministry said in a post on social media. Calling it “an unprecedented, violent, and provocative act”, Kabul warned that defending its territory is its right.From Indian soil, Muttaqi chose to respond sharply. “I think it’s a wrong step by the Pakistan government. Such issues cannot be resolved by strength. Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he told reporters in Delhi. “Some attacks happened in border areas, and we condemn them. We have opened doors for dialogue and diplomacy.”The unusually strong language stressed the widening rift between the Taliban and Pakistan, their uneasy patron for decades. Relations have deteriorated over Islamabad’s military operations against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters allegedly sheltering in Afghanistan. In March 2024, Pakistani airstrikes in Khost and Paktika killed several civilians, triggering warnings from Kabul of “consequences”. This fracture, analysts say, has created a new strategic opening for India.India has historically had a fraught relationship with the Taliban. During the 1990s, New Delhi backed the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance while Islamabad openly supported the Taliban regime. After 2001, India became one of Afghanistan’s largest regional donors, pledging over USD 3 billion for development projects. But the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 disrupted India’s presence and leverage in the country. New Delhi maintained limited contact, focusing on humanitarian assistance and regional coordination with Iran and Central Asian partners.Now, with Pakistan–Taliban ties fraying, India is recalibrating. By reopening its embassy, hosting Muttaqi, and accepting Taliban-appointed diplomats (though not at the ambassadorial level), India is signalling a willingness to engage without granting formal recognition. Strategic analysts describe this as “hedging” — positioning itself to gain influence should Pakistan’s grip weaken further, while safeguarding its own security concerns.Professor Rajan Kumar of the School of International Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University says this evolving situation presents India with a rare diplomatic opening.“The ongoing conflict with Afghanistan and Pakistan certainly offers an opportunity for India can be a stabilising factor even in the ongoing conflict with Pakistan. India’s presence matters a lot to Afghanistan because it will provide some kind of legitimacy to the Taliban government, even though India is unlikely to recognise the regime as such,” he says.The engagement carried clear economic undertones as well. Muttaqi invited Indian companies to invest in Afghanistan’s mining sector and called for the opening of the Attari–Wagah border for direct India–Afghanistan trade. “Pakistan and India should open the Wagah border to facilitate trade between Afghanistan and India. It will benefit the people of all three countries,” he said.Currently, India trades with Afghanistan primarily via Iran’s Chabahar port due to Pakistan’s denial of overland access. But the route faces uncertainty after the United States revoked India’s sanctions waiver for Chabahar in September 2024, complicating transit. While Chabahar remains a strategic hedge, its operational limitations make direct India–Afghanistan connectivity via Pakistan attractive in theory — though politically fraught.India also announced a new slate of development projects: a Thalassemia Centre and 30-bed hospital in Bagrami district, oncology and trauma centres in Kabul, maternity clinics across Paktika, Khost and Paktia, and donations of ambulances, medical equipment and vaccines. These announcements draw on India’s legacy of over 500 development projects across all 34 Afghan provinces, including the Parliament building and the Salma Dam.Security remains at the core of India’s engagement. Without naming Pakistan, both sides “unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from regional countries” in their joint statement. Jaishankar said, “We have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity. However, these are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.” Muttaqi, meanwhile, pledged that Afghanistan “won’t allow any group to use the country against others”, identifying Daesh (ISIS) as the main regional threat.For India, the key is ensuring Afghan soil is not used for anti-India activities — a core concern since the IC-814 hijacking in 1999. Prof. Kumar explains this strategic bottom line:“What can happen, and what India is probably thinking, is that the land of Afghanistan may not be used for terrorist activities against India. That would be a huge achievement from the Indian perspective,” he says.India has so far avoided pressing the Taliban hard on human rights. Muttaqi remained vague when asked about women’s rights, saying, “All countries have their own customs and traditions and these should be respected.” While India has consistently raised rights issues at multilateral forums, officials have avoided making them a precondition for engagement.Perhaps the most consequential element of India’s strategy is its decision to reopen its embassy in Kabul without formally recognising the Taliban regime — a nuanced diplomatic line that gives New Delhi both flexibility and leverage. By restoring a physical diplomatic presence, India can deepen engagement on the ground and signal its relevance in Afghanistan’s evolving power dynamics, without extending official legitimacy to a government that remains internationally unrecognised and controversial for its human rights record.This approach reflects a clear distinction between establishing an embassy and granting diplomatic recognition. India has previously maintained similar diplomatic arrangements, such as with Palestine, where the presence of an embassy does not automatically translate into full diplomatic recognition of a government. In the Afghan context, this allows India to engage pragmatically while aligning its policy with the broader stance of the United Nations, the European Union and Western countries, most of which have opted for functional engagement without recognition.By doing so, New Delhi positions itself strategically. It can build channels of communication, potentially shape outcomes on critical security and connectivity issues, and apply pressure on regional actors like Pakistan and China, both of which are wary of India expanding its influence in Afghanistan. At the same time, India avoids prematurely endorsing a regime whose policies on women’s rights and governance remain at odds with international norms.India’s outreach is also informed by broader regional considerations. Russia and China have already established working relationships with the Taliban. Western governments are engaged in dialogue on counterterrorism and aid. New Delhi, analysts say, does not want to be the outlier.As Prof. Kumar notes, “Since Russia is talking, China is already there, and American and Western governments are also talking, India should not be left out. We may have ideological differences with the Taliban regime, but since other countries are talking to the Taliban in different forms, we should also try to moderate our policy and engage on several issues.”This balancing act is not without challenges. The Taliban regime remains ideologically rigid, especially on women’s rights and governance. Connectivity through Chabahar faces geopolitical headwinds. And there is no guarantee that the Taliban will limit anti-India groups indefinitely. Yet, by opening formal diplomatic channels, India aims to secure a seat at the table rather than watch from the sidelines as others shape Afghanistan’s future.Muttaqi’s visit to Delhi, marked by strong rhetoric against Pakistan, overtures for trade, and assurances on terrorism, reflects Kabul’s attempt to diversify its diplomatic bets. For India, the outreach is less about endorsing the Taliban regime and more about strategic positioning: insulating itself against security risks, reasserting influence in a region long dominated by Pakistan, and adapting to a shifting geopolitical landscape.New Delhi’s approach remains cautious but deliberate. It is engaging the Taliban to pursue its security and strategic objectives, without abandoning its normative concerns or rushing into recognition. In the complex triangle of India–Afghanistan–Pakistan, this marks the beginning of a new phase — one where India is no longer merely reacting to developments in Kabul, but actively shaping them.","India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy.

Government response and TLP’s history





Massive protests by the hardline Islamist groupescalated into violent clashes across multiple cities on Friday and Saturday, leaving at least 11 people dead and dozens injured. Demonstrators marched towards Islamabad in what they called a “Gaza March” to express solidarity with Palestinians and planned to stage a protest outside the United States embassy.TLP launched its protests in Lahore on Thursday, announcing plans to march to the US embassy in Islamabad to oppose the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas following two years of conflict in Gaza. While the demonstrations were initially organised to challenge the ceasefire, the party said the focus had shifted to expressing solidarity with Palestinians.“We have no demands other than showing solidarity with the people of Gaza,” senior TLP member Allama Muhammad Irfan told AFP as the protesters set off for Islamabad.The rally, led by TLP chief Saad Rizvi, began after Friday prayers from the party’s base on Multan Road in Lahore. Thousands joined, chanting religious slogans and carrying sticks and rods. Police set up barricades and used tear gas at key junctions — including Yateem Khana Chowk, Chauburji, Azadi Chowk, and Shahdara — but protesters broke through, clashing with security forces and pelting stones.Videos on social media showed demonstrators seizing government vehicles and damaging public property.Violence soon spread to Islamabad and Rawalpindi, where authorities placed shipping containers to block roads and fired tear gas to disperse crowds. In return, protesters hurled stones at police. Public life in the twin cities was severely disrupted, with schools shut, the Metro bus service suspended, and mobile internet blocked for a second consecutive day.According to Arab News, TLP claimed that 11 of its supporters had been killed and 50 injured since Thursday, though officials have not commented on the claim. Lahore police confirmed multiple injuries among officers and said more than 100 TLP activists had been arrested for attacking law enforcement and damaging property.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi warned that no group would be allowed to march on Islamabad “under any circumstances,” while State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry accused the TLP of “political blackmail” and misusing religious sentiments. “Peaceful protest is a democratic right,” Chaudhry said, “but there is no room for violence or mob pressure.”Founded in 2015, the TLP has a history of staging disruptive protests on religious and political issues. Since its rise in 2017, the group has repeatedly brought parts of Pakistan to a standstill through mass marches and sit-ins that have paralyzed the capital and major highways for days.",Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) launched protests in Lahore on Thursday.

The Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), claimed responsibility for a series of deadly attacks on Friday across northwestern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 20 security personnel and three civilians.As per news agency AFP, the coordinated assaults included a suicide bombing at a police training school in Dera Ismail Khan district, along with clashes in other districts bordering Afghanistan.Eleven paramilitary troops were killed in the Khyber district, while seven policemen died when a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into the gate of the Dera Ismail Khan police training school, followed by an armed assault.“Seven police personnel were martyred and 13 were injured in the attack, while six terrorists were also killed,” Muhammad Hussain, a senior local police official, was quoted as saying by AFP.In Bajaur district, five people—including three civilians—were killed during clashes between militants and paramilitary forces, AFP reported.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the attacks, saying, “Such cowardly acts by terrorists cannot shake our resolve against terrorism.We are determined to completely eliminate terrorism from the country.”Islamabad has accused Afghanistan of allowing militants to operate from its territory, a claim denied by Kabul. Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif warned, “Everyone will have to bear the consequences, including those providing the hideouts. Enough is enough”, adding that any response could cause collateral damage.Friday’s attacks reflect a surge in militancy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since the US-led troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.As per news agency AP , the assault on the police training school in Ratta Kulachi on Friday involved heavy weapons and lasted nearly six hours.Around 200 recruits and trainers were inside during the attack, and officers returned fire, preventing mass casualties. Six militants were killed in the operation, along with the seizure of suicide vests, explosives, and weapons.Security forces have faced rising threats this year, with over 500 people, including 311 troops and 73 police officers, killed in militant attacks from January to mid-September, according to AFP.The TTP, though allied with the Afghan Taliban, operates independently and remains a major threat along Pakistan’s northwestern border.","The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for a series of deadly attacks across northwestern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

LAHORE: Violent clashes erupted Friday between police and Islamists in Pakistan 's eastern city of Lahore after security forces tried to stop thousands of demonstrators from leaving for the capital, Islamabad, where they planned to stage a pro-Palestinian rally outside the US Embassy, officials said.The clashes in the capital of Punjab province began Thursday but intensified Friday after police baton-charged the demonstrators and fired tear gas to disperse them at multiple locations. Protesters hurled stones at officers in response.In a statement, the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan party, or TLP, claimed that two of its supporters had been killed and 50 others injured since Thursday. There was no immediate comment from the Punjab provincial government, which is headed by Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, the niece of the prime minister.The protest comes after Hamas and Israel agreed to a ceasefire plan brokered by US President Donald Trump.Speaking to thousands of worshippers in Lahore at Friday prayers, TLP chief Saad Rizvi announced the march, saying, ""We will now march from Lahore to the US Embassy"" in Islamabad.He said: ""I will walk at the head of the long march. Arrest is not a problem, bullets are not a problem, shells are not a problem - martyrdom is our destiny.""Police officers were swinging batons and firing tear gas to disperse demonstrators near the main TLP office, according to witnesses, who said residents also faced severe difficulties because of the tear gas.The violence has disrupted daily life in parts of Lahore, as residents struggled to reach home because of road closures and continued clashes.On Friday, authorities shut schools, colleges and universities in Lahore, a city of more than 14 million people.The government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has suspended mobile internet service in Islamabad and nearby Rawalpindi as part of measures aimed at preventing demonstrators from reaching the national capital.Authorities have also placed shipping containers along the main motorway, the main highways and roads leading to Islamabad to block protesters.Lahore is about 350 kilometers (210 miles) from Islamabad.The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad issued a security alert ahead of the march, warning of possible disruptions and urging American citizens to exercise caution.""Large crowds and traffic congestion are expected, along with a precautionary security presence, an increased number of checkpoints, and associated disruptions to local mobile and internet networks in the region,"" the embassy said, adding that the duration of the protests is unknown.It advised U.S. citizens to avoid large gatherings, remain aware of their surroundings and keep a low profile.Deputy Interior Minister Talal Chaudhry said Thursday that the TLP had not submitted a request for permission to hold the rally. The group denied the claim, saying it had applied for permission for a peaceful march to express solidarity with Palestinians.The TLP, known for staging disruptive and sometimes violent protests, has drawn criticism online. But many users have accused the government of overreacting by blocking roads even before the demonstrators began their march.""Why are these demonstrators coming to Islamabad for the rally when the peace process has already started in Palestine?"" asked Mohammad Ashfaq, 35, as he turned back from a road block in Islamabad.He said he tried using longer routes to reach the city, but police had also blocked those roads with shipping containers. ""Now I'll have to figure out again how to reach my office,"" he said.","Clashes erupt in Lahore as police try to stop pro-Palestine march to Islamabad.

Why the defeat hurts Pakistan



How Trump’s self-promotion cost him







Opposition leader María Corina Machado of Venezuela has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize , beating a crowded field of nominees that included US President Donald Trump , whose campaign for the honour had drawn international attention. The Nobel Committee said it was honouring Machado “for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy. ”The decision dealt a personal blow to Trump, who had publicly lobbied for the award, calling himself the “president of peace” and repeatedly claiming to have “ended six or seven wars.” But it is also a diplomatic setback for Pakistan , one of the countries that had formally nominated Trump for the prize, portraying him as a “champion of peace.”Pakistan had gone all in on Trump this year. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and Field Marshall Asim Munir made a visit to the White House in August, where they met Trump in a rare Oval Office engagement. Islamabad hailed the meeting as a breakthrough moment in US-Pakistan ties, saying the two sides had discussed cooperation on counter-terrorism, regional security, and new economic ventures. This was Munir’s third trip to the oval office just this year alone.Sharif, speaking later at the United Nations, described Trump as “a champion of peace” and said nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize was “the least we could do.” Pakistan’s nomination cited Trump’s claimed role in “de-escalating” tensions between India and Pakistan, a claim New Delhi has consistently rejected.In recent months, the Trump administration has pushed to deepen economic ties with Islamabad even as trade talks with India remain stalled. The US government announced its intent to collaborate with Pakistan on critical minerals and hydrocarbons, while Trump himself unveiled a plan to help Pakistan develop its “massive oil reserves.”On his Truth Social platform, Trump said, “We have finalised a deal with Pakistan, where both countries will collaborate on developing Pakistan’s extensive oil reserves… Perhaps, in the future, they might sell oil to India!”The boast turned out to be wildly optimistic. According to energy data, Pakistan has just 0.02% of the world’s crude oil reserves, less than a tenth of India’s production. Yet Islamabad’s enthusiasm for Trump reflected both economic desperation and the hope of finding a patron in Washington amid regional isolation.For Islamabad, Trump’s loss is more than symbolic. Pakistan’s government had staked diplomatic capital on its public embrace of the US president, even as India-Pakistan tensions simmered. By nominating Trump and describing him as a “friend of peace,” Sharif’s administration had hoped to reset relations with Washington, a move seen as a pivot away from Beijing.Instead, Pakistan now faces embarrassment on two fronts: Trump’s failure to win the Nobel Prize and the exposure of Islamabad’s overreach. The White House never released an official readout of the Trump–Sharif–Munir meeting, and Washington’s silence contrasted sharply with Islamabad’s exuberant press releases and photos of a smiling Trump flashing his signature thumbs-up.The loss also weakens Pakistan’s argument that Trump’s mediation ended the brief but intense India–Pakistan conflict earlier this year, a claim denied by India’s military, which maintains that the ceasefire was negotiated directly between the two countries’ commanders.For now, the Nobel Peace Prize has gone to a woman fighting for democracy in Venezuela. But for Donald Trump and his unlikely backers in Islamabad the snub serves as a reminder that peace cannot be won through press releases or self-congratulation. It must be earned.For Trump, the Nobel campaign was intensely personal. Over the past year, he has repeatedly told reporters that he “should have gotten [the prize] four or five times” and that “everyone says” he deserves it. He even reminded UN delegates in September that his “peace record” was unmatched, claiming to have ended wars between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan, and “even Thailand and Cambodia.”But this relentless self-promotion likely backfired. Members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee have long avoided appearing to reward leaders who lobby openly for recognition. “We base our decision only on the work and the will of Alfred Nobel,” Committee Chair Jørgen Watne Frydnes said, adding that lobbying or political pressure had “no bearing” on their choice.Moreover, Trump’s record remains divisive. While he claims credit for brokering ceasefires, critics point out that many conflicts he boasts of ending were never formally resolved, and others, such as the war in Ukraine, continue to rage. His domestic policies including mass deportations, expanded war powers, and withdrawal from global climate pacts have also undercut his image as a peacemaker.As one expert told the Associated Press, the Nobel Committee prefers to honour the “durability of peace and the quiet work of institutions”, not the “rhetoric of power.”","María Corina Machado of Venezuela has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize.

India Spreading False Narratives About Hindu Attacks in Bangladesh: Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus





DHAKA: Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus has said India will probably continue hosting former PM Sheikh Hasina if given a ""free choice"", while claiming that ""some external forces"" want her to come back, days after New Delhi asserted that matters related to the Awami League leader are ""legal"" in nature and require ""consultations"" between both nations.The Nobel laureate also stressed that the interim govt - formed after Hasina's ouster last year following massive protests - is ""very alert"" about communal harmony, as he dismissed as ""fake news"" reports of attacks against the minority Hindu community in his country. Yunus said that his message to them, when he meets the community's leaders, ""is don't go back and say, 'I'm a Hindu, so protect me'... always say, 'I'm a citizen of this country. I'm entitled to all the protection the state is supposed to give me"".Talking on the issues related to Hasina and his conversations with PM Narendra Modi in an interview with Mehdi Hassan of online media outlet Zeteo, Yunus said, ""Two things: first, I said you want to keep her, I can't tell you what to do with her but make sure she doesn't talk about us. She doesn't talk about the Bangladeshi people.""Dhaka had sought Hasina's extradition in Dec last year and there has been no development yet.""Probably they (India) will keep her. If some legal obligation is there that they cannot avoid, then the situation will be different,"" he said. They have been supporting her all along, Yunus said. The chief adviser added that those who are behind her hope that she will come back in Bangladesh, ""with full glory of returning as a victorious leader"", claiming that ""some external forces are supporting her to come back"".When Mehdi noted that ""last Nov, around 30,000 Hindus in Bangladesh gathered to protest against your govt, claiming there have been thousands of attacks on their community. (US President) Donald Trump called the violence in Bangladesh 'barbaric',"" Yunus said, ""One of the specialities about India right now is fake news, a barrage of fake news."" ""This is fake news. You can't go by this fake news,"" he said.Asked if he was saying the reports were exaggerated, or if there's no anti-Hindu violence, Yunus said there is ""some conflict sometimes, some family problem, land problem and something"". ""You happen to be my neighbour. You are a Hindu neighbour. I am a Muslim neighbour. We have a problem with our land demarcation, just like two neighbours. So you said this is Hindu-Muslim.

The TTP’s deadly resurgence



What next for Pakistan and the Taliban?



(With inputs from agencies)





Afghanistan and Pakistan have once again found themselves on the brink of open conflict after days of deadly cross-border fighting that exposed the fragility of their long and volatile frontier. Afghan officials said their forces killed 58 Pakistani soldiers in overnight “retaliatory operations,” while Islamabad gave a far lower death toll of 23, describing the attacks as “unprovoked” adding that it killed 200 Taliban fighters.The exchanges, centred along the 2,600-kilometre Durand Line (which Afghanistan has never recognised), follow accusations by Kabul that Pakistan bombed Afghan territory including: Strikes on Kabul and a market in the country’s east. Pakistan has neither confirmed nor denied involvement, but Afghan Defence Ministry spokesman Enayatullah Khwarazmi said, “Our armed forces are fully prepared to defend the nation’s borders and will deliver a strong response. ”The border tension has disrupted the Torkham crossing, a vital trade route, and triggered alarm in the Gulf. Saudi Arabia and Qatar have urged restraint, calling for dialogue to “maintain the security and stability of the region.”Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, currently in India, denied Islamabad’s accusations that the Taliban harbour members of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ), a banned militant group behind recent deadly attacks inside Pakistan.“There is no presence of TTP in Afghanistan now,” he told reporters. “They are Pakistani people from displaced areas and are allowed to live in the country as refugees. The border is more than 2,400 km long—it could neither be controlled by ‘Changez’ nor ‘Angrez’. Strength alone cannot control it. This fight is inside Pakistan.”Muttaqi accused Islamabad of failing to “take its people into confidence” and of “endangering its own people to please a few.” But he warned that Kabul would act if provoked further: “We want a peaceful resolution of the situation, but if the peace efforts don’t succeed, we have other options.”For decades, Pakistan was considered a patron of the Taliban, providing shelter and support since the group’s emergence in the 1990s.Pakistan has supported the Taliban since their inception, initially backing the anti-Soviet mujahideen who later formed the group. In the 1990s, Islamabad was one of only three nations to recognise the Taliban regime and was the last to cut ties in 2001. After the US invasion, Pakistan helped the Taliban regroup, offering safe havens and medical aid, which allowed the movement to endure despite heavy battlefield losses.Islamabad hoped that the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 would secure its western flank and curb cross-border militancy. Instead, it has seen a resurgence of attacks.However, with the war over, the Taliban no longer relies on Pakistan for sanctuaries or wartime support. Now, it focuses on gaining legitimacy at home, where distrust of Pakistan runs deep. “By lashing out at Pakistan, the Taliban hopes to buy some goodwill from the Afghan public,” Michael Kugelman, the director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, told Time.comAnalysts say Pakistan’s influence over the Taliban has eroded sharply. “Taliban leaders no longer need refuge across the border or Pakistani assistance,” wrote Foreign Policy, noting that the leverage Islamabad once enjoyed “is at risk of being lost.” The Taliban’s reluctance to act against the TTP reflects not just ideological affinity but also domestic priorities: distancing themselves from Pakistani control helps their pursuit of legitimacy at home.“Pakistan finds itself in a predicament largely of its own making—the Taliban leadership that it supported throughout much of the 20-year insurgency in Afghanistan is now sheltering militant groups targeting Islamabad,” Joshua White, a professor in international affairs at Johns Hopkins University, told Time.com in July last year.The TTP, listed by the United Nations as an al-Qaeda-linked terrorist organisation since 2011, aims to overthrow Pakistan’s government and impose its own strict interpretation of Islamic law. With an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 members, the group has waged a bloody campaign for nearly two decades, killing hundreds of soldiers, police, and civilians.Pakistan’s military campaigns including: Operations Zarb-e-Azb and Radd-ul-Fasaad. once splintered the group, pushing its leaders into Afghanistan. But the Taliban’s victory in Kabul re-energised the TTP, which has since reunited its factions and ramped up attacks. According to the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), violence in Pakistan in 2024 returned to levels last seen in 2015.A UN report in July 2025 claimed the TTP enjoys “logistical and operational support” from Taliban authorities, a claim Kabul denies. Islamabad, under pressure from growing domestic insecurity, has launched cross-border airstrikes on suspected TTP hideouts and expelled over a million Afghan refugees since last year.“The inability of the Taliban administration to take concrete action against the TTP has significantly strained relations,” Islamabad-based analyst Tahir Khan told Deutsche Welle. “Unless the issue of the TTP is effectively addressed, meaningful improvement in bilateral ties will remain elusive.”The violence along the Durand Line has once again shown how Pakistan’s decades-long strategy of nurturing militant proxies for influence in Afghanistan has backfired. The very groups it once supported are now undermining its internal security.Pakistan’s interior minister Mohsin Naqvi has accused Afghan forces of firing on civilians, warning that “no provocation will be tolerated.” Islamabad’s retaliatory strikes have reportedly destroyed multiple Afghan border posts and militant camps, though the Taliban claim to have seized several Pakistani outposts in return.Both sides remain locked in a dangerous cycle of provocation and denial. Kabul insists the TTP problem is “a fight inside Pakistan,” while Islamabad continues to demand action. Yet neither seems willing to take the political or military risks required for a lasting peace.Until that reckoning comes, the Durand Line will remain what it has always been: not a border of control, but a fault line of crisis.","Afghanistan and Pakistan have once again found themselves on the brink of open conflict after days of deadly cross-border fighting.

Only Hindu temple in East of England faces closure threat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/only-hindu-temple-in-east-of-england-faces-closure-threat/articleshow/124561089.cms,".





LONDON: The only Hindu temple in East of England, which serves 13,500 Hindus, is at risk of closure because the local authority has put the building it is in up for sale.The Bharat Hindu Samaj Temple was established in the New England Complex in Peterborough in 1984 and serves Hindus in Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and parts of Lincolnshire.Peterborough City Council owns the building and wants to sell it to pay off debts.The temple put in its bid by the deadline of Monday night to buy the entire complex of seven units.Kishor Ladwa, president of the temple, said it had a bid of £1.3 million for the complex agreed in April with the council offering a £504,000 discount for the social value of its services. Then, in Sept, the council said it had other buyers and could not offer them the complex for that amount and asked them to increase their bid. The council has not disclosed who the other bidders are but indicated they are community organisations.“We don’t want to be someone’s tenant. The council never sent us a legally binding contract to buy the site. We would have signed it immediately,” Ladwa said. “We have been negotiating to buy the temple for 14 years but the council keeps shifting its goalposts.”The temple is an important social hub for the elderly, offering luncheons twice a week, and dementia and diabetic workshops.It also offers Bollywood dance, yoga, Zumba, Hindi and Gujarati classes. “Some of the elderly are lonely and this is the only social place to meet their own friends,” Ladwa said.There was a huge week-long procession when the idols were consecrated there, so how can they be moved if they have to go to another site, he asks.Ekta Patel, tempe vice-president, said: “We are saving the council millions of pounds in public services through the activities we are providing for the elderly. We don’t want to be in a situation where someone can evict us.”Petitions have sprung up garnering thousands of signatures calling for the sale to be stopped.Councillor Mohammed Jamil, cabinet member for finance and corporate governance at the council, said: “We understand that this must be a worrying time for the Hindu community. However, we have to put all community assets we have identified to sell on the open market to ensure we achieve the best possible value for taxpayers. If the Bharat Hindu Samaj is not the preferred bidder, responsibility for its tenancy would transfer to the new owner, and they would continue to have rights and protections under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1954, but would need to seek their own legal advice. ”","The Bharat Hindu Samaj Temple was established in the New England Complex in Peterborough in 1984.

3I/Atlas and rising UFO sightings: Could an interstellar visitor be watching Earth







As rumours continue to swirl around the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, many enthusiasts are asking which regions in the UK have recorded the highest number of UFO sightings. While sceptics remain cautious, a significant portion of the population believes that humanity may not be alone in the universe. Speculations range from encounters with Greys and insectoid beings to humanoid creatures resembling cats, often described as possessing intelligence and wisdom beyond ordinary imagination.Public interest in UFO phenomena has surged in recent years, particularly following the release of declassified documents by the US Government. Discussions intensified with the discovery of 3I/ATLAS, only the third interstellar object ever detected passing through our solar system. Initially identified as a comet, some researchers have suggested that its unusual trajectory and physical characteristics might point to something more extraordinary. Avi Loeb, a prominent astrophysicist, has even speculated that it could be an alien probe on a reconnaissance mission. Despite these theories, the majority of the scientific community classifies it as a comet, yet its enigmatic behaviour continues to fuel debates surrounding extraterrestrial life.AS reported by Peterborough Telegraph, to identify the top UFO hotspots in the UK, Casino.org compiled user-submitted reports from three independent sources: the National UFO Reporting Centre (NUFORC), the Enigma app, and the UFO Identified Group. Each report was counted per region, then adjusted for population density using the latest UK census data. This per capita approach highlights areas where residents are proportionally most likely to report UFO sightings, rather than simply presenting raw numbers.It is important to note that rankings are based on subjective accounts and may be influenced by local population sizes and reporting cultures. While these figures provide a useful insight into UFO activity, they do not constitute definitive proof of extraterrestrial visitation.Southampton’s UFO sightings are largely concentrated around Southampton Water and the Solent. Observers have reported unusual aerial phenomena above shipping lanes, the city centre, and the New Forest.Leeds has a notable concentration of sightings in its green spaces, including Roundhay Park and Harewood House. Reports also frequently emerge along the River Aire, often describing bright, moving lights.In Leominster, most UFO reports originate from rural areas outside the town, particularly near Queenswood Country Park and over the River Lugg. Witnesses often describe objects hovering silently or moving at high speeds.Preston’s sightings are primarily near Moor Park and the University of Central Lancashire campus. Unusual lights are occasionally seen over the River Ribble, prompting speculation among local UFO enthusiasts.In Exeter, UFO activity has been recorded over the Exeter Ship Canal, Exeter Quay, and the outskirts leading toward Dartmoor National Park. Observers report strange formations and sudden appearances in the sky.The majority of Waterlooville’s reports come from areas surrounding the South Downs National Park and rural regions near Cowplain. Witnesses describe fast-moving lights and hovering objects that defy conventional explanation.Cannock Chase and the skies above the River Sow are notable hotspots for UFO activity in Stafford. Sightings often involve glowing lights that seem to change direction abruptly.Manchester’s UFO reports are frequently centred around Piccadilly Gardens, the Northern Quarter, and the River Irwell. Observers describe unusual aerial movements that are difficult to attribute to conventional aircraft.Norwich has emerged as a prominent location for unexplained aerial phenomena, with frequent sightings over the Norfolk Broads, Norwich Cathedral, and Norwich Castle. Witnesses report rapid lights and objects appearing at varying altitudes.Llandudno ranks as the UK’s most active region for UFO reports. Sightings are concentrated around the Great Orme and Llandudno Pier, with multiple accounts of strange lights moving swiftly over the Irish Sea.The recent attention on UFO sightings in the UK coincides with the discovery of 3I/ATLAS. This third interstellar object ever detected has captured public imagination due to its unusual trajectory and characteristics. While mainstream science considers it a comet, some theorists, including Avi Loeb, have suggested it could be an alien probe sent to observe Earth. Regardless of its origin, the object has intensified curiosity about extraterrestrial life and increased UFO reporting across the country.","Public interest in UFO phenomena has surged in recent years, particularly following the release of declassified documents by the US Government.

British domestic security agency MI5 on Monday released guidelines to “protect” the UK’s democratic institutions from what the Home Office described as “foreign interference” and “espionage threats. ”“The guidance is designed to help MPs, peers, councillors, parliamentary staff and candidates understand the threat and take simple, effective steps to protect themselves, their teams, and the integrity of the UK’s democracy,” the Home Office said in a statement.China, Iran, and Russia have been identified as the sources of “strategic foreign interference.”According to MI5 Director General Sir Ken McCallum, this targeting of Britain is not limited to short-term damage to its security.""This erodes the foundations of our sovereignty and ability to protect our citizens’ interests. Everyone reading this guidance cares deeply about the role they play in UK democracy. Take action today to protect it – and yourself,"" the statement quoted McCallum as saying.The guidance cited cases of political interference, including those involving former Member of the European Parliament Nathan Gill and Christine Lee, a lawyer who was working in coordination with an arm of the Chinese Communist Party.Possible targets include elected representatives and their associates, who may be sought out for their access to sensitive information, ability to influence policy or public opinion, or their relationships with other individuals of interest.The “information” extends beyond classified material to include privileged or insider knowledge that foreign intelligence services consider valuable. Targeting could occur through attempts to exploit overseas travel, online activity, or financial donations as routes to gain access and exert influence.In addition to keeping up to date with guidance from the National Protective Security Authority, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), and their own security teams, elected representatives have been advised to follow the principles of “BEST”: Be alert, Enhance their security overseas, Secure information they have access to, and Trust their instincts.","China, Iran, and Russia have been identified as the sources of “strategic foreign interference.

Keevil's 'apology'





A UK chess master has been sentenced to 28 months in prison for stalking and defaming a university student who refused to rekindle a past relationship.Paul Keevil, 55, who is married and acts as a carer for his wife, had been giving money to the woman, then in her 20s, after engaging in intimate relations with her on several occasions, The Metro reported , citing the public prosecutor.“They first met on a dating website in 2018 and began a relationship that she ended in December of that year. From 2019, they remained in contact, and from time to time, the defendant gave her sums of money, which she sometimes requested — and on one occasion after the end of the relationship they engaged in consensual intimate sexual activity,” prosecutor Tom Farr told Bolton Crown Court.“Though their relationship ended, in 2021 Keevil wanted to rekindle it. She declined, and he began a campaign of defamation,” Farr added.Over a five-month period, Keevil, described as “obsessed,” publicly humiliated his former girlfriend, falsely labelling her a ""sex worker"" in an attempt to have her removed from her university course and dismissed from the children’s nursery where she worked.“The defendant repeatedly threatened that unless she paid him a sum of money, he would disclose to others that she had worked as a sex worker.These malicious threats were designed to manipulate and control her. He told her that unless she complied, he would spread this fiction to members of her family, to her university, to her employer, and to OFSTED (Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills),” the prosecutor added.Keevil also stalked the homes of the woman and her mother, followed her boyfriend, photographed his car, and sent thousands of menacing messages demanding compliance. He even called a hospital maternity unit while she was giving birth, falsely claiming to be the child’s father.The victim said Keevil’s actions left her feeling “suicidal” and living in ""constant fear.""Defence counsel Louise Cowen issued ""apology"" on Keevil's behalf, saying: ""He wishes to apologise to the complainant and her family. He is deeply sorry for the hurt and distress his actions have caused. At the time, he did not fully appreciate what he was doing and had a genuine belief that he was entitled to recover some sums he had paid to the complainant.”However, the judge, Jeremy Lasker would have none of it.“You subjected the complainant to a sustained course of conduct aimed at pressuring her into resurrecting an intimate relationship with you and demanding repayment of monies which you had previously gifted to her.You consistently refused to take no for an answer — you were effectively blackmailing her. She has found herself almost unable to cope with life and has been driven to consider suicide as the only way out of a set of circumstances which you imposed upon her through your obsessive and unrelenting behaviour. She has described her life as a nightmare from which even now she can see little escape.”","Paul Keevil, 55, jailed for 28 months for stalking and defaming his former girlfriend. Keevil had been giving money to the woman, then in her 20s, after engaging in intimate relations with her on several occasions. The victim said Keevil’s actions left her feeling “suicidal’ and living in ""constant fear""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124543604,imgsize-265274,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design.jpg"

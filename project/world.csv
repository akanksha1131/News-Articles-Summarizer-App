‘Strictly for beautiful Russian girls’? What new files allege about Epstein’s links to Hamptons nightclub promoters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/strictly-for-beautiful-russian-girls-what-new-files-allege-about-epsteins-links-to-hamptons-nightclub-promoters/articleshow/128489436.cms,"(AP)





Newly released Department of Justice files reveal that Jeffrey Epstein used the Hamptons as a primary hub for his ""grooming"" operations. The documents allege that Epstein routinely flew young women to the exclusive enclave for ""girls' weekends,"" using a network of wealthy local contacts and luxury parties to build trust and facilitate exploitation.The documents include emails suggesting Epstein coordinated travel, parties and weekend stays in the Hamptons through well-connected acquaintances. An FBI document from 2020 cited in the files said a tipster claimed Epstein had close ties in the area who would “procure underage girls for him.”Epstein’s Hamptons circle also included Mark Baker, a nightclub owner and promoter in the Hamptons and New York City who appears roughly 50 times in the documents. In a 2010 email introducing Baker to Epstein, a redacted correspondent wrote that Baker wanted Epstein to organize weekly parties in his clubs in New York and the Hamptons “strictly for beautiful Russian girls,” adding, “I think it will be a great way to find new friends. ”Later emails show Baker arranging in-person meetings with Epstein after that introduction. According to his website, Baker now lives in Bali, Indonesia.Some emails directly addressed to Epstein referenced unspecified partying in the Hamptons without indicating illegal conduct.In one May 2016 message that included a photo of girls eating on a sidewalk in Montauk, a redacted sender wrote: “We’ve got for us pink t-shirts and it says on it ‘girls weekend.’ Thank you so much Jeffrey for our happiest time.”The emails also show Epstein coordinating arrangements with Hamptons contacts, including millionaire restaurateur Stephen Hanson. In a 2017 exchange, Hanson agreed to let women — who did not appear to be underage — stay at his Hamptons property for a weekend.Hanson, about 66 at the time and mentioned nearly 3,000 times in the files, is not accused of wrongdoing in the correspondence.Other threads show Hanson discussing making “jerky,” inviting the women to his Hamptons restaurant, and asking Epstein if any of them would join him at an opera after he “blew off” his wife. The files also indicate Hanson had previously visited Little St. James, Epstein’s private island.","Newly released Department of Justice files reveal that Jeffrey Epstein used the Hamptons as a primary hub for his ""grooming"" operations.

It took only a 15-second clip of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt duking it out on a crumbling rooftop at twilight to draw swift outrage, and sizeable fear, from Hollywood over the last few days. The widely circulated video was created by Irish director Ruairi Robinson using Seedance 2.0, a powerful artificial intelligence video generation tool owned by Chinese technology company ByteDance. It had plenty of the bells and whistles of a big-budget Hollywood film: sweeping camera angles, stunt choreography, crisp sound effects and haunting music.With a two-sentence prompt and the click of a button, Seedance had produced a stunningly realistic result that was a drastic improvement over previously generated AI videos, often shoddy clips known as AI slop. This video was so convincing that it drew near immediate condemnation from some of Hollywood's top organisations and companies.Rhett Reese, a scriptwriter known for his ""Deadpool"" films, said that the Cruise-Pitt video had sent a ""cold shiver"" up his spine. ""For all of us who work in the industry and devoted our careers and lives to it, I just think it's nothing short of terrifying,"" he remarked. ""I could just see it costing jobs all over the place.""ByteDance released Seedance 2.0 last week, nearly two months after a previous version had failed to prompt much anger.A news release from the company praised the updated tool's ""physical accuracy, realism and controllability,"" which it said was suitable for the needs of ""professional-grade creative scenarios.""Hollywood was swift to sit up straight.

“I’ll give the deal”: Streamer Rakai shares Deion Sanders college football comment after NFL Pro Bowl celebrity game reaction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/ill-give-the-deal-rakai-shares-deion-sanders-college-football-comment-after-nfl-pro-bowl-celebrity-game-reaction/articleshow/128486170.cms,"“I’ll give the deal”: Rakai shares Deion Sanders college football comment after NFL Pro Bowl celebrity game reaction (Image via Getty)

Deion Sanders responds to Rakai’s college football claim after NFL Pro Bowl celebrity game





Deion Sanders did not stay quiet after streamer Rakai shared a bold story online. The Colorado Buffaloes head coach was part of the NFL Pro Bowl weekend on February 15, where he coached a celebrity flag football game. After the game, Rakai, a 17-year-old YouTuber with nearly 940,000 subscribers, said on his stream that Sanders told him he should leave streaming and come play college football.That claim quickly caught attention. Soon after, a video from Well Off Media showed Sanders reacting when asked about Rakai’s words. Sitting in a barber’s chair, Sanders looked up and said, “Can you get Rakai on the phone so we can discuss this?” He then added, “I love him, I think he played his butt off, he has talent. I don’t know if he’s a college athlete at this point.” So while Deion Sanders praised the teenager’s effort, he also made it clear he was not fully backing the idea of a college offer.During his livestream, Rakai said, “Deion said, I’m not gonna lie Brodie, you wanna put down all that streamer stuff and come play college ball. I’ll give the deal.” Rakai also told his viewers, “I know I’m nice at football but I’m not doing all that.”However, Sanders’ public reaction felt different from that story. In the same Well Off Media video, Sanders later gave a strong message that many fans linked to the situation. He said, “I’m here to tell you, you need to get in the game. What does that mean? You on the sideline. You on the bench. You ain’t even in this thing. You just in the stands talking, talking, talking, running your mouth. But you got so much to say about those that are. Maybe get in the game. What you scared of, what you’re afraid of, but forget your yesterday and don’t fear tomorrow. Ain’t no way you can win if you ain’t in the game, but you always got something to say. I need you to shut up and get in the game.”Sanders did not name Rakai directly in that speech. Still, because of the way the video was edited, many viewers felt the timing was not random.On the field, Rakai actually played well for a celebrity event. He moved quickly, avoided defenders, and made plays on defense. But flag football at a celebrity showcase is very different from Power 4 college football. There is no public record of Rakai’s official height or weight. From the video, he appears smaller than most college prospects, which would matter at that level.At the same event, Sanders also joked about comedian Druski’s performance, saying with a smile, “You gave the other team everything you’ve got.” That moment went viral too, showing Sanders’ mix of humor and honesty.For now, there is no proof that Sanders offered Rakai a real college deal. What is clear is that one livestream comment turned a fun celebrity game into a big online debate between fans of football and streaming.","17-year-old YouTuber Rakai said Sanders told him he should leave streaming and come play college football.

Saudi Arabia’s new 'Work Interruption' Service explained: What happens when domestic workers stop showing up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabias-new-work-interruption-service-explained-what-happens-when-domestic-workers-stop-showing-up/articleshow/128448487.cms,"Saudi HR Ministry Introduces ‘Work Interruption’ Option for Absentee Domestic Workers

What is Saudi Arabia’s “Work Interruption” Service?



Domestic Workers Absent? Employers in Saudi Now Have Legal Exit Route

Regularising status via Musaned avoids informal or ad-hoc procedures. Efficient: Employers can initiate contract termination online instead of lengthy in-person paperwork.

Employers can initiate contract termination online instead of lengthy in-person paperwork. Fair: Workers are given defined time frames to resolve their status or seek new employment.

How Saudi Arabia’s Work Interruption Service works



If the worker has been in Saudi Arabia for less than two years, their contract can be terminated and they are required to exit the Kingdom within 60 days. Failure to do so breaches residency and labour laws.

If the worker has been in the Kingdom for more than two years, they have two options within 60 days: Transfer to a new employer or obtain a final exit visa and leave Saudi Arabia.

Saudi Arabia’s worker mobility and protection



Saudi Arabia Tightens Rules on Domestic Worker Absences with New Digital Service

Background: Labour policy reforms in Saudi Arabia



Digital platforms like Musaned and Qiwa



Musaned, historically used for domestic worker recruitment and documentation, is now expanding into full employment lifecycle services.

Qiwa, another national platform, has already introduced reforms such as a 60-day grace period before reporting a worker as absent, giving them time to re-contract, transfer or exit the Kingdom legally.

Correcting status of absent workers



Why Saudi Arabia’s Work Interruption Service matters: For employers and workers



For employers



Workers who disappear but remain legally in the country can create legal and logistical ambiguity.

Lack of formal procedures could lead to employers being unable to hire replacements quickly.

Unregulated exit or absence reports created disputes or misunderstandings.

For workers



A defined timeframe to regularise status rather than indefinite limbo.

Pathways to transfer employment rather than immediate repatriation in some cases.

Legal clarity about their rights and obligations under Saudi labour regulations.

Employers Get New Power Under Saudi’s Work Interruption Service

Contract transparency

Digital record-keeping

Time-bound status resolution

Worker mobility and employer rights





In a significant labour-market update, Saudi Arabia ’s Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development has launched a new digital service that fundamentally changes how domestic worker contracts can be handled when a worker stops showing up for work. The launch, via the national unified recruitment platform Musaned, is part of broader labour reforms aimed at streamlining employment processes and increasing contractual clarity and compliance across the Kingdom.The Work Interruption Service, introduced in February 2026, is an online mechanism that allows individual employers to legally end the employment contract of a domestic worker when the employee has ceased reporting to work. This resolves long-standing legal and administrative ambiguities that both employers and workers have faced under the previous framework.Earlier, if a domestic worker disappeared or failed to show up for work (“huroob”), employers had limited formal options. They often had to wait for months or navigate complex administrative processes to terminate the contract, while workers remained in unclear legal situations, sometimes without clear rights or protections.The new service aims to solve this by providing structured, digital tools that are -The Musaned platform, which already facilitates domestic worker recruitment, visas and documentation, now also hosts this work interruption functionality — extending its role as the central digital hub for household employment governance.When a domestic worker stops reporting to work, the employer can file a termination request through Musaned. This is legally recognised and initiates a formal process that replaces older, informal practices. Once the request is submitted:These 60-day grace periods represent a significant and structured timeline to balance both employer needs and worker rights.Importantly, the Work Interruption Service also incorporates labour mobility features, meaning that workers whose contracts are terminated have a chance to change employers under regulated conditions. This is a notable shift from older norms where workers had little agency once their contract ended or if they left their employer, conditions often tied to the kafala sponsorship system that Saudi Arabia has been reforming for several years.This mobility component indicates that the new service is not just about terminating contracts, it is about ensuring workers are not left stranded without legal rights. It aligns with other regulatory updates that give workers a defined “grace period” to regularise their status or transfer sponsorship.The launch of the Work Interruption Service should be seen against the backdrop of broader labour-system modernisation efforts in Saudi Arabia. Over the past two years, the country has introduced several digital tools and regulatory updates to formalise employment relations:These platforms are part of a broader digital governance strategy that aims to reduce manual bureaucracy, enhance transparency, and digitise labour-market interactions.Before the Work Interruption Service, Saudi Arabia had initiatives such as grace periods on Musaned for workers reported as absent to regularise their status or transfer to new employers, a measure already reflecting a shift towards more humane and structured labour policy. The new Musaned service consolidates these efforts into a more robust system that formalises the termination process itself instead of only offering status correction options.Employers of domestic staff, often families or private households, have historically faced challenges with contractual enforcement:With the Work Interruption Service, employers get a clear legal path to contract termination, reducing risk and confusion. This also benefits the domestic help sector by providing predictable standards for resolving conflicts, something that had been lacking in many informal arrangements.For domestic workers, especially expatriates from abroad, this reform provides:By formalising the process, the system aims to protect vulnerable workers from arbitrary or unfair treatment while still balancing employer needs. Domestic work has often operated in grey zones, with informal contracts or undocumented changes. By codifying termination and mobility processes digitally via Musaned, Saudi Arabia is pushing the sector towards formal labour governance, similar to reforms in the private sector that emphasise digital documentation and lawful compliance.While Saudi Arabia does not fully operate under international labour frameworks, these reforms bring its system closer to globally recognised best practices by ensuring:The Work Interruption Service gives employers a legal, digital way to terminate contracts when domestic workers stop showing up. It includes a grace period (usually 60 days), giving workers options to transfer sponsorship or exit the country legally. This system is part of broader Saudi labour reforms focusing on digital governance and contractual clarity. Workers and employers alike benefit from greater transparency and defined timelines. It complements other reforms like Qiwa’s grace periods and Musaned’s recruitment enhancements.Saudi Arabia’s Work Interruption Service represents a notable shift in how the Kingdom manages domestic employment relations, moving from largely manual, informal arrangements to structured, transparent, digital processes. It reflects ongoing efforts to modernise labour governance, protect rights on both sides and integrate labour-market activity into unified digital platforms like Musaned and Qiwa.Whether you are an employer seeking clarity in contractual enforcement or a domestic worker looking for secure legal pathways to navigate employment changes, this reform marks an important milestone in Saudi Arabia’s labour policy evolution.","Saudi Arabia ’s Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development has launched a new digital service that fundamentally changes how domestic worker contracts can be handled.

Obamas ’ Valentine’s Weekend 2026 that continued on-court

‘It’s True But…’: Barack Obama’s First Response After ALIEN Remark Sparks Big Debate | Full Detail

Sasha Obama: From first kid to independent adult in the spotlight

This visual contrast, from the world’s eyes to a more private adulthood, has sparked reflection and commentary about growing up in the public gaze and the transition to private life.

The Obamas as NBA All-Star ambassadors of fashion, culture and family

The NBA All-Star Game has long been about more than basketball. It is a cultural event blending sport, fashion, celebrity culture and entertainment. The presence of the Obamas, widely admired figures in politics, cultural discourse and public life, amplified that mix in a way that resonated across news outlets and social platforms.

At one of basketball’s biggest cultural nights of the year, Michelle Obama showcased her signature blend of elegance and athletic-inspired ease. Opting for a sleek, tailored jacket layered over classic pieces, she struck the perfect balance between polished sophistication and laid-back courtside cool. She delivered a masterclass in the monochrome courtside dressing as she paired the structured black jacket with flowing, wide-leg black trousers that elegantly revealed pointed black leather heeled boots. Her braids were swept into a high ponytail with soft, face-framing tendrils, allowing diamond stud earrings to subtly sparkle under the arena lights. The look felt both accessible and aspirational. Her choice echoed the event’s vibe: celebratory, stylish but never overly formal, anchoring her presence as both a cultural icon and an engaged fan in the stands.

Beside her, Barack Obama kept things relaxed yet refined in smart-casual attire that reflected his long-standing love for the sport. His understated look in clean lines, muted tones and classic layering complemented the evening’s energy: festive but rooted in timeless personal style. Seated beside basketball legend Julius Erving, Barack kept things relaxed yet refined in a navy bomber jacket layered over a black T-shirt and gray trousers. The former president, a longtime basketball enthusiast, also paused to snap photos with NBA superstar Stephen Curry, adding another memorable moment to the family’s stylish All-Star night.

Meanwhile, the couple’s youngest daughter, Sasha Obama, who was seated just behind her parents during the game, embraced a sleek, side-parted blowout with a polished, Gen-Z-meets-Millennial look that contrasted beautifully with her mother’s auburn-tinted braids. Her beauty aesthetic leaned fresh and minimal, complementing a dark gray knit top. However, it was her accessories that subtly stole attention as Sasha appeared to dip into her mom’s jewellery archive, finishing her look with long silver earrings that looked strikingly similar to the pair that Michelle wore during her Valentine’s Day outing with Barack Obama just a day earlier. Sasha radiated fresh, youthful confidence in the minimalist ensemble that felt right at home at a sporting spectacle.

Together, their fashion choices were not just about dressing up for a game; they communicated comfort, unity and elevated everyday style on one of basketball’s brightest stages. While the game itself featured compelling basketball action with stars from the Stars, Stripes and World teams competing in an exhibition format, it was the off-court narrative that captured social media virality.

Barack Obama, known for his love of basketball dating back to his youth, even had a viral courtside moment during the game when he deftly caught a loose ball headed toward their seats before it struck Michelle Obama. That clip quickly circulated online, with fans applauding everything from his reflexes to the wholesome nature of the moment.

The buzz over Obamas and broader All-Star energy

The Obamas were not the only notable attendees. The All-Star Game drew a constellation of celebrities, including Meghan Markle and Prince Harry in their own surprise courtside appearance. This celebrity convergence amplified attention on the event, not just as a sports fixture but as a cultural gathering. Photos and clips from the night were shared widely across Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok and other platforms, creating a cross-generational buzz that spanned basketball fans, political followers, entertainment audiences and fashion observers alike.

For many, Barack and Michelle Obama evoke a period of American political history tied to hope and change. Seeing them relaxed, affectionate and enjoying an evening together humanises public figures often seen only through the lens of policy or commentary. Unlike some celebrity children who grow up amid constant public exposure, Sasha and her sister Malia have largely been shielded from the media spotlight. This rare glimpse of Sasha enjoying a cultural milestone alongside her parents offered audiences a snapshot of her transition into adulthood.

Basketball and especially NBA All-Star Weekend has grown into a cultural phenomenon beyond sports. It reflects trends in music, fashion, celebrity culture, and media engagement. The Obamas’ presence linked that cultural moment to broader social narratives around family, love and media representation that attracted political followers, family-oriented media and fashion watchers alike.





On February 15, 2026, the Los Angeles Intuit Dome, host to the 75th annual NBA All-Star Game , became the backdrop for one of the most heartwarming celebrity sightings of the year: former US President Barack Obama , former First Lady Michelle Obama and their youngest daughter, Sasha Obama, enjoying a rare family outing together. Their presence turned the star-filled sporting event into a viral moment blending romance, family connection and basketball passion.Just a day before the All-Star Game, the Obamas celebrated Valentine’s Day with a date night that captured public attention. Their transition from a romantic evening to a family-centered sporting event the next day underscored not only their enduring bond as a couple but also their close family ties.Michelle Obama marked the Valentine’s celebration with a heartfelt social media post acknowledging her husband as her “forever dance partner,” offering a candid glimpse into their relationship beyond politics and public service. At the All-Star Game itself, the former first lady posted a photo of the family with the caption: “My favorite teammates on and off the court (sic).”One reason this story gathered so much attention is the rare public appearance of Sasha Obama, the youngest daughter of the former president and first lady. At 24, Sasha is now a graduate of the University of Southern California and has increasingly stepped away from public life. Her courtside appearance alongside her parents at a major sports event was notable precisely because it’s uncommon.Photographs captured Sasha sitting a row behind her parents, stylish and confident, wearing a simple gray ensemble and sharing in the excitement of the game. Observers noted how much she had grown up, a far cry from the young child who entered the White House at age seven during Barack Obama’s presidency.","Barack and Michelle Obama attended the NBA All-Star Game in New York.

The department has emphasised that consular officers around the world routinely deny visas for a range of reasons, including concerns over overstaying or criminal behaviour.Rubio has made similar points in the past, telling lawmakers that a visa is a privilege rather than a right and with a hardline ant-immigrant stance saying that there is no constitutional entitlement to one.","US State Department has reiterated that visas are not a guaranteed right and can be taken away if foreign visitors act against America's national interests.

As millions of Muslim believers prepare for pilgrimages like Hajj and Umrah, authorities in Saudi Arabia are enhancing healthcare coverage for pilgrims coming from outside the Kingdom. The aim is to ensure that pilgrims can undertake their spiritual journeys with confidence, safety and medical protection, even if they face emergencies or unexpected health needs during their stay.According to reports, the health insurance policy for pilgrims from overseas provides emergency health coverage for a period of up to 90 days, which includes:This scheme caters specifically to visitors on pilgrimage visas, not residents or citizens, offering a basic safety net for urgent healthcare during their time in the Kingdom.

Los Angeles flash flood warning: What residents need to know about upcoming storms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/los-angeles-flash-flood-warning-what-residents-need-to-know-about-upcoming-storms/articleshow/128438563.cms,"What’s happening now

Why the flood threat is serious

What flash flood warnings mean

Risk factors across Los Angeles

Burn scar areas — Hillsides affected by wildfire lack vegetation to absorb water, increasing the chance of debris flows and mudslides.

Urban zones — Heavy rain can quickly overwhelm storm drains and cause water to pool on streets and freeways.

— Heavy rain can quickly overwhelm storm drains and cause water to pool on streets and freeways. Mountain and canyon regions — Rapid runoff can elevate streams and cause hazardous conditions.

Official advice





Los Angeles and much of Southern California are facing flash flood risks as a series of strong storms moves through the region, bringing heavy rain, thunderstorms and hazardous conditions. Officials and forecasters warn residents to stay alert and prepared because flash floods can develop quickly and with little warning.A powerful weather system has brought intense rainfall to Southern California, including Los Angeles County. The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued flash flood warnings and watches for parts of the county as rainstorms dump significant moisture over the area.Heavy rain has already triggered warnings for places including the Santa Monica Mountains and burn scar zones like the Palisades and Franklin areas, where recent wildfires have left the ground more prone to dangerous debris flows and rapid runoff.Forecasters say this weather pattern is part of a larger system that could bring several days of precipitation, with the heaviest rainfall expected early in the week. Coastal and valley regions may see between 1 to 3 inches of rain, while mountain areas could receive between 2 to 5 inches or more.Storms may also be accompanied by strong winds and isolated thunderstorms. In some conditions, even weak tornado activity cannot be ruled out as part of the larger threat.A flash flood warning means flooding is imminent or already happening. Water can rise rapidly along streams, in urban streets, and in poorly drained areas. A flood watch, on the other hand, means conditions are favourable for flooding.Because flash floods can occur within minutes of heavy rain, authorities urge people not to drive through flooded roads and to seek higher ground if necessary.Certain areas are especially vulnerable:Authorities recommend monitoring local weather bulletins, signing up for emergency alerts, and preparing for possible evacuations in vulnerable locations. Roads may become dangerous, and officials warn that flash flooding can strike fast and without much notice.Staying informed through trusted weather services such as the NWS and local emergency management is essential during these conditions.",A powerful weather system has brought intense rainfall to Southern California.

The US Capitol police detained an 18-year-old man after he ran toward the west side of the Capitol building, carrying a loaded shotgun, prompting a swift law enforcement response.Authorities said the incident is under investigation, including whether members of Congress were the intended target. The arrest comes a week before President Donald Trump’s scheduled State of the Union address, though officials said security plans remain unchanged.According to Capitol police chief Michael Sullivan, the suspect parked a Mercedes SUV near the Capitol before exiting the vehicle and running several hundred yards toward the building while armed with a shotgun.Officers quickly intercepted him and ordered him to drop the weapon and lie on the ground, after which he was taken into custody without injuries.Sullivan said the shotgun was loaded, and the suspect was carrying additional ammunition.Police also recovered a tactical vest and gloves worn by the suspect, while a Kevlar helmet and gas mask were found inside the vehicle.Authorities said they have video footage of the incident and have appealed to members of the public to share any additional recordings that may assist the investigation.The suspect has been identified as Carter Camacho, an 18-year-old from Smyrna, Georgia.Police said he was not previously known to authorities and was not from the Washington area. Officials also noted that the vehicle used in the incident was not registered in his name and that he has multiple listed addresses.Camacho is currently being held on charges including unlawful activities, carrying a rifle without a license, possession of an unregistered firearm and possession of unregistered ammunition, according to a Capitol Police press release.Chief Sullivan said the department had recently conducted active shooter drills in nearly the same area where the incident occurred, highlighting the preparedness of officers on duty. “Who knows what would have happened if we hadn’t had officers standing here?” he said during a press briefing.The Capitol has seen similar security incidents in recent years. In 2023, Capitol Police arrested an Atlanta man armed with a rifle after he was spotted in a park near the Senate.Officials emphasised that Tuesday’s arrest will not affect security arrangements for the upcoming State of the Union address, noting that the event is treated with the highest level of security planning.The incident comes amid broader discussions around crime and security in Washington DC.Authorities said crime levels in the city have declined significantly in 2026 compared with 2025, which itself saw a sharp drop from the previous year. Last August, President Trump declared an emergency in the city to address crime, leading to the deployment of more than 2,000 National Guard members along with additional federal law enforcement personnel, many of whom remain stationed across Washington.Separately, a recent encounter involving US Marshals resulted in the death of a Washington resident after authorities responded to a report of a person allegedly threatening to kidnap and harm someone while armed.The incident is under investigation, and local activists have called for greater transparency from officials.","18-year-old man detained after he ran toward Capitol building with loaded shotgun.

Trump makes shocking claims about Jesse Jackson and Obama in tribute to late civil rights leader,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-makes-shocking-claims-about-jesse-jackson-and-obama-in-tribute-to-late-civil-rights-leader/articleshow/128485405.cms,"



Civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, a close associate of Martin Luther King Jr., passed away at 84 after battling Parkinson's and progressive supranuclear palsy. US President Donald Trump took to Truth Social to post a tribute to the late leader in a post that also made explosive claims about his relationship with former US President Barack Obama.On Tuesday, the President took to his social media platform to pay his respects to the two-time presidential candidate, calling him a ""good man, with lots of personality, grit and ""street smarts."""" He framed his relationship with Jackson as one of mutual respect and admiration and also stated that it was his ""pleasure to help Jesse along the way,"" despite being ""falsely and consistently"" called a racist by ""Radical Left, Democrats ALL. ""Trump then went on to mention the numerous initiatives and instances he helped the late leader with, including ""providing office space for him and his Rainbow Coalition for years in the Trump Building at 4- Wall Street,"" and ""pushed and passed long term funding for Historically Black Colleges & Universities (HBCUs)"" among other things.“Jesse was a force of nature like few others before him. He had much to do with the Election, without acknowledgement or credit, of Barack Hussein Obama, a man who Jesse could not stand,” Trump wrote.Ending his post with ""deepest sympathies and condolences"" to Jackson's family, he added that he ""will be missed"" and signed off, ""President DONALD J. TRUMP.""Trump's post comes in the light of recent accusations of 'racism' against him when he posted an online video of Barack and Michelle Obama depicted as apes on his social media platform, during Black History month and refused to take down the now-deleted video or apologise for it.Obama responded to the video in an interview with journalist Brian Tyler Cohen, calling his successor's behaviour ""deeply troubling"" and labelling it a ""clown show."" “Just days ago Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face on an ape’s body — and so again, we’ve kind of seen the devolution of the discourse,” said Cohen. “How do we come back from the place that we have fallen into?” he asked.“First of all, I think it’s important to recognise that the majority of the American people find this behaviour deeply troubling,” Obama responded. “It is true that it gets attention. It’s true that it’s a distraction, but as I’m travelling around the country, as you’re travelling around the country, you meet people — they still believe in decency, courtesy, kindness.” He stated that there was a ""sort of clown show"" playing out on social media and on television, adding that the sense of propriety and decorum for the office has been lost. “What is true is there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sense of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office. So that’s been lost,” he added.As for his relationship with Jackson, the two leaders enjoyed a bond that was occasionally marred by frustration but was dominated largely by support. In 2008, while Obama was running for President, a mic caught the late leader saying a controversial statement about the then-candidate after he made comments about absentee fathers in the African-American community. Jackson later apologised for the remark and also famously cried at Obama's 2008 election win, acknowledging the new President was running ""the last lap"" of the struggle for Black political empowerment.However, Trump has also had a rocky relationship with the Rainbow/PUSH coalition founder. As Trump mentioned in his tribute, the two connected in the 1990s when Trump provided office space to Jackson's coalition. At a 1999 press conference, Jackson referred to the then-business tycoon as a ""friend"" and praised him for ""reaching out and being inclusive.""Cracks appeared between the two associates during the 2016 presidential race when Jackson endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, when Trump was also running. He described Trump as ""affable and social"" in his early years but criticised his campaign ideas for being ""off the main line"" and claimed they could ""destabilise the country.""","US President Donald Trump took to his social media platform to pay his respects to the late civil rights leader Rev.

Blackstone founder Stephen Schwarzman plans to donate his entire $48 billion fortune to a major philanthropic foundation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/blackstone-founder-stephen-schwarzman-plans-to-donate-his-entire-48-billion-fortune-to-a-major-philanthropic-foundation/articleshow/128482163.cms,"Stephen Schwarzman’s plans for large-scale philanthropy

From Wall Street to global philanthropy





Stephen Schwarzman, the co-founder and chief executive of global investment firm Blackstone, is preparing to transfer most of his estimated $48 billion personal fortune into a philanthropic foundation, according to documents reviewed by the Wall Street Journal. If implemented, the plan would significantly expand the Stephen A. Schwarzman Foundation and could place it among the world’s largest charitable organisations. Schwarzman has said his philanthropic focus is centred on artificial intelligence, education and preparing societies for rapid technological change.The Wall Street Journal reported that Schwarzman and his team are planning a major expansion of the Stephen A. Schwarzman Foundation, which reported $65 million in total assets in 2024. Internal documents reviewed by the newspaper said the foundation recently hired an executive director to oversee future growth and long-term strategy. Neither Blackstone nor the foundation responded to requests for comment.Schwarzman is a signatory to the Giving Pledge, which encourages the world’s wealthiest individuals to donate most of their fortunes to charitable causes.His net worth is estimated at about $47.8 billion by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. If nearly all of that wealth is eventually transferred to the foundation, it would place it alongside major global philanthropies such as the Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust.In his Giving Pledge letter, Schwarzman said advances in artificial intelligence and computing could reshape employment, education and global competitiveness. He described an urgent need for societies to prepare for these changes and said these concerns had already led him to fund large-scale initiatives linked to AI, research and education.Schwarzman has also cited family influences on his approach to giving. He has said his grandfather regularly sent medical supplies to children overseas, while his father extended credit to newly arrived immigrants while running a small business in Philadelphia. He has described these experiences as shaping his view of philanthropy as both a responsibility and a privilege.Schwarzman began his career at Lehman Brothers in 1972 after earning an MBA from Harvard Business School. He rose to become a managing director before leaving in 1985 to co-found Blackstone with Peter G. Peterson. The firm launched with $400,000 and later grew into one of the world’s largest asset managers. Today, Blackstone oversees more than $1.3 trillion across private equity, real estate, private credit and infrastructure.Beyond domestic giving, Schwarzman has supported global education initiatives. In 2013, he founded the Schwarzman Scholars programme at Tsinghua University in Beijing, which funds a one-year master’s degree in global affairs and is often compared to the Rhodes Scholarship.In 2018, Schwarzman donated $350 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to establish the Schwarzman College of Computing. The gift was the largest in the university’s history. MIT said the funding was aimed at advancing artificial intelligence research while integrating ethical and societal considerations into computing education.In recent interviews, Schwarzman has said he now defines his legacy by what he is building for the future rather than past financial achievements, with philanthropy, education and technology at the centre of that long-term vision.","Schwarzman has said his philanthropic focus is centred on artificial intelligence, education and preparing societies for rapid technological change.

Trump Issues An Ultimatum To Iran On Nuclear Deal; 'Accept Or Face Fire'

(With AFP inputs)





Iran has not accepted all of the “red lines” outlined by US President Donald Trump for a diplomatic resolution, Vice President JD Vance said on Tuesday following the second round of talks in Switzerland's Geneva.Vance suggested that the United States remains open to diplomacy, even after Trump warned that military action could be considered if Iran’s clerical leadership fails to address key concerns, starting with its nuclear program.“In some ways, it went well; they agreed to meet again,” Vance told Fox News.“But in other ways, it was clear that the president has established certain red lines that the Iranians are not yet prepared to recognize or work through,” he added.“We will continue to pursue diplomatic efforts. However, the president reserves the right to determine when diplomacy has run its course. We hope it doesn’t come to that, but if it does, the decision will be the president’s,” Vance said.Meanwhile, Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, who participated in the talks with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner in Geneva, said Tehran and Washington had reached agreement on “guiding principles” for a potential deal aimed at preventing conflict.“Ultimately, we were able to reach broad agreement on a set of guiding principles, based on which we will move forward and begin working on the text of a potential agreement,” Araghchi told Iranian state television after the talks, describing them as “more constructive” than the first round held earlier this month.He also cautioned, however, that it “would take time to narrow” the differences between the two countries.Mediated by Oman, the talks were intended to avert possible US military intervention against Iran’s nuclear program, coming weeks after the cleric-run Islamic Republic reportedly killed thousands while suppressing mass protests.For years, Tehran has sought relief from sweeping US sanctions, including restrictions preventing other countries from buying Iranian oil.","Iran has not accepted all of the “red lines” outlined by US President Donald Trump for a diplomatic resolution, Vice President JD Vance said.

A Texas-based conservative activist stirred a row after questioning the presence of a 90-foot-tall statue of Lord Hanuman at the Shri Ashtalakshmi Temple in Sugar Land, Texas.Carlos Turcios, a Republican activist from the Dallas–Fort Worth area, shared a video of the statue on X, claiming that “third World Aliens are slowly taking over Texas and America” and urging people to “stop the invasion. ”The statue is known as the Panchaloha Abhaya Hanuman and was inaugurated in August 2024 and is the tallest of its kind in North America. Temple officials describe it as a symbol of strength, devotion, and a “spiritual epicenter” for peace.Indian-Americans quickly responded to Turcios’ post, pushing back against his claims. One wrote: “It’s on private property—built by Hindus on land they own and with their own money. You lost the culture war years ago, and you’re about to lose the midterms too. Your ‘America First’ grift is exposed as racist nostalgia.”Another commenter showed the assimilation of Indian-Americans through data, comparing language statistics in the US: “There are 41 million households that speak Spanish in the US. Yet there are no Indian languages in the top 10. Since household language is the strongest indicator of assimilation, you have a long way to go before your group is anywhere near the assimilation level of Indian-Americans.”Turcios has previously criticised H-1B visas, claiming that Indian immigrants were “invading” places like Frisco, Texas. He is not the only figure criticising the visa system. Nikki Haley's son Nalin Haley, former Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and Florida governor Ron DeSantis have all wanted a long ban on the H1-B visa system saying it is exploitive in nature and scams domestic Americans out of their jobs.Moreover, there are numerous prominent figures in the Trump administration who follow Hinduism. Former DOGE leader Vivek Ramaswamy, National Intelligence bigwig Tulsi Gabbard, FBI director Kash Patel and second lady and US vice president's wife Usha Vance.The Hanuman statue remains a significant cultural and religious symbol for the local Indian-American community, and the temple continues to welcome visitors, despite online controversy.","Carlos Turcios shared a video of the statue on X, claiming that “third World Aliens are slowly taking over Texas and America’ The statue is known as the Panchaloha Abhaya Hanuman and was inaugurated in August 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128481230,imgsize-877617,width-400,resizemode-4/128481230.jpg"

Early collaboration

Political split

Jackson and Obama





Donald Trump has paid tribute to the Rev Jesse Jackson following the civil rights leader’s death, describing him as a longtime associate and inspiration. But the relationship between the two men was complex, stretching from cooperation in New York business circles to sharp political disagreement on the national stage.Jackson died on on Tuesday at the age of 84. Announcing his passing, the Rainbow PUSH Coalition said: “It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of Civil Rights leader and founder of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the Honorable Rev. Jesse Louis Jackson Sr. He died peacefully on Tuesday morning, surrounded by his family.”In a post on Truth Social hours after Jackson’s death, Trump wrote: “I knew him well, long before becoming President. He was a good man, with lots of personality, grit, and ‘street smarts.’ He was very gregarious - Someone who truly loved people!”He added that he had supported Jackson’s organisation for years by providing office space in Manhattan and shared many old pictures with hum. “Despite the fact that I am falsely and consistently called a Racist by the Scoundrels and Lunatics on the Radical Left, Democrats ALL, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way,” Trump wrote, saying Jackson was given space “for years, in the Trump Building at 40 Wall Street. ”Trump also credited Jackson’s advocacy with influencing some of his own policies. “Responded to his request for help in getting CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM passed and signed, when no other President would even try; Single handedly pushed and passed long term funding for Historically Black Colleges & Universities (HBCUs), which Jesse loved, other Presidents would not do,” he wrote.“Responded to Jesse’s support for Opportunity Zones, the single most successful economic development package yet approved for Black businessmen/women, and much more. Jesse was a force of nature like few others before him.”Long before Trump entered politics, the two men crossed paths in New York. In the 1990s, Trump provided office space to Jackson’s Rainbow PUSH Coalition. At a 1999 press conference, Jackson referred to Trump as a “friend” and said, “in terms of reaching out and being inclusive, he's done that, too.”Trump, speaking at the same event, joked about Jackson’s negotiating skills. “Jesse started off by saying, ‘most of the wealth in this country is in the hands of a few.’ And I thought to myself: is that a bad thing?” he said, drawing laughs. He added: “He's a very tough negotiator ... Nah, he's a terrific guy. We love him, and I'm here for him.”Their relationship changed once Trump entered politics. During the 2016 presidential race, Jackson endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Speaking to Bloomberg Television that year, Jackson described Trump as “affable and social” in earlier years but criticised his campaign positions.“These ideas are not just conservative, they are somewhat way off the main line. They could destabilize the country,” Jackson said, referring to Trump’s policies on immigration, foreign affairs and healthcare. He declined to label Trump a racist, saying he did not want to make the campaign about “branding.”In 2020, Jackson endorsed veteran leader Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary.Trump’s recent tribute also claimed Jackson helped elect Barack Obama, “a man who Jesse could not stand.” Jackson had publicly supported Obama, although he did make critical remarks during the 2008 campaign that he later apologised for, saying he believed they were off the record.Obama also paid tribute to Jackson in a post on X:After Obama’s victory in 2008, Jackson was visibly emotional. “We are a better America today,” he told CBS. “America is a work in progress, and last night we saw that that work in a most magnificent way expressed.”Over decades, Jackson remained one of the most prominent Black leaders in America, a two time presidential candidate and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.","Jackson died on on Tuesday at the age of 84.

"Dallas becoming 'Dallaspuram': Indian festival video from Texas resurfaces amid H-1B visa row, MAGA responds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dallas-becoming-dallaspuram-indian-festival-video-from-texas-resurfaces-amid-h-1b-visa-row-maga-responds/articleshow/128480179.cms,"



A viral social media post claiming Dallas is being turned into “Dallaspuram” has stirred a row over immigration and H1B visas after old festival footage resurfaced online.The post, shared by X user @CyberGreen09 shows a lively Ganesh Chaturthi procession in a Dallas area suburb. People dressed in traditional Indian attire can be seen playing dhol and tasha drums in what appears to be a shopping centre car park.The caption reads: “Dallas is being transformed into ‘Dallaspuram’ before our eyes.”It adds and blames the visa system for such an environment: “H1B visas are being used to import Indians for basic jobs Texans can do. These guys aren’t top global talent, it’s industrial fraud destroying our great state. Time to put Texans first and end the H1B program!”However, the video is not recent. The clip dates back to August 2025 and was filmed during Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations outside India Bazaar in Lewisville, a northern suburb of Dallas with a large Indian community. The footage first went viral last year.Hindu Americans described it as a joyful annual cultural celebration but the MAGA base complained it caused disruption and ruckus in a commercial parking area.The same video had been repurposed in online debate about immigration and the H1B visa programme which is under high scrutiny right now.Far right commentator and anti-H1B speaker Andrew Branca also reposted the video and said: ""W**, America. Was this what our Founders envisioned?""The Dallas Fort Worth metro area is home to more than 250,000 Indian Americans.Many live in suburbs such as Frisco, Plano and Lewisville, which have grown into major technology and business hubs.In 2024, around 71 per cent of approved H1B visas went to Indian nationals, according to federal data.A lot of American employers and bussinessmen say skilled migration has boosted the local economy and strengthene crucial sectors like tech and defence. The 'America First' supporters says the system is flawed and steals jobs from domestic US workers and hands them to Indians and Chinese workers on a much lower salary.Similar tensions surfaced at a Frisco city council meeting few days ago, where some residents voiced fears of an “Indian takeover” in the region.","The post, shared by X user @CyberGreen09 shows a lively Ganesh Chaturthi procession in a Dallas area suburb.

The US military struck three alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean on Monday night, killing all 11 people on board, US Southern Command said Tuesday.“Intelligence confirmed the vessels were transiting along known narco-trafficking routes and were engaged in narco-trafficking operations,” Southern Command said in a statement. “Eleven male narco-terrorists were killed during these actions, 4 on the first vessel in the Eastern Pacific, 4 on the second vessel in the Eastern Pacific, and 3 on the third vessel in the Caribbean. No U.S. military forces were harmed. ”The strikes brought the death toll from the US campaign, which began in September, up to at least 135 people killed, with several more survivors of the strikes presumed dead. The last US strike on a suspected drug-trafficking vessel was carried out Friday in the Caribbean and killed three people, according to Southern Command.Last fall, the Trump administration produced a classified legal opinion that justified the lethal strikes against a secret list of at least two dozen cartels and suspected drug traffickers classifying them as enemy combatants, CNN has reported.The strikes came under intense scrutiny by legal experts and Democratic members of Congress who said they amounted to murdering civilians since the US was not in a declared, congressionally authorised war with drug cartels.In at least one instance last September, the US military deliberately killed survivors after an initial strike on an alleged trafficking vessel did not kill everyone on board, prompting accusations that the US had committed a war crime and sparking congressional investigations.Before the US military began blowing up boats in September, countering illicit drug trafficking was handled by law enforcement and the US Coast Guard, and cartel members and drug smugglers were treated as criminals with due process rights. The Coast Guard continued to interdict drug-trafficking vessels and seizing narcotics in the eastern Pacific without the use of lethal force.","The US military struck three alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean on Monday night, killing all 11 people on board.

Top Trump aide Tricia McLaughlin to leave DHS — Has Trump’s immigration crackdown gone too far?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/top-trump-aide-tricia-mclaughlin-to-leave-dhs-has-trumps-immigration-crackdown-gone-too-far/articleshow/128479551.cms,"



One of the most outspoken faces of Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown is stepping down, raising questions about internal rift in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).Tricia McLaughlin, the chief spokesperson for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, is leaving the Trump administration next week, according to two DHS officials familiar with the move. She is expected to inform colleagues of her decision on Tuesday, reports Politico.Her departure comes at a sensitive moment. The department is facing a funding lapse as Republicans and Democrats negotiate possible reforms to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). It also follows growing public disapproval about the administration’s hardline immigration approach.A Reuters/Ipsos poll last week found that 58 per cent of Americans believe Trump's crackdown has gone too far.McLaughlin was widely seen as one of the administration’s most forceful defenders of its immigration policies.She is a former ABC News contributor and also frequently appeared on Fox News, CNN, CBS, NPR and Newsmax, sometimes logging up to five media appearances a day. She described the communications battle over immigration in stark terms.“Media is so much of the battle, so to speak, on the immigration issue,” she told the Cincinnati Enquirer last month.She added: “So much of the debate is a [public relations] debate. It’s a PR war.”Her exit had been planned since December, according to people briefed on the matter, but was delayed in the aftermath of the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis at the hands of federal agents last month.McLaughlin previously worked for Vivek Ramaswamy’s 2024 presidential campaign and Ohio governor Mike DeWine. During Trump’s first term, she served under Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and at the State Department on arms control issues.Her high-profile role brought backlash from Democrats.Despite this, she retained the president’s public backing. After a December appearance on Fox, Trump praised the “wonderful TRICIA MCLAUGHLIN” and also said, “Tricia really knows her ‘STUFF!’”On New Year’s Day, McLaughlin appeared to address critics indirectly by sharing a meme on Instagram that read: “Your boos mean nothing. I’ve seen what makes you cheer.”The DHS has faced a lot of criticism in recent months, including a Wall Street Journal report that described “constant chaos” within the agency and questioned Kristi Noem’s leadership. The article referred to allegations that a US Coast Guard pilot was dismissed for misplacing the secretary’s blanket. Some inside the GOP administration have expressed frustration over the department’s handling of high-profile incidents. At one stage, Trump appointed border czar Tom Homan to oversee operations in Minneapolis, a move seen by some as a sign of concern about Noem’s approach.Noem confirmed Tricia's imminent departure in a statement: “She has played an instrumental role in advancing our mission to secure the homeland and keep Americans safe. While we are sad to see her leave, we are grateful for her service and wish Tricia nothing but success.”","Tricia McLaughlin, the chief spokesperson for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, is leaving the Trump administration next week.

Jeffrey Epstein’s Zorro Ranch to be probed after unanimous vote by New Mexico lawmakers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jeffrey-epsteins-zorro-ranch-to-be-probed-after-unanimous-vote-by-new-mexico-lawmakers/articleshow/128477915.cms,"



Lawmakers in New Mexico unanimously approved new legislation on Monday authorising a probe into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ’s Zorro Ranch, located 30 miles from Santa Fe.The legislation created a special committee of state representatives, including two from both the Democratic and Republican parties, to investigate happenings at the ranch and related allegations of criminal activity, Hill reported.The effort, which cost Rs 20.8 crore, according to Reuters, coincided with a federal push to release new information tied to Epstein and his associates, led by the Department of Justice (DOJ).“Many of the survivors had experiences in New Mexico, and as we’ve learned, you know, there were local politicians and other people that were aware of what was happening in New Mexico,” attorney Sigrid McCawley, whose law firm represented hundreds of Epstein survivors, told Reuters.The survivors allegedly abused at the ranch included the late Virginia Giuffre, who had said she’d visited the ranch many times, per Reuters.Epstein was named in several civil suits accusing him of sexually assaulting girls at the ranch, but he was never charged as a result of the allegations, according to Reuters.“There were clearly activities that took place here under the guise of Jeffrey Epstein … and other perpetrators,” state Rep.Andrea Romero (D) told Axios in a phone interview.Former New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas attempted to investigate Epstein’s crimes in 2019 but was told to halt the probe by federal prosecutors to avoid a “parallel investigation,” Reuters also reported.However, current state Attorney General Raúl Torrez assigned a special agent to handle any new crimes discovered as a result of state lawmakers’ investigation, spokesperson Lauren Rodriguez told the outlet.The New Mexico Department of Justice also sent a letter to the federal DOJ requesting an unredacted copy of a 2019 email from an anonymous sender that alleged two “foreign girls” were buried at Zorro Ranch, according to Source NM.","Lawmakers in New Mexico unanimously approved new legislation on Monday authorising a probe into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ’s Zorro Ranch.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has opened investigations into three school districts following student protests against US immigration enforcement, alleging that school officials may have failed to protect students and disrupt classrooms.The probe was announced on Monday and focuses on North East Independent School District in San Antonio, the Dallas Independent School District and the Manor Independent School District. It follows a similar inquiry into Austin Independent School District. Paxton said his office is also reviewing claims that administrators and faculty helped organise the demonstrations.“I will not allow Texas schools to become breeding grounds for the radical Left’s open borders agenda,” Paxton said.He added: “Let this serve as a warning to any public school official or employee who unlawfully facilitates student participation in protests targeting our heroic law enforcement officers: my office will use every legal tool available to hold you accountable.”The investigations come after hundreds of students across Texas took part in walkouts earlier this year, protesting immigration enforcement. The demonstrations were part of a national movement following the deaths of several people in actions by federal immigration officersy especially Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.Students called for the dismantling of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Protests took place in cities including Austin, San Antonio and Waco.State leaders have also responded. Governor Greg Abbott warned that school districts could lose funding and said students who break the law during protests could face arrest. The Texas Education Agency has stated that districts found to have facilitated walkouts may face state intervention.Paxton’s office is requesting records from the three districts, including student leave policies, excused absences, security procedures, internal communications about the protests, and the use of public funds. The investigation will also examine whether any laws were broken.The three districts involved are among the largest in Texas.

Pakistan Army Chief Asim Munir was briefly stopped and asked to produce his identity card by security staff at the Munich Security Conference in Germany.A video that went viral on social media showed a security officer asking the Pakistani army chief to keep his identity card visible. Just steps away from the conference entry, a security official is heard saying, “Stop… where is your ID? Please flip your ID card. ”The Munich Security Conference, widely regarded as a key platform for dialogue and conflict resolution, annually brings together world leaders, diplomats, and security experts to address international peace and security challenges.Meanwhile, Munir’s visit was also objected to by Germany-based Sindhi political organisation Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), which called the invitation “deeply regrettable.” Members of the JSMM protested outside the venue, highlighting alleged human rights violations in Pakistan.In a formal statement addressed to the United Nations, the European Union, the German government, and international human rights bodies, JSMM Chairman Shafi Burfat expressed what he described as “deep shock and regret” over Munir’s presence at the high-level global forum.JSMM alleged that Pakistan’s military establishment has a historical record of human rights violations and political interference.The group referred to the 1971 events in former East Pakistan that led to the creation of Bangladesh, describing them as genocide. It also accused Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies of supporting extremist elements in the region — allegations that Islamabad has consistently denied.The organisation further claimed that Pakistan’s military wields disproportionate influence over the country’s political and judicial institutions. It cited the assassinations of former leaders, including Liaquat Ali Khan and Benazir Bhutto, as well as the execution of former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, as examples of alleged instability linked to military dominance.

'Imran Khan’s Health Stable, But Facing Mental Torture', Claims Sister After Jail Visit





PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan underwent an eye examination at Adiala Jail on Sunday following a Supreme Court order, with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) calling the process as “malicious” and questioning the exclusion of his family and personal doctors.According to news website Dawn, a five-member medical team conducted a detailed examination that lasted about an hour. The doctors collected blood samples, measured his blood pressure and brought their own equipment. The process reportedly began after a two-and-a-half-hour wait and a report is expected to be compiled soon.Shortly after the examination ended around 5.30 pm, PTI issued a statement on X rejecting the procedure and objecting to the absence of Imran’s family and personal physicians.“Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf categorically rejects the recent conduct of the government and jail administration regarding the medical examination of former prime minister Imran Khan's eye in Adiala Jail. The government's claim that a message was sent to the party leadership to arrive at the jail at the time of the examination is, in fact, a crude attempt to divert attention from the core issue,” the party said.Explaining its objection, the statement added, “This matter was never about the presence or absence of the party leadership.In such sensitive and delicate medical matters, the constitutional, moral, and legal right to make decisions belongs to Imran Khan's family. The family cannot make an informed decision until Imran Khan's personal doctors are present for the examination. Therefore, inviting the party leadership symbolically has neither any moral rationale nor any legal justification. ”Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum also said that no medical board would be accepted without the approval of his personal doctors.Referring to reports that he might be shifted to Al-Shifa Eye Hospital in Rawalpindi, she reiterated, “Our demand has been clear from the beginning. Imran Khan shall not be given any treatment without the presence and approval of his personal doctors and family members.”She further said, “We do not accept any medical board they set up and control! We do not accept any reports or results they manufacture.”Questioning the exclusion of family members and doctors recommended by Imran’s team, she asked, “Why are they rejecting the supervision by Imran Khan's personal doctors? Why are they rejecting the presence of Imran Khan's family members? Why such fierce resistance? Are they hiding something?”The examination was carried out after the Supreme Court directed the formation of a medical board to assess Imran’s condition. The order followed his claim on February 12 that his right eye retained only 15 per cent vision. The court also allowed him to speak with his children before February 16.Although government officials had indicated on Saturday that Imran might be transferred to a hospital, no shift had taken place by Sunday afternoon. At 3.45 pm, his sister Noreen Khanum said that an ambulance had arrived at the jail to move him.“But, this is unacceptable to us without us and Khan sahib's personal doctors being taken into confidence,” she said.The jail superintendent dismissed reports of a transfer as a “rumour” and clarified that only a medical examination was underway.“The medical team will examine Imran's eyes, conduct different tests, and decide whether there is a requirement to move him to a hospital or if he can be retained in jail and continue the treatment here,” the superintendent said.Imran had earlier undergone a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad on the night of January 24, a development that was confirmed later amid limited information shared with his family.Imran’s personal physicians, Aasim Yusuf and Faisal Sultan, also called for a comprehensive evaluation at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad, news agnecy PTI reported citing Dawn.In a joint video statement they said, “In addition to urgent retina specialist care for his central retinal vein occlusion and severe vision loss, Imran Khan needs a full multidisciplinary evaluation of his underlying conditions at a tertiary hospital like Shifa International Islamabad.”Meanwhile, the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) alliance continued its sit-in at Parliament House for the third day, demanding that Imran be treated at a hospital chosen by his personal doctors.PTI MNA Asad Qaiser told reporters, “We will not compromise on Imran's health.”A TTAP leader said that the initial understanding to shift Imran to Shifa International collapsed due to demands to change the composition of the medical board. The alliance also alleged that access to food, water and medicines inside Parliament House had been blocked for the third day.Describing the reported denial of medicine to Senator Abbas as an “extreme and condemnable act,” the alliance said, “Prioritising any political disagreement over human compassion and medical needs is the worst form of oppression.”Vowing to continue the protest, TTAP stated, “History bears witness that tyrannical tricks, sieges, and oppression have never suppressed movements, nor forced those standing firm on the right side to back down from their demands.”The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan expressed grave concern over the health of PTI-affiliated prisoners, particularly Imran Khan and Yasmin Rashid and urged authorities to ensure immediate independent medical examinations and uninterrupted access to treatment.",Imran Khan underwent an eye examination at Adiala Jail on Sunday following a Supreme Court order. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) called the process as “malicious’ and questioned the exclusion of his family and personal doctors. Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum also said that no medical board would be accepted without the approval of his personal physicians.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128389240,imgsize-747332,width-400,resizemode-4/128389240.jpg"

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) on Sunday claimed it has detained 17 Pakistani soldiers, releasing 10 while giving the Pakistani government one week to arrange a prisoner swap for the remaining seven.In a purported statement attributed to the BLA’s media wing, Hakkal, spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch described the move as the “second phase of Operation Herof.”According to the statement, the 10 released soldiers were identified as ethnic Baloch men affiliated with local policing structures and were freed after being “warned.” The group maintained that the move reflected “ground realities” and the “broader interests” of the Baloch population.“The remaining detainees are members of regular units of the Pakistan Army. Proceedings were convened in a Baloch National Court, where the captives faced accusations ranging from involvement in actions against civilians to aiding enforced disappearances and taking part in the genocide of the Baloch people. During the hearing, the men were allowed to respond to the allegations, evidence was presented, and statements were recorded before a guilty verdict was delivered,” the statement read.Despite the reported “convictions,” the BLA stated it was granting Islamabad seven days to formally express readiness for a prisoner exchange. It asserted that should such willingness be demonstrated within that period, the seven detainees could be swapped for Baloch prisoners.The statement also accused Pakistani authorities of ""failing to act"" on previous exchange proposals and, in doing so, not prioritising the lives of their personnel. It added that the “court sentence” would be carried out if no tangible progress is made within a week.There was no immediate official response from the military or the government.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claims it has detained 17 Pakistani soldiers, releasing 10 while giving the Pakistani government one week to arrange a prisoner swap for the remaining seven.

Baloch Leader Akhtar Mengal Stuns Pakistan, Says Balochistan's 'Separation Is The Only Option Now'





The recent disappearances of several people in Balochistan have been linked to Pakistan’s security apparatus, sparking fear and anxiety among families.At least seven individuals are reported missing in incidents connected to Panjgur and Karachi.Residents of Pulabad, a locality in Panjgur, described a recent raid where armed personnel searched homes and detained at least six people. Witnesses said those taken were transported to unknown locations. Locals mentioned two names, Inayat and Rasheed, while the identities of the other detainees could not be independently confirmed, reported ANI citing The Balochistan Post.In a separate case, 23-year-old Zulfiqar, son of Hameed and a resident of Tasp, was reportedly seized from a marketplace on February 13, 2026. Locals alleged that men linked to a state-backed armed faction, commonly described as a “death squad,” carried out the detention. Family members have not received any information regarding his condition since the incident.Another case raising alarm involves Zakir Noor, a student from Panjgur, who was allegedly detained in Karachi on December 30, 2025.The Baloch rights organisation Paank said he was taken by security personnel without legal documentation.Noor has not contacted his family since, fueling fears he may have been transferred to an undisclosed detention site.Paank said secret confinement places detainees at serious risk and violates international safeguards against arbitrary arrest. Activists added that the pattern disproportionately affects students and young men, especially those who migrate to major cities for education or work.","At least seven individuals are reported missing in incidents connected to Panjgur and Karachi.

Imran Khan’s Family Stages Prayer Protest After Being Barred From Meeting Him At Adiala Jail

'We were not consulted': Imran Khan’s sister

(With AP inputs)





Pakistan’s information minister Ataullah Tarar on Saturday announced that imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan will undergo treatment for an eye condition at a specialised medical facility, days after the Supreme Court ordered a medical evaluation amid growing concerns about the cricketer-turned-politician’s eyesight.Tarar wrote on X that an examination would be conducted by leading eye specialists as part of Khan’s ongoing treatment, which began in late January after the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder-chairman claimed ""partial loss of vision"" in his right eye.The minister, however, did not specify the medical facility or the date of treatment and urged the public to avoid speculation.“A detailed report will also be submitted to the Supreme Court. Conjecture, speculations, and efforts to turn this into political rhetoric and mileage for vested interests may please be avoided,” Tarar posted.Earlier this week, Khan’s lawyer and PTI member Salman Safdar told the Supreme Court that the ex-premier had lost roughly 85% of vision in his right eye. The court subsequently directed authorities to arrange a medical assessment by a panel of doctors and facilitate a telephone call between Khan and his two UK-based sons before February 16.PTI supporters have staged protests in the capital, Islamabad, and other cities, demanding that their party chief be shifted from prison to a hospital for specialised treatment. Some lawmakers from PTI and its allies are also staging a sit-in outside Parliament.Meanwhile, Khan’s sister Aleema Khan reacted angrily to Tarar's announcement, saying the family had not been consulted and demanding that family members and his personal physician be present during any future procedures.She confirmed that, following the Supreme Court’s directive, authorities had arranged a call between her brother and his two sons, who live with their mother and his former wife, British screenwriter and producer Jemima Goldsmith.Khan was removed from office in a parliamentary no-confidence vote in April 2022. He has alleged that his ouster was the result of a US-backed “conspiracy” involving political rivals and Pakistan’s then army chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa — allegations denied by Washington, Pakistan’s military, and Khan’s political opponents.The issue of Khan’s partial vision surfaced in late January when the federal government said the former prime minister had undergone a medical procedure for an eye condition and was in ""good health.""The PTI made a strong showing in the February 2024 parliamentary elections but did not secure a majority in the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament. The party alleged the vote was “rigged,” a claim the government has denied.","Pakistan’s information minister Ataullah Tarar on Saturday announced that imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan will undergo treatment for an eye condition.

Imran Khan’s Family Stages Prayer Protest After Being Barred From Meeting Him At Adiala Jail





The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Thursday directed authorities to constitute a medical board to assess the health of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan after reports surfaced about a loss of vision in one of his eyes.A bench comprising Chief Justice Yahya Afridi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan also instructed officials to facilitate communication between Khan and his two sons, who live in the United Kingdom with his former wife, British producer and screenwriter Jemima Goldsmith.“The issue of Imran’s health is most important. Intervention is necessary. His phone calls with his son are also important,” Chief Justice Afridi said during the hearing.The order came after the bench resumed hearing a case about the jail conditions of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder-president and ordered a detailed medical check-up before February 16. During the hearing, Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan said it was the state’s responsibility to provide the former prime minister with medical care.The order also came two days after the court asked PTI leader and lawyer Salman Safdar to meet Khan at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where the cricketer-turned-politician has been held since August 5, 2023, following his conviction in a corruption case.Safdar later submitted his report to the court after meeting Khan. It was the first meeting with the jailed leader since December 2, when his sister, Uzma Khan, was allowed to see him for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, Dawn newspaper, citing the report, noted that it detailed Safdar’s meeting with Khan, the condition of his cell, the facilities provided to him, a description of his living area and the process the lawyer followed to reach the jail.In the report, Safdar quoted Khan as stating that despite receiving treatment, including an injection, he has only 15% vision left in his right eye.Khan reportedly told Safdar that until October 2025, he had normal vision in both eyes. He later began experiencing constant blurred and hazy vision, which he repeatedly reported to the then jail superintendent, but no action was taken.The report added that Khan eventually suffered a sudden and complete loss of vision in his right eye. An eye specialist from Pims Hospital, Dr Muhammad Arif, was then called to examine him.He was diagnosed with a blood clot that caused serious damage. Despite treatment, including an injection, his vision in the right eye remains at only 15 per cent.A day earlier, Safdar denied making any statement about Khan’s health on Tuesday, clarifying that anything attributed to him on the matter had been misrepresented or misreported.However, on the day he met Khan, Safdar told reporters that the jailed leader was “fine and healthy.”","The Supreme Court of Pakistan has ordered a medical board to assess the health of Imran Khan.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has delivered a scathing assessment of his country’s past alliances with Washington, telling the National Assembly that Islamabad had been “used like toilet paper and then discarded” after serving American interests in Afghanistan.Speaking during a debate on terrorism following a deadly suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Islamabad, Asif said Pakistan had repeatedly joined “superpower wars” that were never its own.“We took part in two wars that were fought on the soil of Afghanistan,” Asif told lawmakers. Referring to the Soviet intervention in 1979, he claimed it was carried out “at the invitation of the government in Kabul” and that the narrative of an outright invasion was shaped by the United States.Pakistan, he said, entered those conflicts “in the name of Islam and religion”, but in reality two former military dictators sought legitimacy and the backing of a global power.“These were not our wars; they were superpower wars,” he said, adding that Pakistan and its land were used and then discarded ""like toilet paper.""Asif went on to describe terrorism in Pakistan as the “blowback of mistakes committed by dictators in the past”.He added that Pakistan had failed to learn from history, continuing to shift between Washington, Moscow and London in pursuit of short-term interests.""For our own interests, we sometimes turn to Washington, sometimes to Moscow, and sometimes to Britain. We have built strong franchises here, which was not the case 30 or 40 years ago,"" Asif said.Recalling then US President Bill Clinton’s brief stop in Islamabad in 2000, a visit lasting only a few hours at the end of a longer India trip, Asif said it underscored how transactional the relationship had become. Clinton’s engagement with then military ruler Pervez Musharraf was framed by US demands on democracy, non-proliferation and militancy, reinforcing.Asif’s remarks came as parliament passed a resolution condemning the attack on Imambargah Qasr-e-Khadijatul Kubra in Islamabad’s Tarlai area, where a suicide bomber killed 31 people and wounded 169 during Friday prayers. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. Thousands attended funerals across the capital as grieving families demanded accountability. “What happened yesterday has left us extremely angry and deeply hurt,” said Bushra Rahmani, whose brother was among the wounded.The minister urged political unity, lamenting what he called a lack of consensus even in condemning terrorism. “It is very important that we have a national identity on which no one disagrees,” he said, criticising those who, for political reasons, avoided attending the funerals of victims.","Defence minister Khawaja Asif criticises Pakistan's past alliances with the U.S. and Russia.

‘China no longer trusts us’

Backdrop of deadly Islamabad attack





Pakistan’s Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday launched a sharp attack on Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy, questioning how extremist elements continue to cross the border even as trade remains blocked.Speaking at a public gathering in Rawalpindi, Rehman highlighted what he described as a glaring contradiction in Islamabad’s approach towards Afghanistan. “In all these decades, we never paused to ask why our Afghan policy failed so miserably. Not a single pomegranate or melon can enter Pakistan, yet terrorists keep crossing the border,” he said, smiling as he made the remark.Referring to repeated claims by Pakistani authorities that militants were entering from Afghanistan, Rehman added, “Authorities say terrorists are coming from there. If they are coming, stop them. If they are coming, eliminate them. The Afghan government has never objected to your actions.”The JUI-F leader also criticised Pakistan’s broader foreign and economic policies, calling them “complete failures”. He said Islamabad’s diplomatic approach had left the country increasingly isolated.“India is our enemy, Afghanistan is our enemy, and even Iran and China are upset with us,” Rehman said, adding that the public deserved answers.“A nation cannot survive when its policies produce only isolation, mistrust and insecurity.”He argued that Pakistan’s foreign policy was being driven not by elected governments but by the military establishment. “One general comes and says we will negotiate; another comes and says we will wage war,” he said.Rehman also took aim at the government’s handling of the China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC), claiming that the flagship infrastructure project had stalled due to declining Chinese confidence.“CPEC has seen no real progress during this tenure because China no longer trusts us,” he said, questioning whether “even a single brick” had moved under the current government. He claimed Beijing had expected the Pakistan democratic movement (PDM) government to stabilise relations and revive projects, but remained dissatisfied.Rehman’s remarks come amid heightened tensions following a suicide bombing at a mosque in Islamabad on Friday that killed 69 people and injured more than 170, according to local media reports citing hospital officials. The blast occurred during Friday prayers at Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra in the Tarlai area, Dawn reported.After Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif suggested on X that preliminary findings pointed to the attacker having travelled to and from Afghanistan, Kabul rejected the allegation. Afghanistan’s ministry of national defence termed the claim “irresponsible and baseless” and urged Pakistani authorities to take responsibility for internal security lapses, Afghan media outlet Ariana News reported.The Afghan ministry said similar accusations had been made in the past following attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, without conclusive evidence.","Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman criticises Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy.

'Not Vassals Of Trump & Elon Musk': Spain's Deputy PM Makes Blistering Exit From 'Place Of Hate' X





Pakistan’s decision on granting a licence to Starlink to operate in its satellite internet market has been delayed amid data security concerns, geopolitical sensitivities and competition from Chinese firms, local media reported on Sunday.Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk , is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan. However, officials say unresolved security considerations and broader geopolitical factors have slowed the clearance process.According to the Express Tribune, the government has raised concerns that Starlink’s services could allow certain data transmissions to bypass Pakistan’s monitoring, regulatory and safety checks. “We cannot allow a license to Starlink without ensuring a safety check to ensure the safety of the data of consumers in Pakistan,” a senior government official was quoted as saying by Express Tribune.Sources cited by the newspaper said authorities had tested scenarios in which Starlink was expected to pick up sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services. “But the real reason is that the government has tested some cases in which Starlink was supposed to pick up some sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services,” sources said.Officials added that the government is working to address these issues, which have delayed the approval process.The report also cited the fallout between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk as a factor being weighed by the Pakistani establishment. While Trump and Musk had enjoyed a close relationship in the past, they later drifted apart. Officials indicated that Pakistan, which has seen improved ties with the United States since Trump returned to power last year, is cautious about taking steps that could draw scrutiny from Washington.At present, Pakistan maintains control over internet data traffic largely through Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited, which holds a majority stake in the country’s undersea cable infrastructure. Authorities are concerned that similar oversight may not be feasible with satellite-based services, raising fears of potential data breaches or loss of regulatory control.Satellite internet services are expected to focus primarily on remote and underserved regions, including Balochistan, where conventional broadband infrastructure remains limited. Currently, authorities are able to monitor internet traffic and suspend connectivity when required for security reasons. Officials have expressed concern that enforcing similar controls over satellite-based networks could prove more challenging.The Pakistan Space Activities Regulatory Board has confirmed that five companies, including Starlink and China-based Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology Limited, have shown interest in entering the satellite internet market. Chinese firms already have a strong presence in Pakistan’s telecommunications sector and are viewed as direct competitors to US-based companies such as Starlink.While consultations with stakeholders have been completed, the PSARB has yet to finalise the licensing framework. According to officials, additional time is needed to establish safety mechanisms before satellite-based internet services are permitted to begin operations.","Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday.

Amaq claimed over 200 casualties in contrast to the official Pak govt admission of 36 deaths and injuries to scores.The suicide bomber was identified by Amaq as Saifullah Ansari. His photograph taking the bayah (oath of allegiance) was also posted by the IS mouthpiece. The statement also mentioned that hundreds of Pakistani Shias had joined the pro-Iran 'Zaynabiyoun brigade' militia in Syria.The claim by Amaq followed an official denial by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which strongly rebutted any involvement in the incident.The blast, which occurred during prayers at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque in Tarlai area, was the deadliest in Islamabad since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.The explosion coincided with the visit of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to Pakistan. The attack is being seen as a result of growing sectarian tensions in the country.Earlier in Jan, ISKP had claimed responsibility for a blast in Bajaur district that killed a senior Lashkar commander named Najibullah.","Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday.

'Home-Grown Ills': Islamabad Mosque Blast Triggers Blame Game As India Rejects Pakistan's Blame





The Islamic State on Saturday claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad, which killed at least 36 people and injured many others.In a statement released through its Amaq News Agency, the Islamic State in Pakistan, an offshoot of Daesh, said the bomber opened fire at security guards when they tried to stop him at the entrance and then exploded inside among worshippers.The group also said Shiite Muslims in Pakistan were a target, claiming they provided recruits to militias fighting the Islamic State in Syria.The blast took place on Friday at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque-cum-shrine in the Tarlie area of the capital. The attacker, identified as 32-year-old Yasir from Peshawar, entered the mosque while worshippers were offering weekly prayers and detonated explosives.Authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said they arrested four suspects, including three alleged facilitators and the mastermind, during intelligence-based raids in Peshawar and Nowshera.Investigators said an identity card recovered during the probe confirmed the attacker’s identity. Official records showed his permanent address in Abbas Colony on Charsadda Road in Peshawar.Officials also said the attacker had spent around five months in Afghanistan before the bombing, where he allegedly received training in weapons handling and suicide attacks.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif had earlier claimed that India and Afghanistan were involved in the attack, without presenting any evidence.India had strongly rejected the allegations, saying, ""It is unfortunate that, instead of seriously addressing the problems plaguing its social fabric, Pakistan should choose to delude itself by blaming others for its home-grown ills.

Bangladesh’s decades-long “battle of begums” era has ended, and a new power centre has emerged in Dhaka. With Sheikh Hasina in exile and Khaleda Zia no more, the country is witnessing a political shift that would have seemed improbable even two years ago. After decades of dominance by its two most powerful women leaders, Bangladesh has now democratically elevated a man to its top office: BNP scion Tarique Rahman, marking the beginning of a new chapter in the nation’s politics.Tarique Rahman took oath on Tuesday, becoming Bangladesh’s first male Prime Minister in 35 years.Both towering figures of Bangladesh’s political landscape remained absent from this election, with Hasina’s Awami League not even participating in the general polls. For over three decades, the country’s politics revolved around the “battle of begums” -- a rivalry that shaped elections, governance, and Bangladesh’s foreign policy trajectory.Hasina now lives in exile in India after being forced from power by a mass uprising, while Zia’s death following prolonged illness has brought a definitive end to one of South Asia’s most enduring political rivalries.Into this historic vacuum has stepped Tarique Rahman, son of Khaleda Zia and heir to one of Bangladesh’s most influential political dynasties.His return from exile after 17 years, followed by a sweeping electoral victory, has reshaped Bangladesh’s political order, marking the end of the “battle of begums” and the emergence of a new centre of power.Rahman’s ascent is more than a political comeback. It marks a generational shift, the end of a decades-long political order, and the beginning of a new phase in Bangladesh’s leadership under a figure who has moved from exile to elected power.The longstanding rivalry between Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, two leaders whose personal histories were closely intertwined with Bangladesh’s founding and political evolution.Sheikh Hasina, daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s founding father, dominated Bangladesh’s political landscape for much of the past two decades. Her tenure transformed Bangladesh economically and strengthened its global standing. However, in her later years, her leadership drew criticism for being increasingly autocratic, suppressing opposition, weakening democratic institutions, and concentrating power.Her rival, Khaleda Zia, widow of former president Ziaur Rahman and leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), represented the principal alternative political force. She became Bangladesh’s first female prime minister in 1991 and led governments in 1991, 1996, and 2001. Her political strength ensured that Bangladesh remained defined by a bipolar political system.The ""battle of begums"" became the central narrative of Bangladesh’s political life.That era ended abruptly in August 2024.A massive youth-led uprising swept across Bangladesh, driven by frustration over unemployment, economic inequality, and political repression. Tens of thousands of young Bangladeshis poured into the streets, demanding systemic change and accountability. The protests intensified rapidly, spreading from university campuses to cities, highways, and government institutions to ultimately Hasina's official palace in Dhaka.The wave of unrest grew so strong that protesters surrounded and stormed Hasina’s residence, leaving her with no option but to flee the country to avoid the fate her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and his family faced in 1975, when they were killed during a violent uprising.As unrest spiralled, Hasina’s hold on power collapsed. Facing mounting pressure, she fled and took refuge in India, ending her uninterrupted 15-year rule in dramatic fashion.Her departure created an unprecedented political vacuum.Khaleda Zia, once her fiercest rival, was no longer able to step into that space. Years of illness had weakened her physically, even as her symbolic political influence endured. Within days of her son Tarique Rahman’s return to Bangladesh, she died, marking the definitive end of an era defined by her rivalry with Hasina.The “battle of begums,” which had dominated Bangladesh’s political narrative for decades, ended not with an electoral defeat, but with exile and death.Until recently, Tarique Rahman’s political comeback did not seem foreseeable.Once a controversial and polarising political figure, Rahman went into exile in London in 2008 amid corruption charges and political pressure. For nearly two decades, he remained physically absent from Bangladesh’s political stage.Not even two months after returning from his self-imposed exile of 17 long years, Rahman rose rapidly to prominence.London-return Tarique Rahman landed in country with celebration scenes, boarding a bulletproof bus, painted in the red and green, theme colours of Bangladesh national flag. Dhaka crowd erupted to give him a massive welcome. The crowd welcoming Rahman was as massive as the July–August 2024 protests against Hasina, but the atmosphere was entirely different.In his first public address that same day, which was also Christmas, he drew inspiration from American civil rights veteran Martin Luther King, turning the phrase ""I have a dream"" into""Today, the people of Bangladesh want to regain their right to speak. They want to regain their right to democracy,"" he said in first address.He also struck a reassuring and secular tone in a country shaken by communal tensions, outlining BNP’s inclusive vision ahead of the elections. Rahman stressed on the values of unity and also safety for all citizens of the country.His message was clear: he was positioning himself not merely as a dynastic successor, but as a national leader capable of restoring democratic legitimacy and unity.The strategy resonated with voters.The BNP secured a landslide victory, winning nearly two-thirds of parliamentary seats, restoring the party to power and elevating Rahman to the position of prime minister.Rahman was struck by a personal tragedy as Khaleda Zia died after a prolonged illness in December.Her death marked not only the loss of a mother but the passing of one of Bangladesh’s most influential political figures and first lady PM.Rahman inherited not only leadership of the BNP but also a powerful political legacy shaped by struggle, violence, and sacrifice.His father, President Ziaur Rahman, who founded the BNP in 1978, had been assassinated in a military coup in 1981 when Tarique was a teenager.Despite years of exile, political isolation and legal battles, Rahman’s return signified both his resilience and his determination to reclaim political relevance.He dedicated his victory to the people.“Our paths and opinions may differ, but in the interest of the country, we must remain united,” he said in his first speech since the election. “I firmly believe that national unity is a collective strength, while division is a weakness.”The recently held polls in Bangladesh were different in many ways, as for the first time voters were asked to cast ballots twice, once to choose their next Prime Minister and again to give their consent to the “July Charter”, which seeks to overhaul the nation’s governance structure.The referendum was conducted across all 64 districts under tight security and international observation.The referendum count suggested a commanding “Yes” vote, with most constituencies reporting strong backing from both urban and rural regions, as most major parties, even those with minor disagreements over details, campaigned in favour of the Charter.Under the regulations of the July Charter, the powers of new Prime Minister Tarique Rahman will face closer checks to prevent a return to authoritarianism in the country.The power centre in Dhaka was founded on democratic and secular principles in 1971, following Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan after the Mukti Bahini-led liberation struggle. Formerly East Pakistan, the country has, from time to time, suffered under autocratic rule.The July National Charter Implementation Order 2025 is a 28-page political agreement signed by Muhammad Yunus and 25 political parties. Its goal is to transform Bangladesh into what many call the “Second Republic”—a state designed to prevent any future return to authoritarianism.Rahman took charge at a time when Bangladesh was facing one of its most unstable internal security situations in years.December proved to be a turbulent month. Dhaka and several other cities witnessed explosions, widespread unrest, and internet shutdowns.Much of the violence was triggered by an assassination attempt on influential student leader Osman Hadi, who later died from his injuries in Singapore.News of his death sparked anger across the country. Violent attacks followed, with minorities, especially Hindu labourers, businessmen, and community members, among those targeted.However, people from other communities were also caught in the violence.Dipu Chandra Das was one of the victims. The 28-year-old garment factory worker was burnt alive on December 18, the same day Hadi’s death was confirmed. His killing shocked the country and drew widespread attention on social media.As Bangladesh voted for a new government under Tarique Rahman, Das’s family said they cast their vote hoping for justice and safety.Rahman’s inclusive messaging and his promise to protect all communities may help reassure minorities and broaden support for the BNP.Since his return, Rahman has tried to present himself as a calmer and more mature leader, ready to move beyond past political conflicts.The image of an aggressive political operator from the BNP’s 2001–2006 era has largely faded.Although he never held an official government position, Rahman was often accused of influencing decisions behind the scenes during his mother Khaleda Zia’s tenure, an allegation he has denied.“What does revenge bring to someone? People have to flee from this country because of revenge. This does not bring anything good,” he said. “What we need at the moment in the country is peace and stability.”During Sheikh Hasina’s rule, Rahman faced multiple corruption cases and was convicted in absentia. In 2018, he was also sentenced to life imprisonment over a 2004 grenade attack on a rally Hasina was addressing.Rahman denied all allegations, calling them politically motivated. Following Hasina’s ouster, he has since been acquitted in these cases.Since returning, he has adopted a more measured tone, avoiding aggressive rhetoric and calling for unity and reconciliation.He has spoken about restoring “people’s ownership of the state” and rebuilding institutions -- a message that has energised BNP supporters and raised hopes for political change.The elections also marked a significant gain for Jamaat-e-Islami, which won nearly one-third of the parliamentary seats, its strongest performance in decades.Notably, the party did not field a single woman candidate, reflecting its ideological position on women’s role in politics.Jamaat's rise, an organisation that believes in '' for women, signals a shift in Bangladesh’s political landscape, especially after decades dominated by two powerful female leaders, Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia.Two months earlier, Jamaat had surprised observers by forming an alliance with the National Citizen Party (NCP), created in 2025 by leaders of the student uprising.The NCP promised a more inclusive democracy and stronger protection of women’s rights. However, this contrasts with Jamaat’s long-held belief that women’s participation in public life should follow Islamic principles. The election results, meanwhile, suggested that voters gave greater support to Jamaat than to the NCP.This alliance reflects the complex and evolving nature of Bangladesh’s political alliances.After Hasina’s departure, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus assumed charge as caretaker, leading the interim government during the country’s political transition.Yunus became chief adviser of the interim government.He repeatedly said his role was temporary.Throughout his tenure, Yunus maintained that he had “no desire to be part of the next elected government”.His focus, he said, was to ensure a peaceful and fair transition.According to JNU professor Rajan Kumar, Yunus is likely to remain influential even after the new government takes over.“I think he is likely to remain as an advisor because this government would be favourable to him and they'll press no charges against him, whatever happened earlier,” Kumar said.“He fits perfectly into that structure. So he'll remain in some capacity as an advisor — maybe some role of economic adviser, either formal or informal.”Rahman’s rise carries important implications for India-Bangladesh relations.After Sheikh Hasina fled and took refuge in India, ties between the two countries became strained. The interim government under Yunus did little to improve relations.Rahman, however, moved quickly to reach out diplomatically.Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke with Rahman and congratulated him.""Delighted to speak with Mr Tarique Rahman. I congratulated him on the remarkable victory in the Bangladesh elections.""The BNP also thanked India and Prime Minister Modi for recognising the election results and expressed hope for stronger ties.India sent Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri to attend the oath-taking ceremony, signalling its willingness to rebuild relations.Under Sheikh Hasina, India was Bangladesh’s closest regional partner. Rahman’s outreach suggests an effort to restore stability and cooperation between the two neighbours.Tarique Rahman’s rise marks a major turning point in Bangladesh’s political history.For decades, politics was dominated by Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia. Their rivalry shaped the country’s leadership, elections, and direction.That era has now ended.Rahman’s leadership represents both continuity and change — continuity through political legacy, and change through generational transition.He faces major challenges: restoring trust in institutions, maintaining communal harmony, managing rising political forces, and rebuilding foreign relations.Bangladesh now stands at an important moment, entering a new political phase under a leader whose journey reflects the country’s own years of conflict, change, and political transformation.","Bangladesh’s decades-long “battle of begums” era has ended, and a new power centre has emerged in Dhaka. With Sheikh Hasina in exile and Khaleda Zia no more, the country is witnessing a political shift that would have seemed improbable even two years ago.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128466299,imgsize-1530199,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

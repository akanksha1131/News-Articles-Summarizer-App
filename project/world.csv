Trump ropes in Palantir to compile data on Americans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-ropes-in-palantir-to-compile-data-on-americans/articleshow/121702831.cms,"US President Donald Trump





WASHINGTON: In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling for the federal govt to share data across agencies, raising questions over whether he might compile a master list of personal information on Americans that could give him untold surveillance power.Trump has not publicly talked about the effort since. But behind the scenes, officials have quietly put technological building blocks into place to enable his plan.In particular, they have turned to one company: Palantir, the data analysis and technology firm.Representatives of Palantir are also speaking to at least two other agencies - the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service - about buying its technology. The push has put a key Palantir product called Foundry into at least four federal agencies, including DHS and the health and human services department. Widely adopting Foundry, which organizes and analyzes data, paves the way for Trump to easily merge information from different agencies, govt officials said.Creating detailed portraits of Americans based on govt data is not just a pipe dream. The Trump administration has already sought access to hundreds of data points on citizens and others through government databases, including their bank account numbers, the amount of their student debt, their medical claims and any disability status.Trump could potentially use such information to advance his political agenda by policing immigrants and punishing critics, Democratic lawmakers and critics have said. Privacy advocates, student unions and labour rights organizations have filed lawsuits to block data access, questioning whether the govt could weaponize people's personal information.","US President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling for the federal govt to share data across agencies.

'Devil in the Ozarks': Fugitive killer and ex-police chief Grant Hardin recaptured near Arkansas; moved to higher security facility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/devil-in-the-ozarks-fugitive-killer-and-ex-police-chief-grant-hardin-recaptured-near-arkansas-moved-to-higher-security-facility/articleshow/121702803.cms,"Grant Hardin recaptured (Image credits: X @Brooketaylortv)





Grant Hardin, convicted murderer and former police chief known as the “Devil in the Ozarks,” was recaptured Friday in Arkansas nearly two weeks after he escaped from the prison. Hardin has been transferred to the Varner SuperMax prison southeast of Little Rock.He was found just 1.5 miles northwest of the Calico Rock prison he escaped from. When officers approached, he tried to flee but was quickly tackled and taken into custody.Hardin, formerly the police chief of Gateway, Arkansas, disappeared from the North Central Unit, a medium-security prison in Calico Rock, less than 30 minutes before officials realised he was missing. According to the Arkansas department of corrections, he escaped wearing a ""makeshift"" law enforcement uniform.Hardin is currently serving a 30-year sentence for the 2017 murder of city employee James Appleton, along with a separate 50-year sentence for a 1997 rape, which was linked to him through DNA evidence in 2018.Search teams used drones, bloodhounds, and a helicopter during the manhunt. However, heavy rains raised water levels in nearby creeks and streams, making it difficult for both Hardin and the searchers to move through the rugged terrain.Prison system spokesperson Rand Champion said the area around Moccasin Creek was particularly hard to search earlier because of high water. “Search teams had looked through this area before, but the high water previously limited their ability to fully investigate.”Hardin had been imprisoned at Calico Rock since 2017 after pleading guilty to first-degree murder.A tower guard opened a secure gate, unknowingly allowing him to walk out. Authorities are now investigating why his identity wasn’t properly checked.Benton County prosecutor Bryan Sexton, who led the cases against Hardin for murder and rape, said he believed Hardin stayed in the northern Arkansas area. He kept victims and witnesses informed during the search.Now that Hardin has been caught, Sexton said the victims can begin to find closure. Cheryl Tillman, whose brother was shot by Hardin in 2017, called the capture a “big sigh of relief.”Sexton said he was relieved that Hardin is now in a more secure facility. The Varner Unit, opened in 1987, houses over 1,700 inmates, including high-risk and death row prisoners. Its supermax section is reserved for the most dangerous offenders, including those convicted of high-profile crimes.Hardin’s case drew national attention after it was featured in a documentary titled Devil in the Ozarks.","Grant Hardin, convicted murderer and former police chief known as the “Devil in the Ozarks,’ was recaptured Friday in Arkansas.

Ukraine denied Russian allegations on Saturday that it had indefinitely postponed prisoner swaps, accusing Moscow of ""playing dirty games"" after overnight Russian missile and bomb strikes on Kharkiv left three people dead and 22 injured.Separately, Russian officials said a Ukrainian drone attack in the Moscow region wounded two people. At a second round of peace talks in Istanbul on Monday, the two sides agreed to swap more prisoners and return the bodies of 12,000 dead soldiers.However, Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky said on Saturday Kyiv had unexpectedly postponed the exchanges indefinitely. This was denied by Andriy Kovalenko, an official with Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, who said Moscow should stop ""playing dirty games"" and return to constructive work.Overnight, Russian forces used high-precision long-range weapons and drones to attack military targets in Ukraine, hitting all of them, according to Russia's defence ministry.The northeastern city of Kharkiv, one of Ukraine's largest, is just a few dozen kilometres from the Russian border and has been under frequent Russian shelling during more than three years of war triggered by Russia's full-scale invasion.""Kharkiv is currently experiencing the most powerful attack since the start of the full-scale war,"" mayor Ihor Terekhov said in a post on Telegram earlier on Saturday.Residential buildings, educational and infrastructure facilities were attacked, he said, and photos showed buildings burnt and reduced partially to rubble, as rescuers carried the wounded away for treatment.A Ukrainian drone attack deep inside Russian territory last weekend likely damaged around 10% of Russia's strategic bomber fleet and hit some of the aircraft. afp","Russian forces used high-precision long-range weapons and drones to attack military targets in Ukraine, hitting all of them.

Did you never think Epstein was killed, Rogan asks Kash Patel





FBI director Kash Patel came clean about the Epstein Files on a surprise Joe Rogan Experience episode that dropped a day after Elon Musk claimed that President Donald Trump is named in the Epstein Files and that's why they are not releasing it. The timing of the episode caught JRE fans by surprise as it was shot when Elon Musk and Donald trump were nuking each other. Kash Patel was seen smoking and talking in details about FBI and Epstein Files.Steering clear of Elon-Trump drama, Kash Patel said people are pissed at him for the delay in releasing the Epstein files. He said he was not there when Jeffrey Epstein did the abominable act with the protection of a section of media who chose to protect Epstein because of the connections he had.Claiming that Epstein killed himself, Patel asked if anyone thinks that he and Dan Bongino would protect any information regarding the pedophile. Patel said it was the decision of the Donald Trump administration that all files would be released and they will be released ""as much as possible"", Patel said.The FBI director added that he knows that he would not be able to convince anyone that Epstein did kill himself in the prison cell, no matter how many files the FBI releases, because there have been 15 years of people coming in and creating fiction.Joe Rogan asked Kash Patel what he used to think about Epstein's death before he became the FBI director. Patel said he never had a suspicion that Epstein was killed in his cell and said that he had a different background that made him acquainted with jails as a public defender. He said he knew people who committed suicides in cell and based on the information publicly available to him at that time, he always believed that it was not possible for anyone to enter Epstein's cell and kill him.Patel said the FBi would release the video of the cell and everybody would be able to see whether Epstein killed himself or not.When Joe Rogan presented several opinions of doctors who claimed that Epstein's death and his injuries looked more like a murder and not suicide, Kash Patel called it a 'war of experts'. He said this war of experts where there will always be someone to say something in contrary will go on for years, but his current job as the FBI director is to present the public with absolutely everything.","Kash Patel said he was not there when Jeffrey Epstein did the abominable act with the protection of a section of media who chose to protect Epstein.

Thomas Fugate, a 22-year-old with a background in gardening and grocery store work, has been appointed by US President Donald Trump to head the center for prevention programs and partnerships (CP3) at the department of homeland Security (DHS).Just five years ago, Fugate was working as a neighborhood gardener. As recently as August 2023, he held a job at a grocery store. A 2023 graduate of the University of Texas at San Antonio, Fugate has experienced a swift rise through Republican political circles.Fugate’s LinkedIn page shows limited experience in the national security or policy field. In 2020, he listed himself as a self-employed “landscape business owner.” He also worked as a “cross functional team member” at an H-E-B supermarket in Austin, Texas.After completing his degree in politics and law, Fugate joined Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign as an “advance team member.” He has also interned at the conservative Heritage foundation and with Texas state representatives Terry Wilson and Steve Allison.In February, he was reportedly hired as a special assistant in an immigration office at DHS.Following the resignation of the previous CP3 director, Fugate was named as the acting head of the center.“Tom Fugate has performed well in his current role as a confidential assistant in our immigration & border security suboffice,” a DHS official told The Daily Beast.“Due to his success, he has been temporarily given additional leadership responsibilities in the center for prevention programs and partnerships office (CP3). This is a credit to his work ethic and success on the job.”Earlier posts from his X account show a different tone, one of interest in global aid, LEGO, Star Wars, and international development. In past tweets, he encouraged Texas lawmakers to support the international affairs budget and aid for the global poor.Fugate later shifted toward a MAGA-aligned political image, rebranding himself with the “thomas4texas” Instagram handle and announcing his entry into public service. His online profiles reflect a carefully constructed persona, including a LinkedIn photo in front of the DHS seal, hinting at confidence and ambition.His rapid promotion has sparked questions about experience and readiness, but DHS officials have stood by the decision, citing his work ethic and current performance.","Thomas Fugate, a 22-year-old with a background in gardening and grocery store work, has been appointed by US President Donald Trump to head the department of homeland Security.

AQAP: Once al-Qaeda's most dangerous branch



‘Trump Must Bleed’: Al-Qaeda Leader’s Terrifying Message, Issues Death Treat In New Video

Gaza conflict draws in regional militants







The leader of al-Qaeda's Yemen branch has issued threats against US President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, marking his first public appearance since taking control of the group in 2024.In a half-hour video released online early Saturday by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) supporters, Saad bin Atef al-Awlaki called for retaliatory attacks and urged lone-wolf militants to assassinate leaders in Egypt, Jordan, and Gulf Arab nations over their roles in the conflict, which he described as devastating to Palestinians in Gaza.The video featured images of Trump, Musk, US Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, along with logos of Musk's companies, including Tesla.“There are no red lines after what happened and is happening to our people in Gaza,"" al-Awlaki declared. ""Reciprocity is legitimate.”Though weakened in recent years by internal divisions and US drone strikes, AQAP was long considered al-Qaeda's most dangerous branch following the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden . The group has retained influence in Yemen and continues to advocate for global jihad.Al-Awlaki, who has a $6 million US bounty on his head, is accused by Washington of inciting attacks against the US and its allies.He succeeded former leader Khalid al-Batarfi, whose death AQAP confirmed in 2024.AQAP’s threats come as Yemen’s Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, have also drawn global attention for launching missiles at Israel and attacking ships in the Red Sea, prompting a heavy US naval response. The Pentagon has described the ongoing conflict with the Houthis as the most intense combat since World War II.Though the Houthis and AQAP have historically been at odds, the Shiite Houthis and Sunni AQAP fought bitterly in Yemen’s civil war, AQAP’s attacks on Houthi targets have decreased in recent years, while the group continues to strike forces from the Saudi-led coalition.UN estimates suggest AQAP retains a network of 3,000 to 4,000 active fighters and supporters. The group funds its operations through bank robberies, smuggling, counterfeiting, and ransom activities.As the Houthis gain popularity across the Arab world for confronting Israel, experts believe al-Awlaki is using the Gaza war to reclaim AQAP’s relevance.“For a national security and foreign policy community increasingly disengaged from Yemen, this video is a clear reminder: Yemen still matters,” said Mohammed al-Basha of the Basha Report.“As the Houthis gain popularity as leaders of the Arab and Muslim world's 'resistance' against Israel, al-Awlaki seeks to challenge their dominance by presenting himself as equally concerned about the situation in Gaza,” he added.","Saad bin Atef al-Awlaki urges lone-wolf militants to assassinate leaders in Egypt, Jordan, and Gulf Arab nations over their roles in the conflict.

An American Airlines plane carrying passengers from Philadelphia to Naples had to make a sudden mid-air diversion after the pilots understood that the Boeing 787-9 that they were flying was not certified to land at Naples Airport; it was too big for the airport. The incident took place on June 2, and the airlines said the diversion to Rome was due to operational reasons.American Airlines Flight AA780 departed Philadelphia at 7:42 PM and crossed the Atlantic without incident. It was supposed to land in Naples at 10 am local time. But as the aircraft began its descent into Naples (NAP), the crew altered course and redirected the flight to Rome Fiumicino Airport, approximately 124 miles away from the destination. The passengers were bused from Rome to Naples which takes two hours.Historical flight data shows that American Airlines usually sends a Boeing 787-8 on flights to Naples. While these two Dreamliner variants are pretty similar, with the same wingspan, the 787-9 is actually 20 feet longer.Flight 780 had to change course over the Tyrrhenian Sea. The 787-8 is small enough to land at an airport with a Category 8 RFFS, but the 787-9 needs a Category 9 RFFS airport.Aviation enthusiast @xJonNYC, who first shared the incident on X, reported that the airport authority said 787-9 planes can't land in Naples.After landing at Rome Fiumicino Airport around 9:45 a.m., passengers were transported to Naples by bus, the airline spokesperson told Business Insider. ""We apologize to them for this disruption to their journey,"" they added.

Trump vs Musk: President warns Tesla CEO of 'very serious consequences’ if he backs Democrats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-vs-musk-president-warns-tesla-ceo-of-very-serious-consequences-if-he-backs-democrats/articleshow/121698494.cms,"



US President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Elon Musk, threatening ""serious consequences"" if the tech billionaire chooses to support Democratic candidates in retaliation against Republicans who back the GOP's budget bill.Speaking to NBC News in a telephonic interview on Saturday, Trump did not clarify what those consequences might be, but said, “If he does, he’ll have to pay the consequences for that,” adding, “very serious consequences.”The confrontation came after a dramatic rift between the president and Musk, who was once one of Trump’s most prominent financial backers. Musk contributed more than $250 million to Trump’s 2024 campaign efforts and briefly served as head of the department of government efficiency during Trump’s term, where he oversaw extensive cuts across federal departments.But in recent days, the relationship has unravelled in public view. The fallout began with Musk criticising the House-passed “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” on his social platform X, arguing the GOP spending plan was unsustainable and would trigger an economic downturn.Responding to Musk’s criticism on Thursday he said, “I’m very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill. I’m very disappointed in Elon.I’ve helped Elon a lot.”Musk retaliated with a series of posts, many of them now deleted, including one calling for Trump’s impeachment and another reviving long-discussed allegations about Trump’s links to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.“That’s called ‘old news,’” Trump said on Saturday, dismissing the resurfaced claims. “Even Epstein’s lawyer said I had nothing to do with it.”Asked whether he planned to repair his relationship with the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, Trump said curtly, “No,” and confirmed that he believed their relationship was effectively over, “I would assume so, yeah.”Trump added that he had “no intention” of speaking with Musk again. “I’m too busy doing other things,” he said.He also accused Musk of being “disrespectful to the office of the President,” stating, “You could not disrespect the office of the President.”Despite calls from conservative allies like Steve Bannon for federal scrutiny into Musk’s business dealings, Trump said he hadn’t discussed any such action. “It’s not something that’s on top of my mind right now,” he said.However, in a Truth Social post earlier this week, Trump did hint at possible retaliation, writing, “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.”“I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!”Despite the public feud, Trump struck an upbeat note about the GOP's budget bill, expressing confidence it would pass the Senate by July 4. “The Republican Party has never been united like this before,” he said. “Actually, more so than it was three days ago.”","US President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Elon Musk, threatening ""serious consequences"" if the tech billionaire chooses to support Democratic candidates.

Addiction medicine specialist Dr Drew Pinsky broke down Elon Musk's abnormal behavior that prompted an exchange of salvos with President Donald Trump. Appearing on Newsmax to discuss on Elon Musk's Asperger's syndrome that Musk himself admitted in 2021 on Saturday Night Live, Dr Pinsky said there's more than just Asperger's. Dr Pinsky said he respect Elon Musk, read his biography and thinks he is a great guy, a very successful man but there is a flip side of that success that Musk probably has hypomania.Dr Pinsky said he got to know from Musk's biography that Musk had has phases of hypomanic binges where he worked for hours without sleeping. Musk probably suffers from hypomania that many successful people have. Hypomania has the risk of turning into mania which makes one irritable with a lack of risk assessment which means they can't grasp the significance or the repercussion of what they are doing. ""Is he bipolar, I don't know,"" Dr Pinsky said adding to what Donald Trump called as Trump Derangement System.Talking about Elon Musk's outburst over the Big, Beautiful Bill, Trump said Elon Musk is probably missing the White House and getting affected Trump Derangement Syndrome, something that he came up with to describe the condition of his detractors. But it was not just a hilarious comment, the Newsmax panel commented adding that not being able to accept change is associated with Asperger's syndrome.Elon Musk raged on his social media platform X calling Donald Trump ungrateful, liar and then made the massive allegation that Trump was named in Epstein Files and that's why the administration was not releasing it. According to reports, this took the fight beyond any repair and Donald Trump rejected to even talk about Elon Musk. A day later, Musk deleted that particular post.Musk spoke extensively about his Asperger's and said he grew up with it. The social cues were not intuitive to him and he used to take things very literally, he said on one occasion.

"Musk-Miller feud: Katie Miller used to give instructions on Elon's behalf, White House sent a mail to bar her",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musk-miller-feud-katie-miller-used-to-give-instructions-on-elons-behalf-white-house-sent-a-mail-to-bar-her/articleshow/121696179.cms,"Katie Miller and Stephen Miller are once again working for two sparring bosses. Earlier, it was Mike Pence and Donald Trump.

Musk vs Millers: Here are the inside details



A Wall Street Journal report claimed that Karie Miller overreached her role and started giving instructions on Elon's behalf. Special government employees like Katie Miller did not have any walk-in privileges in the West Wing unless they were working with the president, like Elon Musk. But Karie Miller was always flouting the rule -- walking in and out of offices as she worked in the first Trump administration as well. An email was sent pout to the staff reminding them that they can't walk into any office they want. The target was Katie Miller, and the mail was sent out from her husband's department. As Elon Musk-Trump's public slamming took an ugly turn, the Millers maintained silence but the WSJ report said that Katie Miller privately asked others to speak on her behalf. And the statement is that the Millers were ""trying to cool the temperaute between Musk and Trump"" Friday. Katie Miller is known to be a strong taskmaster who doesn't think twice to blur ethical lines. People who worked with her told Journal that she used to exhaust people, and so they gave her what she wanted. And many people do not like that kind of intensity. One of her former colleagues told Journal that Katie Miller is a person who could tell from her memory the status of every project better than those who are running the projects. This is not the first time that Millers are torn between two bosses. Katie Miller continued working for Mike Pence and Stephen with Donald Trump when they had a split. But this time, the rumors were that Katie Miller was leaving Stephen Miller for Elon Musk. White House was not happy with Katie Miller's role in DOGE, the WSJ report said as they feel that she did not do enough to persuade Musk to work with the agencies and the White House. While working as DOGE spokesperson, Katie continues working P2 Public Affairs, a Republican consulting firm and secured many clients meetings at the White House. After this got repored, she left P2.





Before Elon Musk and Donald Trump publicly fought and reached a point of no return, there was another 'breakup' that took place between Musk and the Millers -- Stephen Miller and Katie Miller. Stephen Miller is the deputy chief of staff in the White House where Katie Miller used to work as Elon Musk's spokesperson. But when Elon Musk stepped down from DOGE, Katie Miller chose to work full-time with Elon Musk. The disagreement between Donald Trump and Elon Musk was not a secret when Elon Musk walked out of the White House, but after their public fallout, the Millers are the most affected individuals. Elon Musk unfollowed Stephen Miller while Katie Miller is not issuing any public statements.","Katie Miller is known to be a strong taskmaster who doesn't think twice to blur ethical lines.

US lawmaker under fire for protesting Sikh prayer in Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-lawmaker-under-fire-for-protesting-sikh-prayer-in-congress/articleshow/121695895.cms,"File Photo: Republican lawmaker Mary Miller (Picture credit: X/@RepMaryMiller)

The TOI correspondent from Washington:





A racist Republican lawmaker known for making inflammatory statements is under fire after misidentifying a Sikh religious leader as Muslim and declaring he should never have been allowed to deliver the morning prayer in Congress in a country she falsely claimed was ""founded as a Christian nation. ""“It’s deeply troubling that a Muslim was allowed to lead prayer in the House of Representatives this morning. This should never have been allowed to happen. America was founded as a Christian nation, and I believe our government should reflect that truth, not drift further…” Illinois lawmaker Mary Miller said in a now-deleted post, after she had corrected the religious identity.The remark embarrassed the Republican Party beyond its racist MAGA base, particularly since it was a GOP Congressman who had invited New Jersey granthi Giani Singh to deliver the prayer.""I was proud to invite a Sikh chaplain to open the House with prayer this morning. The Sikh community is peaceful, generous, and deeply rooted in family and service, values we should all appreciate, no matter our religion,"" New Jersey Congressman Jeff van Drew said, adding, ""as a Catholic, I take my faith seriously and I also believe part of being American is respecting other people's faiths too.""Miller was also castigated by the Democratic Party, which is more representative of America's changing demographics.“It’s deeply troubling that such an ignorant and hateful extremist is serving in the United States Congress,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on X. “That would be you, Mary.”Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and public intellectuals also called out Miller for falsely claiming the US was founded as a Christian nation, a more recent fiction promoted by racist MAGA hardliners. The US was not founded as an explicitly Christian nation, and the First Amendment to the Constitution protects freedom of religion.In fact, the first Sikhs came to America around 1900, long before the forebears of many MAGA extremists. Early Sikhs settled down on the Pacific coast, and many of their descendants are now prosperous and politically influential farmers and business owners in California, a fact recognised by local lawmakers.“I’m troubled by my colleague’s remarks about this morning’s Sikh prayer, which have since been deleted,” California Congressman David Valadao, a Republican, wrote on X. “Throughout the country—and in the Central Valley— Sikh-Americans are valued and respected members of our communities, yet they continue to face harassment and discrimination.There are more than 500,000 Sikhs in the US, according to Sikh Advocacy groups, although the 2020 US census reported only 70,697 respondents identifying as Sikh. Many of them are in California's Central Valley, where some towns have had Sikh mayors and Punjabi is commonly spoken.The GOP also has at least two prominent Sikhs in leadership positions: Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley and former Trump campaign legal advisor and US assistant attorney general for the civil rights division Harmeet Dhillon.Dhillon in fact delivered the closing invocation (antim ardas) at the Republican National Convention last year, triggering a backlash from MAGA fundamentalists, one of whom posted this on X: ""ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE!! I have nothing but respect for Harmeet Dhillon but fire whoever invited her to pray to a foreign god, there is only one true God we pray to and his name is not whatever she said. His name is YAHWEH and his only begotten Son is Jesus Christ. ""","Illinois lawmaker Mary Miller misidentified a Sikh religious leader as Muslim.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif has urged the US to broker a ""comprehensive dialogue"" between India and Pakistan. Addressing an event at the US embassy in Islamabad on Wednesday, Sharif lauded US President Donald Trump for what he said was his role in defusing a four-day military clash last month that was triggered by the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 lives. India has rejected all claims of a US role in bringing about a cessation of hostilities.Sharif's praise for Trump as a leader ""against escalation and war"" was mirrored by Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in Washington. Bilawal credited Trump's diplomacy for the ceasefire and suggested that US mediation could facilitate broader talks. ""If America can help sustain this ceasefire, its role in arranging a comprehensive dialogue would benefit both nations,"" he said. This appeal to Trump's deal-making persona has sparked suspicion in India, where analysts see it as Pakistan's attempt to shift focus from its alleged role in cross-border terrorism and regain diplomatic leverage.Sharif's call for dialogue signals willingness to engage but raises questions about Pakistan's commitment to India's concerns, especially after dismissing the Simla Agreement and seeking US involvement.","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif has urged the US to broker a ""comprehensive dialogue"" between India and Pakistan.

More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since April as Islamabad ramped up its deportation campaign targeting undocumented migrants, with Iran also increasing expulsions, raising concerns over Afghanistan’s capacity to manage the influx.According to Pakistan’s ministry of interior, over 135,000 Afghans left the country in April, followed by 67,000 in May, and more than 3,000 in just the first two days of June. The repatriation drive, which began in November 2023, has now seen over one million Afghans return from Pakistan, reported news agency ANI, citing ARY News.The deportation campaign is aimed at more than 800,000 Afghans whose residency documents have been revoked. Among them are individuals born or raised in Pakistan. Islamabad has accused Afghan nationals of links to terrorism and blamed Kabul for harbouring militants, a charge the Taliban authorities have repeatedly denied.Farmer Mohammad Wali, who crossed into Afghanistan via the southern Spin Boldak border, was quoted by AFP as saying, “We left behind our orchards... but we said to ourselves, ‘If we stay, maybe one day we’ll lose our dignity.’”With Eid al-Adha approaching, the pace of returns has slightly slowed, though crossings continue daily.Iran, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with similar measures. The UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) recorded 15,675 Afghan deportations from Iran in May, more than double the figure in April.The IOM expressed alarm at the increasing number of families, rather than single men, being sent back, calling this “a new and concerning trend.”In late May, Iranian authorities ordered undocumented Afghans to leave by July 6—a move that could impact as many as four million people, according to AFP. Already, more than 450,000 Afghans have returned from Iran since January.Both nations host millions of Afghan refugees who fled decades of conflict.But as economic conditions worsen and political tensions rise, public support for Afghan migrants has diminished. Pakistan, which still hosts around three million Afghans, has also warned it may revoke the UNHCR-issued refugee cards of 1.3 million cardholders by the end of June.The IOM has repeatedly urged countries to “immediately suspend the forced return of Afghans... until safe, voluntary, and dignified return conditions are in place.”The Taliban authorities, who remain internationally unrecognised, have echoed the call, asking for returns to occur in a “dignified” manner.Analysts view the deportation moves, particularly by Pakistan, as politically driven. Islamabad is under pressure to address domestic security threats, especially in border regions plagued by insurgencies.However, rights groups and humanitarian agencies warn that Afghanistan’s already fragile infrastructure is ill-equipped to absorb such a massive and sudden return of people.","More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since April as Islamabad ramped up its deportation campaign targeting undocumented migrants.

Baloch human rights group Paank strongly condemned the killing of two Baloch men whose bodies were found in Kalat, calling it another disturbing sign of growing violence and repression in the region.Samiullah, son of Muhammad Hanif, and Bismillah, son of Ghulam Sarwar, both residents of Padang Abad in Mastung district, were found dead on 3 June in the Ganda Gain neighbourhood of Sheikhri, Kalat. According to Levies officials, both men had been brutally shot, their bodies discarded and later transported to RHC Mangochar for formalities.Paank, in a post on X said, “Forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces on May 29, 2025, their executions are a glaring testament to the ongoing horrors of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings in Balochistan, a despicable violation of humanity that must be stopped.”The rights organisation said 2025 has already seen a surge in such cases. In February alone, Paank documented five extrajudicial executions and 33 enforced disappearances. Among the victims were Bashir Ahmad Marri and Arman Marri, who were reportedly executed in a staged encounter after being abducted in 2023.The group also referred to the tragic case of Rehana, who was shot dead in Awaran while trying to prevent her husband’s kidnapping.In April, Mehrab and Khan Mohammad were tortured to death in Kech after disappearing earlier in the month, while the tortured body of Sher Khan Nazar was discovered in Turbat two days after he went missing.Most recently, Zabid Ali, a resident of Chaghi, was abducted from his home on 11 May.In a separate post on X, Paank demanded the safety and recovery of three members of the family who “were forcibly disappeared in Pidarak area in Kech district.”On June 3, 2025, Pakistani security forces allegedly carried out a series of enforced disappearances in the Pidarak area of Kech district, Balochistan. Among those abducted from their homes were Sinkandar Baloch, son of Muhammad Anwar; Siddique Sabzal, son of Sabzal Baloch; and Ibrahim Yaqoob, son of Yaqoob Baloch. All three men were reportedly detained without any legal process, and their whereabouts remain unknown.Enforced disappearances remain one of Balochistan’s most alarming human rights crises. International watchdogs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have repeatedly urged the Pakistani state to investigate these abuses and take meaningful steps to end the practice, which leaves families traumatised and communities in fear.","Samiullah and Bismillah were found dead on 3 June in the Ganda Gain neighbourhood of Sheikhri, Kalat.

'Vindictive nature': Imran Khan levels fiery charge at Asim Munir; alleges army chief targeted his wife,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/vindictive-nature-imran-khan-levels-fiery-charge-at-asim-munir-alleges-army-chief-targeted-his-wife/articleshow/121616395.cms,"Pakistan On Knees, Pleads India To Withdraw This Decision; ‘Reconsider Blocking…’ | Watch





NEW DELHI: Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has accused army chief general Asim Munir of waging a personal vendetta against his wife, Bushra Bibi.In a social media post on Monday, Khan claimed the alleged animosity dates back to his decision to remove Munir from his position as Director General of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) during Khan's tenure.In a social media post on Monday, Khan claimed that following Munir's dismissal, the general attempted to contact Bushra Bibi through intermediaries, but she refused, stating she ""had no involvement with such affairs."" Khan attributed his wife's 14-month imprisonment and alleged mistreatment to ""General Asim Munir's vindictive nature.""Khan further asserted that Bushra Bibi, a private citizen with no political role, has been falsely accused and arrested repeatedly without evidence. “The way my wife has been targeted for personal vengeance is unprecedented. Even during Pakistan’s darkest periods of dictatorship, such a thing never happened,” he said, noting he had not been allowed to meet her in four weeks, despite a scheduled June 1 meeting.Turning his criticism toward the military-backed government and judiciary, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief accused authorities of suppressing democratic dissent and rigging the political system.He blamed the events of May 9, 2023—when military installations were attacked—on a so-called “London Plan” aimed at dismantling PTI. “Our democratic mandate was brazenly stolen, and corrupt individuals — Sharifs and Zardaris — were imposed upon the nation,” he said.Khan alleged that anti-terrorism courts and judges are complicit in the crackdown on his party and deliberately ignoring key evidence. “Despite repeated demands, they refuse to summon or examine the stolen CCTV footage from May 9, 2023… We are innocent. Our people are being sentenced without evidence and without the right to a fair trial.”Calling for a judicial commission, Khan demanded investigations into the deaths of unarmed pro-democracy protesters on May 9 and November 26, 2024. He also lashed out at the judiciary, comparing current Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa to the widely criticised Justice Munir, saying the institution is “driven not by justice but by a desire to protect their own jobs and privileges.”Khan’s remarks come days after a court sentenced 11 PTI supporters, including a lawmaker, for violence and vandalism on May 9 last year—an incident triggered by his arrest.The 72-year-old PTI founder has been in Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi since mid-2023, facing multiple legal cases.","Imran Khan has accused army chief general Asim Munir of waging a personal vendetta against his wife, Bushra Bibi.

How the jailbreak unfolded





A routine safety measure after earthquake tremors turned into a major security breach in Karachi, as over 100 inmates escaped from prison on Tuesday.Officials said the prisoners had been evacuated from their cells as a precaution following a series of mild earthquakes in the area, but chaos erupted when a group of inmates attacked guards, seized their weapons, and managed to flee.According to senior police official Kashif Abbasi, 216 inmates escaped from Malir prison before dawn. He confirmed that 78 of them had already been caught.Police teams were carrying out raids to find the rest. “No one convicted or facing trial as a militant is among those who fled,” Abbasi said.The escape led to a shootout in which one inmate was killed and three security personnel were injured. “The situation has been brought under control,” Abbasi added.Sindh’s home minister, Ziaul Hassan, explained how the jailbreak unfolded. The inmates had been moved out of their cells due to tremors. While they were still outside, some prisoners attacked the guards and fled the premises after opening fire.Prison Superintendent Arshad Shah said the escapees headed towards nearby residential areas. Residents reported that police later used mosque loudspeakers to warn them about the escaped inmates and requested help in identifying and reporting them.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah made a televised appeal, urging the escapees to turn themselves in. “They had only been involved in minor crimes until that point,” he said. “But they could face terror charges if they are arrested by police on the jailbreak charge.”Although prison escapes have happened during court transfers in Pakistan, such mass breakouts from within prison walls remain rare.Karachi has experienced multiple earthquakes in the past 24 hours, with magnitudes ranging from 2.6 to 3.4, according to the National Seismic Monitoring Center.", 216 inmates escaped from Malir prison in Karachi on Tuesday morning.

Tapping out: Kabul may be first modern city to run out of water; report warns of 'unprecedented humanitarian disaster',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/tapping-out-kabul-may-be-first-modern-city-to-run-out-of-water-report-warns-of-unprecedented-humanitarian-disaster/articleshow/121693383.cms,"Representative image

'Kabul’s Water Crisis: An Inflection Point for Action',

Pakistan On Knees, Pleads India To Withdraw This Decision; ‘Reconsider Blocking…’ | Watch





Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, could become the first modern city to completely run out of water, warns a recent report. The report titledreleased recently by the NGO Mercy Corps, outlines in detail the city’s worsening water emergency and urges immediate international and domestic attention.The report says that Kabul’s groundwater extraction exceeds natural recharge by 44 million cubic meters each year, with the water table having dropped between 25 to 30 meters over the past decade. According to projections by Unicef, cited in the report, the city’s aquifers could run dry by 2030, potentially displacing up to 3 million people. The situation is already critical—nearly half of the boreholes, Kabul residents’ primary source of drinking water, are dry.An aquifer is an underground layer of rock, sand, or soil that holds water. It acts like a natural water tank. People access this water through wells, but if too much is taken out and not enough refills it (like from rain or snow), the aquifer can run dry.The report says, ""Kabul’s water crisis represents a failure of governance, humanitarian coordination, water regulation, and infrastructure planning... Without immediate intervention, the city risks becoming the first modern capital in the world to fully deplete its water reserves.""Kabul’s water largely comes from three main aquifers, recharged by snowmelt from the Hindu Kush mountains. However, due to climate change and recurring droughts, snow and rain have significantly declined. From October 2023 to January 2024, Afghanistan received only 45–60% of its normal winter precipitation. According to the report, ""Afghanistan is the sixth most vulnerable country in the world to impacts of climate change,"" and Kabul is already seeing the effects, with reduced snowfall and shorter winters reducing the volume of meltwater.""Shorter winters also mean less time for snow to accumulate on the Hindu Kush, and thus less meltwater runoff in the spring, even as the city’s demand for water rapidly increases,"" the report says.On the infrastructure side, only 20% of households in Kabul are connected to centralised piped water systems. Most residents rely on water pumped from borewells, many of which are unregulated or drying up. ""90% of Kabul’s residents rely on water pumped from borewells to supply their daily needs,"" the report says.The report also highlights water quality issues. ""As much as 80% of Kabul’s groundwater is contaminated with sewage, toxins, and dangerously high levels of chemicals such as arsenic and nitrates,"" posing major health risks. In interviews conducted for the report, 70% of residents said their well water had issues such as bad taste, odor, or discoloration.Economically, the crisis has forced families to spend 15–30% of their monthly income on water. In some cases, private water companies extract water and sell it back to residents at high prices. ""Weekly water costs for a single household reach 400–500 Afghanis ($6–7), exceeding food expenses for more than half of households,"" the report notes. ""To meet this financial burden, families are forced to borrow more, placing them deeper into debt. 68% of households incur water-related debt, with informal lenders charging 15–20% monthly interest.""The city’s main water sources like the Qargha Reservoir and Shah-wa-Arous Dam are either underperforming or newly operational. Long-planned projects such as the Panjshir River Pipeline and Shah Toot Dam remain delayed due to funding and political issues.Governance challenges are also severe. The National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), responsible for water quality monitoring, has lost about 40% of its technical staff, ""largely due to technical staff fleeing the country."" Due to a lack of international recognition and funding cuts, like from USAID, the agency cannot conduct full water testing and lacks access to basic equipment.The report warns that unless urgent changes are made—including better governance, water infrastructure investment, and international cooperation—Kabul could face a humanitarian crisis. ""Without large-scale changes to Kabul’s water management dynamics, the city faces an unprecedented humanitarian disaster within the coming decade, and likely much sooner,"" it concludes.","Kabul's groundwater extraction exceeds natural recharge by 44 million cubic meters each year. The water table has dropped between 25 to 30 meters over the past decade. According to projections by Unicef, the city's aquifers could run dry by 2030, potentially displacing up to 3 million people.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121694249,imgsize-1385292,width-400,resizemode-4/121694249.jpg"

Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) criticised chief adviser Muhammad Yunus ’s announcement of holding national elections next year in April, saying that people are “disappointed” by the delay.In a statement issued on Saturday, BNP said “People’s victory was achieved through the immense sacrifices made by students and the masses during the July uprising.”“But the unwarranted delay in arranging the election has disappointed and angered the people,” Dhaka Tribune quoted the statement.BNP’s national standing committee, led by acting chairman Tarique Rahman, held an emergency virtual meeting in response to Yunus’s address. The committee reiterated its long-standing demand that elections be held no later than December this year, citing upcoming Ramadan, major school examinations, and potential weather disruptions as key considerations.“The people of this country, deprived of their basic voting rights for almost a decade and a half, have continued their struggle to restore democracy through voting, despite being disappeared, murdered, imprisoned, injured, and tortured,” the party said.The BNP argued that holding elections during Ramadan in April could create logistical and political complications that might be used as an excuse for further delays. The party also criticised Yunus for failing to clearly explain why December was an unviable option.Moreover, the statement accused the chief adviser of straying beyond his interim mandate of overseeing justice, reform, and elections. “The meeting expressed anger at his choice of words in the speech, which crossed the limits of political decorum,” BNP said.Yunus assumed the role of chief adviser after the fall of Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League government in August 2024. He had vowed to deliver “a clean, peaceful, festive, and inclusive election,” but his announcement appears to have intensified tensions with the BNP and other opposition forces.While the BNP, under the leadership of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, has demanded immediate polls, some student and right-wing groups have supported the delay, insisting that elections should follow meaningful reforms and justice processes.",Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) criticised chief adviser Muhammad Yunus ’s announcement of holding national elections next year in April.

Here's how the escape took place:





In a meticulously orchestrated operation, former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina departed Dhaka on August 5, 2024, under a veil of secrecy, amid escalating political unrest. She landed at Hindon Airport in India.Hasina's aircraft remained the most tracked plane that day. As per real-time data from the flightradar24 website, Bangladesh Air Force aircraft AJAX1431 become the most tracked plane globally, with over 29,000 people following its route at one point of time.The Bangladesh Air Force's Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft, designated AJAX1431, took off from Bangabandhu Airbase at 3.09pm, officially listed as a training flight. To obscure its trajectory, the aircraft's transponders and automatic geolocator systems were deactivated until it neared Indian airspace over West Bengal, The Daily Star reported citing sources.Upon approaching Indian airspace, AJAX1431 reactivated its transponders at waypoint ""BEMAK"" and altered its course from Kolkata to Hindon Air Force Base in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh.This clandestine departure occurred just 30 minutes before protesters seized the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's official residence.Army Chief General Waker-uz-Zaman, unaware of Hasina's departure, was preparing to announce her resignation. In a later interview, he acknowledged the volatile situation and the potential risks to Hasina's life had she remained in the country.""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said.","Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, 2024, amid escalating political unrest. She landed at Hindon Airport in India.

Fugitive liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya has told a podcast, in a rare interview, that he told the late former finance minister Arun Jaitley that he was about to fly out of India to London before he left for the airport in March 2016.At the time there was supposed to be a CBI lookout circular (LOC) issued against him.Mallya told “Figuring Out with Raj Shamani” he was not aware of any LOC against him, nor that it had been downgraded by the CBI from detaining him to informing immigration of authorities of his travel plans.He told Shamani that certain TV anchors and the Indian govt want to see him in “jail clothes, eating jail food” in Tihar and spending the rest of his life behind bars. “If that is what is inevitable, what options do I have? It might be inevitable, I’m not an astrologer. I will fight my way in court.”He said: “I told FM Arun Jaitley before leaving for the airport and then I flew from Delhi to London on the way to Geneva for a meeting which was fixed months ago. I told the then finance minister because I went from Parliament to Delhi airport. When this news hit the media, once again, it created a storm.People went running to Mr Jaitley. He denied meeting me. A Congress MP saw us and then said to the media ‘No, I saw them together’. Mr Jaitley had to retract his statement and say ‘Yes, yes I met him but only while walking — it was a fleeting meeting’.”“I never said I went to Mr Jaitley’s office, sat in front of him, had tea with him. All I said is I told the finance minister while leaving, I’m going to London and going to Geneva for a meeting, please tell the banks to sit across the table and settle with me. How long does this once sentencetake? You see the way he denied it, and then when a Congress MP pointed out his mistake that he saw us, he quickly changed.”He also said he had always planned to go back to India but his Indian passport was revoked.In the four-hour podcast Mallya also said he would be prepared to return to India. “If I have the assurance of a fair trial and assurance of dignified existence in India, I will think about returning to India seriously. “ He then reminded Shamani of the judgment in the Sanjay Bhandari case which found “Indian detention conditions a violation of Article 3 of the ECHR (European Convention on Human Rights)”, which may mean he could not be extradited now.When asked why he had not gone already as he had lost his extradition battle in the courts, the 69-year-old said: “My stay in England is fully legitimate. There is more than the particular case you are referring to. There are ongoing proceedings in this country. It’s one of the legal battles I am fighting,” he said. This suggests he may have applied for asylum.","Vijay Mallya says he told the late former finance minister Arun Jaitley that he was about to fly out of India to London before he left for the airport in March 2016.

LONDON: New homes built in Britain will have rooftop solar panels ""by default"", reducing energy bills and helping to meet carbon-reduction targets, the Labour government announced Friday.Prime Minister Keir Starmer's party wants 1.5 million new homes built by 2029 amid a housing shortage, a figure many experts believe is optimistic.Energy secretary Ed Miliband said proposals announced Friday mark ""a monumental step in unleashing this rooftop revolution"".The government said: ""New homes will also have low-carbon heating, such as heat pumps and high levels of energy efficiency, cutting people's energy bills and boosting the nation's energy security with clean, homegrown power.""It added in a statement that ""a typical existing UK home could save around £530 ($717) a year from installing rooftop solar.""""The proposed Future Homes Standard would see building regulations amended to explicitly promote solar for the first time, subject to practical limits with flexibility in place for new homes surrounded by trees or with lots of shade overhead,"" the government said.Environment campaign group Greenpeace welcomed the policy, while urging the government to go further.""This is a great example of how climate solutions can not only cut planet-heating emissions but also improve people's lives,"" its head of politics, Ami McCarthy, said in a statement.""Now ministers need to urgently reform the UK's energy system as a whole and stop gas from setting the price of electricity so that everyone, whether living in a new build or not, gets to enjoy the lower bills that cheap, clean renewable power can bring.""Britain has set its sights on delivering a net zero carbon economy by 2050.","New homes built in Britain will have rooftop solar panels ""by default,"" government says.

LONDON: Market regulators from six countries are cracking down on the illegal promotion of financial products by influencers on social media, UK officials said Friday.Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the action, which began on Monday, has resulted in three arrests in the UK and the authorisation of criminal proceedings against three individuals.The crackdown is being conducted jointly with regulators from Italy, Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, and the United Arab Emirates.Some 50 ""warning letters"" have been issued, which will result in more than 650 requests to remove content from social media platforms and more than 50 websites ""operated by unauthorised finfluencers"", the FCA said.It has also sent seven ""cease and desist"" letters and invited four so-called finfluencers for interviews.So-called finfluencers, or financial influencers, use their social media audiences to promote investment products, share advice, or offer their opinions on investments.Many act legitimately, but some ""tout products or services illegally and without authorisation through online videos and posts, where they use the pretence of a lavish lifestyle, often falsely, to promote success"", according to the FCA.These products can be risky, such as cryptocurrencies.""Our message to finfluencers is loud and clear,"" said Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA.""They must act responsibly and only promote financial products where they are authorised to do so -- or face the consequences.""The announcement came as a group of British MPs said it had sent a letter to Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, asking for information on its approach to financial influencers.The letter from parliament's Treasury Committee follows evidence from FCA officials that Meta took up to six weeks to remove harmful content, longer than other platforms.""There was an isolated incident in late 2024 which resulted in a delay in actioning a small number of reports from the FCA,"" Meta said in a statement Friday.""This was rectified and all other relevant reports made by the FCA have been promptly processed.""","Regulators from six countries are cracking down on the illegal promotion of financial products by influencers on social media.

The relationship between King Charles and Prince Harry has reportedly deteriorated beyond repair, leaving little hope for a royal reconciliation.The 76-year-old monarch has maintained a reserved stance whilst being physically separated by 5,459 miles from his younger son, following Harry and Meghan Markle 's withdrawal from royal duties in 2020.The father-son relationship has deteriorated to such an extent that palace sources believe reconciliation is now improbable between the royal family members, according to the New York Post.""There is no turning back,"" royal expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News. ""King Charles remains tender towards his son but can't risk communication. Prince William now has absolutely no interest in mending fences.""According to Fordwich, the king's confidants advise against reconciliation with his son as it could potentially impact Prince William's future sovereignty. ""The animosity is so deep that William has shut the door on Harry. Charles is not willing to go against his heir's wishes,"" she added.The fundamental issue remains one of trust between the parties. A palace source informed The NY Post about the king's distrust of Harry, specifically referencing the Duke of Sussex's revealing BBC interview, which reportedly destroyed their remaining trust.Recent reports suggest the king, who is battling cancer, remains reluctant to repair relations with the 40-year-old son.""The king and William don't trust Harry and Meghan with any kind of confidential conversation,"" royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith told People, adding that ""the underlying issue is trust.""NY Post sources also indicate Prince William, Harry's estranged brother and heir to the throne, shows no inclination towards reconciliation. Meanwhile, the palace sources further claim that Camilla is attempting to remain uninvolved in the situation.A royal commentator recently suggested that the duke's only chance at family reconciliation would require maintaining a ""dignified silence"".This report comes just days after revelations that during delays in obtaining UK passports for their children Archie and Lilibet, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle considered adopting the Spencer surname, being Harry's mother's Diana's maiden name.The Duke of Sussex initiated discussions with his uncle Earl Spencer regarding a potential family surname modification, an action that potentially strained relations further with the royal establishment.The family currently utilises Sussex as their surname, and reports indicate they submitted UK passport applications for Archie and Lilibet, aged six and four respectively, using Sussex alongside HRH (His/Her Royal Highness) titles.According to sources speaking to The Guardian, prolonged delays in passport approval led Harry and Meghan to suspect resistance towards their children's HRH titles, prompting the duke to seek counsel from his uncle.Contrasting accounts have emerged regarding Earl Spencer's stance. Whilst the Mail on Sunday suggested Princess Diana's brother cautioned against the change, citing significant legal obstacles, sources close to Harry and Meghan refute this. The Guardian's reporting indicates Earl Spencer displayed enthusiasm and support for the proposed surname modification.","King Charles and Prince Harry's relationship has reportedly deteriorated beyond repair.

"Death sentence in 1976: Mississippi executes longest-serving death row inmate, Richard Jordan after 49 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/death-sentence-in-1976-mississippi-executes-longest-serving-death-row-inmate-richard-jordan-after-49-years/articleshow/122082222.cms,"Death sentence in 1976: Mississippi executes longest-serving death row inmate, Richard Jordan, after 49 years





Richard Gerald Jordan, the longest-serving prisoner on Mississippi’s death row, nearly 49 years after he kidnapped and killed Edwina Marter in a failed ransom plot was executed by lethal injection on Wednesday.Jordan,a 79-year-old Vietnam veteran, received the injection at 6 pm in the Mississippi State Penitentiary, Parchman. Prison officials pronounced him dead at 6.16 pm.Before the drugs were administered, Jordan apologised to the victim’s family, thanked prison staff for “a humane way of doing this,” and addressed his wife, lawyer and spiritual adviser, saying, “I will see you on the other side, all of you.” His wife Marsha Jordan and lawyer Krissy Nobile wiped away tears as they witnessed the procedure.Family members of Edwina Marter did not attend. Instead, spokesman Keith Degruy read a statement on their behalf, saying the execution could not restore what was lost: “Nothing can ever change what Jordan took from us 49 years ago.”Court records show that in January 1976 Jordan telephoned Gulf National Bank in Gulfport, obtained loan officer Charles Marter’s home address from a directory, and kidnapped Marter’s wife Edwina.He shot her in a forest before calling her husband to demand US$25,000, falsely claiming she was alive.Jordan’s execution followed decades of legal challenges spanning four trials and numerous appeals. He was one of several inmates who had sued Mississippi over its three-drug execution protocol, calling it inhumane. On Monday, the US Supreme Court rejected his final appeal without comment.Defence lawyers argued Jordan suffered severe post-traumatic stress disorder from three consecutive Vietnam tours, but Governor Tate Reeves denied a clemency request that cited his wartime trauma.The execution was Mississippi’s third in the past decade and the first since December 2022. It came a day after another prisoner was put to death in Florida, contributing to what observers say could be the highest annual US execution count since 2015.","Richard Gerald Jordan, 79, was executed by lethal injection on Wednesday.

Trump gets 'golden share' power in US Steel buyout. US agencies will get it under future presidents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-gets-golden-share-power-in-us-steel-buyout-us-agencies-will-get-it-under-future-presidents/articleshow/122081804.cms,"



HARRISBURG: President Donald Trump will control the so called ""golden share"" that's part of the national security agreement under which he allowed Japan based Nippon steel to buy out iconic American steelmaker US Steel, according to disclosures with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.The provision gives the president the power to appoint a board member and have a say in company decisions that affect domestic steel production and competition with overseas producers.Under the provision, Trump, or someone he designates controls that decision making power while he is president. However, control over those powers reverts to the treasury department and the commerce department when anyone else is president, according to the filings.The White House responded in a statement that the share is ""not granted to Trump specifically, but to whoever the president is"" when asked why Trump will directly control the decision making and why it goes to the treasury and commerce departments under future presidents.Still, the wording of the provision is specific to Trump.It lists what decisions cannot be made ""without, ... at any time when Donald J. Trump is serving as President of the United States of America, the written consent of Donald J.Trump or President Trump's Designee"" or ""at any other time, the written consent of the CMAs"", a contractual term for the treasury and commerce departments.Nippon steel's nearly USD 15 billion buyout of Pittsburgh-based US Steel became final last week, making US Steel a wholly owned subsidiary.Trump has sought to characterise the acquisition as a ""partnership"" between the two companies after he at first vowed to block the deal - as former president Joe Biden did on his way out of the White House, before changing his mind after he became president.The national security agreement became effective June 13 and is between Nippon Steel, as well as its American subsidiary, and the federal government, represented by the departments of Commerce and Treasury, according to the disclosures.The complete national security agreement hasn't been published publicly, although aspects of it have been outlined in statements and securities filings made by the companies, US steel said on Wednesday.The pursuit by Nippon Steel dragged on for a year and-a-half, weighed down by national security concerns, opposition by the United Steelworkers and presidential politics in the premier battleground state of Pennsylvania, where US Steel is headquartered.The combined company will become the world's fourth-largest steel-maker in an industry dominated by Chinese companies, and bring what analysts say is Nippon Steel's top-notch technology to US steel's antiquated steel-making processes, plus a commitment to invest USD 11 billion to upgrade US Steel facilities.The potential that the deal could be permanently blocked forced Nippon Steel to sweeten the deal.That included upping its capital commitments in US Steel facilities and adding the golden share provision, giving Trump the right to appoint an independent director and veto power on specific matters.Those matters include reductions in Nippon Steel's capital commitments in the national security agreement; changing US steel's name and headquarters; closing or idling US steel's plants; transferring production or jobs outside of the US; buying competing businesses in the US; and certain decisions on trade, labour and sourcing outside the US.","The provision gives the president the power to appoint a board member and have a say in company decisions.

(NYT News Service)

Daddy’s Home





The White House on Thursday joined the buzz around US President Donald Trump ’s latest ""Daddy"" nickname as the White House shared a one-minute video showing Trump’s arrival and interactions with Nato secretary general Mark Rutte and other leaders at the summit, set to the trackby Usher. The video appears to playfully embrace the nickname, which emerged from an exchange between Trump and Rutte.US President Donald Trump, already the most powerful man in the world, received a new nickname on Wednesday from Nato secretary general Mark Rutte -- ""Daddy.""The moment came as the two leaders were chatting ahead of the Nato summit. Trump brought up his usual comparison of Iran and Israel to fighting schoolchildren.""They've had a big fight, like two kids in a schoolyard,"" Trump said. ""You know, they fight like hell. You can't stop them. Let them fight for about two, three minutes, then it's easier to stop.""To that, Rutte responded: ""And then Daddy has to sometimes use strong language.""Rutte was referring to Trump’s angry reaction earlier in the day at the White House, where the president was visibly upset about the possibility of the Iran-Israel ceasefire falling apart.""The two countries have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing, do you understand that?"" Trump told reporters.Trump laughed at Rutte’s ""Daddy"" remark and acknowledged the use of his unexpected expletive. ""Everyone said 'Well, you have to use a certain word',"" he said.When asked later about the nickname, Trump said he didn’t mind it. ""He did it very affectionately,"" Trump said. ""Daddy, you're my daddy.""The exchange also drew laughter from US secretary of state Marco Rubio, who was present when Trump responded to Rutte’s comment.Trump, known for fiery remarks but not frequent public swearing, surprised many with the language he used.Rutte, meanwhile, made extra efforts to keep Trump engaged during what could have been a tense Nato summit. From shortening the schedule to hosting Trump at the king’s royal palace, Rutte has earned another title of his own, the ""Trump Whisperer.""","US President Donald Trump received a new nickname on Wednesday from Nato secretary general Mark Rutte -- ""Daddy"" The White House shared a one-minute video showing Trump’s arrival and interactions with Rutte and other leaders at the summit, set to the trackby Usher.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122081798,imgsize-1419563,width-400,resizemode-4/122081798.jpg"
Syrian architect uses drone footage to help rebuild hometown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/syrian-architect-uses-drone-footage-to-help-rebuild-hometown/articleshow/122081589.cms,"TAL MARDIKH: Syrian architect Abdel Aziz al Mohammed could barely recognise his war ravaged village when he returned after years away. Now, his meticulous documentation of the damage using a drone helps to rebuild it.""When I first came back, I was shocked by the extent of the destruction,"" said Mohammed, 34.Walking through his devastated village of Tal Mardikh, in Syria's northwestern Idlib province, he said he could not recognise ""anything, I couldn't even find my parents' home"".Nearly half of Tal Mardikh's 1,500 homes have been destroyed and the rest damaged, mainly due to bombardment by the former Syrian army.Mohammed, who in 2019 fled the bombardment to near the Turkish border, first returned days after an Islamist led offensive toppled longtime ruler Bashar al Assad in December.The architect, now based in Idlib city, had documented details of Tal Mardikh's houses and streets before fleeing, and afterwards used his drone to document the destruction.When he returned, he spent two weeks carefully surveying the area, going from home to home and creating an interactive map showing the detailed conditions of each house.""We entered homes in fear, not knowing what was inside, as the regime controlled the area for five years,"" he said.Under the blazing sun, Mohammed watched as workers restored a house in Tal Mardikh, which adjoins the archaeological site of Ebla, the seat of one of ancient Syria's earliest kingdoms.His documentation of the village helped gain support from Shafak, a Turkey-based non-governmental organisation which agreed to fund the reconstruction and rehabilitation of 434 out of 800 damaged homes in Tal Mardikh.The work is expected to be completed in August, and includes the restoration of two wells and sanitation networks, at a cost of more than one million dollars.- 'Full of hope' -Syrians have begun returning home after Assad's ouster and following nearly 14 years of civil war that killed over half a million people and displaced millions of others internally and abroad.According to the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, more than 600,000 Syrians had returned home from abroad, while around 1.5 million internally displaced people have gone back to their regions of origin.The agency estimates that up to 1.5 million Syrians from abroad and two million internally displaced people could return by the end of this year.Around 13.5 million currently remain displaced internally or abroad, according to UNHCR figures for May.In Tal Mardikh, Alaa Gharib, 45, is among only a few dozen residents who have come back.""I lived in tents for seven years, and when liberation came, I returned to my village,"" said Gharib, whose home is among those set for restoration.He is using a blanket as a makeshift door for his house which had ""no doors, no windows, nothing"".After Western sanctions were lifted, Syria's new authorities are hoping for international support for post-war reconstruction, which the UN estimates could cost more than $400 billion.Efforts have so far been limited to individuals or charities, with the government yet to launch a reconstruction campaign.Architect Mohammed said his dream was ""for the village to be rebuilt, for people and life to return"".He expressed hope to ""see the Syria we dream of... the Syria full of hope, built by its youth"".","Nearly half of Tal Mardikh's 1,500 homes have been destroyed and the rest damaged.

A US federal judge on Wednesday ordered the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia , the Salvadoran national who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Donald Trump administration in March, in a case which made global headlines.However, Abrego Garcia, who was brought back earlier this month to face federal criminal charges in two counts of alleged human smuggling, will spend at least a few more days in jail, while attorneys spar over whether prosecutors have the power to prevent him from being deported again.Ordering a conditional release of the 29-year-old, federal judge Barbara Holmes admitted that once released, he would land in the custody of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) - an argument his legal team repeatedly made during the hearing.""I have no reservations about my ability to direct the local US attorney’s office. (However) I don’t think I have any authority over ICE,"" news agency AP quoted Holmes as saying.The judge, who previously ruled that Abrego Garcia has a right to be freed, did not say when she would file the release order, but it will not happen before Friday afternoon.Meanwhile, federal prosecutors tried to stay Holmes’ release ruling, but it was denied by another federal judge, who wrote that the government was asking the court to “save it from itself” in a situation which was “completely of its own making.”The human trafficking charges against Abrego Garcia stem from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding in Tennessee. During the incident, the Salvadoran national was found driving a vehicle with nine passengers.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Donald Trump administration in March.

Operation Midnight Hammer: US state secy Marco Rubio denies limited damage reports; says Iran now 'much further away from nukes',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/operation-midnight-hammer-us-state-secy-marco-rubio-denies-limited-damage-reports-says-iran-now-much-further-away-from-nukes/articleshow/122077507.cms,"US secretary of state Marco Rubio (AP)





US secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that Iran is “much further away from a nuclear weapon.”In an interview with news portal Politico on the sidelines of the Nato summit in The Hague, Rubio offered a more nuanced assessment of US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities earlier this week, in contrast with his boss President Trump’s assertions at the same summit, that Iran’s Fardo, Natanz and Isfahan sites have been “completely obliterated. ”“The bottom line is, they are much further away from a nuclear weapon today than they were before the president took this bold action,” Rubio said. “That’s the most important thing to understand, significant, very significant, substantial damage was done to a variety of different components, and we’re just learning more about it.”The interview comes in the backdrop of a leaked initial assessment by the Pentagon's defense intelligence agency, first reported by CNN earlier this week, which suggested US strikes may have left key parts of Iran's nuclear facilities intact, setting the program back only by months.The US intelligence community is expected to release further assessments in the coming days and weeks, though differing analyses are common among the various spy agencies.Rubio rejected the media reports as “false,” saying they failed to present the complete picture.“I hate commenting on these stories, because often the first story is wrong and the person putting it out there has an agenda,” he said. “That story is a false story, and it’s one that really shouldn’t be rereported because it doesn’t accurately reflect what’s happening.”While Trump has hinted at regime change in Iran on social media, Rubio clarified that it is not the objective of the US government.“The world is filled with regimes I don’t like and the president doesn’t like, and a lot of us wish didn’t exist. The United States’ job is not to go around and set up governments for every country,” he said.“Our national security issue with Iran is with a clerical regime that wants nuclear weapons so they can threaten us, threaten Israel today, threaten us tomorrow. And the president’s made clear that’s not going to happen.”Rubio went on to add that Trump views regime change as a likely outcome if Iran’s leadership stays on its current path.Rubio noted that although Trump considers a range of views and advice, “once the president makes a decision, his instincts are uncanny, and we have to appreciate that.”“I find it curious when people argue as if somehow this is some coalition government and we all get a vote. There’s only one vote here,” Rubio said.He added: “When he says, ‘this is the direction I want to go,’ our job is not to spend all day trying to change his mind.”","US secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that Iran is “much further away from a nuclear weapon.” Rubio offered a more nuanced assessment of US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities earlier this week, in contrast with his boss President Trump”s assertions at the same summit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122077526,imgsize-700364,width-400,resizemode-4/122077526.jpg"

Top US intelligence officials on Wednesday issued a strong rebuttal to leaked media reports suggesting limited damage from recent US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear sites, asserting that the targeted facilities were in fact severely hit and would take years to rebuild.Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard accused what she described as the “propaganda media” of selectively leaking classified assessments in a bid to discredit President Donald Trump’s handling of the strikes. In a post from her official X account, Gabbard said new intelligence confirms the “complete destruction” of Iran’s nuclear facilities at Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan during American airstrikes earlier this week.“If the Iranians chose to rebuild, they would have to rebuild all three facilities entirely,” she wrote, adding that such a reconstruction process “would likely take years.”Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii who now serves in Trump’s cabinet, also criticised the credibility of recent news reports that downplayed the extent of the damage. She claimed that these stories were based on illegally leaked classified assessments written with “low confidence” and selectively leaked to mislead the public.Echoing her remarks, CIA director John Ratcliffe also issued a statement on X confirming that the agency had “credible intelligence”, including from trusted sources, showing that the Iranian nuclear programme had sustained serious setbacks.“Iran's nuclear facilities have been severely damaged by the recent, targeted strikes,” Ratcliffe said, noting that the CIA continues to monitor the situation and will update officials and the public as more information becomes available.Both officials directly challenged initial leaks reported by some US media outlets that suggested the strikes had left core components of the Iranian nuclear facilities intact and had set it back only by a matter of months. Ratcliffe dismissed those reports as based on illegally obtained intelligence that does not reflect the CIA’s current assessment.The statements from Gabbard and Ratcliffe mark the most assertive public response from the intelligence community since the strikes were carried out.",Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard accused what she described as the ‘propaganda media’ of selectively leaking classified assessments.

Iran-Israel New War Erupts At UN; Tehran ‘EXPOSES’ U.S. For BOMBING Nukes | ‘Master Of Lies’





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday claimed that Israel may have sent agents to inspect Iran’s Fordo nuclear site following recent American airstrikes. He said the site suffered “total obliteration” and warned that further action would follow if Tehran were to resume uranium enrichment.While speaking to reporters at the Nato summit in The Hague, Trump said, “You know they have guys that go in there after the hit, and they said it was total obliteration.”He said that Israel is currently assessing the damage inflicted on the sites.“Israel is doing a report on it now, I understand, and I was told that they said it was total obliteration. I believe it was total obliteration, and I believe they didn’t have a chance to get anything out because we acted fast,” he added.Israeli officials, while responding to remarks made by Trump, told Kan public broadcaster, that they were not aware of any Israeli operation at Fordo nuclear site after the US strikes.Earlier in the week a leaked Pentagon intelligence report first reported by CNN, suggested that US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities might have left core components largely intact, and that Iran’s nuclear program has essentially only been set back only by months.Adding that a significant portion of Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile may have been moved out of the facilities before the bombings took place.The White House has dismissed the report's conclusions and criticized the leak.When asked by the reporters if the US would strike Iran again if Tehran were to rebuild its uranium enrichment facilities, Trump said, “Sure. But I’m not going to have to worry about that. It’s gone for years.”In response to a question about the extent of the setback to Iran’s nuclear program, Trump said, “I think it’s basically decades, because I don’t think they’ll ever do it again. I think they’ve had it. I mean, they just went through hell. They’ve had it.”“The last thing they want to do is enrich anything right now,” Trump said. “They want to recover,” he added.“They’re not going to have a bomb and they’re not going to enrich,” he stressed.Trump went on to compare the American strikes on the three Iranian nuclear sites with the nuclear bombing of Japan towards the end of world war two, “That hit ended the war. That hit ended the war. I don’t want to use an example of Hiroshima, I don’t want to use an example of Nagasaki, but that was essentially the same thing that ended that war. This ended that, this ended that war. If we didn’t take that out, they would have been fighting right now. ”“I think we’ll end up having somewhat of a relationship with Iran,” he added.",US President Donald Trump claimed that Israel may have sent agents to inspect Iran’s Fordo nuclear site following recent American airstrikes.

Trump vs the Bench: Why is the Trump administration suing Maryland federal judges?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-vs-the-bench-why-is-the-trump-administration-suing-maryland-federal-judges/articleshow/122080123.cms,"Trump vs the Bench: Why is the Trump administration suing Maryland federal judges

Is Maryland’s deportation pause order, judicial overreach?

Why sue judges instead of appealing orders?

Fight for democracy versus docket management.





The Trump administration introduced a constitutional curveball by suing the entire bench of the US District Court for the District of Maryland, 15 sitting judges, in their own courthouse over the court’s ruling in which automatically pauses any deportation from Maryland for two business days when a detainee files a fresh habeas petition.The Trump administration filed the lawsuit in Baltimore, which argued that Maryland’s standing order defied both US Supreme Court precedent on injunctive relief and the clear intent of Congress. The Justice Department labels the order an “egregious example of judicial overreach,” portraying it as yet another entry in a growing list of courtroom interventions that have hamstrung the administration’s ability to carry out its immigration agenda.The order was signed by Chief US District Judge George Russell after a prolonged legal battle over the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia—a Salvadoran national with an American wife and child—who was removed to El Salvador despite a 2019 immigration court ruling shielding him from return due to the threat of gang violence.To contest a trial court's decision, a party would need to do so within the same case or request that an appellate court overturn the ruling.""It is a shocking move by the Justice Department that is simply unprecedented,"" said Marin Levy, a professor at Duke University School of Law. ""And it seems like part of a strategic attempt to attack the courts rather than any sort of good faith litigation.""US Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that President Trump was elected to implement his policy agenda, and that continued judicial interference not only disrupts that mandate but also poses a serious threat to the integrity of the democratic process.""Every unlawful order entered by the district courts robs the Executive Branch of its most scarce resource: time to put its policies into effect,"" the Justice Department stated in the lawsuit. ""In the process, such orders diminish the votes of the citizens who elected the head of the Executive Branch.""For the judiciary, it is a stress test of institutional independence. Do judges, like other litigants, have to defend themselves in court for interpreting the law?Read: Court to rule on release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, man mistakenly deported to El Salvador; may face possible ICE custody","The Trump administration sued the entire bench of the US District Court for the District of Maryland, 15 sitting judges, in their own courthouse.

Education department vs California





After their feud over deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles amid violent street protests against immigration raids, the Donald Trump administration and California are feuding again - this time over the state's violation of Title IX, a federal law.Responding to the federal education department's allegation against the state of violating Title IX, the office of governor Gavin Newsom posted a GIF of education secretary Linda McMahon from her professional wrestling days.McMahon is the wife of former World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) owner Vince McMahon and made several appearances for the company, mostly as an authority figure. President Trump himself is a member of WWE's ""hall of fame"" and was involved in a ""battle of the billionaires"" against Vince McMahon on the promotion's programming in 2007.The GIF posted by Newsom's press office showed Linda McMahon taking a move called the ""tombstone piledriver"" on a WWE show. The wrestler who performed the move was Kane, real name Glenn Jacobs - the current mayor of Knox County, Tennessee.This came after McMahon warned California with ""imminent action"" for violating the federal law.On Wednesday, the Trump administration said it determined that California's education department and governing body for high school sports are defying Title IX, which bans sex discrimination in education.The Republican-led federal government gave the Democratic state 10 days to reverse its policy, or face ""imminent enforcement action.""“The Trump Administration will relentlessly enforce Title IX protections for women and girls, and our findings today make clear that California has failed to adhere to its obligations under federal law,” education secretary McMahon said in a statement.Separately, she told Fox News that the department could withdraw federal funding if the state did not comply.California, though, asserted it has ""no plans"" to change its policies.""The California Department of Education believes all students should have the opportunity to learn and play at school, and we have consistently applied existing law in support of students’ rights to do so,” according to a statement by spokesperson Liz Sanders.McMahon's announcement comes weeks after a trans student athlete, AB Hernandez, caught national attention over her participation in the California high school state track and field championship, where she won the girls high jump and triple jump, and came second in the long jump. However, the organizers awarded gold and silver medals to both Hernandez and other competitors who would have won medals had she not participated. It was the first time such a rule change was made.In one of the earliest decisions of his second term, which began in January, President Donald Trump had signed an executive order to keep ""men out of women's sports.""","California governor's office posted a GIF of education secretary Linda McMahon from her professional wrestling days.

Market harming?





SAN FRACISCO: A US judge on Wednesday handed Meta a victory over authors who accused the tech giant of violating copyright law by training Llama artificial intelligence on their creations without permission.District Court Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco ruled that Meta's use of the works to train its AI model was ""transformative"" enough to constitute ""fair use"" under copyright law, in the second such courtroom triumph for AI firms this week.However, it came with a caveat that the authors could have pitched a winning argument that by training powerful generative AI with copyrighted works, tech firms are creating a tool that could let a sea of users compete with them in the literary marketplace.""No matter how transformative (generative AI) training may be, it's hard to imagine that it can be fair use to use copyrighted books to develop a tool to make billions or trillions of dollars while enabling the creation of a potentially endless stream of competing works that could significantly harm the market for those books,"" Chhabria said in his ruling.Tremendous amounts of data are needed to train large language models powering generative AI.Musicians, book authors, visual artists and news publications have sued various AI companies that used their data without permission or payment.AI companies generally defend their practices by claiming fair use, arguing that training AI on large datasets fundamentally transforms the original content and is necessary for innovation.""We appreciate today's decision from the court,"" a Meta spokesperson said in response to an AFP inquiry.""Open-source AI models are powering transformative innovations, productivity and creativity for individuals and companies, and fair use of copyright material is a vital legal framework for building this transformative technology.""In the case before Chhabria, a group of authors sued Meta for downloading pirated copies of their works and using them to train the open-source Llama generative AI, according to court documents.Books involved in the suit include Sarah Silverman's comic memoir ""The Bedwetter"" and Junot Diaz's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel ""The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao,"" the documents showed.""This ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta's use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful,"" the judge stated.""It stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one.""A different federal judge in San Francisco on Monday sided with AI firm Anthropic regarding training its models on copyrighted books without authors' permission.District Court Judge William Alsup ruled that the company's training of its Claude AI models with books bought or pirated was allowed under the ""fair use"" doctrine in the US Copyright Act.""Use of the books at issue to train Claude and its precursors was exceedingly transformative and was a fair use,"" Alsup wrote in his decision.""The technology at issue was among the most transformative many of us will see in our lifetimes,"" Alsup added in his decision, comparing AI training to how humans learn by reading books.The ruling stems from a class-action lawsuit filed by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson, who accused Anthropic of illegally copying their books to train chatbot Claude, the company's ChatGPT rival.Alsup rejected Anthropic's bid for blanket protection, ruling that the company's practice of downloading millions of pirated books to build a permanent digital library was not justified by fair use protections.","US judge sides with Meta in AI training copyright case.

President Donald Trump's pledge to revive American manufacturing is running into the stubborn obstacle of demographic reality.The pool of blue-collar workers who are able and willing to perform tasks on a factory floor in the United States is shrinking. As baby boomers retire, few young people are lining up to take their place. About 400,000 manufacturing jobs are currently unfilled, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics - a shortfall that will surely grow if companies are forced to rely less on manufacturing overseas and build more factories in the United States, experts say.Difficulty attracting and retaining a quality workforce has been consistently cited as a ""top primary challenge"" by US manufacturers since 2017, said Victoria Bloom, the chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers, which produces a quarterly survey.The hiring challenges faced by US factories are multifaceted. The president's crackdown on immigration, which includes attempts to revoke deportation protections for migrants from troubled countries, may eliminate workers who could have filled those jobs.Many Americans aren't interested in factory jobs because they often do not pay enough to lure workers away from service jobs that may have more flexible schedules or comfortable working environments.For some companies, remaining globally competitive involves the use of sophisticated equipment that requires employees to have extensive training and familiarity with software. And employers cannot simply hire people right out of high school without providing specialised training to bring them up to speed. That wasn't the case in the heyday of American manufacturing.Attracting motivated young people to manufacturing careers is also a challenge when high school guidance counselors are still judged by how many students go on to college. College graduates, on the other hand, often do not have the right skills to be successful on a factory floor.Trump's aggressive cuts to training programmes for blue-collar workers have also hurt efforts to train a new generation of factory workers. The administration has taken steps to eliminate the Job Corps, a 60-year-old programme that provides at-risk youths from 16 to 24 with a path to a career in the trades.nyt","As baby boomers retire, few young people are lining up to take their place.

'War's over; talks next'





Iran said its nuclear installations were ""badly damaged"" by US airstrikes, the first such comments by Tehran as debate grows over how much the bombardment managed to dent the Islamic Republic's atomic programme.""Our nuclear installations have been badly damaged, that's for sure,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei told Al Jazeera TV in an interview on Wednesday.Baghaei did not give further details and said authorities were still assessing the situation on the ground. He added that the US attacks were a ""detrimental blow"" to international law and the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to which Iran is a signatory.The comments are the first time an Iranian official has addressed the scope of damage caused by the June 22 strikes which involved US attacks on three nuclear facilities in Iran.The comments came hours after US President Trump disputed a US intelligence report that said the attacks had limited impact on Iran's nuclear programme below ground.An assessment from the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency said the bombing likely didn't cripple the core components stored underground including centrifuges, according to people familiar with its contents.Commenting on the intelligence leak, Trump said the report was ""very inconclusive"" but that he still believed the sites were demolished. ""The intelligence says we don't know,"" he told reporters at a Nato summit in the Hague. ""It could have been very severe. That's what the intelligence says. So I guess that's correct, but I think we can take that we don't know. It was very severe. It was obliteration.""Trump said the US would hold a meeting with Iran next week but cast doubt on the need for a diplomatic agreement, citing the damage that the US bombing had done to its key nuclear sites. He said the conflict was effectively ""over"" after the US mission - though he also warned: ""Can it start again? I guess someday it can. It could maybe start soon.""","Iran says its nuclear installations were ""badly damaged"" by US airstrikes.

Is Pakistan building an ICBM?

Foreign Affairs

What is ICBM?

Change in US strategy?





Another growing concern stems from Pakistan. US intelligence agencies have assessed that Pakistan is actively developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the continental United States.According to a report by, the Pakistani military is pursuing a nuclear-armed ICBM, particularly in the wake of Operation Sindoor that took place in May.While Islamabad maintains that its nuclear program is aimed solely at deterring India—its conventionally superior neighbor—US intelligence agencies have assessed that Pakistan is actively developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the continental United States.By pursuing such long-range capabilities, Pakistan may be attempting to deter potential US actions—whether a preemptive strike on its nuclear facilities or intervention in a future conflict with India.ICBM is a long-range missile with a reach exceeding 5,500 kilometers (3,400 miles), primarily designed to deliver nuclear payloads—typically one or more thermonuclear warheads. While ICBMs are theoretically capable of carrying conventional, chemical, or biological weapons, such payloads have never been operationally deployed on these systems.Modern ICBMs often feature multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), enabling a single missile to deliver several warheads to different targets simultaneously.Countries currently known to possess operational ICBMs include the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Israel, and North Korea. Pakistan, despite being a nuclear-armed nation, remained the only such state without an ICBM capability.Advancements in missile technology, such as those seen in second- and third-generation systems like the US LGM-118 Peacekeeper, significantly increased accuracy, allowing ICBMs to hit even small, fortified targets with high reliability.ICBMs stand apart from other ballistic missile classes due to their extended range and faster speed. They surpass intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs), medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs), short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), and tactical ballistic missiles in both capability and strategic impact.US officials have pointed out, the acquisition of ICBMs capable of targeting American territory would compel Washington to categorize Pakistan as a nuclear threat. Historically, no nation with such reach has been treated as an ally by the United States. In effect, the threat of nuclear escalation now shadows every region central to US strategic interests.While each emerging nuclear adversary—Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran—poses a significant threat on its own, the prospect of coordination or strategic collusion among them presents a far more alarming challenge.","According to a report by, the Pakistani military is pursuing a nuclear-armed ICBM.

That would mean surrendering our future to the agenda of terrorists,” he said.Bilawal insisted that peace in South Asia was not possible without dialogue and mutual trust. “We are not only fighting for Pakistan’s future, we are fighting for regional stability, for the people of both countries,” he said.The IWT, one of the few surviving agreements between India and Pakistan, allocates water from six rivers in the Indus basin.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Monday extended its airspace ban on Indian aircraft for another month, citing ongoing tensions between the two countries following the Pahalgam terrorist attack and subsequent military operations.The ban, originally imposed on April 23, was first extended on May 23 after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7. The Indian military action targeted and reportedly dismantled several terror camps in Pakistan-administered territory, triggering four days of intense cross-border clashes that concluded with a ceasefire on May 10.A fresh Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) issued by the Pakistan Airports Authority now extends the restriction from June 23 to July 24. The notice states, “Pakistan airspace not available for Indian registered aircraft and aircraft operated/owned or leased by Indian airlines/operators including military flights.”The situation remains tense despite the end of direct hostilities. Diplomatic channels have yet to yield any breakthroughs in repairing the fractured bilateral relationship. Indian and Pakistani officials have not resumed formal dialogue since the flare-up.The initial ban followed the Pahalgam terrorist attack, which killed at least 26 people, further deepening mistrust and heightening military alertness on both sides.","The ban, originally imposed on April 23, was first extended on May 23 after India launched Operation Sindoor.

Pakistan Condemns U.S. Strikes On Iran A Day After Nobel Peace Prize Endorsement For Donald Trump





The Pakistani government and its powerful military establishment are facing a wave of public backlash after formally recommending US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, a move that drew widespread condemnation following the US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities.Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar sent a letter to the Nobel Committee in Norway, crediting Trump’s “decisive diplomatic intervention” during the recent India-Pakistan standoff. But the recommendation triggered a storm on social media after Trump ordered attacks on Iran’s Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear sites, an operation he called a “historic moment” and one that escalated regional tensions.On X (formerly Twitter), users accused the Pakistani government of appeasing its “master.” One user mocked, “Pakistanis, beware! After the attack on Iran, PM Shehbaz might not only award Trump the Nobel Peace Prize, but also Tamgha-e-Jurat, Tamgha-e-Shujaat, Tamgha-e-Basalat, Tamgha-e-Imtiaz, and perhaps even the Nishan-e-Haider!”Veteran journalist Ameer Abbas recalled that PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique had once likened Trump to Genghis Khan and Hitler.“Now, the same government nominates him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Who is orchestrating such shameful and cowardly decisions?” he asked.Raheeq Abbasi, political analyst and columnist, noted the irony, “Trump, who vetoed the Gaza ceasefire 8 times and is protested across the West for war crimes, is being nominated for a Nobel by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Is there no sense of honour left?”The backlash cut across ideological lines. Some users accused the military establishment of calling the shots. “The uncrowned kings are ready to sell out the nation whenever they please,” wrote Major (R) Asim.Another user, Jarjees Ahmad, called out the “supreme level of hypocrisy”, “We’re nominating someone involved in the massacre of Palestinians while claiming to stand with Iran.”Aamir Khan added, “What greater betrayal could there be to Muslims, our country, and the people of Pakistan?”The Pakistani government has yet to respond officially to the criticism.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar sent a letter to the Nobel Committee in Norway, crediting Trump’s “decisive diplomatic intervention” during the recent India-Pakistan standoff.

ISLAMABAD: In a move likely to stir diplomatic discussion across the region, the Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan govt announced on Saturday that it will formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, citing his diplomatic intervention during the recent India-Pakistan military crisis, reports Omer Farooq Khan.In an official statement shared on X, the Pakistan govt credited Trump's ""decisive intervention"" and ""pivotal leadership"" with helping de-escalate a rapidly intensifying standoff between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Islamabad said it responded with a calibrated military action - Operation Bunyanum Marsoos - described as a ""measured"" and ""precise"" strike intended to restore deterrence without targeting civilian areas.Pakistan's govt claimed Trump engaged both Islamabad and New Delhi through high-level diplomacy at a moment of heightened regional volatility, securing a ceasefire that averted a wider conflagration. ""President Trump demonstrated strategic foresight and statesmanship, preventing a broader conflict that could have had catastrophic consequences for the region,"" the statement read.The govt also praised Trump for his ""sincere"" willingness to assist in resolving the Kashmir dispute - an issue Pakistan maintains is central to lasting peace in South Asia.India, however, has consistently rejected third-party involvement in Kashmir, reiterating that the issue must be resolved bilaterally under the Simla Agreement.The Pakistani statement expressed hope that Trump's ""legacy of pragmatic diplomacy"" would continue to play a role in addressing global flashpoints, including the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and rising tensions involving Iran.Trump, who is yet to respond publicly, has previously highlighted his role in managing past India-Pakistan tensions, including in 2019 following the Pulwama-Balakot incident. His earlier offer to mediate on Kashmir was firmly rebuffed by New Delhi.The Nobel Peace Prize nomination process permits formal recommendations from heads of state, national lawmakers, and certain academic and diplomatic figures. The Norwegian Nobel Committee does not comment on individual nominations.If successful, Trump would join a select group of American leaders - US Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter, and Barack Obama - who have received the Nobel Peace Prize.","Pakistan to nominate US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.

'Could not Occur Without Money': FATF Condemns Pahalgam Attack; Pakistan's Return To Grey-List Soon?





A new report from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has cited a case involving Pakistan’s missile development programme, referencing a shipment seized by Indian customs officials in 2020 that was bound for Port Qasim in Karachi. The FATF case study outlines how dual-use goods, including equipment critical for ballistic missile technology, were mis-declared in export documents and linked directly to Pakistan’s National Development Complex, which is known to be involved in the development of long-range ballistic missiles.The FATF report reveals that Indian investigators intercepted a cargo ship falsely declaring autoclaves, equipment used for high-energy materials and missile motor components. “The Bill of Lading of the seized cargo provided evidence of the link between the importer and the National Development Complex,” the report noted.This latest disclosure comes as FATF increases its scrutiny of state-sponsored terrorism, particularly following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, which left 26 dead. In a public condemnation, FATF said: “This, and other recent attacks, could not occur without money and the means to move funds between terrorist supporters.”As per PTI sources, India is likely to use this FATF disclosure in its dossier to push for Pakistan’s return to the FATF grey list. The upcoming Asia Pacific Group meeting in August and the FATF plenary in October may see renewed calls for sanctions or monitoring. According to officials cited by PTI, the inclusion of “state-sponsored terrorism” in the FATF’s upcoming analysis marks a significant step in acknowledging Pakistan’s involvement in funding and facilitating terror operations.The incident flagged by FATF, which occurred in February 2020 at Kandla port, saw authorities act on intelligence regarding a suspicious Hong Kong-flagged ship, Da Cui Yun, that had departed from China’s Jiangyin port, TOI had reported. Officials seized a massive pressure chamber described as a pipe-like object, 35-40 feet in length, now confirmed to have potential ballistic missile applications. Experts from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) joined a high-level investigation into the cargo, amid tight-lipped responses from customs due to the national security implications.Also read: ‘Suspicious’ Chinese ship seized at Kandla, under strict scrutiny The FATF report also highlighted the growing global risk from proliferation financing (PF), especially concerning state and non-state actors acquiring dual-use technologies for weapons of mass destruction (WMD). “The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related financing represents a significant threat to global security and the integrity of the international financial system,” the report warns, adding that failure to implement effective controls could allow actors to exploit weaknesses in global export and financial systems.","A new report from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has cited a case involving Pakistan’s missile development programme.

ISLAMABAD: In a bid to recalibrate Pakistan’s global narrative and bolster ties with Washington, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States, meeting senior American scholars, strategic experts, and international media representatives during an official visit to Washington DC, the Pakistani military said on Friday.In a carefully choreographed diplomatic offensive, Munir interacted with leading think tanks and policy institutions, offering what officials described as “Pakistan’s principled perspectives” on evolving regional and global dynamics. His engagements underscored Islamabad’s renewed focus on international outreach amid a shifting geopolitical landscape in South Asia.The army chief reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to regional stability, counterterrorism, and a rules-based global order, pitching the country as a responsible actor in an increasingly multipolar world.Munir spoke at length about Pakistan’s counter-terrorism strategy, highlighting military operations such as Maarka-e-Haqa and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. He reminded his audience of Pakistan’s role as a frontline state in the global war on terror, citing the “immense sacrifices” borne by its security forces and civilians.Without naming India, Munir warned against “regional actors using terrorism as an instrument of hybrid warfare” – a familiar refrain in Pakistan’s diplomatic lexicon referring to its neighbour.While not new, the accusation resurfacing in the US capital, signalling Pakistan’s intent to shape the security discourse in South Asia.Munir also showcased Pakistan’s economic aspirations. He pitched the country’s untapped potential in IT, agriculture, and mineral wealth, calling on global stakeholders to invest in these “engines of shared prosperity”.From foreign policy to economic diplomacy, Munir portrayed Pakistan as a country pursuing dialogue, diplomacy, and international law — an image Islamabad has been keen to project as it seeks to distance itself from past reputational baggage.Discussing Pakistan-US relations, Munir called for transforming the historical security-centric engagement into a multidimensional partnership grounded in strategic convergence and mutual respect. He acknowledged past cooperation on counterterrorism and economic development but pushed for a broader framework of engagement.According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, participants appreciated the candid nature of the discussions and acknowledged Pakistan’s efforts to maintain regional stability. The meetings were seen as a trust-building exercise amid evolving US priorities in the Indo-Pacific region and growing scepticism over Islamabad’s commitments.The visit comes at a time when Pakistan is striving to reset ties with major powers, especially after its recent economic crises and shifting regional alignments. With India drawing closer to the US and Afghanistan remaining volatile, Islamabad is attempting to reposition itself as an indispensable — if complicated — regional player.","Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Friday issued a stern warning that he may dissolve the provincial assembly if the federal government attempts to destabilise the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-led coalition in the province.In a video message, Gandapur asserted that he holds the constitutional power to dissolve the assembly at any time. The warning comes amid increasing political friction between the federal and provincial governments.Gandapur suspended implementation of the recently passed provincial budget and instructed lawmakers not to submit any cut motions during Friday’s session. He added that a new strategy would be announced on Monday.“If we don’t pass the budget, the federal government could take control of the province under the pretext of a financial emergency,” Gandapur said, accusing Islamabad of conspiring to topple his government.He also lashed out at the federal authorities for what he described as “unjust treatment” of the province following the May 9, 2023, incidents. He alleged that the public mandate in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was stolen in the aftermath.“Our leader was unjustly jailed, and the way we were treated after May 9, followed by the theft of our mandate, is unacceptable. However, the people of this province stood firm to protect their vote,” he stated.Former Prime Minister Imran Khan , founder of PTI, remains in jail since August 2023. He faces multiple cases, including charges of inciting attacks on military and government buildings following his arrest by paramilitary Rangers from the Islamabad High Court premises.Gandapur also criticised the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governor for allegedly violating constitutional responsibilities. “It is the constitutional duty of the governor to call the budget session, but he failed to do so,” he said.He further added, “Moreover, our party’s founding chairman has a legal and moral right to be consulted on the budget, but he has been denied access.”Gandapur’s remarks highlight rising tensions between the provincial and federal leadership, amid concerns of deepening political instability in Pakistan.",Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur issued a stern warning that he may dissolve the provincial assembly if the federal government attempts to destabilise the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-led coalition.

Trump Hosts Pakistan Army Chief Munir Alone At White House, Faces Fierce Criticism From Pentagon Vet





ISLAMABAD: The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz, with whispers of backroom deals that could reshape the balance of power in South Asia and far beyond.What began as a one-hour lunch in the Cabinet Room turned into a two-hour marathon meeting that continued in the Oval Office, attended by US secretary of state Marco Rubio, special representative Steve Witkoff, and Pakistan NSA and Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Asim Malik.The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) handout flags counter-terrorism, trade, and peace, but the real stakes — against the backdrop of Iran-Israel airstrikes and India-Pakistan tensions — reveal a high-wire act with far-reaching implications.Trump, channeling his trademark deal-maker bravado, now sees Pakistan as a strategic prize. As Israel intensifies strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites and Washington edges closer to military escalation, Pakistan’s shared border with Iran becomes critical. Sources say Trump privately pressured Munir for airspace access and intelligence on Tehran — leveraging Pakistan’s backchannel role as the host of Iran’s interests section for the US.In return, he offered advanced weaponry and economic incentives, aiming to lure Islamabad away from China’s orbit and Russia’s Brics alliance.Trump’s push to expand trade in critical minerals, cryptocurrency, AI, and energy is part of a broader strategy to anchor Pakistan within US-led markets and curb China’s regional influence. He has also claimed credit for defusing the May 2025 crisis between India and Pakistan.As Pakistan’s power broker, Munir brings serious leverage. His military’s fight against Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) syncs with US aims in Afghanistan. With ties to Iran and a shared border, Munir can offer covert intelligence or logistical support, though Pakistan’s pro-Iran rhetoric caps public alignment. Economically, he can unlock Pakistan’s mineral and tech potential for US investors, but treading too far risks Beijing’s wrath.On India, Munir’s role in brokering the May ceasefire – praised by President Trump – has been framed in Islamabad as a direct rebuttal of New Delhi’s allegations of Pakistani involvement in cross-border terrorism. With the country facing severe economic challenges, Munir is believed to have sought US military and financial assistance to modernise Pakistan’s armed forces and stabilise its economy. Trump’s openness to providing drones or missile defence systems could significantly alter the military balance with India. Munir also reportedly urged Trump to de-escalate growing tensions between Iran and Israel, warning of broader regional instability and citing Pakistan’s vocal alignment with Tehran. In a bold diplomatic gesture, Munir extended an invitation for Trump to visit Pakistan, an effort seen as central to reshaping bilateral ties and enhancing Islamabad’s global relevance.Timed amid Middle East turmoil and South Asian friction, the Trump-Munir summit is a geopolitical pivot. It signals a fragile US-Pakistan thaw, driven by Washington’s ally hunt and Pakistan’s economic crunch. For India, it’s a call to counter a US strategy cosying up to both rivals while eyeing Iran. Trump’s deal-making and Munir’s strategic charm aim to reposition Pakistan as a US cornerstone, potentially redrawing South Asia’s power map at India’s expense. Wednesday’s White House talks weren’t just diplomacy, they were a bold move in a high-stakes regional chess game.","The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz.

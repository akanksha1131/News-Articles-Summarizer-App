Political standoff hardens





The federal government shutdown in the United States is moving closer to becoming the second longest in history, with no signs of a breakthrough. Some lawmakers have even warned that it could soon surpass the record 35-day shutdown that took place during US President Donald Trump’s first term.The standoff began on October 1.The Trump administration is using the shutdown to advance its priorities and cut funding for programmes it opposes, while Democrats insist that any funding deal must include support for millions of Americans who risk losing health insurance or facing steep premium increases if Congress fails to act.Here's how it has affected workers, economy and government services:As of March 31, the federal government employed around 2.3 million civilian workers. Each day, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, about 750,000 of them are furloughed, forced to stay home without pay until the shutdown ends.Others are considered “excepted” and continue working in essential services.Both groups will eventually be paid retroactively, but many could miss a full paycheck later this month after already receiving only a partial one for late September.Active-duty military personnel, roughly 1.3 million people, narrowly avoided missing their pay on Wednesday, after Trump ordered the Pentagon to redirect funds, according to AP.However, officials say another temporary fix is unlikely.The CBO estimates that paying furloughed workers who are not working is costing the government about $400 million a day.In a break from how previous administrations have handled shutdowns, the current Republican administration is moving to lay off thousands of federal employees in departments it considers low priority. A first round of job cuts affecting 4,100 workers has already been announced, with the biggest reductions at the Treasury, Health and Human Services, Education, and Housing and Urban Development departments.White House budget chief Russ Vought told “The Charlie Kirk Show” that more layoffs are coming.“I think we’ll probably end up being north of 10,000,” Vought said, as quoted by AP.“We want to be very aggressive where we can be in shuttering the bureaucracy,” he added. “Not just the funding, but the bureaucracy, that we now have an opportunity to do that.”Lawmakers admit many federal employees live paycheck to paycheck. Food banks in some communities have increased support, with the Capital Area Food Bank announcing extra food distributions in the Washington region from Monday to help federal workers and contractors.Economists warn that the longer the shutdown continues, the greater the economic fallout. Oxford Economics estimates that each week of the shutdown cuts US economic growth by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points. A full-quarter shutdown, which has never happened before, could reduce growth by 1.2 to 2.4 percentage points.Tourism is among the worst-hit sectors. The US Travel Association expects losses of around $1 billion a week as visitors cancel trips to national parks, historical landmarks and Washington DC Many public sites, including Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo, remain shut for visitors.Air travel is feeling the strain as well. The Federal Aviation Administration has reported shortages of air traffic controllers in cities including Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Houston. Flight delays have spread to airports in Nashville, Dallas, Newark and other locations.Small businesses are also affected. The US Chamber of Commerce expects the Small Business Administration normally backs around $860 million in loans for about 1,600 small firms each week, but new loans have stopped. The shutdown has also delayed mortgage approvals and property transactions by freezing the issue and renewal of flood insurance policies.Neither side appears willing to compromise. Historically, the party that ties funding bills to demands rarely gets its way, as Republicans experienced in 2013 and 2018.Public opinion is divided. A poll by The Associated Press–NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that six in ten US adults blame Trump and congressional Republicans “a great deal” or “quite a bit” for the shutdown, while 54% also hold Democrats responsible.The administration has frozen about $18 billion for a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River and an extension of New York City’s Second Avenue subway. It also cancelled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants across 16 states that backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the last presidential election. Officials say these moves are unrelated to the shutdown.Negotiations remain stuck. Republicans want health care talks to happen only after the government fully reopens. “We’re not conducting negotiations in a hostage situation,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-SD.House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said Democrats “are not going to bend and we’re not going to break because we are standing up for the American people.”","The federal government shutdown in the United States is moving closer to becoming the second longest in history.

Legal and social implications of lottery mismanagement





A man from Dezhou, Shandong province has captured the attention of social media and news outlets across China after winning a 10.17 million yuan (US$1.4 million) lottery in December 2024 and reportedly spending a large portion of his winnings on gambling and female live-streamers, leaving his wife with nothing. The scandal has sparked outrage online, drawn legal attention, and led to the wife filing for divorce, highlighting the ethical and social consequences of sudden wealth.The man, whose identity remains undisclosed, initially shared his winnings with his wife, surnamed Yuan, giving her a bank card alleged to contain 3 million yuan (US$420,000). Out of trust, Yuan did not check the account balance, keeping the card in a drawer. Soon after, the man’s behavior changed drastically: he stopped sharing money with his wife, spent his days gambling, and tipped female live-streamers millions of yuan, including a single tip of 1.2 million yuan (US$168,000).In July, he was discovered taking one live-streamer on a four-day trip, exposing the extent of his spending and personal involvement. Chat records obtained by Yuan revealed he addressed the streamer aswhile referring to himself asYuan later found the bank card had no funds, prompting her to file for divorce and publicly reveal the situation to Henan TV. Social media users have expressed widespread outrage, criticizing his irresponsible behavior and ethical misconduct.Under Chinese law, lottery winnings acquired during marriage are considered joint marital assets. According to lawyer Xi Junqi of Henan Zhongdi Law Firm, if tipping to live-streamers far exceeds normal family spending, the wife can petition the court to exclude him from sharing common assets. If the tipping is linked to an immoral relationship, she may also request the return of the money.The incident has sparked broader discussions online about the influence of sudden wealth on relationships, the ethics of excessive tipping in online streaming culture, and the responsibilities of lottery winners to their families. As the legal proceedings continue, the Dezhou man’s identity remains private, but the scandal serves as a cautionary tale for the consequences of reckless financial behavior.The Dezhou lottery scandal highlights how sudden financial windfalls can disrupt personal relationships and attract public scrutiny. While the man’s identity remains unknown, his actions, lavishing millions on live-streamers while neglecting his marital obligations, have made him the focus of national attention, legal debate, and social media outrage, illustrating the ethical responsibilities that come with significant wealth.","A man from Dezhou, Shandong province won a 10.17 million yuan (US$1.4 million) lottery in December 2024.

Florida councilman Chandler Langevin who created a ripple by his targeted attack on Indians in the US was censured in a 3-2 vote by the Palm Bay council as the council took note of his offensive comments on the Indian community. Langevin had deleted one of the controversial posts but defended all and refused to apologize . After being censured by his council, he said he would sue the council.A censure in the council means Langevin will be able to place an item on the agenda if he gets consensus from the council beforehand. He’s also not allowed to speak during the committee and council reports portion of the meeting except to request a consensus to put an item on a future agenda.In his now-deleted post, Chandler Langevin wrote: ""There's not a single Indian that cares about the United States.

Katy Perry Confirms Justin Trudeau Romance? ‘48 Hours Ago’ Comment Stuns Fans





It seems the romance between pop star Katy Perry and former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had been quietly developing for months before their recent yacht photos took the internet by storm.Days after the Daily Mail shared pictures of the pair kissing off the coast of Santa Barbara, a source close to Perry revealed that Trudeau had been “pursuing” her ever since their first date in July. The viral photos show the duo hugging, kissing, and sharing affectionate moments aboard Katy’s yacht.The insider told PEOPLE that “when she first hung out with Justin, she wasn’t looking to date, but they stayed in touch. They have many shared interests and a lot to talk about, but Katy was navigating too many things to even think about dating then.”According to the source, Trudeau went all out in his pursuit despite being such an influential political leader. The ex-Canadian PM “even flew to California to see her during a tour break. They have an easy connection. She finds him attractive. He’s been very respectful,"" the source added.The 40-year-old singer and the 53-year-old former leader first sparked dating rumours in July 2025 when they were spotted dining together at Le Violon restaurant in Montreal.Also read: Amid Trudeau-Katy Perry dating rumours, ex-wife Sophie Grégoire shares 'letting go' Instagram post Exclusive photos published by the Daily Mail showed the couple sharing intimate moments aboard Perry’s 24-metre yacht, the Caravelle, off Santa Barbara.Perry, dressed in a black swimsuit, was seen embracing Trudeau on the upper deck.

Who is George Santos?





US President Donald Trump on Friday announced that he has commuted the prison sentence of ex-congressman George Santos, who is serving more than seven years in federal prison after pleading guilty to fraud and identity theft charges.“I just signed a commutation releasing George Santos from prison, immediately,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social. “George Santos was somewhat of a rogue, but there are many rogues throughout our country that aren’t forced to serve seven years in prison,” he added.Santos, a Republican from New York, admitted last year that he deceived donors and stole the identities of 11 people — including members of his own family — to make fraudulent campaign donations. He began serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey, on July 25, and had been housed in a minimum-security camp with fewer than 50 inmates.Following the announcement, Andrew Mancilla, one of Santos’s attorneys, welcomed the decision, calling it “the right thing to do.”""Very, very happy with the decision. The defence team applauds President Trump for doing the right thing.The sentence was far too long,"" Mancilla told The Associated Press.However, the timing of the 37-year-old's release remains unclear.The move comes just days after Santos sent a handwritten letter from prison appealing directly to Trump for clemency. “Sir, I appeal to your sense of justice and humanity — the same qualities that have inspired millions of Americans to believe in you,” he wrote. “I humbly ask that you consider the unusual pain and hardship of this environment and allow me the opportunity to return to my family, my friends, and my community. ”The son of Brazilian immigrants, Santos made history in 2022 as the first openly gay Republican elected to Congress. However, his political career quickly collapsed after investigations revealed that he had fabricated much of his personal and professional background.In 2023, he was charged with stealing from donors, misusing campaign funds, collecting unemployment benefits fraudulently, and lying to Congress about his finances. He was expelled from the US House of Representatives later that year — only the sixth member in history to be ousted by colleagues.","George Santos, a Republican from New York, admitted last year that he deceived donors and stole the identities of 11 people to make fraudulent campaign donations.

VIDEO: Hamas Fighters Release Seven Israeli Hostages From Gaza Amid Loud Cheer From Palestinians





Hamas published a video on Monday showing eight blindfolded and kneeling men being executed in the streets, branding them ""collaborators and outlaws.""The footage surfaced amid armed clashes between Hamas security units and Palestinian clans, on the fifth day of a US-brokered truce between Israel and the militant group.Hamas proceeded to take control of Gaza on Tuesday, even as US President Donald Trump vowed to disarm the group under a recently brokered ceasefire.The Israeli military confirmed that the remains of four more hostages held in Gaza were handed to the Red Cross, following the release of four others and the safe return of 20 surviving captives.In northern Gaza, as Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza City, Hamas’s black-masked police resumed street patrols. Hamas’s Brigades helped control crowds when freed prisoners arrived in Gaza on Monday. A new Hamas security unit, called the Deterrence Force, has been targeting armed clans and gangs, some of which are said to have Israeli support.Hamas has dominated Gaza since 2007 after defeating rival faction Fatah. Israel insists Hamas must not play any role in a future Gaza government, hand back the remains of 24 deceased hostages, and eventually disarm.Trump has warned that those who refuse to surrender their weapons will be forcibly disarmed. The US-brokered 20-point peace plan, endorsed by world powers at a Trump-led summit in Egypt, demands a demilitarised Gaza and no leadership role for Hamas.Meanwhile, Israeli families continued pressing for the return of the remains of 24 hostages still held by Hamas.The Israeli army confirmed four more bodies were transferred to the Red Cross and on their way to custody. The military identified two victims as Guy Iluz, an Israeli national, and Bipin Joshi, an agriculture student from Nepal. Two others were later named as Yossi Sharabi and Daniel Peretz.Trump celebrated the ceasefire during a visit to Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and later joined regional leaders in Egypt to sign a declaration aimed at cementing the truce.","Hamas published a video showing eight blindfolded and kneeling men being executed in the streets, branding them ""collaborators and outlaws"" The footage surfaced amid armed clashes between Hamas security units and Palestinian clans, on the fifth day of a US-brokered truce between Israel and the militant group.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124561949,imgsize-395662,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Trump mocks movement





Large crowds of protesters gathered across all 50 states of the US on Saturday against President Donald Trump as the government shutdown stretched into its third week amid a legislative deadlock.While the protesters called the demonstration the “No Kings” movement, Republicans ridiculed it as “Hate America” rallies.Demonstrators picketed outside capitols in several Republican-led states including Washington, Los Angeles, Montana, and several other places.More than 2,500 events are planned across all 50 states — from major cities such as Washington D.C. and New York to small towns across the Midwest.In San Francisco, hundreds of people spelled out “No King!” and other phrases with their bodies on Ocean Beach. Hayley Wingard, who was dressed as the Statue of Liberty, said she had never attended a protest before. Only recently, she began to view Trump as a “dictator.”“This is what democracy looks like!” chanted thousands in Washington near the US Capitol, where the federal government remained shut for a third week amid a legislative deadlock.Demonstrators slammed what they called the Republican billionaire’s strong-arm tactics, including attacks on the media, political opponents, and undocumented immigrants.It was the third mass mobilization since Trump’s return to the White House and came against the backdrop of a government shutdown that not only closed federal programs and services but also tested the core balance of power, as an aggressive executive confronts Congress and the courts in ways protest organizers warn are a slide toward authoritarianism.The dissidents were also protesting several specific policies and actions of the Trump administration, including the deployment of federal forces and National Guard troops into US cities — viewed as an overreach of federal power and militarization of communities — sweeping immigration enforcement raids and policies leading to deportations and alleged injustices, and the government shutdown’s impact on the federal workforce and essential services.Meanwhile, Trump spent the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.“They say they’re referring to me as a king. I’m not a king,” the president said in a Fox News interview that aired early Friday, before departing for a $1 million-per-plate MAGA Inc. fundraiser at his club.Trump’s campaign social media account also mocked the protests by posting a computer-generated video of the president dressed like a monarch, wearing a crown and waving from a balcony.Republican leaders called the protesters “communists” and “Marxists.” They said Democratic leaders, including Senator Chuck Schumer, are beholden to the far-left flank and willing to keep the government shut down to appease those liberal forces.“I encourage you to watch — we call it the Hate America rally — that will happen Saturday,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana.“Let’s see who shows up for that,” Johnson added, listing groups including “antifa types,” people who “hate capitalism,” and “Marxists in full display.”","More than 2,500 events are planned across all 50 states.

US Vice President JD Vance has stepped in to defend US defence secretary Pete Hegseth after social media was grilling him over the colour of his tie during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.The row began when photos from the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting at the White House showed Hegseth wearing a tie in white, blue, and red — colours that some claimed resembled the Russian tricolour flag.The photos went viral, with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Special Envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, sharing Hegseth’s photo on social media alongside a Russian flag emoji, adding fuel to the fire.Vance responded to the continuous trolling on social media, slamming critics who were reading too much into the tie’s design. “Or maybe he was wearing the colors of America,” he said on X, reposting commentary from American YouTuber and former US Army officer Jake Broe, who was among the first ones to share the viral image and claiming that ""these people love Putin and Russia.""Despite Vance’s defence, most netizens remained unconvinced. Commenters argued that if the tie truly represented the American flag, it should have included stars or a different pattern.Some users even dug up an online listing for what appeared to be the same tie, described in the product details as a “Russian plain flag tie,” adding to the speculation.The photo was captured during Ukrainian President Zelenskyy’s visit to Washington on Thursday, when he met US President Donald Trump for talks that included a public briefing and a private lunch. Trump later said he intended to work with Ukraine to persuade Putin to end the war, but confirmed that Kyiv would not receive Tomahawk missiles.Meanwhile, in Ukraine, Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba said Russia had launched drone and missile attacks on energy and transport infrastructure ahead of winter, targeting power stations, substations, and railway lines.",US Vice President JD Vance responds to criticism of Pete Hegseth's tie.

What’s next





Lia Thomas, the first openly transgender athlete to win an NCAA women’s swimming title in 2022, recently accepted the Voice of Inspiration Award at the Violet Visionary Awards, an LGBTQIA+ event co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Dodgers and LAFC. During her acceptance speech, Thomas described trans activism as her “purpose” and framed it as part of a lineage spanning “hundreds of years.” The remarks, delivered amid ongoing debates about transgender participation in women’s sports, have reignited discussions about fairness, representation, and the visibility of transgender athletes.The reaction has been sharply divided. Supporters praised Thomas for using her platform to highlight broader LGBTQIA+ advocacy, while critics, derided both the event and its corporate sponsorship as emblematic of “political correctness run amok.” Riley Gaines, a swimmer who competed against Thomas in 2022, called the award an “insult to women” and described the recognition as “disrespectful to athletes who compete under consistent female standards. ”Thomas’ 2022 NCAA victory over competitors including Gaines sparked global debate over whether transgender women retain physiological advantages even after hormone therapy. A 2021 review in thehighlighted that transgender women may retain certain physical advantages post-transition, fuelling policy changes in sporting organisations worldwide.The broader discourse intersects with social, legal, and cultural debates about equality, inclusion, and the integrity of women’s sports. Governments, sporting federations, and advocacy groups are increasingly pressured to balance protections for transgender athletes with fair competition for cisgender women.The Violet Visionary Awards, held in October 2025 in Los Angeles, drew considerable attention on social media. Clips of Thomas’ speech circulated widely, prompting both supportive and critical commentary. Conservative critics mocked the event’s acronym and the involvement of major sports franchises, arguing that public recognition of Thomas could undermine fairness in women’s athletics.At the ceremony, Thomas linked her personal journey in sports to a wider mission for societal change. “Trans activism is my purpose,” she told the audience, framing her career as part of a centuries-long struggle for recognition and rights.Gaines publicly reiterated her criticism, telling reporters, “Awards like this send the wrong message about fairness in women’s sport. It’s not a celebration—it’s a dismissal of the rules and hard work of women who compete in female divisions.” Conservative commentators online echoed this sentiment, framing the recognition as a politically motivated endorsement rather than an athletic achievement.Thomas’ 2022 NCAA win was a first in collegiate sports and ignited debates that continue to influence policies on transgender athletes. Globally, sports federations including World Aquatics have revised eligibility rules for transgender women, often based on hormone therapy duration and testosterone levels.The 2021review informed these policy shifts by demonstrating potential retained advantages in strength and endurance. Critics argue that recognition of Thomas’ activism, particularly in highly publicised ceremonies, runs counter to these efforts to maintain competitive fairness.Thomas’ visibility carries multiple dimensions of significance. Socially, it enhances representation for transgender individuals in sport and public life. Culturally, it underscores the tension between inclusion and fairness, prompting debate on how society reconciles competing values. Institutionally, it pressures federations, sponsors, and educational institutions to clarify policies on athlete eligibility, activism, and recognition.Public discourse around Thomas’ recognition also illustrates the role of media amplification. Social platforms have become battlegrounds for competing narratives: advocacy groups highlight the award as a milestone, while critics termed it as politically charged and potentially harmful to women’s sports.The debate over Lia Thomas and transgender participation in women’s sports highlights a critical issue: the need to prioritise fairness and justice for biological women in athletic competition. Women’s sports were established to provide equitable opportunities for females, whose physiological differences, such as muscle mass, bone density, and testosterone levels, create distinct performance capacities compared to biological males. Allowing individuals who were male two years ago to compete as women undermines the integrity of women’s sports, regardless of their current gender identity. This is not about denying personal freedom or choice, as those rights are universal, but about preserving a level playing field where biological women can compete without disadvantage.Governing bodies must refine eligibility criteria to protect the category of women’s sports, ensuring it remains a space for biological females.

As US President Donald Trump marked a military parade in Washington, DC, this June, around 5 million people across the country protested his administration. Now, amid an ongoing government shutdown and Trump’s push to deploy National Guard troops to cities, millions are preparing for a second wave of demonstrations.Over 2,500 rallies are planned across all 50 states this Saturday, around 450 more than in June. Organizers say the “No Kings” protests aim to oppose what they call Trump’s “authoritarian” agenda. Some Republican leaders have labelled the protests anti-American.Here are 10 of the best posters from “No Kings” protests, using wordplay and creativity to show opposition to authoritarianism, corruption, and threats to civil liberties.The first round of protests followed hundreds of Trump’s executive orders targeting birthright citizenship, protections for transgender people, diversity initiatives, and more. Tensions over immigration reached a peak when Trump federalized the California National Guard against Governor Gavin Newsom’s wishes. ICE raids, media clashes, and attempts to deploy federal troops in Democratic-led cities have further stoked opposition.Some Republicans have called the protests “Hate America” rallies, warning of agitators and Antifa involvement. Organizers stress that the demonstrations will be peaceful. Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of Indivisible, said, “What we are expecting is millions of people around the country collectively showing up to oppose authoritarianism, corruption and attacks on our neighbors and our rights.”The administration is expected to hold a military show of force in California on the same day. Meanwhile, Department of Homeland Security has issued guidelines to law enforcement to monitor for potential violence and ensure protests remain safe.","Over 2,500 rallies are planned across all 50 states this Saturday, around 450 more than in June.

The TOI correspondent from Washington:

Bernie Sanders SHAKES White House With Roaring Speech Against ""Authoritarian"" Trump | NO KINGS Rally





Millions of Americans gathered at more than 2500 demonstrations across a deeply polarized United States in what protestors characterised as a ""No Kings"" movement and what the ruling MAGA dispensation called “Hate America rallies. ”The mass mobilisation, the second one since President Donald Trump took office in January, echoed the anti-monarchist spirit of the American Revolution as protestors gathered in parks and street corners chanting slogans against what they believe has turned into an unfettered imperial presidency.The protests reject the idea of a supreme, unchecked ruler that they believe Trump had become and oppose what they see as the President acting like a monarch who defies constitutional limits, the courts, and democratic norms.The dissidents were also protesting several specific policies and actions of the Trump administration, including the deployment of federal forces/National Guard troops into US cities, viewed as an overreach of federal power and militarization of communities; sweeping immigration enforcement raids and policies, leading to deportations and alleged injustices; and the government shutdown and its impact on the federal workforce and essential services.Typical signs at the protests included “No Faux-King Way!” “Fight Truth Decay” and “I could shit a better president.” Many immigrants, even citizens, stayed away fearing adverse scrutiny.President Trump has rejected the charge that he is acting like a monarch, remarking on one occasion, ""I don't feel like a king, I have to go through hell to get stuff approved."" He frames the presidency as a difficult job constrained by a “deep state, ” a Democrats-dominated bureaucracy, and a “radical left opposition” that have combined to diminish mostly-white and caucasian American exceptionalism.Leading up to the protests, Trump surrogates sought to delegitimize them, calling them unpatriotic ""hate America rallies"" by “subversive” “radical left” demonstrators they describe as “antifa.” In a Fox News interview, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt suggested the rallies were events staged and backed by the Democratic Party, and alleged its “main constituency is made up of “Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals. ”Visually, the rallies were anything but that, featuring mainly white native-born Americans. Fearing that the protests would be infiltrated by right-wing provocateurs, rally organizers in many places asked demonstrators to maintain peace and to personalize their concerns about domestic issues like health care and government shutdown, while keeping out symbols like Palestinian flags, support for Ukraine etc, and not carrying anything weapons.Indeed, the best weapons were words in the form of biting, cutting slogans. “Not a paid protestor. I hate Trump for free,” read one poster, alluding to the MAGA charge that the demonstrations were funded by anti-America forces. “The only tyrant I accept is my child!” read another held by a woman pushing an infant in a stroller.A man in a chicken suit held up a poster that simply read: CLUCK TRUMP !","Millions of Americans gathered at more than 2500 demonstrations across a deeply polarized United States.

What's next







US President Donald Trump has escalated his campaign against left-leaning philanthropist George Soros, directing federal agencies to investigate what he called “left-wing terrorism” and “political violence” across the United States. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Treasury Department is preparing to overhaul the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) criminal investigative division to target major Democratic donors including Soros and his Open Society Foundations (OSF).The move is reportedly being spearheaded by Gary Shapley, a senior adviser to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has been tasked with replacing top IRS officials and focusing on “financial networks” linked to political unrest. “We are operationalising this here at Treasury,” Bessent said in a recent interview, confirming that work had begun on compiling lists of groups and individuals for review.The Washington Post earlier reported that Trump has privately urged the Justice Department to consider bringing racketeering charges against Soros and his son Alex under the federal RICO statute typically used to combat organised crime. The memo cited a report from the conservative Capital Research Center, which accused Soros-funded organisations of backing groups linked to violent protests, including the Sunrise Movement.The Open Society Foundations, founded by Soros and now run by his son Alex, has dismissed Trump’s claims as “outrageous and false.” In a statement shared with Forbes, the organisation said: “Our work is dedicated to strengthening democracy and upholding constitutional freedoms.” A spokesperson added that OSF would “continue to operate within the bounds of the law” and would not “surrender its constitutional rights to free speech or due process. ”According to The Washington Post, lawyers for OSF are already preparing briefs in anticipation of an IRS inquiry, while progressive groups have begun warning Capitol Hill that the administration could use financial probes to pressure banks into freezing the accounts of prominent Democratic donors. “These accusations are politically motivated attacks on civil society meant to silence speech the administration disagrees with,” OSF said in another statement.Trump, however, remains defiant. In a post on Truth Social, he wrote: “George Soros, and his wonderful Radical Left son, should be charged with RICO because of their support of violent protests and much more. We’re not going to allow these lunatics to rip apart America any more.”While US law prohibits the president or senior administration officials from ordering IRS audits or investigations into specific individuals, Trump’s broader strategy involves empowering federal agencies including the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force and the Treasury Department to “identify and disrupt” funding networks that he claims support political violence. Earlier this year, Senator Ted Cruz introduced the Stop Funders Act, which would authorise the Justice Department to prosecute non-profits accused of supporting violent demonstrations.The campaign against Soros marks a significant escalation in Trump’s long-standing feud with the billionaire, who has been a frequent target of right-wing conspiracy theories.",US President Donald Trump has escalated his campaign against left-leaning philanthropist George Soros.

Pakistan And Afghanistan Agree To ‘Immediate Ceasefire’ After Peace Talks In Doha





Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire after several days of deadly cross-border clashes, Qatar’s foreign ministry said on Sunday. The announcement came after at least 10 people were killed in Pakistani airstrikes that followed an earlier truce.“During the negotiations, the two sides agreed to an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of mechanisms to ensure lasting peace and stability between the two countries,” Qatar’s ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement.Officials from both sides met in Doha on Saturday to ease tensions. Kabul had earlier accused Islamabad of breaking a 48-hour ceasefire that briefly paused nearly a week of fighting which killed dozens of soldiers and civilians on both sides.Security officials in Pakistan said the latest strikes in Afghan border areas targeted a militant group linked to the Pakistani Taliban. The attack, they said, came in response to an assault on Pakistani paramilitary forces.Pakistan’s delegation in Doha includes defence minister Khawaja Asif and intelligence chief general Asim Malik, while the Afghan side is led by defence minister Mohammad Yaqoob, the Taliban said.Violence erupted on October 11, just days after explosions in Kabul during a rare visit by Taliban foreign minister Amir Muttaqi to India.

Pakistan's field marshal Asim Munir has yet again engaged in anti-India rhetoric issuing veiled nuclear and economic threats while claiming that the ""misconceived"" immunity of India's geographic vastness will be shattered by the reach and lethality of their weapon systems.Speaking at the Pakistan military academy in Abbotabad (where Osama Bin Laden lived and was killed by the US) on Saturday, the rabble-rouser army chief threatened that a response far beyond the expectations of the initiators (India/Afghanistan) can be expected, if a fresh wave of hostilities is triggered.""With diminishing distinction between combat and communication zones, the reach and lethality of our weapon systems will shatter the misconceived immunity of India's geographic vastness,"" he added.He cautioned and advised the India's military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment.

""Afghan Taliban regime should rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan,” Munir added.Claiming the minerals and rare earth deposits in Balochistan would change Pakistan's future, he said, ""The treasures hidden beneath our land for decades have started to surface as a silver lining for our bright future.""","Pakistan's field marshal Asim Munir has yet again engaged in anti-India rhetoric.

What's happening?

Operation Sindoor and the Muridke connection





A state at war with itself





An imploding picture









“You can’t keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbours.”External affairs minister S Jaishankar issued a stern warning to Pakistan at the United Nations in 2022. Three years later, Pakistan is yet to mend its ways, and the warning rings truer than ever. Then, both leaders accused Pakistan of nurturing terror groups for strategic leverage. Now, the country is confronting the full consequences of that strategy.Pakistan is in turmoil at all fronts, and at the centre of the latest crisis lies Muridke - the same city India struck during Operation Sindoor , a swift 22-minute campaign that targeted terror hubs including Markaz Taiba, the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba.This week, Muridke is again in the spotlight as it turned volatile after Pakistan’s law enforcement cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP). The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.In a move dripping with irony, the provincial chief minister chaired what her office called an ""extraordinary"" meeting, ordering arrests of ""extremist leaders"" and seizure of assets linked to the same group once courted by the establishment.Over 2,700 people have been detained, and Section 144 has been imposed across Punjab, banning gatherings and protests.Mosques associated with the TLP have been sealed, its social media accounts suspended, and its top brass is being added to Pakistan’s Fourth Schedule—a list of individuals suspected of terrorism or sectarianism.Officials have also announced plans to recommend a federal ban on the party, freeze its assets, and prosecute its leaders under anti-terror laws. AI tools are being deployed to track wanted individuals.Authorities say the TLP’s so-called ""Gaza solidarity"" march to Islamabad had turned, as one official put it, ""bloody as always.""The timing and geography of the crackdown are significant. Muridke was among the nine key sites targeted during Operation Sindoor in May following the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.During the four-day campaign, the Indian Air Force destroyed at least six Pakistani fighter jets, two high-value surveillance aircraft, a C-130 transport plane, over ten drones, several cruise missiles, and radar installations.One of its central objectives was Markaz Taiba, Lashkar-e-Taiba’s nerve centre in Muridke — just 25 km from the International Border. The facility, built with donations reportedly including Rs 10 lakh from Osama bin Laden, trained the 26/11 Mumbai attackers.For decades, Pakistan’s national security doctrine rested on militant proxies—to gain ""strategic depth"" against India and influence over Afghanistan. That policy has now imploded.Islamabad is fighting multiple insurgencies at once - from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) in Balochistan, and even rogue Taliban factions across the Durand Line.According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), more than 2,400 security personnel have been killed in 2025 so far—the bloodiest year since 2015. The violence is now driven by what analysts call a ""Quad of Terror"": the TTP, Baloch insurgents, Islamic State–Khorasan (IS-K), and Taliban breakaway groups.Since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul, Pakistan’s western frontier has unravelled. The TTP, long sheltered in Afghanistan, now launches near-daily attacks. The BLA targets Chinese projects in Gwadar and convoys in Balochistan. Despite repeated military operations, the insurgency only appears to be deepening.Drone strikes, air raids, and mass arrests have failed to stem the violence. Meanwhile, reports of enforced disappearances, civilian casualties, and militarisation have eroded public trust, especially in Balochistan.The TLP ban, border tensions with Afghanistan, and the fallout of Operation Sindoor together expose a grim truth that India has warned of several times: Pakistan’s long experiment with extremism has backfired catastrophically.When Hillary Clinton stood beside then-foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, in 2011 and delivered the ""snakes in your backyard"" warning, it was a diplomatic metaphor. Today, it's Pakistan's reality.What began as a policy of control has spiralled into a crisis of survival. Pakistan's greatest threat is no longer at its borders: it's the legacy of its own choices.","Pakistan cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.

Fierce Border Clash Between Pakistan, Afghanistan Intensifies With Tanks, Shelling, High Casualties

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif on Friday said that his country can no longer maintain its past relations with Afghanistan, alleging, without evidence, that the Taliban leadership is ""sitting in India’s lap"" and warning of a ""heavy price"" for cross-border terrorism, signalling a public hardening of Islamabad’s stance toward a regime it once helped install.His comments came after at least six people, including two children, were killed and seven others injured in airstrikes conducted by Pakistan in Afghanistan’s southeastern Paktika province. The strikes reportedly violated a recent ceasefire agreement between the two countries. Media reports said that representatives from both sides are expected to meet in Doha, Qatar, to address the situation.""Pakistan can no longer afford to maintain relations with Kabul as it did in the past,"" Asif said in a social media post.""All Afghans residing on Pakistani soil must return to their homeland; they now have their own government/caliphate in Kabul... Our land and resources belong to 250 million Pakistanis,"" he added.""Self-respecting nations do not thrive on foreign land and resources,"" Asif said.He stated that despite Pakistan’s efforts and sacrifices over the past five years, Kabul has not responded positively. ""Pakistan issued 836 protest notes to the Afghan side and another 13 demarches,"" he said.Asif warned that Pakistan will now respond more strongly to acts of terrorism. ""There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,"" he said.He also alleged that Afghanistan has become a ""proxy of India"" and is working with New Delhi and the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) against Islamabad.""The rulers of Kabul, who are now sitting in India’s lap and conspiring against Pakistan, were once under our protection, hiding on our land,"" Asif said, without providing any evidence for his claim.Earlier this week, MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, while addressing the weekly press briefing, said that Pakistan is habituated in blaming its neighbours for its internal problems. ""On the developments that are happening on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, we are closely monitoring the situation three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbors for its own internal failures. And three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories. India remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan,"" he had said.The Pakistan defense minister reiterated that Pakistan is prepared to defend itself against any aggression from Afghanistan.Earlier this week, Asif said that Pakistan is ready to respond if the Afghan Taliban ""wish for war."" Speaking to Samaa TV, he said, ""Pakistan remains ready for any aggression; no one should harbour doubt.""Islamabad has repeatedly called on the Taliban government to ensure that Afghan territory is not used for cross-border attacks. Kabul has denied these claims, saying that Afghan soil is not being used against any neighbouring country.Tensions between the two nations have grown following repeated attacks by the TTP, allegedly launched from Afghan soil.

In the weeks leading up to the Pahalgam attack, Munir had stirred controversy by invoking the two-nation theory—the ideological foundation of Pakistan’s creation—urging citizens to inculcate in their children a sense of distinction from Hindus. He had further escalated tensions by describing Kashmir as Pakistan’s “jugular vein,” a phrase long associated with Islamabad’s territorial ambitions.Just days after the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed 26 lives, Munir reiterated his stance, declaring, ""The two-nation theory was based on the fundamental belief that Muslims and Hindus are two separate nations, not one.

Fierce Border Clash Between Pakistan, Afghanistan Intensifies With Tanks, Shelling, High Casualties





Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif said on Thursday that Islamabad was ready to hold talks with Afghanistan to resolve their conflict, as a temporary ceasefire that halted days of fierce fighting between the former allies largely held. The neighbouring nations engaged in ground fighting and Pakistan launched airstrikes across the contested frontier, killing dozens and wounding hundreds before agreeing to a 48-hour truce from 6.30pm on Wednesday.Sharif told his cabinet in Islamabad that Pakistan had “retaliated” as it ran out of patience with Afghanistan following a series of militant attacks. “If they want to talk on our valid conditions and want to resolve through dialogue we are ready for that,” Sharif said. “This message has been given to them yesterday. Now the ball is in their court. If this ceasefire is done just to buy time, we will not accept it.”There was no response to his remarks from Kabul.A statement from the Afghaninterior ministry said interior minister Khalifa Sirajuddin Haqqani met Iranian officials and told them that Afghanistan seeks good relations with all countries. “Just as we respect the sovereignty and dignity of others, we expect the same goodwill and respect toward us,” the statement quoted Haqqani as saying.At least 18 civilians were killed and more than 360 wounded in Afghanistan as a result of the fighting since Oct 10, the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan said.",Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif says Islamabad is ready to hold talks with Afghanistan to resolve their conflict.

A new kind of threat







An uneasy ceasefire may have paused six days of fierce fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan, but the name haunting Islamabad remains the same: Noor Wali Mehsud, the militant cleric Pakistan blames for bringing the country to the brink.As Reuters reported, Pakistani forces believed they had their moment last week when an airstrike in Kabul targeted an armoured Toyota Land Cruiser thought to be carrying Mehsud, leader of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). But the strike failed. Militants and Pakistani officials said he survived, and soon after, the group released an audio message purportedly from him, proof, perhaps, that the TTP chief had once again slipped through Pakistan’s grasp.The strike, Pakistan's first in Kabul since the 2022 US drone killing of Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, was followed by deadly clashes along the Afghan border. For nearly a week, both sides exchanged artillery and drone fire, killing dozens and injuring hundreds. As Associated Press reported, Taliban officials accused Islamabad of carrying out two drone strikes in Kabul just hours before the truce took effect, while the UN urged both sides to end hostilities.Behind Pakistan’s anger lies a deeper grievance: Mehsud’s continued sanctuary in Afghanistan. Islamabad has repeatedly accused Kabul’s Taliban rulers of harbouring him and his lieutenants, an allegation the Afghan Taliban deny.According to Reuters, Mehsud, a 47-year-old cleric trained in Pakistan’s seminaries, revived the TTP after years of disarray. When he took over in 2018, the group was fractured and on the run, its leaders killed in US drone strikes. But Mehsud, described by analysts as both “a strategist and an ideologue,” united splinter factions, reorganised command, and shifted tactics.Unlike his predecessors, Mehsud curtailed attacks on civilians, a deliberate move to regain sympathy in Pakistan’s tribal belt after the horror of the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, which killed over 130 children. He ordered fighters to focus instead on the army and police, portraying Pakistan’s military as “anti-Islam” and accusing its generals of “hijacking the people of Pakistan for 78 years.”Under his leadership, the TTP renewed its insurgency. The UN’s Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee lists him for “financing, planning, and perpetrating” terrorist acts, noting the group’s claims of deadly strikes on Pakistani security forces in North Waziristan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2019. As of late 2022, UN records placed Mehsud in Afghanistan’s Paktika province, near the border.Born in 1978 in South Waziristan’s Machikhel village, Mehsud studied at multiple Islamic seminaries across Pakistan before joining jihadist ranks. As detailed by the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), he fought alongside the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s, later joining the TTP in 2003. He rose quickly first as a judge in TTP’s shadow courts, then as its Karachi chief, and finally as deputy to Maulana Fazlullah before taking command in 2018.What distinguishes Mehsud from other militants is his intellectual bent. He is the author of several books, including Inqilab-e-Mehsud (The Mehsud Revolution), a 700-page account linking his movement to anti-colonial resistance. In it, he even claimed responsibility for orchestrating the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, saying she planned to ally with the U.S. against the mujahideen.Analysts describe him as both “a battlefield commander and a theorist.” He views Pakistan’s military operations against militants as a “defensive jihad” retaliation against what he portrays as the army’s betrayal of tribal traditions by handing over foreign fighters to the U.S. His stated goals: preserving Mehsud tribal autonomy, defeating America in Afghanistan, and establishing a Taliban-style Islamic system.Since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, Mehsud’s TTP has enjoyed renewed momentum. Pakistan claims the group has used Afghan soil to launch near-daily attacks, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Efforts at negotiation have failed. According to Reuters, the TTP’s demands implementing Islamic law in border regions and the army’s withdrawal were flatly rejected by Islamabad.The failed airstrike in Kabul has made Mehsud an even more defiant figure. His survival has not only embarrassed Pakistan’s military but also underscored the fragility of its ties with Kabul. For now, an uneasy truce holds, but the man once dismissed as a fugitive cleric has managed to force Pakistan into one of its deadliest border crises in decades, a testament to the enduring power of Noor Wali Mehsud, the scholar-commander who turned ideology into insurgency.","Noor Wali Mehsud is the leader of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) Pakistani forces believed they had their moment last week when an airstrike in Kabul targeted an armoured Toyota Land Cruiser.

Pakistan Seeks Trump’s Intervention After Afghan-Taliban Forces Humiliate Pak Army In Border Clash





Afghanistan’s Taliban government on Thursday claimed that Pakistan carried out two drone strikes on Kabul on Wednesday, even as the two neighbours declared a 48-hour ceasefire following days of deadly cross-border clashes that killed dozens and injured hundreds.The strikes, according to Taliban officials, targeted a civilian house and a market in Kabul, with hospital sources reporting at least five killed and dozens injured.Emergency, an Italian NGO running a surgical centre in the city, said patients suffered shrapnel wounds, burns, and blunt trauma.Khalid Zadran, spokesman for the Kabul police chief, confirmed the attacks but did not provide exact casualty figures, as per the news agency AP Earlier, Taliban chief spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid initially described the incident as an oil tanker explosion.Pakistani officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the strikes were aimed at militant hideouts, reported AP.Cross-border violence had escalated since October 10, with both Islamabad and Kabul accusing each other of harbouring militants.On Wednesday, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) reported at least 17 civilians killed and 346 injured in Spin Boldak on the Afghan side of the border, while noting further casualties in previous clashes.The UN urged both countries to “bring a lasting end to hostilities to protect civilians”.The temporary truce, which came into effect at 6 pm Islamabad time on Wednesday, was aimed at halting bloodshed and creating a window for dialogue.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said ‘the ball is in the Afghan Taliban's court"" and the extension of the ceasefire depends on Kabul’s response. “If in 48 hours they want to resolve the issues and address our genuine demands, then we are ready for them,” he said, reiterating that Afghan territory should not be used to plan attacks by Pakistani Taliban militants.According to the news agency AFP, Spin Boldak residents were observed returning home, and shops were reopening under the fragile truce, while municipal workers in Kabul were repairing roads and buildings damaged by the Wednesday blasts.Blasts had also caused overnight blackouts in parts of the city. Emergency’s country director, Dejan Panic, said, “We started receiving ambulances filled with wounded people… Ten are in critical condition.”The 2,611-kilometre-long Durand Line, which Afghanistan does not formally recognise, remains a flashpoint as Pakistan continues to combat attacks from the Tehreek-e-Taliban ( TTP ) and other armed groups operating along the border.Islamabad has repeatedly accused Kabul of providing safe havens to militants, a charge denied by the Taliban.","Taliban claims Pakistan carried out two drone strikes on Kabul on Wednesday.

'Had detailed discussions with Taliban foreign minister'







NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Thursday sharply criticised Pakistan over its recent hostilities with Afghanistan, while emphasising India’s commitment to Afghanistan’s sovereignty.Speaking on the tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""Three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbours for its own internal failures. Three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories. India remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan. ""In recent weeks, Pakistan has carried out targeted strikes in Kabul and other Taliban-controlled areas following a series of violent attacks by the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Pakistani territory.The Taliban government had then launched the offensive in ""retaliation for air strikes carried out by the Pakistani army on Kabul.""The Taliban had carried out operations along parts of the border with Pakistan, prompting Islamabad to promise a strong response.A 48-hour ceasefire between Afghanistan and Pakistan took hold late on Wednesday.The Pakistan Taliban operates independently of Afghanistan’s Taliban, but the two groups share ideological alignment. Pakistan has accused Kabul of giving shelter to TTP leaders and other groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the ISIL affiliate in Khorasan Province (ISKP).TTP attacks have increased sharply since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, reflecting a growing trend in violence.During Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi's recent visit to India, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had announced that India will upgrade its technical mission in Afghanistan to a full embassy.When asked about the development and India’s stand on recognising Afghanistan’s Taliban government, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “We had detailed discussions with foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi covering humanitarian aid, development cooperation, and upgrading our embassy. We donated 20 ambulances and plan further work in Afghanistan’s health sector. The transition of our technical mission in Kabul into a full embassy will take place in the coming days.

Can Pakistan sustain new approach?







The recent deadly clashes between Pakistan and the Taliban along their shared border signal a major shift in Islamabad's approach towards a group that it had hoped would become an ally in its larger fight against India.Far from becoming a partner, the Taliban has now emerged as the single-biggest threat to Pakistan's security.With Pakistan launching strikes inside Taliban-held Afghan territory and the Taliban responding with attacks on Pakistani outposts and armored tanks, analysts suggest that Pakistan is attempting to establish a 'new normal' in its dealings with the Taliban.This evolving posture strikingly echoes India's decisive stance against Pakistan following Operation Sindoor earlier this year.In the past few weeks, Pakistan has carried out targeted strikes in Kabul and other Taliban-controlled areas after a series of violent attacks by the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) on Pakistani territory.The Pakistan Taliban is independent of Afghanistan's Taliban, but the two groups are ideologically aligned.Islamabad blames Kabul for giving sanctuary to TTP leaders, as well as other groups such as the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and ISIL (ISIS) affiliate in Khorasan Province, or ISKP.TTP attacks have increased sharply since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, and numbers highlight the increasing trend.Data show that the TTP engaged in at least 600 attacks against, or clashes with, security forces in the past year alone. Its activity in 2025 so far already exceeds that seen in all of 2024.The Centre for Research and Security Studies, an Islamabad-based think tank, put the number of deaths of Pakistan's security personnel at more than 2,400 in the first three quarters of this year, which is on track to become the deadliest year in a decade.The recent strikes by Pakistan mark a departure from its often ambivalent or covert stance toward Taliban activities.By crossing into Afghan soil to target militants, Pakistan appears intent on sending a clear warning: any future terrorist operations originating from Afghanistan targeting Pakistan will provoke direct retaliatory action.This approach seeks to establish a new baseline in Pakistan-Taliban relations — a 'new normal' where Pakistan asserts its sovereignty and security interests proactively and visibly.But analysts are perplexed over Pakistan's ultimate goal with this new hardline approach.Are the strikes meant to push the Afghan Taliban into action against the TTP? or is there a bigger plan?After the weekend clashes, Pakistan - for the first time - also questioned the legitimacy of the Taliban government, even though Islamabad was the movement's chief patron for a quarter of a century.Pakistan demanded ""concrete and verifiable actions against these terrorist elements by the Taliban regime"".Significantly, it declared: ""We also hope that one day, the Afghan people would be emancipated, and they would be governed by a true representative government.""This was the first major hint that Pakistan might be open to the idea of throwing its support behind anti-Taliban groups if the current regime continues to ignore Pakistan's security concerns.This escalating dynamic between Pakistan and the Taliban bears remarkable similarities to the India-Pakistan situation earlier in 2025.In April, in response to a spate of terrorist attacks orchestrated by Pakistan-based groups, India launched Operation Sindoor. This was a surgical counter-terrorism campaign targeting terror camps across the Line of Control and deeper inside Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir.After the operation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made it clear that cross-border terrorism would no longer be tolerated, signaling a shift from reactive to proactive and offensive counterterrorism measures.""Terrorism must be crushed at its roots,"" PM Modi emphasised in key speeches following the operation. He highlighted that India would no longer remain complacent or defensive but take the fight to terrorist safe havens across the border.This was a stark departure from previous policies that relied primarily on defensive postures and diplomatic protests.PM Modi's approach sought to create a deterrence framework, warning Pakistan that continued use of terror proxies would only invite more severe repercussions. The impact was significant, forcing Islamabad to recalibrate its own counterterrorism and diplomacy strategies, even if publicly denying Indian claims.The Centre stressed that India would not hesitate to undertake ""pre-emptive"" action if future terrorist activities were launched from Pakistani soil. The message to Islamabad was unequivocal: Pakistan must dismantle terror infrastructure or face decisive consequences.This tough stance surprised many, including Pakistan, which protested vehemently against what it termed India’s ""cross-border aggression"". Yet PM Modi's approach has widely been seen as a game-changer in South Asian security dynamics, raising the bar for how states respond to terrorism.Analysts now speculate that Pakistan may be adopting a similar playbook in its handling of the Taliban.For years, Pakistan's official policy towards the Taliban was one of implicit support or cautious engagement, given their ideological affinities and shared interests to some extent.However, the recent strikes suggest Pakistan is recalibrating toward a more hardline posture that prioritises national security over ideological sympathies.One key motivation behind this could be Pakistan's desire to secure its western border more effectively after years of instability and violent spillovers.With the Taliban in power, Islamabad may see the need to assert dominance and clearly demarcate boundaries that opponents must not cross, even if it means direct military action inside Afghanistan.This mirrors India's move to push back decisively against terrorism and assert territorial and security integrity.If Pakistan truly adopts a stance akin to India's Operation Sindoor doctrine, the implications for regional security could be profound.It indicates a shift from proxy or indirect conflicts toward more direct and overt military engagements aimed at deterrence. This may result in a recalibrated security architecture where Pakistan no longer tolerates Taliban aggression emanating from Afghan territory, just as India refuses to tolerate terrorism from Pakistan.However, this approach also risks escalating tensions further. The border clashes have already resulted in casualties on both sides and threaten to spiral into a wider conflict if not managed carefully.Whether Pakistan can sustain this new posture against the Taliban depends on several factors.Domestically, it will require strong military and political consensus to justify cross-border actions that risk escalating conflict. There are also challenges in controlling non-state actors within its own borders who may have sympathies with the Taliban or other militant groups.Externally, Pakistan's relationship with the Taliban is complex, given their historic ties, shared ethnic Pashtun links, and mutual geopolitical interests, including countering Indian influence.Moving toward a policy of strikes and retribution involves recalibrating these relationships and could alienate influential factions within Pakistan’s security establishment.The ongoing clashes and Pakistan’s direct strikes raise critical questions about the trajectory of Pakistan-Taliban relations and broader Afghanistan stability. Will this 'new normal' lead to a more disciplined, deterrence-based approach to cross-border militancy? Or will it trigger cyclical escalation?","Recent deadly clashes between Pakistan and the Taliban along their shared border signal a major shift in Islamabad's approach towards a group that it had hoped would become an ally. Far from becoming a partner, the Taliban has now emerged as the single-biggest threat to Pakistan's security. Pakistan appears intent on sending a clear warning: any future terrorist operations from Afghanistan targeting Pakistan will provoke direct retaliatory action.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124601085,imgsize-988950,width-400,resizemode-4/a-pakistani-tank-captured-by-taliban-fighters-during-the-recent-border-clashes-photo-credit-ap.jpg"

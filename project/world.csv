"Thousands accessed sensitive White House info, floor plans under Biden and Trump admin: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/thousands-accessed-sensitive-white-house-info-floor-plans-under-biden-and-trump-admin-report/articleshow/120468746.cms,"More than 11,000 federal employees had access to sensitive documents, including White House floor plans and vendor banking information, due to a digital security lapse that spanned several years, according to a report by The Washington Post.The breach, which began during the administration of former President Joe Biden and also involved the current administration of President Donald Trump, involved at least 15 files stored in a Google Drive folder managed by the General Services Administration (GSA).Officials said the documents included potentially sensitive material such as proposed blast door designs for the White House Visitor Center and files marked as “controlled unclassified information” (CUI).The files were accessible to the entire GSA workforce — over 11,000 employees — and some were editable. The GSA has launched an internal investigation and a cybersecurity incident report is underway.The oversharing began in early 2021, during the tenure of former President Joe Biden, and continued until as recently as last week. Internal investigations and a cybersecurity incident report have since been launched.“This kind of mistake is a challenge across all administrations,” said Michael Williams, a Syracuse University professor who studies international security. “These are absolutely not documents you want shared with 11,200 people.”Although it’s unclear whether the East and West Wing floor plans were formally classified, experts say documents containing detailed layouts or embedded security infrastructure would normally be closely guarded. “Even if not formally classified, they would be restricted for obvious security reasons,” said Steven Aftergood, a former security policy analyst with the Federation of American Scientists.One of the earliest breaches occurred in March 2021 when a safety survey with East Wing blueprints was shared agency-wide. A similar incident followed involving the West Wing, which includes the Oval Office, Situation Room, and Cabinet Room. These files reportedly remained accessible for years.The GSA said it has protocols for detecting inappropriate file sharing, including automated scans and mandatory annual training. “Internal controls are not perfect,” a longtime employee told The Post. “But it’s not like we’re letting things happen unchecked.”Nine of the 15 files were marked as CUI — a designation for sensitive but unclassified material — and at least ten could be both viewed and edited by anyone within the agency. The breach included not only architectural blueprints but also courthouse layouts, project manuals, and financial records.The GSA’s Office of Inspector General uncovered the lapse during an audit of the agency’s Google Drive usage. The issue was flagged to the IT incident response team last Tuesday, and by Thursday, file-sharing permissions had been revoked. Investigators have so far been unable to reach the owners of the compromised files.According to WSJ, Neither the White House nor the GSA has issued a comment. A representative for former President Biden also declined to respond.This incident adds to a string of security missteps under both administrations. During President Trump’s tenure, officials mistakenly included The Atlantic's editor-in-chief in a group chat discussing military planning and used personal Gmail accounts for sensitive communication. In contrast, a 2023 special counsel report criticised former President Biden for storing classified notebooks at his residence.Meanwhile, a separate controversy is unfolding at the Pentagon. US defense secretary Pete Hegseth is under scrutiny for allegedly sharing classified airstrike plans in a private Signal group that included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer, according to The New York Times.The chat reportedly contained flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets involved in US operations in Yemen. Unlike a previous leak in March — where a journalist was mistakenly added — the Signal group was reportedly created by Hegseth himself.This is the second time Hegseth has been accused of mishandling classified military information. The Pentagon inspector general is now investigating both incidents. Those in the Signal group reportedly include Hegseth’s wife Jennifer, a former Fox News producer; his brother Phil; and his personal lawyer Tim Parlatore.","The breach involved at least 15 files stored in a Google Drive folder managed by the General Services Administration.

Gunmen launched a violent attack on a Chinese-owned hydroelectric power plant under construction in southern Chile on Sunday, setting fire to dozens of vehicles and construction equipment.The targeted facility, the Rucalhue power plant , is being built by Rucalhue Energia Spa, a subsidiary of China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE), with a projected investment of $350 million. It is located along the Biobio River, about 550 kilometers (340 miles) south of Santiago.According to police chief Renzo Miccono, the armed attackers threatened security personnel before setting fire to the site. ""They proceeded to burn all the equipment there was at the site,"" he said.The assault led to the destruction of 45 trucks and five pieces of earth-moving machinery. Two security guards were injured during the incident.The comes amid the ongoing opposition from Indigenous communities that the project is facing. Critics have raised concerns about its environmental impact on one of Chile’s major waterways.Chile's Security Minister Luis Cordero described the attack as having ""a terrorist nature"" due to its location and planning.Rucalhue Energia Spa said it is currently evaluating the financial losses from the destruction.","The Rucalhue power plant is being built by a subsidiary of China International Water and Electric Corporation.

: Backing Trump’s Territorial Ambition

Clashing with China: Peasants comment sparks outrage

The Cheney comparison—and 2028 ambitions

The unconventional vice president

JD Vance has taken on the traditionally subdued role of US Vice President with an unusually aggressive posture, stepping far beyond the ceremonial expectations of the office in his first 100 days. At just 40, the former Ohio senator has inserted himself into world affairs in ways few of his predecessors dared, quickly becoming the public face of President Donald Trump's most controversial foreign policy stances.“Vance is unfailingly loyal to the president, knows not to overshadow the boss, and acts as an attack dog,” said Matt Dallek, a professor of political management at George Washington University. “But he also makes in-your-face comments that represent something of a departure from his predecessors.”Vance’s global profile exploded in February when he confronted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. As tensions simmered over continued US aid to Ukraine , Vance accused Zelensky of being ungrateful.“Have you said ‘thank you’ once, this entire meeting?” Vance demanded, calling the Ukrainian leader “disrespectful.” The moment quickly escalated as President Trump joined in, berating Zelensky in front of reporters.Vance later denied that the exchange was part of any coordinated plan to play “bad cop,” but the spectacle cemented his position as Trump's ideological bulldog on foreign policy.Since taking office, there has been speculation over which version of Vance would show up in Washington. Was he the Appalachian chronicler of Hillbilly Elegy, the Marine Corps veteran, the Yale Law School graduate, the Catholic convert, or the Silicon Valley investor?At one point, he was also a staunch Trump critic, comparing the former president to Adolf Hitler. But since entering politics, Vance has undergone a sharp transformation, aligning himself completely with Trump’s agenda and presenting himself as the ultimate MAGA loyalist.Vance’s first major foreign appearance came at the Munich Security Conference , where he delivered a strident address targeting what he described as Europe's ""woke"" culture and overreliance on US defense.“There’s a new sheriff in town,” he told startled allies, signaling that America’s foreign policy would now take a more confrontational and transactional turn under the second Trump administration .In a moment that revealed more than intended, a journalist was accidentally added to a Signal group chat discussing US airstrikes on Yemen’s Huthi rebels. In the conversation, Vance lamented, “I just hate bailing out Europe again,” criticizing US military involvement that he argued disproportionately benefits the EU.The leak, dubbed “Signalgate,” showed the vice president’s skepticism of traditional alliances and his preference for a nationalist, America-first approach.Adding fuel to another long-standing Trump fascination, Vance visited Greenland to lend credence to the president's renewed interest in purchasing the Danish-ruled territory. The trip was condemned as provocative by Denmark and NATO officials, but Vance defended it unapologetically.“We can’t just ignore the president’s desires,” he said during the trip, framing the visit as a gesture of loyalty to Trump’s geopolitical instincts.His wife, Usha Vance, made a rare public appearance during the visit, offering a glimpse into the personal toll of Vance’s high-profile role. “It’s a very lonely, lonely world,” she admitted in an interview, reflecting on the pressure and isolation that comes with the job.Vance has also drawn fire from Beijing for controversial comments about America’s debt dependence. In a speech, he claimed the US was “borrowing money from Chinese peasants,” a remark that triggered an official rebuke from China’s Foreign Ministry.Comparisons between Vance and former Vice President Dick Cheney are increasingly common. Like Cheney, who shaped George W. Bush’s foreign policy and championed the Iraq War, Vance is viewed as a central player in the Trump administration’s international strategy—particularly in pushing back against aid to Ukraine and resisting new US military engagements.Speculation is already swirling about Vance’s political future. He has not ruled out a 2028 presidential run but insists he would only move forward after consulting Trump.Trump, however, hasn’t endorsed the idea. “No,” the president told Fox News’s Bret Baier in February when asked if Vance was his chosen successor. “But he’s very capable.”In just three months, JD Vance has proven he is no placeholder. From confrontations with world leaders to unapologetic defenses of Trump’s most polarizing ideas, Vance is not only redefining the role of vice president—he’s auditioning for something bigger.Whether the world is ready for that remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: JD Vance is not here to wait in the wings.","JD Vance has taken on the traditionally subdued role of US Vice President with an unusually aggressive posture.

Among the listed tactics were currency manipulation , government subsidies, counterfeiting, and transshipping to evade tariffs.The post comes shortly after Trump announced a 90-day suspension of reciprocal tariffs for most US trade allies—excluding China. Speaking to reporters last Thursday in the Oval Office, Trump said discussions with Beijing were ongoing. “Yeah, we're talking to China. I would say they have reached out a number of times,” he said.The 78-year-old has long criticised what he describes as imbalanced trade policies.

They take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and drop it on the hood of the car,” Trump said. “If the hood dents, the car doesn’t qualify.

Ada, Oklahoma Hit By Another Tornado

Easter Sunday turned tragic for many communities in Texas and Oklahoma as a slow-moving storm system brought tornadoes, heavy rain, and large hail. Three people died, including a woman and a 12-year-old boy whose car was swept away in floodwaters in Moore, Oklahoma. Another person was killed in Spaulding when a tornado hit the rural town and destroyed several homes, reported Associated Press.The national weather service reported 17 tornado events on Saturday, five of which were confirmed in south-central Oklahoma. Some of the tornadoes were classified as EF1, with wind speeds reaching up to 177 km/h.One small town, still recovering from a tornado in March, was hit again. In Ada, a town of about 16,000 people, roofs were torn off buildings, windows shattered, and trees uprooted.In Marshall County, emergency crews said a tornado travelled over 10 kilometres, damaging at least 20 homes. Some were completely destroyed. No injuries were reported in that area.The city of Moore, with around 63,000 residents, experienced what police called a “historic weather event”. Dozens of high-water incidents were reported. Emergency services were stretched thin as they responded to stranded vehicles and rising floodwaters.In Texas, tornadoes in Parker County damaged several homes. Photos on social media showed roofs ripped off and debris scattered across properties.As the storm moved northeast on Sunday, the threat shifted to Arkansas, Missouri, and parts of the Midwest. Thousands in Missouri lost power. Forecasters warned that more rain is expected in the plains this week, raising fears of further flooding due to already saturated ground and swollen streams.","A slow-moving storm system brought tornadoes, heavy rain, and large hail.

Japan may ease auto rules

United States president Donald Trump on Easter Sunday listed on social media eight examples of what he called "" non-tariff cheating "". Among them was the familiar Japanese “bowling ball test,” which he claims is used to reject American-made cars.The unusual claim first came up in 2018. “It’s the bowling ball test,” Trump said at that time. “They take a bowling ball from 20 feet in the air and drop it on the hood. If it dents, the car doesn’t qualify. It's horrible,” he said, writes MSNBC.At the time, White House officials dismissed it as a joke. However, reports later revealed that Trump had repeatedly mentioned the test in private meetings.The origin remains unclear, but one theory links it to a Nissan advertisement that showed bowling balls hitting a car’s surface.Though Japan has used regulatory barriers in the past, there is no evidence of a real “bowling ball test.”The recent post comes as Japan considers relaxing import safety rules to ease ongoing trade friction. According to Nikkei Asia, Tokyo may soften crash test requirements as a way to reduce trade tensions with Washington.Differences in safety standards between the two countries have long created trade friction. As part of the now-defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Japan had agreed to lower some import restrictions. Trump withdrew from the deal in 2017, shortly after taking office.","Donald Trump listed eight examples of what he called "" non-tariff cheating"" Among them was the familiar Japanese “bowling ball test,” which he claims is used to reject American-made cars.

Poll How do you feel about the hate calls received by Imran Chaudhary? It's part of public discourse. It's unacceptable.

Imran Chaudhary , a property developer in Texas, has alleged receiving hate calls almost daily over a proposed housing and community project. The threats escalated after his team revealed early plans for a new community development in East Texas, reported news agency AFP.The proposal includes 1,000 homes, a hospital, a community centre, and a place of worship. The project is meant to serve a growing population near East Plano.But opponents, including Republican lawmakers, are not convinced. Senator John Cornyn claimed the site may violate the rights of Jewish and Christian Texans. Governor Greg Abbott went further, calling it an attempt to bring in Sharia law. “To be clear, Sharia law is not allowed in Texas,” Abbott wrote on social media.Texas has laws that reject the use of foreign legal systems like Sharia.Chaudhary said the development is not for a specific community. “Anybody can use our services,” he told AFP. He said all legal guidelines are being followed, and even invited Abbott to a barbeque to ease tensions — but got no reply.The EPIC community, which began in Plano 20 years ago, says the new land near Josephine is simply a much-needed expansion.Still, protests and social media misinformation have slowed down the approval process. At a recent town hall, critics voiced fears about the nature of the project. Chaudhary and his team say they remain committed, but worry about rising hostility.","Property developer Imran Chaudhary has alleged receiving hate calls almost daily over a proposed housing and community project.

Teen Activist Jailed in Russia for Anti-War Graffiti & Poetry | Darya Kozyreva Sentenced | News9

Who is Darya Kozyreva?

The 19-year-old Kozyreva from St Petersburg, Russia.

She was first detained in 2022 for anti-war graffiti while still in school.

Koxyreva was expelled from university in 2023 for a critical social media post.

In August 2024, a second case was filed against Kozyreva. This followed an interview with Radio Free Europe in which she openly called the war in Ukraine “monstrous” and “criminal.”

(This is a top Google Trends topic)

A court in St Petersburg has sentenced 19-year-old Darya Kozyreva to two years and eight months in a penal colony after she was accused of repeatedly discrediting the Russian military. The decision came after she pasted a verse from a well-known Ukrainian poem onto a statue of the poet Taras Shevchenko.The poem, titled My Testament, included a call to “break your heavy chains” and “water with the tyrants’ blood. The freedom you have gained.” Authorities viewed this as a political act aimed at criticising the Russian state.Rights groups including Memorial and Amnesty International have called her a political prisoner. They argue that her punishment is meant to suppress any anti-war expression, especially among young people. Her lawyer has said they are likely to appeal the verdict.Meanwhile, Reuters shared video of Kozyreva smiling and waving to supporters as she left the courtroom — a moment of defiance amid growing pressure on Russia’s youth to remain silent.","Darya Kozyreva, 19, was sentenced to two years and eight months in a penal colony.

Trump To Fire Pentagon Boss? Hegseth LEAKS Houthi Attack Details To Wife, Brother | Report

10 things to know about Hegseth's Signal chat leaks:

The chat group, named ""Defense | Team Huddle,"" included 13 participants: Hegseth, his wife Jennifer, his brother Phil, and his personal lawyer.

Sensitive information shared in the chat included warplane launch times and strike packages related to the March airstrike on Yemen's Houthi militants.

The chat was conducted on Hegseth's personal device, not a government-issued one, raising further security concerns.

The earlier incident prompted internal upheaval within the Pentagon, with several top officials resigning or being placed on leave amid the ongoing probe.

The use of Signal for discussing sensitive military operations contravenes Pentagon regulations, which prohibit the transmission of non-public Department of Defense information via unauthorized apps.

The earlier Signal chat that which was revealed by the Atlantic's Jeffery Goldberg, was titled ""Houthi PC small group,"" included top officials like Vice President JD Vance.

The leaks included military plans involving the Panama Canal, Red Sea deployments, and suspended intelligence-sharing with Ukraine.

Journalist Jeffrey Goldberg was mistakenly added to the encrypted Signal chat, giving him direct access to classified discussions.

Dan Caldwell was removed from the Pentagon after being suspended over leaks of sensitive defence information.

Darin Selnick, another senior Trump official, was also placed on administrative leave and escorted out.

US defence secretary Pete Hegseth has once again found himself in the eye of a political storm following revelations that he shared sensitive military details about a March airstrike on Yemen’s Houthi militants in a private Signal chat with his wife, brother, and personal lawyer.The group, dubbed ""Defense | Team Huddle,"" comprised 13 individuals, including Hegseth's wife Jennifer, a former Fox News producer, and his brother Phil, a Department of Homeland Security liaison at the Pentagon,The chat reportedly contained specific information such as warplane launch times and strike packages, raising serious concerns about the handling of classified materials.This disclosure follows an earlier incident where Hegseth shared similar sensitive information in another Signal chat that included top Trump administration officials and, mistakenly, a journalist. The Atlantic published the contents of that chat, revealing detailed operational plans for the Yemen strike, which experts assert would typically be classified at the highest levels. Hegseth had denied any wrongdoing, saying, ""Nobody was texting war plans,"" and attributing the reports to media bias.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt had described the Signal messaging thread as “a policy discussion, a sensitive policy discussion among high level cabinet officials and senior staff.” Defending the Secretary of Defense, she asked, “Do you trust the secretary of defense who was nominated for this role, voted by the United States Senate into this role, who has served in combat, honourably served our nation in uniform or do you trust Jeffrey Goldberg?”When questioned about the thread, Trump distanced himself, saying he’s “not sure” whether the information shared was classified: “Well, that’s what I’ve heard. I don’t know. I’m not sure, you have to ask the various people involved.” Trump added that Waltz had taken responsibility for the error, but dismissed Hegseth’s involvement: “How do you bring Hegseth into it? He had nothing to do with it.”The White House stated Trump had seen Hegseth’s texts. “It’s all a witch-hunt,” Trump said. While the National Security Council confirmed the thread’s authenticity, Leavitt posted: “The Atlantic has conceded: these were NOT ‘war plans.’”","US defence secretary Pete Hegseth shared sensitive military details about a March airstrike on Yemen’s Houthi militants in a private Signal chat with his wife, brother, and personal lawyer.

"Houthi-controlled areas hit by US airstrikes, 12 killed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/houthi-controlled-areas-hit-by-us-airstrikes-12-killed/articleshow/120469163.cms,"US airstrikes on Yemen ’s capital, Sanaa , killed 12 people and wounded 30 others, the Houthi rebels said on Monday. The attacks reportedly hit a market in the Furwah neighborhood of the Shuub district, an area previously targeted by American forces. Other regions across the country were also struck overnight.These strikes come just days after a US attack on the Ras Isa fuel port killed at least 74 people and injured 171. The recent wave of airstrikes follows renewed talks in Rome between the US and Iran over Tehran’s advancing nuclear program, something Washington has linked to Houthi actions in the region.The US is targeting the Houthis due to their repeated attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea, a critical global trade route, and their threats against Israel. The group, aligned with Iran and calling itself part of the “Axis of Resistance,” is the only one among Iran backed groups still capable of striking Israel.The new campaign, launched under President Donald Trump, appears more aggressive than actions taken under President Joe Biden. It began after the Houthis warned they would resume targeting ships linked to Israel in response to the blockade of aid to Gaza.Between November 2023 and January 2024, the Houthis attacked over 100 commercial vessels using drones and missiles, sinking two ships and killing four sailors. Their campaign has severely disrupted Red Sea shipping , which normally sees about $1 trillion in goods pass through annually with 12 percent of global shipping traffic normally passesThe US military has released little information about the strikes, and the Houthis tightly control access to affected areas, making it difficult to verify the full impact. Many of the strikes are believed to have hit military and security targets.According to Houthi media, recent US airstrikes also hit Kamaran Island, Marib governorate, and the Attan area of Sanaa, under rebel control since 2014. A sanitation facility in Asir and a busy market in Shoub were among the locations struck.Since March, over 200 people have reportedly been killed in US airstrikes. The US claims the offensive aims to halt Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping lanes.The Houthis temporarily paused their attacks during a two-month ceasefire in Gaza but resumed them after Israel restarted its military operations. Known formally as Ansar Allah, the Houthis emerged in the 1990s and gained power in 2014 when they took control of Sanaa and forced President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee the country.","The attacks reportedly hit a market in the Furwah neighborhood of the Shuub district.

According to Superintendent Richard Sullivan, the gunfire appeared to target a specific individual, though no injuries were reported.

"Trump raised $239 million for inauguration, more than doubling his own record",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-raised-239-million-for-inauguration-more-than-doubling-his-own-record/articleshow/120468373.cms,"President Donald Trump raised $239 million for his inauguration festivities in January, a norm-shattering amount fueled by corporate America's desire to curry favor with a famously transactional president.The total, disclosed in a filing with the Federal Election Commission on Sunday, is more than double the previous record of $107 million set by Trump's inaugural committee in 2017. About 140 different people or companies gave at least $1 million to the effort, including blue-chip companies like JPMorgan Chase, Delta Air Lines and Target.The committee, known formally as the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, is required by federal law to report the names of donors and the dollar amounts for contributions over $200 to the FEC no more than 90 days after the Jan. 20 ceremony. It is not required to report how it spent the money.Many of the donations to Trump's inauguration were previously announced -- such as $1 million each from tech giants like Meta and Amazon -- in part because companies wanted it known widely that they were backing Trump's formal return to power. But the report revealed a few names not well-publicized, including several friends of Elon Musk, such as tech investors like John Hering, Ken Howery and Keith Rabois, who each gave $1 million. (Neither Musk, a top presidential adviser, nor any of his companies donated.)The three largest contributions came from a poultry producer, Pilgrim's, which donated $5 million; a crypto company, Ripple Inc., which donated just under that; and Warren Stephens, a Republican donor who gave $4 million on the same day, Dec. 2, that Trump named him as his pick to be ambassador to Britain.Inaugurations, even with several days of elaborate dinners and other events, have never cost anything near roughly a quarter-billion dollars, and the amount raised by the committee will resurface questions about where any leftover funds might go. The committee has not said how much money it has spent, but the president's allies have said that the remaining amount will be funneled to other Trump-sponsored projects, primarily a nonprofit organization that will build his presidential library.Contributions to inaugural festivities have long been used by corporate interests to cultivate allies in an incoming administration, but the amount raised by Trump is exceedingly high by historical standards. George W. Bush, for instance, collected $30 million in 2001 (roughly $55 million in today's dollars). Four years ago, Joe Biden collected $62 million (nearly $76 million in 2025 dollars) for his inauguration, though that celebration was pared down because of the coronavirus pandemic.Trump's total in 2017 was twice as much as any president-elect had ever raised for an inauguration. The $346 million raised by his two inaugural committees is more than the nominal amount raised by all other inaugural committees combined since Richard Nixon's $4 million in 1973.The haul this year by Trump's inaugural committee was so large that some seven-figure donors were not guaranteed access to premier events because those functions were full. Trump's committee accepted a total of roughly $245 million, but issued about $6 million in refunds, including a $50,000 check from the Miss Universe Organization, which Trump used to own.","The total is more than double the previous record of $107 million set by Trump's inaugural committee in 2017.

Two days before their planned visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories, 27 French lawmakers and local officials were informed on Sunday that their entry visas had been revoked.The group, which included members of France's left-wing ecologist and communist parties, said the trip was meant to promote international cooperation and peace, reported news agency AFP.The French consulate in Jerusalem had invited the lawmakers for a five-day official programme. However, Israel’s interior ministry cancelled their visas under a law that allows authorities to bar individuals considered a threat to national interests.Among those banned were national assembly deputies Francois Ruffin, Alexis Corbiere, Julie Ozenne, communist deputy Soumya Bourouaha, and senator Marianne Margate. Other participants included mayors and local elected officials. In a joint statement, they described the move as “collective punishment” and a “major rupture in diplomatic ties.”They urged French president Macron to respond and ensure Israel reversed its decision. The lawmakers also noted that their political parties have long supported Palestinian statehood, which Macron recently appeared to support. He said France may recognise a Palestinian state as early as June during an international summit.This is not an isolated incident. Earlier this month, Israel deported two British MPs at Tel Aviv airport. In February, two left-wing European parliament members were also barred.

Both will then start to do big business with the United States of America, which is thriving, and make a big fortune!"" Trump posted to his Truth Social network.However, he did not share details of any progress in peace talks Washington has sought to push forward between Moscow and Kyiv, since he took over from Joe Biden in January.The US president's Truth Social post comes just days after his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, warned that Washington could ""move on"" from its push to broker an agreement to end the conflict, which began in February 2022.""We need to figure out here now within a matter of days whether this is doable in the short term, because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on,"" Rubio said on Friday in Paris, after high-level discussions with European and Ukrainian leaders.“We're not going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end. So we need to determine very quickly now, and I'm talking about a matter of days whether or not this is doable in the next few weeks. If it is, we're in. If it's not, then we have other priorities to focus on as well,” he added.Efforts by both Rubio and Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff have included multiple rounds of negotiations in Saudi Arabia and at least three meetings between Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Poll Should the federal government halt the canal project in response to protests? No, it should continue Yes, it should be halted

A Pakistani Hindu state minister was attacked with tomatoes and potatoes in Sindh on Saturday by protesters opposing the federal government’s proposed canal projects, which critics say will reduce the province’s share of irrigation water.Kheal Das Kohistani , state minister for religious affairs in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, was targeted by a group of demonstrators in Thatta district, however, he remained unharmed.The attack, which took place amid rising tensions over the Green Pakistan Initiative , drew swift condemnation from both federal and provincial authorities. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif termed the assault on Kohistani “unacceptable” and assured of “a thorough investigation” into the incident. “The attack on the public representatives is unacceptable. The persons involved in the incident would be given exemplary punishment,” he said.Federal information minister Atta Tarar also called it “an attack” and sought a report from the Sindh Inspector General of Police and the federal interior secretary.Sindh chief minister Syed Murad Ali Shah issued a stern warning against taking the law into one’s own hands and instructed Hyderabad’s deputy inspector general to arrest the culprits immediately.Kohistani, a member of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), hails from Sindh’s Jamshoro district and was first elected to parliament in 2018. He returned to the National Assembly in 2024 and was later appointed as a state minister.The protestors chanted slogans against the PML-N-led federal government, accusing it of threatening Sindh’s agricultural livelihood by backing controversial canal projects in Punjab under the Green Pakistan Initiative.The plan, supported by the federal government, Punjab authorities and the military, includes the construction of six new canals to irrigate Cholistan. Opponents argue it will cut downriver water flow to Sindh, worsening irrigation issues in the province.Political tensions flared further after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari issued a strong warning to the PML-N at a rally in Hyderabad. He said the PPP would withdraw support from the federal government if the canal plan wasn’t shelved.In response, PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif directed the federal government to initiate talks with the PPP to resolve the dispute amicably.Rana Sanaullah, a senior PML-N leader and adviser to the prime minister, later stated, “Politics should not be played over the issue of water. Matters must be resolved through dialogue.” He reiterated that the 1991 Water Accord and 1992 IRSA Act protect inter-provincial water rights.","Kheal Das Kohistani, state minister for religious affairs in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, was targeted by a group of demonstrators in Thatta district.

"‘No right to appeal for Kulbhushan Jadhav’: ICJ only granted consular access, Pakistan SC told",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-right-to-appeal-for-kulbhushan-jadhav-icj-only-granted-consular-access-pakistan-sc-told/articleshow/120450503.cms,"Poll Do you believe Kulbhushan Jadhav should have the right to appeal his conviction? No, the conviction should stand Yes, he deserves an appeal

The Pakistani Supreme Court was told on Wednesday that Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav was never granted the right to appeal his conviction because the 2019 ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) only required consular access , not a legal right to challenge his sentence, the Dawn reported.Pak defence ministry counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed, appearing before a seven-judge constitutional bench, said the ICJ ruling did not obligate Pakistan to provide Jadhav, who was convicted of espionage and terrorism, with an automatic right to appeal. “The ICJ verdict addressed only the consular access issue under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention. It never directed Pakistan to extend appeal rights,” he told the court.The bench is currently hearing 38 intra-court appeals, including from the federal and provincial governments, against the Supreme Court’s October 2023 judgment that struck down military trials for civilians involved in the May 9 riots.Responding to criticism that Pakistani citizens convicted by military courts after the May 9 violence are not being given the same appeal options as Jadhav, Haris argued that Pakistan’s 2021 ICJ (Review and Re-consideration) Act was a “unique jurisdiction” created specifically for compliance with the ICJ ruling, not a general legal provision.The Dawn reported Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar pointed out that the ICJ law stemmed from earlier Pakistani court rulings like the 2017 Said Zaman Khan case, which had expanded the rights of the accused. Justice Musarrat Hilali added that the Said Zaman ruling, initially contested by the government, was eventually cited in Pakistan’s defence before the ICJ.The case of Jadhav, a former Indian Navy officer, remains one of the most high-profile legal controversies between India and Pakistan. Captured in Balochistan in 2016, Jadhav was sentenced to death by a military court in 2017. India moved the ICJ, which ordered Pakistan to grant him consular access but stopped short of overturning the conviction.Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan is expected to weigh in on whether Pakistani civilians tried in military courts post-May 9 should be allowed to appeal, a decision that could have broader implications for the ongoing constitutional debate.Justice Jamal Mandokhail pressed the government on whether military court proceedings can begin without filing a formal FIR. The counsel replied that under Section 157 of the Pakistan Army Act, a court of inquiry can initiate proceedings and no FIR is needed.","Pakistani Supreme Court told Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav was never granted the right to appeal his conviction.

Poll Do you support Pakistan's recent deportation of Afghan refugees? No, it harms vulnerable families. Yes, it's necessary for national security.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar met Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul on Saturday to mend frayed bilateral ties strained by security concerns and the contentious repatriation of Afghan refugees.The high-level talks, which included meeting with Afghan interim prime minister Mullah Muhammad Hassan Akhund and other officials, focused on trade, security and people-to-people ties, but the shadow of Pakistan’s intensified deportation drive loomed large, particularly for low-income Afghans facing upheaval.The visit, described by Pakistan’s foreign office as a “reflection of commitment to enhance sustained engagement”, follows a recent Pak-Afghan joint coordination committee meeting in Kabul.

Ahmadiyya minority beaten to death by anti-blasphemy group in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/ahmadiyya-minority-beaten-to-death-by-anti-blasphemy-group-in-pakistan/articleshow/120412129.cms,"A member of Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya community was beaten to death on Friday after a mob of radical surrounded an Ahmadi place of worship in Karachi’s Saddar neighbourhood.The crowd, having many from the anti blasphemy political groupTehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), forced their way through narrow streets chanting anti-Ahmadi slogans before surrounding the colonial-era worship site. Tensions quickly escalated when the group accused the minority community of violating Pakistan’s controversial anti-Ahmadi laws.“One member of the community was killed after the mob identified him as an Ahmadi,” said Muhammad Safdar, a senior police official in Karachi.“They attacked him with sticks and bricks.”Police said members of several religious parties were part of the mob. To protect others from further violence, officers took around 25 Ahmadis into custody and moved them away in a police-escorted van after negotiating with the crowd, which had swelled to around 600 people.The Ahmadiyya community, considered heretical by Pakistan’s state and many religious groups, has long faced systemic discrimination. Ahmadis, who have a population of almost 10 million worldwide, consider themselves Muslims and have faith identical to mainstream Islam in almost every manner. Though they regard themselves as Muslim, a 1974 constitutional amendment declared them non-Muslim, and a 1984 ordinance criminalised many of their religious practices.Friday’s killing is the latest in a long history of persecution. According to community records, six Ahmadis have been killed in 2024 so far, with over 280 killed since 1984. Thousands more have faced criminal charges, including hundreds under Pakistan’s harsh blasphemy laws.Abdul Qadir Ashrafi, a 52-year-old businessman who took part in the protest, said the group’s intention was to pressure police to act against the Ahmadis.“We requested that the place be sealed and that those conducting the Friday prayers be arrested, with criminal proceedings initiated against them,” he told AFP.The human rights commission of Pakistan condemned the attack, saying it was ""appalled by the orchestrated attack by a far-right religious party on a colonial-era Ahmadi place of worship.""“This failure of law and order is a stark reminder of the continued complicity of the state in the systematic persecution of a beleaguered community,” the commission posted on social media platform X.Mob violence has become an all-too-common response to accusations of blasphemy in Pakistan, often with deadly consequences. In a similar incident last year, dozens of churches were torched in the city of Jaranwala after a Christian man was falsely accused of blasphemy.","A member of Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya community was beaten to death on Friday after a mob of radical surrounded an Ahmadi place of worship in Karachi.

Baloch separatists kill 8 Pakistanis in Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/baloch-separatists-kill-8-pakistanis-in-iran/articleshow/120262403.cms,"ISLAMABAD:

Eight Pakistani car mechanics were shot dead in Iran late Saturday, sparking outrage and deepening fears that the country was becoming a hub for anti-Pakistan militants after Afghanistan.Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack in Sistan-Baluchestan province, escalating tensions between the neighbouring countries as Pakistan demanded swift action. The eight workers hailed from Punjab -- Pakistan’s most populous province -- and were killed at a workshop in Mehrestan district, near Afghanistan’s border, Pakistani authorities said.BNA framed the killings as retaliation against perceived Punjabi dominance in Balochistan’s economic and political spheres. “We will not allow outsiders to exploit our land and resources,” BNA said in an online statement, echoing long-standing Baloch grievances over resource exploitation and marginalisation. The outfit has aligned itself with the broader Baloch insurgency led by groups like Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif called the attack “barbaric”. “We demand the perpetrators be brought to justice swiftly,” he said, urging Tehran to act. Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to help the victims’ families and repatriate the bodies. Foreign minister Ishaq Dar issued a similar condemnation. “This attack challenges our sovereignty. We cannot allow our citizens to be targeted abroad,” Dar said.Iran’s response was measured but conspicuously vague. Ambassador Reza Amiri Moghadam condemned the killings as “inhumane and cowardly”, calling terrorism a “chronic plight” that demands regional cooperation. Yet, Tehran offered no concrete assurances of cracking down on groups like BNA, prompting scepticism in Islamabad.Thousands of Pakistanis, particularly from economically deprived areas, travel to Iran on a regular basis to take up informal jobs in sectors such as vehicle repairs, construction, and agriculture.In Jan 2024, nine Pakistani labourers were killed and three critically injured in a similar attack in Saravancity, also located in Iran’s southeastern border region. Like in the latest killings, the victims in that case worked in an automobile repair shop. These murders occurred at a time when Pakistan and Iran were attempting to repair diplomatic relations after tit-for-tat missile and drone attacks.","Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack.

Poll Do you believe that Pakistan is adequately prepared for earthquakes? No Yes

A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.Tremors were felt across many parts of the Valley, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or property damage. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometres, with coordinates of 33.63 degrees North latitude and 72.46 degrees East longitude.According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the recent earthquake struck at a shallow depth of 10km, increasing the likelihood of aftershocks.Shallow earthquakes are typically more dangerous than deeper ones because the seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface, causing stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and higher casualties.Pakistan, located on the boundary of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, is one of the most seismically active countries. The nation frequently experiences destructive earthquakes due to its position on major fault lines. Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and Gilgit-Baltistan lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir are on the north-western edge of the Indian plate. The collision of these plates makes the region highly susceptible to violent earthquakes.Earlier, Pakistan’s neighbor Tajikistan was also jolted by a 4.2 magnitude earthquake.","A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.

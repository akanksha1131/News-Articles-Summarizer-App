Tariff-hit BRICS Nation Leader Shames Trump’s Naval Buildup In US Backyard | ‘Using Force Illegally’





Hours before a US federal appeals court declared most of President Donald Trump’s global tariffs illegal, rejecting his use of emergency powers to impose duties, his cabinet secretaries filed statements in court, warning of serious implications of ruling on US foreign policy, and leaving Washington red faced diplomatically, reported Bloomberg.The ruling by the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington, DC, said the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize a president to levy tariffs. “The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,” the judges said.The decision invalidates Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs announced in April and another set imposed in February on China, Canada and Mexico. It does not affect tariffs issued under other legal authorities, such as those on steel and aluminum imports.The court’s ruling came just hours after urgent statements filed by multiple members of Trump’s cabinet urging judges to delay any decision until the US Supreme Court rules.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent warned of “dangerous diplomatic embarrassment,” while commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said a ruling against the administration without a stay would have “devastating and dire consequences,” as quoted by the news portal.Lutnick argued tariffs had brought foreign powers to the negotiating table “in ways that no other president came close to achieving,” and cautioned that striking them down would “send a signal to the world that the United States lacks the resolve to defend its own economic and national security.”“Suspending the effectiveness of the tariffs would expose the United States to the risk of retaliation by other countries based on a perception that the United States lacks the capacity to respond rapidly to retaliation,” Bessent added..Secretary of state Marco Rubio added that Trump had invoked tariff powers during sensitive talks, including efforts to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, warning of “severe consequences for ongoing peace negotiations and human rights abuses.”During oral arguments on July 31, federal circuit judges expressed skepticism over the administration’s sweeping claims of tariff authority, raising the possibility they could side with lawsuits brought by small businesses and Democratic-led states. The administration’s last moment filing indicated concern about that very outcome.Trump had justified his tariffs under IEEPA by declaring national emergencies over trade deficits and drug trafficking, but the appeals court rejected this interpretation. “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,” the ruling said.The lawsuits were brought by small businesses and a coalition of Democratic-led states, who argued tariff power rests with Congress. The New York-based US court of international trade had already ruled against Trump’s tariffs in May, finding he had exceeded his authority.The federal circuit has now paused the effect of its decision until October 14, giving the administration time to appeal to the US Supreme Court.","US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington, DC, said the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize a president to levy tariffs.

A Jewish woman in her 70s was stabbed in broad daylight at a supermarket in Ottawa. The shocking incident took place Wednesday afternoon at a Loblaws store on Baseline Road, where the victim was shopping with a friend.Ottawa Police Service confirmed Friday that the assault is being investigated as a 'hate-motivated' crime.Police said the attacker, who did not know her, approached and stabbed her without provocation. She was critically injured but survived after being rushed to hospital.The suspect, identified as Joseph Rooke, 71, of Cornwall, Ontario, was arrested at the scene. He has been charged with aggravated assault and possession of a dangerous weapon. Rooke appeared in court Thursday and is due back on September 2.The attack has sent shockwaves through Canada’s Jewish community. Prime Minister Mark Carney posted on X, ""To the Canadian Jewish community: you are not alone. In full solidarity, we denounce the hatred and threats to your safety.”Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre condemned the assault as “yet another vile antisemitic attack” and urged stronger hate-crime laws. Ottawa Mayor Mark Sutcliffe said the incident had “caused significant distress” among the city’s Jewish community, adding that security would be bolstered in certain neighborhoods.Local representatives also voiced concern. Ottawa West-Nepean MPP Chandra Pasma called it a “deeply troubling incident,” while MP Anita Vandenbeld said she was “mortified” and “cannot imagine the fear of our Jewish neighbours.”","Elderly Jewish woman stabbed in broad daylight at Ottawa grocery store.

‘You can’t mimic the king’: JD Vance again mocks Gavin Newsom’s Donald Trump-style posts; calls it ‘cheap imitation’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/you-cant-mimic-the-king-jd-vance-again-mocks-gavin-newsoms-donald-trump-style-posts-calls-it-cheap-imitation/articleshow/123580503.cms,"JD Vance again mocks Gavin Newsom’s Donald Trump-style posts (Picture credit: AP)

The Chaos That Erupted Just Moments Before Vance Was Booed At Union Station Revealed





US Vice President JD Vance has again criticised California Governor Gavin Newsom’s new social media strategy, saying his attempt to copy President Donald Trump ’s style lacks authenticity.In an interview with Fox News host Will Cain, Vance argued that Newsom cannot replicate Trump’s appeal. “He's trying to be a fake copy of Trump and it just doesn't work. You can't mimic the king. You can’t mimic the master; you ought to just go and be yourself. And I think the people would like that a lot more than a cheap imitation of the president of the United States,” he said.The comments follow a string of posts from Newsom’s press office in August that mirrored Trump’s online persona — using capital letters, mocking nicknames and emphatic sign-offs.One viral post declared, “WOW! TOMORROW HISTORY WILL BE MADE… DONALD ‘THE FAILURE’ TRUMP BE WARNED, TOMORROW MAY BE THE WORST DAY OF YOUR LIFE. LIBERATION DAY FOR AMERICA!!! — GCN.”Cain noted that the approach may be resonating with Democrats, pointing to a Morning Consult poll showing Newsom’s support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents rose by eight points between June and late August.However, Vance dismissed the tactic as inauthentic. “When I see Gavin Newsom trying to act like Donald Trump, that’s the opposite of authenticity.He’s not trying to be Gavin Newsom — whoever that is. He’s trying to be a fake carbon copy of Donald Trump, and it just doesn’t work,” he said.Vance emphasised that Trump’s enduring influence comes from being genuine. “The lesson of President Trump in American politics is you’ve got to be authentic to yourself,” he added. “People liked his posts because they spoke to his authenticity. With Newsom, it’s a cheap replication.”Newsom defended his approach earlier this month, saying he wanted to highlight the double standards around Trump’s social media behaviour. “I’m sort of following his example,” he said in a press conference, according to The Wrap. “If you’ve got issues with what I’m putting out, you sure as hell should have concerns about what he’s putting out as president.”In an earlier interview, Vance has also warned Democrats more broadly against drawing the wrong lesson from Trump’s success. “This idea that Gavin Newsom is somehow going to mimic Donald Trump’s style — I think that ignores the fundamental genius of President Trump’s political success, which is that he’s authentic,” he said on Fox News’s The Ingraham Angle.Vance went further, offering blunt advice, “The autopsy for the Democrats… is stop sounding like crazy people. Don’t be a crazy person. Be authentic.”","JD Vance again mocks Gavin Newsom’s Donald Trump-style posts. ‘He's trying to be a fake copy of Trump and it just doesn't work.

Poll Should police prioritize non-lethal methods in dangerous confrontations? Yes No





A dramatic police video has captured the moments before a 35-year-old Sikh man, wielding a machete near Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles was fatally shot by officers in July this year.The incident took place on the morning of July 13, when multiple 911 callers reported a man brandishing a large blade at passersby at the busy intersection of Figueroa Street and Olympic Boulevard.Police later identified him as Gurpreet Singh LAPD released footage of the incident on its YouTube channel yesterday, where Singh is seen apparently performing G, a traditional Sikh martial art, in the middle of the street.According to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), Singh abandoned his car in the middle of the road, waved the machete aggressively and, at one point, even appeared to slice his own tongue with the weapon.Officers said they repeatedly ordered him to drop the blade, but he refused to comply.Singh briefly returned to his vehicle, retrieved a water bottle and hurled it at police before driving off while sticking the machete out of the window. Officers launched a short pursuit during which Singh allegedly drove erratically and collided with a police vehicle.He finally came to a stop near Figueroa and 12th Streets, where police said he charged at them with the weapon. Officers opened fire, striking Singh.He was rushed to hospital but later succumbed to his injuries.The LAPD said a two-foot-long machete was recovered from the scene. No officers or civilians were hurt in the ordeal.","LA Police shoot dead Sikh man performing gatka on LA road.

Trump's Rival Democrats Blast Tariff on India, Call Out Move 'Hurting Americans', Sabotaging Ties

'Total disaster for US'



Trump went too far



What next?





US President Donald Trump on Friday said that he would ""fight back"" after a US federal court in a significant ruling found his global tariffs ""illegal.""The US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington ruled that many of Trump's tariffs were illegal; however, it allowed them to remain in place for now, giving the US president time to take the matter to the Supreme Court.A furious Trump termed the court ruling ""incorrect,"" saying that ""ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT!""""Today, a Highly Partisan Appeals Court incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed, but they know the United States of America will win in the end,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Blown by the decision, Trump flagged that if tariffs ever went away, it would be a ""total disaster"" for US, adding that the country ""will no longer tolerate enormous Trade Deficits and unfair Tariffs and Non-Tariff Trade Barriers imposed by other Countries, friend or foe.""""The USA will no longer tolerate enormous Trade Deficits and unfair Tariffs and Non-Tariff Trade Barriers imposed by other Countries, friend or foe, that undermine our Manufacturers, Farmers, and everyone else,"" he added.""If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,"" Trump wrote further.The US president underlined that the tariffs imposed by him on several countries, which resulted in a trade war, are ""best tool"" for US workers and ""support Companies that produce great MADE IN AMERICA products.""Trump said that for many years tariffs were used against US but now he will approach Supreme Court to make America ""Rich, Strong, and Powerful Again.""The 7-4 ruling by the US court observed: ""The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,"" as quoted by Reuters.The decision also noted that the US president had exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).Federal court's ruling has thrown a roadblock to Trump's path after he audaciously claimed unlimited power to bypass Congress and imposed tariffs on several countries, friends and foes.The decision was centred on tariffs Trump imposed on almost every country on earth on April 2, calling it 'Liberation Day,' as well as levies on China, Mexico, and Canada.The court stated that he overstepped when he declared national emergencies to justify imposing tariffs on several countries.If tariffs are struck down, the US administration argued that it will have to refund some of the import taxes that were collected. It will be a major financial blow for US treasury. According to news report from AP, by July the revenue from tariffs totalled to $159 billion, more than expected. The justice department earlier had said that revoking the tariffs could mean ""financial ruin"" for America.""While existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments, or even seek to renegotiate terms,"" Ashley Akers, a former justice department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision, as quoted by AP.Meanwhile, Trump declared on his social media platform that he will take the fight to the Supreme Court. ""If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,"" he wrote.While the president still has other legal tools to levy import taxes, they are far more limited. The Trade Act of 1974, for example, allows tariffs of only up to 15% and for a maximum of 150 days against countries with which the U.S. runs large trade deficits.Another option is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 — the basis for past tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos. But that route requires a formal Commerce Department investigation and cannot be triggered at the president’s discretion.","US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington ruled that many of Trump's tariffs were illegal.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has revoked the visas of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and 80 other officials ahead of next month's annual high-level meeting of the UN General Assembly, where the Palestinians previously have been represented.A State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss visa issues that are normally confidential, disclosed Friday that Abbas and other officials from the Palestinian Authority were among those affected.The move is the latest in a series of steps the Trump administration has taken to target Palestinians with visa restrictions and comes as the Israeli military declared Gaza's largest city a combat zone. The State Department also suspended a program that had allowed injured Palestinian children from Gaza to come to the US for medical treatment after a social media outcry by some conservatives.The department said in a statement earlier that Rubio also ordered some new visa applications from Palestinian officials, including those tied to the Palestine Liberation Organisation, be denied.""It is in our national security interests to hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their commitments, and for undermining the prospects for peace,"" the statement said.It said that to be considered partners for peace the groups ""must consistently repudiate terrorism, and end incitement to terrorism in education, as required by US law and as promised by the PLO.""The State Department didn't specify how many visas had been revoked or how many applications had been denied or give details beyond its statement.The Palestinian Authority denounced the visa withdrawals as a violation of US commitments as the host country of the United Nations and urged the State Department to reverse its decision.It said in a statement that the Palestinian presidency ""expressed its deep regret and astonishment"" at the visa decision, which ""contravenes international law and the Headquarters Agreement, especially since the State of Palestine is an observer member of the United Nations.""UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the world body would be seeking clarification from the State Department.""We obviously hope that this will be resolved,"" he said. ""It is important that all member states, permanent observers be able to be represented.""The State Department said representatives assigned to the Palestinian Authority mission at the United Nations would be granted waivers under the US host country agreement with the U.N. so they can continue their New York-based operations.The Palestinian ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, told reporters Friday that Abbas planned to lead the delegation to the UN meetings and was expected to address the General Assembly - as he has done for many years.He also was expected to attend a high-level meeting co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia on September 22 about a two-state solution, which calls for Israel living side-by-side with an independent Palestine.","Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is among those affected, a State Department official says.

The TOI correspondent from Washington:





Trump surrogates on Friday kept up a relentless attack on New Delhi for purportedly fuelling Russia's war against Ukraine, shaking US-India ties in a manner not seen in more than 50 years amid growing concern outside MAGA-sphere.From accusing India of being a ""laundromat for Kremlin"" (WH trade counselor Peter Navarro) to alleging New Delhi and its Brics allies are somehow responsible for Russia's latest bombing of Kyiv in which 23 people died (Senator Lindsey Graham), Trump minions continued to savage India amid pushback from former US officials, think tanks, advocacy groups, and Democrat lawmakers seeking to arrest the slide.""India, China, Brazil and others who prop up Putin's war machine by buying cheap Russian oil: How do you feel right now that your purchases have resulted in innocent civilians, including children, being killed?"" South Carolina Senator and Trump minion Lindsey Graham wrote on X hours after the the latest bombing in Kyiv that killed 23, warning, with reference to the 50% tariff on New Delhi, ""India is experiencing the cost of supporting Putin. To the rest, you will soon too.""It was Graham, widely seen as a warmonger even in Republican circles, who triggered the Trump tariffs on India by introducing the ""Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025"" which, among other things, proposed a 500% tariff on nations buying Russian energy. While Russia, China, and EU have since been treated with kid gloves, India inexplicably has borne the brunt of Graham's ire.In a series of vituperative posts following up his characterisation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict as ""Modi's war,"" Graham's White House pointman Peter Navarro accused India of ""using our dollars"" to ""bankroll"" Russia and said New Delhi's buying of Russian oil ""carries an added price of blood and devastation in Ukraine.""""It doesn't stop there. India continues to buy Russian weapons - while demanding that US firms transfer sensitive military tech and build plants in India. That's strategic freeloading,"" Navarro said, adding, ""If India, the world's largest democracy, wants to be treated like a strategic partner of the US, it needs to act like one. The road to peace in Ukraine runs through New Delhi.""The comments came even as the US state department on Friday announced it will send 3,500 extended-range cruise missiles to Ukraine, a $825 million tab bankrolled by Europe and US, raising questions about their role in the bloodbath. By some accounts, it was US shenanigans in Ukraine that triggered the war.The virulence of the Graham-Navarro attacks - unchecked by the MAGA supremo - alarmed even conservative pundits outside the MAGA-sphere. ""Blow up our relationship with India over Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"" is proof we're in the dumbest timeline. Putin loves this. If this is what ""winning"" looks like, I'd rather lose,"" said Jeff Smith, director of the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank.The attacks on India even bothered the advocacy group American Jewish Committee to speak beyond its immediate remit. ""AJC is mystified, and deeply troubled, by the chorus of attacks on India by U.S. officials....We regret energy-hungry India's reliance on Russian oil - but India isn't responsible for Putin's war crimes, is a sister democracy and an increasingly important strategic partner of the US, and has a crucial role to play in Great Power competition. It's time to reset this vital relationship,"" it said.While supine Republican lawmakers, including many in the India caucus, remained silent, House Democrats blasted the administration for ""sabotaging US-India relations"".","Trump surrogates on Friday kept up a relentless attack on New Delhi for purportedly fuelling Russia's war against Ukraine.

From heartbreak to hate

Community in shock





Minneapolis police say the gunman who killed two children and injured 18 others at Annunciation Catholic Church this week had recently gone through a breakup that may have played a role in his violent spiral.The suspect, identified as Robin Westman, 28, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after Wednesday’s attack, which unfolded as children attended mass during their first week of school.According to Fox9, Westman’s father told investigators his son had “recently broke up with a significant and/or romantic partner” and was staying with a friend in the aftermath. Police described the breakup as a destabilizing factor in his personal life, adding that Westman appeared increasingly isolated in the weeks leading up to the shooting.Records also show that in 2018, officers conducted a welfare check at the home of Westman’s mother involving him as a juvenile - an early sign of mental health concerns.Just hours before the attack, Westman uploaded a series of YouTube videos, including a manifesto where he described fantasies about “being that scary horrible monster standing over those powerless kids.” He also expressed admiration for the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre.In a letter addressed to family and friends, Westman apologized but insisted he still had “traits of empathy, self-sacrifice, and good character,” despite the violence he was about to unleash.On Wednesday morning, Westman fired through church windows at children and parishioners, then barricaded the doors with wooden planks. Minneapolis police chief Brian O’Hara called the act “one of the darkest tragedies imaginable,” as the community mourns the young lives lost and asks how personal turmoil escalated into mass violence.","The suspect, identified as Robin Westman, 28, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after Wednesday’s attack.

The AI shift that opened doors

His secret to cracking big tech interviews

Advice for aspiring AI engineers





At just 23, Manoj Tumu has cracked the code many engineers spend years chasing - a $400,000 (Rs 3.36 crore) paycheck and a role at Mark Zuckerberg ’s Meta.The Indian-American software engineer swapped Amazon for the social media giant earlier this year, joining its advertising research team, and now he’s sharing the playbook behind his rapid rise.Tumu admits Amazon gave him a solid foundation, but the lure of Meta’s projects was irresistible. “Though I had learned a lot at Amazon, I just thought there was more interesting work going on at Meta,” he told Business Insider. When the offer landed in June, he didn’t hesitate.Tumu says the timing was perfect. Machine learning has transformed in recent years, shifting from human-driven “classical” techniques to deep learning, where neural networks crunch raw data automatically. “That change has opened up exciting opportunities,” he explained.If you thought referrals or flashy projects were the ticket in, Tumu disagrees. He revealed he got into both Amazon and Meta without a reference - just a “decent resume” and a lot of persistence. His advice? Ditch the college project section once you’ve gained two or three years of experience and focus on professional impact instead.And when it comes to interviews, he insists the behavioral round is where many stumble.“At Amazon, I went through six rounds of interviews. I studied the company’s values, wrote a huge document of stories and follow-ups, and tailored my answers for every principle,” he said. His takeaway: knowing the company’s culture is as important as knowing your code.For students, his golden rule is simple - grab an internship, no matter the pay. “Even low-paying internships can be beneficial. Experience matters more than money early on,” he said.Tumu, who started his master’s program in 2022, also swears by cold emails. Sending them helped him get his foot in the door — something he says aspiring AI professionals shouldn’t shy away from.","Manoj Tumu, 23, left Amazon for Mark Zuckerberg's Meta earlier this year.

A joke that turned serious: Rubio exits USAID role; hands shutdown to Vought,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-joke-that-turned-serious-rubio-exits-usaid-role-hands-shutdown-to-vought/articleshow/123591154.cms,"Marco Rubio and Donalfd Trump (File - AP)





US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Friday announced he is stepping back from his role overseeing the US agency for international development (USAID), handing off responsibilities to office of management and budget director Russ Vought as the agency enters its final phase of shutdown.In a post on X, Rubio wrote congratulating Russ, “I joked with @realDonaldTrump that I had four jobs. He told me to give one to my friend Russ Vought. So I did,”“Since January, we’ve saved the taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. And with a small set of core programs moved over to the State Department, USAID is officially in close out mode,” he added. “Russ is now at the helm to oversee the closeout of an agency that long ago went off the rails. Congrats, Russ.”While the OMB has yet to confirm if Vought will serve as acting administrator of USAID or act in a designee role under Rubio, the move adds to his current portfolio, which includes heading the consumer financial protection bureau and leading Trump’s budget team.Vought also played a central role in shaping Project 2025, a conservative policy framework developed by The Heritage Foundation, according to Politico.USAID, once a key independent agency delivering international aid, has been gradually dismantled under the Trump administration. Earlier this year, President Trump appointed Rubio as acting administrator, and by March, 83% of its programmes - including those focused on food, water and medical aid - had been cut. The remaining functions were absorbed by the State Department on July 1.The restructuring followed a January executive order by Trump that froze a wide range of foreign and domestic aid programmes, targeting what the administration described as “woke” spending across federal agencies.More recently, in a letter sent Thursday to House Speaker Mike Johnson and later shared on the White House Office of Management and Budget’s X account, President Donald Trump said he was invoking a “pocket rescission” - a budgetary tool that lets the president allow allocated funds to expire without direct action. Since Congress has only 45 days to respond, Trump’s late August submission makes it nearly certain the funds will lapse unused when the fiscal year ends on September 30.There has been a consistent effort by the Trump administration to use the all possible tools at their disposal, like shutting down aid delivery agencies like USAID to pocket recession, along with other policy decision and recission proposals to substantially reduce the amount of money US spends on critical and humanitarian foreign aid, which they believe don't serve the purpose.","US secretary of state Marco Rubio announced he is stepping back from his role overseeing the US agency for international development (USAID) He handed off responsibilities to office of management and budget director Russ Vought.

JD Vance meltdown over Politico story: ‘Deep state laundering garbage into the conversation’; MAGA rallies behind,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-meltdown-over-politico-story-deep-state-laundering-garbage-into-the-conversation-maga-rallies-behind/articleshow/123588586.cms,"JD Vance (File - AP)





US Vice-President JD Vance has hit out at a recent Politico report critical of Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy in Russia-Ukraine talks, calling it “a foreign influence operation” aimed at discrediting the administration.Vance initially issued a formal response defending Witkoff, stating, “Witkoff has made more progress towards ending the bloodshed in Ukraine than all his critics combined.”But In a lengthy post on X, Vance accused the outlet of “journalistic malpractice” and said the article relied on anonymous sources to push an agenda. “Notice how all of the people attacking Steve are on background?” he wrote. “That means it's two or three deep staters who are angry that Witkoff has succeeded where they've failed.”The Politico story, published earlier in the day, quoted over a dozen unnamed officials who described Witkoff as inexperienced and ineffective in managing talks with Moscow. Vance pushed back, saying the piece omitted key on-record quotes from senior officials including himself, the secretary of state Marco Rubio, and Jared Kushner.He also referenced support for Witkoff from UK national security advisor Jonathan Powell, calling the article “disgraceful” and accusing its author, Felicia Schwartz, of either being used by anonymous operatives or complicit in what he termed a “literal foreign influence operation.”Defending Witkoff’s performance, Vance said, “The fruits of his negotiations are that we have narrowed the list of open issues in the Russia-Ukraine war to a set of clearly defined issues – specifically, security guarantees and territorial concessions.”He went on, “Maybe we make peace, and maybe we don’t. If we do, it will be because Steve Witkoff and the President of the United States worked their tails off, in the face of outright lies from the mainstream press.”Steve Witkoff thanked VP Vance for offering his very public defense of him,In a post on X, Witkoff wrote, “This statement from our amazing Vice President speaks for itself. Thank you Mr Vice President. It is my honor to serve in the Trump Administration.”The White House has not officially responded to the story, which comes amid heightened sensitivity around backchannel diplomacy efforts in Eastern Europe.Vance’s post triggered a wave of online abuse targeting Politico reporter Felicia Schwartz, with several pro-Trump social media users launching personal attacks. “With a name like ‘Fellatio’ and a face like this… i mean…” one user wrote, sharing an image of the journalist. Another responded, “You as VP can jail the journalist and I think it’s time. Put them in camps, sir.”Known Republican and MAGA social media accounts were quick to run down the Politico story and journalist, branding it as a smear campaign against Steve Witkoff, and alleging it to be solely based on fictional sources.","Vice-President JD Vance has hit out at a recent Politico report critical of Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy in Russia-Ukraine talks.

US President Donald Trump has unilaterally cancelled nearly $5 billion in foreign aid, drawing sharp criticism from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers.Republican Senator Susan Collins called the move ""unlawful"", while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned it could lead to a government shutdown this fall.The rescinded funds, valued at $4.9 billion, were meant for international development and peacekeeping programs, including those historically managed by USAID, which has seen major funding and operational cuts recently.A senior Republican Senator Susan Collins, who oversees spending legislation as chair of the Senate appropriations committee said, “the President’s rescission of congressionally approved foreign aid is illegal.” She urged a return to the regular budget process.“Instead of this attempt to undermine the law, the appropriate way is to identify ways to reduce excessive spending through the bipartisan, annual appropriations process,"" she said in a statement, as quoted by news agency Reuters.Senate Schumer said Trump is aiming to force a government shutdown at the end of September by indicating that he is willing to ignore any spending laws passed by Congress.In response he threatened a standoff in the upcoming federal funding negotiations, signalling that Democrats may be willing to force a shutdown if the rescission is not reversed.""Republicans don’t have to be a rubber stamp for this carnage,"" Schumer said in a statement, the agency quoted.The Trump administration is using a mechanism known as a “pocket rescission”, which allows suspension of funds for up to 45 days without Congress’s approval. If not acted upon by September 30, the funds will permanently expire.This move follows the Rescissions Act of 2025, which Trump signed in July, cutting billions from foreign assistance and public broadcasting. Health experts and aid groups have warned the cuts could have dire humanitarian consequences globally.The decision is likely to deepen political tensions as Congress returns in September for budget talks ahead of the fiscal deadline.","US President Donald Trump has unilaterally cancelled nearly $5 billion in foreign aid.

Small offenses, big consequences

‘Optics’ vs safety





On a humid Friday night in Washington, DC, Juan Carlos Dela Torre was doing something unremarkable: standing on a sidewalk, smoking a joint. Within minutes, he was in handcuffs. Federal officers confiscated the marijuana, searched him, said they found a small amount of MDMA, and sent him to jail.“I’ve never seen this much police presence in my whole life,” Dela Torre, a 37-year-old massage therapist who has lived in the city since 1994 was quoted as saying by NYT. “You guys are worried about some guy smoking a joint on the corner on a Friday night?”The arrest is one of nearly 1,000 made since President Donald Trump declared Washington “out of control” and vowed to “rescue our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor.” Elite federal agencies, from the FBI to the Secret Service, were deployed in mid-August, flooding the city with checkpoints, foot patrols, and undercover stings, NYT reported.Officials tout the results: violent crime down 45%, property crime down 12% in just two weeks, NYT reported. “We already had good momentum coming into the federal surge, and it made it better,” said city administrator Kevin Donahue.But arrest records reviewed by The New York Times tell a more complicated story: many of the detentions have little to do with violent crime.Instead, federal officers are stopping cars for tinted windows, citing people for open containers, and running low-dollar drug stings.More than half of the charges involve drugs or guns, some against people licensed to carry firearms elsewhere but not in D.C. Another 18% are for traffic and minor violations, like drinking in public. Only 9% of arrests tied to federal agents directly involved violent or property crimes.One case involved a $20 cocaine buy-and-bust. Another, an arrest over an open tequila bottle in a car, escalated into a felony gun charge when police spotted a Glock with an extended magazine.The strategy resembles the “broken windows” policing of the 1990s, where tackling small infractions was seen as a path to bigger busts. But for residents, the effect is unsettling. “It is bringing a sense of fear in the community,” said Jawana Hardy, 35, after watching a platoon of officers march into a neighborhood cookout.Critics argue the crackdown is less about fighting crime than creating a show of force. “People who are not the problem are being locked up to create optics,” said Ron Moten, a longtime anti-violence activist. “It’s making good everyday working people afraid to walk in the District of Columbia.”The majority of those arrested are Black, a disproportionate share in a city where Black residents make up just over 40% of the population. Arrests cluster heavily in Ward 8, which has some of DC’s highest violent crime rates.And while federal officials are unfazed by the city’s overcrowded jail, residents like Kimberly Mitchell are left recalibrating daily life. She recently paid $175 for tinted windows on her car. “Now I want to get it taken off,” she said.For Dela Torre, the massage therapist caught smoking a joint, the surge is personal. What was once a familiar city sidewalk now feels like a stage for a federal dragnet.","Nearly 1,000 arrests have been made since President Donald Trump declared Washington ‘out of control’ Elite federal agencies, from the FBI to the Secret Service, were deployed in mid-August.

Flood Threat For Pakistan As India Releases Water From Swollen Rivers Day After Alerting Islamabad





AMRITSAR: Embarrassed by a viral video showing its side of the parade path at Wagah border badly waterlogged - and its Rangers standing in knee-deep water - while the Indian side looks clean, Pakistan has blamed the elevation of Grand Trunk Road on the Indian side for the mess.The fact is India has already implemented a rainwater harvesting system and improved drainage management to prevent waterlogging.Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days. Its side of the parade area at the site of the daily flag ceremony at the Wagah joint checkpost is wallowing in muddy knee-deep water. Sandbags are seen piled up at a few places on the Pakistani side ahead of the ceremony. In contrast, the Indian side is free of water, except for a small area near the international border gates.Sources say Pakistan has raised the elevation of GT Road with Indian authorities. Pakistan also hastily constructed drainage channels and elevated a portion of the road to facilitate water outflow. BSF IG, Punjab Frontier, Atul Fulzele said there was incessant and heavy rainfall on Aug 8-9, and the video was likely from that period.""There has been no waterlogging at any of the three sites of the ceremonial flag-lowering ceremonies - Attari, Hussainiwala, and Sadqi. "" However, several border outposts (BoPs) along the Punjab Frontier were inundated due to heavy rainfall, and some had to be evacuated, he said.BoPs located in enclaves beyond the Ravi river and short of the international border are also being evacuated due to severe flooding.","Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Big Op Sindoor Lie Claims India Begged For Ceasefire, Trump Stepped In





ISLAMABAD: Nearly 100 days after Indian fighter jets pounded “terror bases” in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque that was among those hit.The May 6 raids had left the Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad badly damaged, with three fatalities reported. Now, PoK police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot “sold out” by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.Obaid has been booked under the draconian Official Secrets Act, 1923, with police claiming they had recovered “hard evidence” of espionage. “He passed on sensitive images and the mosque’s coordinates in exchange for hefty payments,” claimed SSP Riaz Mughal of PoK police’s counter-terrorism department (CTD).But the case is already mired in conflicting narratives. Another senior CTD officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, went further, alleging Jahangir had a past with a banned outfit before joining a so-called relief organisation. Investigators, he added, had traced communications with Indian handlers on his phone.The family, however, insists Obaid is no militant. His uncle admitted the 30-something may have “fallen into a money trap” but stressed he was only associated with the Jammu Kashmir United Movement, a relief body.“If he is guilty, he should face the law, but he has never been part of any militant outfit,” the uncle maintained.His lawyer, Abdul Samad, pointed out that the sections invoked against him cover trespassing into restricted areas and passing on information “prejudicial to national security”. Conviction under these clauses carries punishments ranging from 14 years in prison to life.Earlier this year, too, PoK police had arrested a police constable on charges of selling sensitive information across the border.","Indian fighter jets pounded ‘terror bases’ in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) Nearly 100 days later, local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque.

At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, were injured after an explosion took place at a fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.Thick smoke could be seen billowing into the sky from the building where firecrackers were stored, according to television footage.Witnesses cited by AP said that broken glass from nearby shops covered the road and panicked residents fled the scene.Firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze while ambulances ferried the injured, including passers-by, to hospitals.Senior police official Asad Raza said several shops and vehicles on Jinnah Road were damaged in the blast. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.The fire was reported in a warehouse near Taj Complex on MA Jinnah Road, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding,“as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the Fire and Rescue team reached the scene along with an ambulance and two fire brigade trucks.”Police surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “Sixteen injured at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [with] two critical. Fourteen at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre,” adding that the warehouse had been storing firecrackers.Karachi traffic police said MA Jinnah Road had been closed due to the fire, with traffic from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.Citizens were advised to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate routes “to avoid inconvenience,” the Dawn reported.Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed officials to control the blaze and ensure no lives were lost. According to a statement, he also ordered the Karachi Commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report. “There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.The Sindh home ministry later issued a statement saying 20 people had been injured in the blaze.Home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to the scene, saying, “Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital. An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”Lanjar also instructed investigators to include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene, Dawn furthed added.Explosions at fireworks facilities are not uncommon in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab province. Fires in commercial and residential buildings are also frequent, largely blamed on poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety rules, and negligence.","At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, injured after explosion at fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.

Targeting Ahmadiyya community



Blasphemy accusations







The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.HRCP on Thursday released its latest report, Streets of Fear: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2024/25, documenting violations of freedom of religion or belief (FORB) between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025.The report painted a picture as grim as in previous years, recording targeted killings, forced conversions, mob lynchings, hate speech, desecration of places of worship and extrajudicial killings. It also warned that religious freedom in Pakistan is facing an unprecedented threat.The HRCP highlighted several cases where individuals were killed over blasphemy accusations, describing the trend as deeply troubling in a country that has already witnessed the assassination of a provincial governor by his own security guard.The HRCP report noted that the pattern of minor non-Muslim girls disappearing and later resurfacing after allegedly converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men persisted in 2024/25.Hindus in Sindh, who form 8.8% of the population, and Christians in Punjab (1.9%), have raised repeated concerns. A fact-finding study found that forced conversions and coerced marriages remain most prevalent among Scheduled Caste Hindus due to poverty and limited social mobility.The report highlighted the role of cleric-politician Mian Abdul Haq, or Mian Mithu, accused of using his influence to facilitate conversions at his seminary in Ghotki. He was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.The report also cited cases where police were seen siding with abductors, often claiming it would be “haram” to return a girl after conversion.In July 2024, Faisalabad police recovered Christian minor Laiba Suhail, abducted in February and forcibly converted before being married off illegally. Another girl, Alina, is still missing. In January 2025, a Mirpurkhas court heard a plea from a couple accused of forcing an underage Hindu girl to convert and marry.Other cases were reported across provinces: in April 2025, 14-year-old a Hindu girl, Chahat disappeared in Quetta and later claimed in a video to have converted, though her parents produced documents proving she was underage.In May, Hindu Panchayats in Ghotki and Rohri protested the disappearance of a Meghwar teenager in Rohri, fearing abduction for forced conversion. In June, civil society groups and Hindu Panchayats in Larkana expressed concern over three minor girls and a teenage boy from Shahdadpur allegedly being forced to convert.The HRCP stressed that such cases continue to deepen insecurity among religious minorities and called for protective measures to safeguard vulnerable children and their families.The report listed multiple killings of Ahmadis: dentist Zakaur Rahman in Lalamusa (July 2024), Tayyab Ahmad in Rawalpindi (December 2024), Amir Hasan in Naukot (December 2024), Laeeq Cheema lynched in Karachi (April 2025), Muhammad Asif in Kasur (April 2025), and senior doctor Mahmood Sheikh in Sargodha (May 2025).The UN warned, “We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan.”“According to the data provided by the Ahmadiyya community, 29 Ahmadi places of worship were attacked and damaged during the review period,” the report said.It further added that in 26 cases, the demolition was carried out by law enforcement agencies.“These incidents occurred in Okara, Khanewal, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, and Sargodha, among other locations Back in January, a historic Sialkot site linked to Pakistan’s first foreign minister Zafarullah Khan was “reduced to rubble”.The report said that the blasphemy law has been often misused to settle personal scores or seek financial gain in Pakistan, where, a ‘mere accusation of blasphemy can be a death sentence.’In September, last year, two men accused of blasphemy were killed while in police custody less than a week apart. One was inexplicably shot and killed in Mirpurkhas during an alleged police encounter, and the other was killed by a police constable inside a police station in Quetta.On 12 September 2024, constable Saad Khan Sarhadi shot dead Abdul Ali, a blasphemy suspect, inside Quetta’s Cantonment Police Station after mobs from religious parties gathered outside demanding his custody. It marked the first such incident in the city where a serving officer killed a suspect in custody. Days later, Ali’s family pardoned Sarhadi, while lawyers and a JUI-F senator pledged legal support for him.Later, on 17 September 2024, Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a civil hospital employee from Umerkot, fled to Karachi after a cleric accused him of posting blasphemous content. He denied the charge in a video message before being arrested by police, who assured his family of protection. Two days later, police claimed he was killed in an encounter, with officers celebrated as heroes.His family was prevented from burying him by armed mobs, and the body was desecrated. Following outrage from rights groups, a Sindh police inquiry declared the encounter “fake.”The report also showed that the mainstream media largely ignored issues of religious freedom under the period covered. Even the Islamabad High Court’s hearings into the “blasphemy business group,” affecting nearly 400 households and livestreamed for four months, drew little coverage. Likewise, cases of coerced marriages, forced conversions and violence against minorities rarely made headlines.A worrying trend has emerged in Pakistan, where ultra-right-wing groups are exerting growing pressure on the judiciary and elected officials through propaganda and intimidation, it added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.

’14 Pakistani Soldiers Killed’: Baloch Rebels Attack Day After India’s Strike On Terror Hubs | Watch





The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan 's army personnel dead. According to BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch, fighters launched a raid in the Surdu area of Panjgur on Tuesday night, eliminating a key operative of the Pakistan army.The statement revealed that Ghulam Sarwar had earlier established and commanded a so-called death squad under the protection of the Pakistani military. This squad, which had been active for years in Gichek and other parts of Panjgur, was later led by his son, Islam Sarwar. The group allegedly supported the army's operations, carrying out targeted killings, enforced disappearances, and other violent acts. In return, the army reportedly allowed them to freely engage in drug trafficking, kidnappings for ransom and extortion through road checkpoints.During the operation, BLA fighters seized three Kalashnikov rifles, an M-4, additional weapons, two vehicles, and three motorcycles from Islam Sarwar's hideout. The site, according to the BLA, also served as a torture chamber, where electric shock devices and other tools of abuse were found. Islam Sarwar was accused of abducting and killing a young man in Panjgur just two months earlier. Jeeyand Baloch warned that the Pakistani army and its allies would be held accountable for crimes against the Baloch people.The BLA's latest offensive is part of the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan , where separatist groups are demanding greater autonomy and recognition of Baloch rights. In recent years, attacks on military and paramilitary forces, along with government facilities, have intensified.Separatist factions argue that the Baloch people face systemic marginalisation and exploitation, despite the province's wealth in natural resources. In response, Pakistan's military has pursued counterinsurgency campaigns to suppress the rebellion. However, human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns over reports of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and excessive force during these operations.Numerous accounts point to the widespread issue of disappearances, with civilians and activists allegedly detained without due legal process. Rights organisations argue that such tactics fuel fear and deepen mistrust, further straining relations between the Pakistani state and the Baloch population.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan's army personnel dead.

Poll Do you think Imran Khan's corruption charges are politically motivated? Yes, they are fabricated. No, they are legitimate.





Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan ’s wife Bushra Bibi, has alleged that Bushra was forced to go on a hunger strike in prison before she was allowed to meet her family, ARY News reported.Both Bushra and Imran are behind bars facing multiple cases of corruption. Since his arrest in 2023, Khan has consistently maintained his innocence, asserting that the charges were fabricated by his opponents to prevent his political comeback.Maryam further claimed that Bushra was being kept in “difficult and unlawful” conditions. She said the ceiling of her cell leaked, the electric board had live current, rats moved around inside, and electricity was cut for up to two days.Speaking on ARY News, Maryam said Bushra was allowed to meet her family only after more than a month of repeated appeals. She said the family was also made to wait outside the jail for hours.Maryam alleged that Bushra’s health has worsened. “She has lost around 15 kilograms and has become very weak,” she said, adding that her sister’s morale remained strong.She also said that Bushra has not been given bail in several cases and has not been allowed to meet her husband, PTI founder Imran Khan.Meanwhile, Dawn reported that Imran Khan has nominated Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PMAP) chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai as opposition Leader in the national assembly, and Azam Khan Swati as opposition leader in the senate.","Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan ’s wife Bushra Bibi, has alleged that Bushra was forced to go on a hunger strike in prison.

DHAKA: Bangladesh's Election Commission (EC) on Friday described the national election scheduled for February next year as the ""most risky” in the country's electoral history, urging officials to brace for unpredictable challenges amid political uncertainty and social unrest.The remarks came a day after it unveiled a roadmap for the election, which has drawn mixed reactions from political parties.""The upcoming general election will undoubtedly be the most risky in Bangladesh's electoral history,” Election Commissioner M Anwarul Islam Sarker said at a training programme for election officials, which was also attended by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) AMM Nasir Uddin.""We may have to confront challenges that we do not yet know,” he said. Unveiling the roadmap for the general election, Bangladesh's top electoral body had said the poll schedule would be announced at least 60 days before the voting date.Another election commissioner, Abdur Rahmanel Masud, echoed Sarker's concern, saying that the upcoming election ""will be risky but the matter does not end there”.“A former CEC was recently garlanded with shoes (by a mob), while another is currently in jail,"" he said, urging officials to “just follow the law” and not to look to anyone else.CEC Uddin stressed professionalism and neutrality, directing officials to prepare for possible threats to law and order as well as the spread of misinformation and disinformation through social media.The commission “wants 100 per cent neutral behaviour from election officials in the upcoming polls”, he said.The upcoming polls will be the first since the ouster of Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League government in August 2024, following the violent protest led by Students Against Discrimination (SAD).Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has since been heading the interim government as Chief Adviser, with the Awami League barred from contesting the election pending trials of Hasina and her colleagues on charges, including crimes against humanity.While former prime minister Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and several left-leaning groups have welcomed the election roadmap, Jamaat-e-Islami on Friday rejected it as a “blueprint” to ""undermine free, fair election”.Jamaat leader Syed Abdullah Mohammad Taher, in a meeting with election officials in Cumilla district, accused Yunus of breaking his “promise"" by prematurely announcing the election deadline.The Islamist party was demanding the introduction of a proportional representation (PR) system in the polls, apparently to enhance its possible stake in the future parliament.Taher said the deadline was announced without taking a decision on the matter and other reform issues.The newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP) -- an offshoot of the SAD seen as sympathetic to Yunus -- has also expressed reservations against the planned polls under the existing system and scenario.The party, which is yet to get the EC registration, described the roadmap as a “breach of promise”.NCP Joint Convener Ariful Islam Adeeb, in a press conference, warned that “this misstep” could create future crises for which “the government must bear responsibility"".The party is pushing for a new constitution to replace the 1972 charter through a Constituent Assembly. It is demanding that the “July Charter” announced by Yunus earlier this month, acknowledging last year’s “revolution”, be implemented through the new constitution.Analysts have voiced concerns over whether a credible election can be held in the absence of the Awami League. They also warned that escalating mob violence and the current fragile law and order situation could also jeopardise the process.However, BNP, which has emerged as the single major party in Awami League's absence, sounded upbeat.“Everything has been done according to public expectations. I hope there will be no more irrelevant questions about the election now,” BNP standing committee member Salahuddin Ahmed was quoted as saying by the Daily Star newspaper.Yunus had earlier said the polls under his administration would be “the best” Bangladesh had “ever witnessed” in its history.","Bangladesh's Election Commission urges officials to brace for unpredictable challenges.

South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms, with lawmakers passing the bill on Wednesday, August 26, 2025, to address growing concerns about smartphone addiction among students, as per a report by BBC. The measure, approved by 115 out of 163 lawmakers present, aims to improve academic performance and social interactions among children and teenagers, with implementation scheduled for the next school year beginning March 2026.The new legislation comes as South Korean educators, parents, and lawmakers have observed declining academic progress and performance linked to excessive smartphone use in educational settings. The ban encompasses mobile phones and other smart devices within classroom environments.The initiative aligns South Korea with several other nations that have implemented similar restrictions. Countries including Finland and France have established phone bans specifically for younger students, while Italy, the Netherlands, and China have implemented broader restrictions across all school levels.Many South Korean schools had already implemented various forms of smartphone restrictions prior to this nationwide mandate.The new law formalizes these practices and establishes consistent standards across the country's educational institutions.The implementation timeline provides schools and educational authorities several months to prepare for the transition and establish necessary protocols before the law takes effect in March 2026.The ban reflects growing global awareness of smartphone addiction among youngsters and its potential impact on educational outcomes. Educational institutions worldwide are increasingly examining their policies regarding mobile device use in academic settings.","South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms.

Sri Lanka's jailed former president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, was admitted to the intensive care unit at Colombo National Hospital on Saturday, a day after being charged with misusing government funds for foreign travel.The deputy director-general of hospital Rukshan Bellana said that Wickremesinghe was reportedly severely dehydrated and required close monitoring.

(AP

CHEMMANI: A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region, along with 141 human skeletons including some that appear to be of children of different ages.The findings were made at a cremation ground in the Chemmani area near Jaffna town, the cultural heartland of the country's ethnic Tamil minority. But hardly any burials take place here, as Hindus mostly cremate their dead according to religious customs.Excavations have been underway since June, after workers found human remains while digging to build an electric crematorium.A pit test over nine days discovered 19 sets of human remains. Shallow burials of about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in a scattered and disorganized manner, and the absence of clothing, indicated the site was a mass grave, according to a report provided to a court in June.Since the area was secured and declared a crime scene that month, a total of 141 skeletons have been discovered within a 165-square-meter (1,776-square-foot) area. About 135 of the bodies had no clothing, and only one set of adult clothing was identified.Tests confirmed that a skeleton found with a schoolbag was that of a girl between 4 and 6 years old. Toddlers' dresses, socks and footwear, tiny bead bangles and a baby powder tray were also recovered.The identities of the dead and the cause and timing of their deaths are all unclear. But many think the victims could be civilians who disappeared during Sri Lanka's civil war, which broke out in 1983 between government forces and ethnic Tamil rebels, who fought to create an independent homeland for the minority group. The war ended in 2009.Several Tamil armed groups and an Indian peacekeeping mission were active in the region over the decades. But attention has focused on the Sri Lankan military, which had a heavy presence for over a decade in Chemmani, as the gateway to Jaffna town.Decades-old confession heightens suspicions A confession made by an army soldier before he was sentenced to death for rape and murder 27 years ago has strengthened suspicions about the site.In 1998, Somaratne Rajapakse along with four alleged accomplices from the military and police were sentenced to death for the gang rape and murder of a schoolgirl and the killing of her mother, brother and a neighbor.The five, who weren't hanged and remain in prison due to a moratorium on executions, have maintained that they were not involved in the rape and murder, but only disposed of the bodies under orders.Rajapakse told the court that he knew where up to 400 bodies were buried in Chammani.""We cannot say exactly who the perpetrators are yet, but the finger points to the (state) army,"" said Brito Fernando, an activist working with the families of people who disappeared during various armed conflicts in Sri Lanka.The area, including the cremation ground, were under Sri Lankan military control from 1996, when it captured Jaffna from the rebels, until after the war ended in 2009. The military operated checkpoints, and anyone who entered or left the area was searched.In 1999, Rajapakse led police to a spot where the schoolgirl, her family and the neighbor were buried and later showed police other places where more remains were found. But the investigations were abruptly stopped.Families want closure Items found at the site were publicly displayed earlier this month in the hope that their owners would be identified, and many people from surrounding villages and beyond visited the site.Amalanathan Mary Calista, whose husband has been missing since 1996 when the military arrested him in their village, said she hoped seeing proof that her husband was dead would bring a sense of closure.""I went there hoping to see at least his clothes. There was a sarong (clothing that wraps around the waist) but it wasn't my husband's. He was wearing a blue sarong at the time. It was disappointing,"" she said.""I only saw the clothing of little children,"" she added, as she wept.She said her husband is among 24 people who never returned home after the military searched their village. Families had tried to block the army vehicles from taking away the detained people, but the authorities pushed them aside with guns and the vehicles sped away, she said.""My wish is that he should be alive and return, but we can do nothing if it is not so,"" she said.""The state army arrested him. They must say that they arrested him and that he died at their hands. They also must pay us compensation,"" she said.Woman recalls military taking her brother and husband away Sivanathan Selvamalar said she watched her younger brother being loaded into a military truck blindfolded during that same raid. Years later, in 2009, her husband was also detained at a checkpoint. He called her to tell her of his arrest and was not heard from again.""We went to see the things, thinking they may have buried people who were arrested around this area, but we saw only the things of little children,"" she said.""We have checked all the prisons but have not found them. When we are told that more than 100 skeletons have been dug out, we fear the worst,"" she added.No children listed in missing person reports A 2003 report by Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission said it investigated 281 complaints of missing persons from 1990 to 1998. Of these, three were found in prisons and later released, while the rest are still unaccounted for. The report said the military was responsible for 243 cases, while the Tamil Tiger rebels were responsible for 25. The responsibility for 10 others is unknown.No children were listed as missing.Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, the editor of the only newspaper in the region at the time, said several families returned to Jaffna after fleeing into rebel-held territory as the military moved in. Some reportedly went missing after being stopped at checkpoints set up to look for infiltrating rebels, he said.Calls for DNA analysis Although previous investigations stalled, there is hope now that victims will be identified, Fernando said. But he said the government must do more to conduct a credible investigation.""We don't have proper guidelines to investigate the mass graves and have no DNA bank to help with identification,"" said Fernando, adding that the government should fund a DNA bank and enlist international support in the identification of victims.""Only a proper investigation by the government can free its military from suspicion,"" he said.Any direct probe into the military would likely anger Sri Lankan nationalists. Many of the majority ethnic Sinhalese admire the military for winning the civil war.Excavations will continue for 8 more weeks Ground-penetrating radar in other parts of the cremation ground has shown ""soil anomalies ... that are indicative of comparable density of buried skeletal remains,"" according to a report submitted in the Jaffna court last week.The scanned area is three times larger than the site that has been excavated, said Ranitha Gnanarajah, a lawyer monitoring the process. Investigators have requested court approval to continue excavations for eight more weeks, she said.Army spokesman Brig. Waruna Gamage said no one has formally accused the army of responsibility for the mass grave, and if they did they would need to show proof, he said.""The excavations are still ongoing and it is a civil matter belonging to the police and courts,"" Gamage said. ""We will respect the law of the country.""Government forces and the rebels are both accused of committing atrocities amounting to war crimes in the months leading to the end of the civil war in 2009.","A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region.

A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20 (about Rs 2,300) from a car owner after wiping his window.The clip shows the student approaching a parked vehicle, cleaning the glass, and insisting on payment. Surprised by the demand, the car owner recorded the incident and uploaded it to social media, where it has now crossed two million views.In the footage, the owner is heard asking, “for what?” when the student demands £20. She replies, “I just cleaned your window,” prompting him to respond, “you just did a quick wipe. Look, I’m confused – £20?” To this, she insists, “yeah, I mean that is the cost of living.”The exchange escalates as the student blocks the car, warning, “You will have to knock me if you want to leave,” and refusing to let him go without paying. The owner then calls her a “robber,” saying, “this is what robbers look like nowadays apparently.”The video has triggered sharp reactions online, with many users labeling it as “scripted” or “staged” for social media engagement. One user wrote, “Isn’t she the same girl who hit a parked car for insurance, just realised even that was staged.” Another commented, “Staged, this girl appeared in so many videos like this. But it’s not cool as she is damaging the image of India and many people don’t know that it’s just an act. ”Such staged “street encounter” clips, according to users, have become a rising trend on social media, blurring the line between authentic incidents and content created purely for clout.","A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20.

Plymouth: The UK’s healthiest midlifers and their lifestyle patterns

Diet and lifestyle: Key drivers of healthy ageing and longevity



Purpose, relationships, and mental wellness: Building a long, fulfilling life



Midlife clarity: Knowing your health inside out

Practical health steps for midlifers

Exercise snacking: Short bursts of 3–5 minutes of activity during work or daily routines help maintain strength and mobility.

Sleep optimization: Aim for around seven hours of restorative sleep nightly to support cognitive and physical health.

Mindful eating: Focus on a plant-rich diet, follow the 80 percent rule, and avoid overconsumption of processed foods and red meat.

Purpose and social connections: Invest in relationships, community, hobbies, and personal passions to enhance mental wellbeing.

Regular health checks: Utilize midlife health assessments and screenings to detect early changes and maintain control over long-term health.

Lessons from global Blue Zones applied to the UK

By the sea in southwest England, a surprising trend is emerging—residents of Plymouth are living longer, healthier lives than most of their UK peers. According to a Daily Mail report on the Midlife Clarity Index study by Vista Health, Plymouth stands out as the UK city with the healthiest midlifers—people in their 40s, 50s, and 60s who enjoy strong health, low incidence of chronic disease, and overall wellbeing. This mirrors global Blue Zones, such as Okinawa in Japan, Sardinia in Italy, Nicoya in Costa Rica, Ikaria in Greece, and Loma Linda in California, where lifestyle, diet, and community bonds play a decisive role in extended lifespans and higher quality of life.Blue Zones are regions where people consistently live beyond 100 while experiencing lower rates of heart disease, diabetes, and dementia as reported by Daily Mail. Studies of these areas reveal nine shared habits, called the “Power Nine”: consistent physical activity integrated into daily life, diets rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, moderate alcohol consumption, deep family ties, strong social engagement, stress reduction practices, spiritual or purposeful living, and the avoidance of overeating. These lifestyle habits collectively reduce inflammation, improve gut health, and enhance mental and physical resilience, contributing to longevity and happiness.The Midlife Clarity Index, which surveyed 7,000 adults aged 40 to 65 across 17 UK cities, used metrics such as diet, exercise, alcohol use, stress management, and sleep quality to rank midlife health. Plymouth topped the list thanks to strong scores for daily activity, high intake of fruits and vegetables, and sufficient restorative sleep. Midlifers in Plymouth typically engage in around two hours of exercise weekly—not including walking, gardening, or other routine movement. This combination of plant-rich diet, regular physical activity, and stress management mirrors global longevity practices and positions residents for longer, healthier lives.A plant-focused diet is central to long life, with Blue Zone research showing that beans, legumes, whole grains, and seasonal vegetables form the core of daily meals. Meat is eaten sparingly, often only a few times a month, while the “80 per cent rule” prevents overeating and promotes mindful consumption. As reported by the Daily Mail, Plymouth’s midlifers are increasingly following these principles, boosting gut health, immunity, and reducing inflammation. Combined with gentle but consistent physical activity and seven hours of sleep nightly, these habits strengthen cardiovascular health, support cognitive function, and lower risks of type 2 diabetes, stroke, and other age-related conditions.Longevity is not just about diet and exercise; mental wellbeing and social engagement are equally critical. Health experts quoted by the Daily Mail highlight that maintaining meaningful relationships and investing in community connections can reduce the likelihood of dementia by up to 50 percent and extend life expectancy. Plymouth’s midlifers benefit from strong social networks, hobbies, volunteering, and pursuing passions that provide purpose, mirroring the concept of ikigai from Okinawa, Japan—a reason for being that nurtures both mental and emotional health.Vista Health’s Midlife Clarity Index emphasizes that midlife is the ideal time to take control of your health. In your 40s, 50s, and 60s, your body sends new signals—changes in sleep, energy, stress response, and recovery time—making this the right moment to pause and evaluate wellbeing. Common issues like back pain, knee discomfort, heart or prostate concerns, or unexplained symptoms can be assessed through trusted diagnostic scans and health checks. Vista Health provides private midlife health assessments, from full-body MRI scans to ultrasounds, helping individuals understand risks and take proactive steps before issues become limiting.The study highlights several actionable habits that midlifers can adopt:While the UK has no official Blue Zones, Plymouth demonstrates that adopting the principles of longevity—balanced diet, regular natural movement, social connection, meaningful purpose, and restorative sleep—can significantly improve health outcomes. By integrating these habits into daily life and using tools like Vista Health’s midlife assessments, individuals can reduce health risks, remain mentally sharp, and increase the likelihood of reaching 100. The findings emphasize that longevity is accessible to the broader population, not just elite biohackers or billionaires, and that small, consistent lifestyle choices have a profound impact on wellbeing.","The Midlife Clarity Index surveyed 7,000 adults aged 40 to 65 across 17 UK cities.

in towns like Rotherham and Rochdale, which left many convinced that working-class girls are abandoned by the state. Distrust of authority: The perception that police and courts fail to protect the vulnerable, forcing communities to fend for themselves.

The far-right remix



Who is the man in the video?



He lives in a council property with his wife, Fatos Yulianova, 19, and their eight-month-old baby.

He first worked in a St Andrews restaurant after arriving in Scotland, and has studied English in Wales.

Police Scotland confirmed there is no evidence he committed any offence.

Daily Mail

“I never touched her. I didn’t hit her, I swear on my life. I have a baby now. I would never hurt someone.”

“I am not an illegal migrant. I have not done anything. I am a human not an animal.”

“If I did hurt the girl, why didn’t the police arrest me? They saw from CCTV I was stopped from going to the shop.”

Police response and political pushback



A familiar pattern



The law and the paradox of self-defence



Why it matters



A child in the spotlight: A 12-year-old has been thrust into a national culture war.

Disinformation at scale: Dumana, a young Bulgarian father, was smeared as an “illegal migrant” within hours.

Cultural resonance: The Braveheart analogy shows how Scotland frames defiance — but reality is more complex.

The risk of unrest: As with Southport, unchecked narratives risk spilling into real-world violence.

The bottom line



On August 23, a clip filmed in Dundee’s Lochee area went viral: a schoolgirl wielding a knife and an axe, shouting at a man while another girl tried to hold her back. Within hours, the footage had been amplified by figures like Tommy Robinson and Elon Musk, who claimed the man was a “migrant” and used the incident to fuel anti-immigration anger. The girl, aged 12, was later charged with possession of offensive weapons.The Dundee video resonated because it carried three explosive elements:For supporters online, the girl was not just a child with a knife — she was a symbol of Britain’s deeper failings.The far-right narrative was quick to take shape: a “native girl” defending her sister from a predatory foreigner. Robinson and Musk implied that the man was fresh off a “small boats” crossing, and online forums branded the girl a modern Braveheart figure, standing against an “alien threat.”The imagery tapped into Scotland’s enduring mythos of defiance — though in reality, this was not a Mel Gibson war epic, but a grim confrontation on a housing estate verge.The man wrongly cast as a migrant predator has now been identified as Fatos Ali Dumana, 21, a Bulgarian national who has lived in Dundee since 2021.Speaking to the, Dumana rejected the claims against him:Police Scotland said the girl has been charged and will be referred to the relevant authorities.They stressed that “misinformation” about Dumana’s status was false. Former Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf was more blunt, dismissing the far-right framing: “Who would have guessed the far right were full of bulls**.”*The Dundee incident follows a pattern seen before. In Southport in 2024, riots erupted after false claims spread about a stabbing suspect’s identity. The choreography is familiar: partial facts, viral amplification, political reframing — and a local clash becomes a national flashpoint.UK law bans minors from carrying knives. While self-defence is legally recognised, “reasonable force” rarely extends to waving a blade in public.This creates a paradox. In the eyes of the law, the girl is a child charged with a weapons offence. In the eyes of many online, she is a victim forced into self-defence.The grooming gang shadow: Old scandals mean new incidents are viewed through the lens of institutional failure.A Saturday evening confrontation in Dundee has been transformed into a parable of Britain’s anxieties. A child has been charged, while a Bulgarian man — wrongly accused online — insists he has done nothing wrong. The myths travelled faster than the facts, merging grooming gang trauma, immigration fears, and Scottish defiance into a viral storm. The Braveheart echoes explain the emotional charge, but the truth is simpler: a frightened girl, a family man, and a country still fighting its culture wars.","A 12-year-old girl has been thrust into a national culture war.

‘Aided the rape epidemic of their own people’: Elon Musk renews attacks on UK officials over grooming gang scandal; pledges to fund legal action,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/aided-the-rape-epidemic-of-their-own-people-elon-musk-renews-attacks-on-uk-officials-over-grooming-gang-scandal-pledges-to-fund-legal-action/articleshow/123542975.cms,"File photo: Elon Musk (Picture credit: AP)

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reignited controversy in Britain by calling for prosecutions of officials accused of failing to stop grooming gangs, following fresh claims that child sexual exploitation has taken place across dozens of local authorities.In a post on X, Musk wrote, “Start by condemning the grovelers and collaborators in positions of authority in Britain who aided the rape epidemic of their own people or turned a blind eye to their responsibilities. Both civil and criminal prosecutions.”His comment came in response to a user who shared the photo of a 14-year-old girl arrested in Dundee after allegedly carrying a bladed weapon, as reported by The Courier.The user had claimed teenage girls were resorting to defending themselves from rape, accusing police of failing to protect victims.Earlier, Musk replied to British MP Rupert Lowe, who chairs an unofficial “Rape Gang Inquiry.” Quoting Lowe’s findings, Musk posted: “85 cities in Britain where local authorities were complicit in the rape of children …”Lowe had announced that his inquiry uncovered evidence of gang-based sexual exploitation in 85 local authorities, describing it as “one of the most comprehensive exposés of the rape gang scandal to date.”He said the inquiry had received testimonies from survivors and families, alongside thousands of Freedom of Information requests.Musk has also pledged to fund legal action against “corrupt officials” accused of covering up abuse. In a separate post, he wrote: “I would like to help fund legal actions against corrupt officials who aided and abetted the rape of Britain, per the official government inquiry.”The billionaire later posted an image of the national flag of England, fuelling speculation about his intent to continue intervening in the debate.The issue of grooming gangs has gained renewed prominence since June, when Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer agreed to a government-backed national inquiry, reversing Labour’s earlier stance. Survivors and campaigners have since pressed the government to deliver on promises of justice.Lowe said his team’s research shows the problem stretches back to the 1960s and spans towns and cities across the UK. “The message from survivors is clear: get on with it. There have been too many broken promises,” he said, as cited by The Telegraph.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reignited controversy in Britain by calling for prosecutions of officials accused of failing to stop grooming gangs.

LONDON: Indian nationals in the UK saw the largest increase in sexual offence convictions here of all foreign nationals in the four years from 2021 to 2024, new data shows.There was a 257% increase in convictions of Indian nationals for sexual offences in Britain over the period, followed by Nigerian nationals who saw an increase of 166% and Iraqis (160% increase). Indians were convicted of 100 sexual offences in 2024 compared to 28 in 2021.UK’s ministry of justice (MoJ) said the data relates to sentencing occasions rather than individual offenders.The statistics were taken from MoJ data drawn from the Police National Computer and obtained by the think tank Centre for Migration Control via a freedom of information request to the MoJ.Indians had the third-highest increase in convictions for serious offences of all foreign nationals between 2021 and 2024 at 115%, with the second-highest being Algerian, and the highest being Egyptian. There was a total of 588 convictions of Indian nationals for serious offences in 2024 compared to 273 in 2021.This comes as new immigration data released by the home office shows that in 2024 a total of 293 Indian nationals arrived in the UK illegally via small boat and 206 have arrived between Jan and June this year. Indians are a tiny proportion, though, as the largest cohort last year came from Afghanistan, Iran and Syria.Indians made up 15% of illegal arrivals at UK ports in the year ending June 2025 when there were 5,474 asylum applications made by Indian nationals, of which, rounded to the nearest 100, 4,000 were made by those who had come to the UK on a legal visa, mostly study visas, 400 were made by those who came on small boats, and the rest entered through other means. For asylum initial decisions for Indians, 2,691 were refused in the year ending June 2025, while 20 were granted asylum, and the rest are awaiting a decision.Indians were the largest group to gain citizenship and received the highest number of work visas and tourist visas of any nationality in the year ending June 2025.

'I don’t understand Prince Harry’s anger': Butler challenges ‘evil stepmother’ Queen Camilla story — What really happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/i-dont-understand-prince-harrys-anger-butler-challenges-evil-stepmother-queen-camilla-story-what-really-happened/articleshow/123525991.cms,"Harry’s Private Note To Late Grandfather Prince Philip Sparks Backlash Online

The simmering tension between Prince Harry and Queen Camilla, long splashed across tabloids, has been reignited, but this time by someone unexpectedly in the middle of royal history. Former royal butler Grant Harrold, who served the monarchy for decades, is challenging the Duke of Sussex’s stark portrayal of his stepmother in his memoir Spare.In the explosive book, Harry branded Camilla “evil” and “wicked,” accusing her of tearing apart the family he cherished with Princess Diana. Yet Harrold’s recollections paint a different picture, one of warmth, laughter, and shared family moments.In his upcoming biography, The Royal Butler: My Remarkable Life of Royal Service, Harrold recounts the day Charles and Camilla wed in April 2005. “Charles and Camilla were catching a flight to head straight to Birkhall. We all went outside to wave them off and laughed as we saw William and Harry had decorated their car with ‘Just Married,’” he writes. He added that the brothers “raced after the car” as the couple drove off “through the arches to cheers,” a scene far removed from the cold animosity Harry described.Harrold insists he witnessed “no animosity” between Harry and Camilla. “The four of them, I promise you, got on so well. I saw them having dinners together, I saw them having drinks together, I saw them going to parties together,” he recalled.He also praised King Charles for his calm demeanor, noting, “He works hard and doesn’t suffer fools… he doesn’t once raise his voice.”A royal insider corroborated Harrold’s account, telling GB News that Harry seemed genuinely happy during the wedding celebrations and even took the lead in decorating his father’s Aston Martin. “I am sure there were mixed emotions over the years, but all I can tell you is how he seemed at the time,” the source said.Yet Harry’s memoir paints a more bitter picture. He claimed Camilla was “dangerous,” accused her of leaking details of his past drug use, and even compared her to the “wicked stepmothers in storybooks.” The stark contrast between Harry’s narrative and those who witnessed the events firsthand has sparked a debate over truth, perception, and memory within the royal family.As Harrold prepares to release his biography, royal watchers are left wondering: did Harry’s version of events obscure a more nuanced reality, or was it a reflection of long-held personal pain?","Former royal butler Grant Harrold is challenging Prince Harry's portrayal of his stepmother in his memoir Spare.

Three people were killed and one seriously injured after a helicopter crashed during a flight lesson on the Isle of Wight, off England’s south coast, on Monday morning, authorities said.The Robinson R44 II aircraft, operated by Northumbria Helicopters, had taken off from Sandown Airport around 9 am local time with a pilot and three passengers on board. It went down just before 9.30 am in a field near a road in the Shanklin area, reported AP.The survivor was airlifted to University Hospital Southampton’s trauma centre in serious condition, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary confirmed.Eyewitness Leigh Goldsmith told thehe saw the helicopter spiral into a hedge while driving nearby.In a statement, Shanklin Town Council said it was “shocked to hear about the incident involving a pleasure flight helicopter crash landing on the outskirts of the town”, reported BBC.The council also noted that the crash came during a busy bank holiday weekend, when several events were underway on the island — including the Isle of Wight Scooter Rally at Sandown Airport, which drew thousands of vintage scooter owners.The UK’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch has deployed inspectors to the crash site to gather evidence and determine the cause of the incident.","Robinson R44 II aircraft, operated by Northumbria Helicopters, had taken off from Sandown Airport around 9 am local time.

From feud to a possible reunion: Is a royal homecoming for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle with children on the cards?

Prince Invites King Charles Amid Hopes Of Reunion

For years, the rift between the royal family and the Sussexes has been the stuff of palace whispers, glossy magazine covers, and endless “sources close to” speculation. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have built a life on the other side of the Atlantic - swapping Buckingham Palace for Montecito mansions, royal duties for media deals, and the London fog for Californian sunshine. But is there a chance the family feud could finally ease? Some royal watchers say the door might just be creaking open.Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital that trust remains the sticking point. “I believe it to be totally correct that members of the royal family do not trust Meghan. And of course, she does not trust some members of the royal family in return,” he said.Still, Turner hinted that the narrative isn’t as black-and-white as it seems. “If every member of the royal family doesn’t trust Meghan, then why did King Charles instigate a meeting with his senior advisor and that of Harry and Meghan’s team? Is it all the royal family, or is it perhaps William?”Optimism, however, lingers. Turner hopes Harry, Meghan, and their children—Archie and Lilibet—will eventually be welcomed back “warmly” into the fold. Fellow commentator Ingrid Seward echoed the sentiment, telling Fox News Digital, “I feel that [this] won’t go on forever. I just feel that at some stage… they will begin to come together.”That said, Seward was quick to admit that Meghan remains deeply unpopular with hardcore royalists.The speculation is being fueled further by Harry’s scheduled trip to the UK in September. According to PEOPLE!, he’s set to appear at a charity event for WellChild, which supports children with life-limiting conditions.Whether this visit sparks a reunion with King Charles remains to be seen, but it has reignited questions about the Sussexes’ long-term ties to Britain.One factor pulling them back could be education.Former royal butler Grant Harrold told Style Caster that Harry may want Archie and Lilibet to experience the same schooling system he grew up with. “It’s very likely and it’s completely possible… But then it depends on how the relationship is with the rest of the family when the time comes.”But here’s the royal-sized hurdle: security. In ITV’s Tabloids on Trial, Harry admitted that safety concerns are the main reason Meghan avoids the UK. “They are genuine concerns for me… It's one of the reasons why I won’t bring my wife back to this country,” he said.A source close to him doubled down in Us Weekly: “He’ll always be fond of his home country, but the way he views it, his wife and kids are his priority.”","Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner says trust remains the sticking point.

What the law actually allows

Royal Lodge context (often bundled into the rumors)

Where public opinion sits

What could change in the next reign

A new sovereign could:

Maintain the 2022 limits;

Tighten style/usage via letters patent (e.g., continued non-use of HRH); or

Ask ministers to explore legislation if removing a peerage were desired.

Bottom line

Facts today:

Talk has picked up again about what happens to Prince Andrew’s titles in the next reign. Several outlets claim Prince William wants a tougher line and could look at further steps once he is king. There is no official plan on record; the stories rely on unnamed sources and remain unconfirmed.In January 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages were returned to the Queen and that he would not undertake public duties; at the same time, briefings confirmed he would no longer use the HRH style in an official capacity. He remains Duke of York and holds no front-line duties. None of that has changed.Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and, in some tellings, press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision.A dukedom is a peerage, which is a legal dignity. Removing a peerage requires an Act of Parliament; the House of Lords Library is explicit on this point. The last time Parliament provided a mechanism to strip titles was the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, drafted for wartime enemies, hardly a ready tool for modern scandal.Any fresh action would almost certainly need new legislation.By contrast, styles (like HRH) sit within the sovereign’s power to define by letters patent, hence the 1917 letters patent that limited who is HRH. Using letters patent to refine style/usage is established; using them to annul a peerage would collide with statute and convention. In practice, government-backed legislation is the clean route for removing a dukedom.Prince Andrew holds a 75-year Crown Estate lease on Royal Lodge dating from 2003. Changing his residence would be a landlord-tenant and lease issue, not a simple royal edict. Reporting about pressure to move has see-sawed, but the legal baseline is the lease itself.Recent polling shows strong support for going further: 67% of Britons say Andrew should be stripped of his remaining titles; only 13% are opposed. That mood is real but policy still comes down to law and process.Any move to remove a dukedom would prompt debates on due process, precedent, and where to draw the line for other peers.Andrew does not use HRH, holds no military roles or active patronages, and retains the Duke of York title. Any further step is not something a monarch can do “on a whim”; it would almost certainly require Parliament. Until a legal route exists and is pursued, this remains talk, not policy.","Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision.

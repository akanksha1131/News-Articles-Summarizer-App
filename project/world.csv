US President Donald Trump on Sunday claimed that a deal over the future of TikTok in the United States was nearly finalised but China pulled back in response to new American tariffs.Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump said Beijing's change of stance came after Washington slapped an additional 34 per cent tariff on all Chinese imports last week.""The report is that we had a deal, pretty much for TikTok, not a deal, but pretty close, and then China changed the deal because of tariffs. If I gave a little cut in tariffs, they'd approve that deal in 15 minutes, which shows you the power of tariffs,"" he said.The president's comments follow his decision on Friday to extend the deadline for TikTok to find a non-Chinese buyer by another 75 days. The video-sharing platform, which has more than 170 million users in the US, is facing potential shutdown under a law passed last year that mandates its separation from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance .Trump has previously said his administration was working on a deal that would involve multiple investors to keep TikTok operating in the country, though he has provided few specifics.ByteDance, for its part, confirmed ongoing discussions with US government but said ""key matters"" still needed to be resolved. In a statement, the company noted that no agreement had been finalised and emphasised that any arrangement would also be ""subject to approval under Chinese law.""",US President Donald Trump said a deal over the future of TikTok in the United States was nearly finalised.

Global markets crash as Donald Trump tariff blitz sparks panic and retaliation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/global-markets-crash-as-donald-trump-tariff-blitz-sparks-panic-and-retaliation/articleshow/120049303.cms,"Representative AI image generated by Denny

NEW DELHI: Asian stock markets nosedived on Monday as global financial turmoil deepened, triggered by US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs and China’s retaliatory measures. With fears of a full-blown trade war mounting, US futures pointed to further losses on Wall Street, compounding Friday’s historic meltdown.Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 fell 7.1% in early trade after briefly plunging nearly 8%, while Taiwan’s benchmark index slumped close to 10%. South Korea’s Kospi lost 5.5%, Australia’s ASX 200 dropped 6.3%, and Singapore tumbled 8.5%, signalling widespread panic across Asia. The ASX 200 also hit its lowest level in almost 15 months.The sharp sell-off followed Wall Street’s worst single-day performance since the Covid-19 pandemic. On Friday, the S&P 500 fell 6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 5.5%, and the Nasdaq slid 5.8%, erasing trillions in market value.Analysts estimate that over $9 trillion has been wiped off global stock markets in just two days, drawing comparisons to the 2008 financial crisis. Investor confidence has evaporated following China’s decision to impose a 34% tariff on all US imports beginning April 10, intensifying fears of prolonged economic disruption .Meanwhile, US crude dipped below $60 per barrel for the first time since April 2021, and the dollar weakened to 145.98 yen, indicating a rush towards traditional safe-haven assets.Despite the mounting turmoil, Donald Trump remained unapologetic and said, “Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” denying he was deliberately fuelling a market collapse. Speaking aboard Air Force One, he insisted countries were eager to negotiate: “They’re dying to make a deal.”The latest wave of chaos was set off after Beijing retaliated Friday, matching Trump's tariffs with its own 34% levy on all US imports starting April 10. China’s Commerce Ministry called it a direct response to the US's aggressive trade measures.Senior officials in Washington struck a defiant tone even as they confirmed outreach from dozens of countries. “More than 50 countries have reached out to the president to begin a negotiation,” said Kevin Hassett, head of the White House National Economic Council, noting that Vietnam had already requested a 45-day delay on tariffs.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added, “At this moment he’s created maximum leverage for himself... I think we’re going to have to see what the countries offer, and whether it’s believable.”Jerome Powell, Chair of the US Federal Reserve, warned the trade war could lead to “higher inflation and lower growth,” signalling limited room for interest rate cuts. Trump, however, fired back: “CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!”Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose country was hit with 17% tariffs, was due in Washington Monday for emergency talks. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, in an op-ed, warned that “the world as we knew it has gone,” and that future stability would depend on “deals and alliances.”Markets in Saudi Arabia, which remained open on Sunday, were also battered—plunging 6.78%, the worst daily loss since the pandemic. Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his government was bracing for more turmoil. “You can’t change global events. What you can do is prepare for them,” he said.Economists have warned that tariffs could trigger price hikes at home, a charge the Trump administration denies. “I don’t think that you’re going to see a big effect on the consumer in the US,” Hassett insisted.Larry Summers, former economic adviser to President Obama, said, “There is a very good chance there’s going to be more turbulence in markets the way we saw on Thursday and Friday.”Yet Trump struck an optimistic note. “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH,” he wrote on social media. He later added: “Some day people will realize that Tariffs, for the United States of America, are a very beautiful thing!”Wall Street, however, painted a bleaker picture. Companies deeply connected with China suffered severe losses—DuPont plunged 12.7% after Chinese regulators launched an anti-trust investigation, and GE Healthcare fell 16%, as 12% of its revenue comes from China.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve faces a dilemma: rate cuts could cushion economic damage, but may also stoke inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned, “Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored... [and ensure] a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.”","Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 7.1% in early trade after briefly plunging nearly 8%.

Trump defends tariffs, takes questions from reporters aboard Air Force One

US President Donald Trump on Sunday doubled down on his decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from around the world, saying he would not back off unless trade imbalances with the US were addressed.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump acknowledged the economic uncertainty caused by the tariffs but said the move was necessary for long-term stability.When asked, ""Is there pain in the market at some point you're unwilling to tolerate?""""I think your question is so stupid,"" Trump reacted fiercely to the reporter's question.""I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something and we have been treated so badly by other countries,"" Trump said, referring to the sharp market downturn triggered by his trade moves.The president's comments came as global markets braced for further volatility, with US stock futures plunging Sunday evening; Dow and S&P 500 futures dropped nearly 4 per cent, while Nasdaq futures fell nearly 5 per cent. Bitcoin also declined about 6 per cent.Despite rising fears of a recession, Trump showed no signs of backing down. ""They're dying to make a deal,"" he said of world leaders, adding, ""We're not going to have deficits with your country. We're going to have surpluses or, at worst, going to be breaking even.""Treasury secretary Scott Bessent said these were not issues that could be resolved overnight and that the US would assess offers carefully.Top economic adviser Kevin Hassett admitted that some countries were retaliating but claimed more than 50 nations had approached the White House to start negotiations.While Trump spent the weekend golfing in Florida, his administration worked to defend the tariffs publicly. ""There doesn't have to be a recession,"" Bessent said. ""What we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity.""Trump also took to social media to rally support, posting, ""WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy.""","US President Donald Trump doubled down on his decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from around the world.

"After Trump’s tariffs, stocks plunged but penguin memes ticked up",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/after-trumps-tariffs-stocks-plunged-but-penguin-memes-ticked-up/articleshow/120048973.cms,"The Trump administration this week levied sweeping tariffs across the globe, provoking retaliation from other countries and sending the stock market tumbling. An unexpected consequence? Penguin memes .Images of the flightless birds have waddled their way across the internet this week after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Heard Island and McDonald Islands , Australian territories near Antarctica that are home to many penguins but no people.One meme featured an altered photo of the explosive February White House meeting in which Trump and Vice President JD Vance publicly clashed with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine. Instead of a fiery confrontation with the wartime leader, however, Trump and Vance sit next to a black-and-white bird.One person who posted the meme wrote, ""Maybe it didn't say thank you?"" in a possible reference to Vance's accusation that Zelenskyy had not appropriately thanked the United States for the military support Washington had provided Ukraine throughout the war.A different meme showed a penguin teaching sea gulls to aim their waste at Teslas, an apparent nod to Trump's billionaire adviser, Elon Musk. Yet another showed a huge gathering of penguins with a caption citing ""Unprecedented protests"" on Heard Island and McDonald Islands, ""as the population rises up"" against Trump's imposition of across-the-board tariffs.The UNESCO World Heritage Convention notes the islands' ""complete absence of alien plants and animals, as well as human impact."" Still, Trump included the desolate islands on his list, imposing the 10% baseline tariff he placed on nearly all goods imported into the United States.The Wednesday announcement, which Trump described as America's ""Liberation Day,"" sent shock waves across the world as both allies and adversaries scrambled to make sense of the new and hefty tariffs. The move has shot U.S. import duties to the highest levels in more than a century.Also slotted for new tariffs were the British Indian Ocean Territory, a collection of mostly uninhabited islands, save for U.S. and British soldiers stationed on joint military bases.Other islands subjected to tariffs included Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand that has fewer than 2,000 inhabitants; the Norwegian islands of Svalbard, which has about 3,000 residents; and Jan Mayen, where the only humans are the military personnel who operate a weather and coastal services station.Trump has said little about the methodology behind the new system of calculations, but each country's new tariff rate appeared to come from a formula that takes the trade deficit America runs with a nation and divides it by the exports that country sent into the United States. The White House explained its methodology in this post, which essentially confirms that formula.Then, because Trump said he was being ""kind,"" the final tariff number was cut in half.It is not clear how the administration decided to add Heard Island and McDonald Islands to the list of tariffs. The White House did not immediately respond to request for comment.","Penguin memes flood the internet after U.S. tariffs on Australian islands.

A 14-year-old Palestinian-American boy was shot and killed by Israeli forces during an incident in the West Bank town of Turmus Ayya on Sunday, Palestinian officials said, with Israeli authorities claiming he was among a group of “terrorists” hurling rocks at cars on a nearby highway.According to the town’s mayor, Adeeb Lafi, the teenager, Omar Muhammad Saadeh Rabee , was shot at the town’s entrance along with two other teens.Mayor Lafi told Reuters the Israeli army later declared Omar dead after detaining him.As per AFP, the Palestinian Red Crescent confirmed its teams transported the teenager’s body to hospital and reported that two other boys were also wounded, one in the abdomen and the other in the thigh. Both were 14 years old, and one of them, Ayoub Asaad, also holds US citizenship, his father told AFP.The Israeli military issued a statement saying soldiers opened fire after spotting “three terrorists who hurled rocks toward the highway, thus endangering civilians driving.” It said one of the suspects was “eliminated” and two others were wounded.However, the Palestinian foreign ministry strongly condemned the incident, describing it as an “extra-judicial killing” and accusing Israel of “continued impunity.” The ministry further criticised the use of live fire against children , saying Israel’s actions encouraged “further crimes.”Violence in the occupied West Bank has intensified since the Gaza war began on October 7, 2023.According to Palestinian health authorities, at least 918 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers since then, including militants. Meanwhile, Israeli sources say 33 Israelis, including soldiers, have died during raids and attacks in the same period.The town of Turmus Ayya, northeast of Ramallah, is known for its large community of dual Palestinian-American citizens. Witness accounts, such as that of Abdul Rahman Shehadeh, one of the injured teens, contradicted the Israeli military’s version.He told AFP he was collecting fruit when he was shot by a soldier.The father of Ayoub Asaad also claimed their ambulance was delayed at a checkpoint, and that a soldier told him he was the one who shot the three boys.Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967, and clashes between settlers, armed Palestinians, and Israeli forces have grown more frequent, especially since the escalation in Gaza.","Omar Muhammad Saadeh Rabee, 14, was shot and killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank town of Turmus Ayya on Sunday.

Lawyers advise Canadians to keep a burner phone

Canada has again updated its travel advisory for the United States, including a warning to prospective travelers that they should be prepared for scrutiny from border patrol officers. The updated advisory says US authorities can check electronic devices like phones and laptops. ""Comply and be forthcoming in all interactions with border authorities. If you are denied entry. you could be detained while awaiting deportation,"" the new advice read.This is the second major update of Canada's travel rules for the US. The first came as the US made it mandatory for all Canadians staying in the US for more than 30 days to register with the US administration. This new rule is effective from April 11.The mandatory registration rules come from an executive order issued by President Donald Trump on his first day in office, directing the Department of Homeland Security to ensure non-citizens comply with the Immigration and Nationality Act. The law requires “all aliens 14 years of age or older who were not registered and fingerprinted (if required) when applying for a US visa and who remain in the United States for 30 days or longer” to do so, according to the USCIS website. Parents and legal guardians of children under 14 must make sure they are registered.Canada issued a warning about the stricter border checks before the new rule took effect.""Individual border agents often have significant discretion in making those determinations. US authorities strictly enforce entry requirements. Expect scrutiny at ports of entry, including of electronic devices. Comply and be forthcoming in all interactions with border authorities.

No, I oppose his view. Yes, I support his view.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to acknowledge the reasoning behind US President Donald Trump’s latest push for tariffs, even as he maintains that such protectionist measures are the wrong approach, according to The Times.In a speech due to be delivered on Sunday, the Labour leader is set to announce that he recognises why Trump's economic nationalism resonates with many voters. However, he will also argue that tariffs ultimately do more harm than good.“Trump has done something that we don’t agree with but there’s a reason why people are behind him on this,” a spokesperson for the Prime Minister told The Times.“The world has changed, globalization is over and we are now in a new era. We’ve got to demonstrate that our approach, a more active Labour government, a more reformist government, can provide the answers for people in every part of this country,” the spokesperson added, quoted by the New York Post.Starmer will also throw light on what he sees as the end of globalisation, saying that free trade and mass migration, once considered cornerstones of modern economic policy, have failed large sections of the voters.Although Starmer has not yet spoken to President Trump about the newly announced tariffs, he did raise the issue with French President Emmanuel Macron during a phone call on Saturday. Both leaders reportedly agreed that a trade war would benefit no one, though “nothing should be off the table,” according to the report.Trump’s sweeping new tariffs, announced on Wednesday, include a 10% levy on all goods imported from the UK, part of a broader strategy targeting almost every country in the world.","UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to acknowledge the reasoning behind US President Donald Trump's latest push for tariffs.

US Senator Bernie Sanders has intensified his criticism of America’s political and economic system, warning that the United States is moving “rapidly toward oligarchy” and calling it a "" pseudo-democracy "" in which billionaires wield disproportionate power over governance.At 83, Sanders is still drawing massive crowds to rallies, energising a new wave of opposition to US President Donald Trump and those backing him financially and politically.As per CBS News, Sanders directly named Elon Musk and Donald Trump as figures driving what he views as a dangerous shift in American democracy. “You can thank Elon Musk and Trump for that,” he said, adding, “These guys, led by Musk... have now allowed billionaires essentially to own our political process.”The senator blamed the Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling for enabling this system, where “you get one vote, and Elon Musk can spend $270 million to help elect Trump.”Sanders, an independent from Vermont who previously ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, remains outside the traditional party structure. He has long criticised both Republicans and Democrats for failing to represent working-class Americans. “Sixty percent of our people are living paycheck-to-paycheck. Media doesn't talk about it. We don't talk about it enough here in Congress,” he said.In his interview with CBS, Sanders also took aim at major law firms allegedly reaching financial settlements with the Trump administration . “Absolute cowardice,” he said, accusing firms of selling their souls to maintain influence in Washington.He dismissed any notion of Trump’s third-term talk as a joke. “They don’t believe in the Constitution. So yeah, I would take that seriously,” Sanders said, describing the situation as not just political, but a “moral and constitutional crisis.”Reflecting on his own past, Sanders said his activism stems from growing up in a working-class Jewish family in Brooklyn. “We were never poor; my father worked all the time, just never had any money,” he said. The Holocaust’s lingering presence in his community, including survivors with camp tattoos, shaped his fight against racism and injustice.Despite not being a Democrat, Sanders remains a prominent voice on the left. When asked what the Democratic Party needs to hear, he replied, “Why has the working class in this country largely turned away from them?” He warned the party must choose whether to chase big-money donors or stand with workers.As for a potential 2028 presidential run , Sanders laughed off the idea. “Little bit old to be worrying about those things,” he said, but added that speaking to people across the country is what “keeps me going.”",US Senator Bernie Sanders has intensified his criticism of America’s political and economic system.

Toxic ocean sends sea lions into frenzy; swimmers and surfers under threat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/toxic-ocean-sends-sea-lions-into-frenzy-swimmers-and-surfers-under-threat/articleshow/120049882.cms,"File photo

Along roughly 70 miles of Southern California’s coastline, an alarming number of sea lions are turning aggressive, leaving experts scrambling for answers as the typically friendly marine mammals bite swimmers and surfers. The underlying cause, scientists believe, is not malice—but poisoning from their own ocean habitat.At the Marine Mammal Care Center in Los Angeles, staff are facing an unprecedented crisis. “The sea lions are coming in almost comatose by the time they’re stranding. Something is happening in this particular bloom that seems worse on multiple levels,” CEO John Warner told CNN.“But volume-wise, it’s definitely the worst we’ve ever seen.”Toxic algal blooms , commonly referred to as red tides , are likely behind the troubling behavior. These blooms produce domoic acid , a neurological toxin that makes its way up the food chain and into the diets of marine animals.“When they are affected with this toxin, they’re out of their minds,” Warner explained CNN. “They’re scared. They’re totally disoriented and frightened. They really don’t understand where they are. They’re struggling to even get out of the water, so they don’t drown.”The toxicity causes symptoms like breathing difficulty and seizures, including one known as ""stargazing"" in which sea lions unnaturally tilt their heads backward with closed eyes. In this state, the animals may act erratically, even aggressively. “If someone swims or walks next to them and they don’t see the animal or the animal doesn’t see them, that’s where some negative interactions can take place,” Warner warned.One of the victims, 15-year-old Pheobe Beltran, was finishing a 1,000-yard swim during junior lifeguard tryouts in Long Beach on March 30 when she was suddenly bitten. “I was just so scared, so shocked, but I still felt the immense pain on my arms, like, over and over again,” Beltran said. Though her arms are bruised and scratched, she did not need stitches.Another terrifying encounter took place days earlier in Ventura County, where surfer RJ LaMendola had a near-disastrous run-in near Oxnard. “The sea lion erupted from the water, hurtling toward me at top speed,” he wrote on social media. “Its expression was feral, almost demonic, devoid of the curiosity or playfulness I’d always associated with sea lions.” He described it as a “harrowing and traumatic experience” and said the animal even stalked him back to shore.This year has been especially brutal for dolphins as well. “There’s no rehabilitation that’s going to work with dolphins,” Warner said. “Most of the time when they strand, they’re already deceased. The ones that are struggling on the beaches that are seizing... the best thing we can do is humanely euthanize them which, unfortunately, we’ve had to do more than we’ve ever done before.”So far in 2024, the center has already treated 240 animals—just short of its annual budgeted capacity of 300. In addition to treatment, the budget must cover food, medicine, staff salaries, and even disposal of deceased animals. In just five weeks, the center has received over 2,000 emergency calls—far beyond the usual 3,000–4,000 seen annually.Warner also noted that many of the affected animals are coming from the Channel Islands, which are the main breeding grounds for California sea lions. “This seems to be the epicenter of these domoic acid events the last four years,” he said. About 85% of California sea lions are born in that region every June.Twenty dolphins have been found still alive after stranding this year, but many were already too ill to survive.The increasing severity of these toxic events—and their deadly consequences—have experts deeply concerned, not just for marine life, but for beachgoers along California’s coast.","Toxic algal blooms are likely behind the troubling behavior.

‘Psychotic’ mom who drowned toddlers for ‘religious cleansing’ ruled not guilty by insanity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/psychotic-mom-who-drowned-toddlers-for-religious-cleansing-ruled-not-guilty-by-insanity/articleshow/120049373.cms,"Representative photo

A New Jersey woman who killed her two daughters in what she described as a “religious” act to purify the world has been found not guilty by reason of insanity. The ruling, delivered last week by Superior Court Judge Guy Ryan, acknowledged Naomi Elkins ’ responsibility for the deaths but deemed her criminally insane at the time of the murders.Elkins, 27, drowned her daughters—aged 1 and 3—in the bathtub of their Lakewood home on June 25. According to prosecutors, she had picked them up from Giggles Daycare, where she also worked, before fatally stabbing the younger child and then drowning her.When the older child witnessed the horror and attempted to hide in a separate bathroom, Elkins followed, started a second bath, and drowned her as well.Psychologist Gianni Pirelli, who testified during the trial, said Elkins suffered from postpartum psychosis and believed she was either the Messiah or a descendant of Hitler. “She thought that if she destroyed her children, she would be destroying all the evil in the world,” he explained.Authorities said Elkins had admitted to the killings, telling investigators she counted to 50 multiple times while holding each child underwater to make sure they were dead. A letter she wrote to her daughters was described as reading “more as a letter to God,” according to Pirelli.“She was undoubtedly psychotic,” he told the court.After committing the murders, Elkins contacted Hatzolah Medical Services and confessed that she had harmed her children. Both were declared dead at the scene.Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley Billhimer did not contest the insanity ruling. Judge Ryan sentenced Elkins to two life terms—equating to 150 years in a secure psychiatric facility, as mandated under state law. Defense attorney Mitchell Ansell stated that her mental condition will be regularly assessed by the court. Elkins will remain institutionalized unless she is deemed no longer a threat to herself or others.","Naomi Elkins, 27, drowned her daughters, aged 1 and 3, in the bathtub of their Lakewood, New Jersey, home on June 25.

Gay asylum seeker deported to El Salvador prison under Trump crackdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gay-asylum-seeker-deported-to-el-salvador-prison-under-trump-crackdown/articleshow/120048819.cms,"AP photo/ For representational purpose

Andry Hernandez Romero , a Venezuelan makeup artist and member of the LGBTQ+ community, came to the United States last year seeking asylum after facing threats in his home country due to his sexuality and political beliefs. After a treacherous journey through the perilous Darien Gap and into Mexico, he legally presented himself at a US border crossing near San Diego and was taken into custody to await the outcome of his asylum application.Romero had passed a credible fear interview—an initial screening in the asylum process—which determined that his claim had merit. “And the government had found that his threats against him were credible and that he had a real probability of winning an asylum claim,” said Lindsay Toczylowski, his attorney.But just weeks ago, Romero vanished from the legal process. ""Our client, who was in the middle of seeking asylum, just disappeared. One day he was there, and the next day we're supposed to have court, and he wasn't brought to court,"" Toczylowski added.Romero is among 238 Venezuelan migrants transferred to El Salvador's high-security Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) under a new deportation agreement between the Trump administration and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. President Trump, who has vowed to dismantle the Venezuelan criminal organization Tren de Aragua, utilized the Alien Enemies Act—unused since WWII—to justify the deportations, branding the individuals as terrorists and gang members.Since being flown to El Salvador, Romero’s legal team and loved ones have been unable to contact him. Images captured by Time magazine photographer Philip Holsinger show Romero inside CECOT. Holsinger recalled hearing a man cry out, ""I'm not a gang member. I'm gay. I'm a stylist,"" before being slapped and forcibly shaved.""It's horrifying to see someone who we've met and know as a sweet, funny artist, in the most horrible conditions I could imagine,"" said Toczylowski, expressing deep concern for her client's safety. ""We have grave concerns about whether he can survive.""",Andry Hernandez Romero came to the United States last year seeking asylum after facing threats in his home country due to his sexuality and political beliefs.

President Trump defends tariffs, calling it 'economic revolution'

United States President Donald Trump doubled down on his tariff move, calling the retaliatory duties a ""beautiful thing"" that the Americans would ""realise someday"".Trump’s remarks followed a steep downturn in global financial markets, which seemed poised to extend their losses when trading reopened on Monday. His aides, meanwhile, attempted to calm investor fears, noting that over 50 countries had expressed interest in opening talks to remove the tariffs.Trump said the US has a ""massive financial deficit with China, the European Union and many others"", accusing predecessor Biden of growing surplus.""We have massive Financial Deficits with China, the European Union, and many others. The only way this problem can be cured is with TARIFFS, which are now bringing Tens of Billions of Dollars into the U.S.A. They are already in effect, and a beautiful thing to behold,"" he said on his social media platform TruthSocial.He further said: ""The Surplus with these Countries has grown during “Presidency” of Sleepy Joe Biden. We are going to reverse it, and reverse it QUICKLY. Some day people will realize that Tariffs, for the United States of America, are a very beautiful thing!""On April 02, Trump implemented a series of extensive tariffs aimed at restructuring US trade relationships and bolstering domestic industries. On April 2, dubbed ""Liberation Day,"" a universal 10% import duty was imposed on all goods entering the United States, with higher rates for 57 specific trading partners, including China, Canada, and Mexico. These increased tariffs were calculated based on existing trade deficits with each country, with the administration aiming to reduce these deficits to zero.Specifically, tariffs on Chinese imports were raised to an effective rate of 54% after April 9, intensifying the ongoing trade tensions between the two nations. Additionally, a 25% tariff on imported automobiles was enacted on April 3, affecting major auto-exporting countries.The administration justified these measures by citing the need to address trade imbalances, protect national security, and curb issues such as contraband drug trafficking. However, these actions have led to significant economic debates.Critics argue that the tariffs could lead to increased consumer prices , potential job losses in industries reliant on imports, and strained relationships with key trading partners. Some economists warn of the risk of a recession due to reduced consumer confidence and increased production costs.In response, countries like Canada, China, and the European Union have announced counter-tariffs , further escalating global trade tensions. Legal challenges are also emerging, questioning the extent of executive power in imposing such tariffs and their alignment with international trade laws .As these policies unfold, their long-term impact on the US economy and global trade dynamics remains a subject of close observation and analysis.","US President Donald Trump doubled down on his tariff move, calling the retaliatory duties a ""beautiful thing"" that the Americans would ""realise someday"" His remarks followed a steep downturn in global financial markets, which seemed poised to extend their losses when trading reopened on Monday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120051339,imgsize-1098856,width-400,resizemode-4/Trump-tariff.jpg"
Brooke Rollins: Who is Brooke Rollins? Trump’s agri secretary at heart of tariff policy debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-brooke-rollins-trumps-new-agri-secretary-at-heart-of-tariff-policy-debate/articleshow/120047032.cms,"File photo: US agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins (Pictur credit: AP)

Who is Brooke Rollins?

Brooke Leslie Rollins was officially sworn in as the 33rd secretary of agriculture in a private ceremony at the US supreme court.

Hailing from Glen Rose, Texas, she graduated from Texas A&M University, earning a degree in agricultural development . She went on to become the institution’s first female student body president, and later obtained her law degree with honours from the University of Texas School of Law.

Rollins presented a long and accomplished career in public policy, law, and agricultural advocacy to her new role.

Her early political experience included serving as policy director for then-governor Rick Perry, followed by a 15-year tenure as president of the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF). Rollins later founded and led the America First Policy Institute (AFPI).

During President Trump’s first term, she served as director of the domestic policy council and assistant to the president for strategic initiatives, where she also directed the office of American innovation, shaping major policies that the administration hailed as transformative for American families and communities.

Rollins and her husband, Mark, are parents to four children. The family lives in Fort Worth, Texas where much of their free time is spent at baseball games, cattle shows, piano recitals, and Aggie football matches.

US agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins, who took up the charge previous month, has stirred fresh debate over the future of US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs after her recent TV appearance. Rollins was seen dodging direct questions on whether the levies would remain in place.Speaking on CNN’s State of the Union, the agri secretary repeatedly stepsided anchor Jake Tapper’s attempts to pin down the administration’s long-term trade strategy .Tapper asked, “How long do you expect this tariff chaos is going to be going on? Thirty days? Sixty days? Ninety days?”However, rather than commit to a timeline, Rollins reiterated the administration’s stance on putting American interests first.She said that Trump’s tariff policies marked the beginning of a “new American order, the new American economic plan.”“So I think we’ll see in short order a really positive outcome from this. We already have 50, five- zero, 50 countries that have come to the table over the last few days, over the last weeks, that are willing and desperate to talk to us.” she said.“We are the economic engine of the world, and it’s finally time that someone, President Trump, stood up for America,” Rollins further added.“Our goal is to protect American farmers and workers — full stop,” she said. “President Trump’s approach to trade is about fairness and strength. These policies are part of a larger effort to reset broken trade relationships that have left rural America behind for far too long.”Earlier, Brooke Rollins , the US secretary of agriculture signed a major secretarial memo declaring an “emergency situation determination” across more than 112 million acres of national forest system land.The move issued on April 4 (local time) follows an executive order by US President Donald Trump aimed towards increasing timber production by 25 per cent and is designed to give the US forest service the authority to fast-track emergency measures to reduce wildfire risks.","Brooke Leslie Rollins was officially sworn in as the 33rd secretary of agriculture in a private ceremony at the US supreme court.

A 49-year-old man was shot by police on Sunday morning after he allegedly went on a violent rampage with a meat cleaver inside a Brooklyn apartment, slashing and stabbing four young girls before being confronted by officers.According to New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, the victims — aged 16, 13, 11, and 8 — sustained serious injuries but are expected to survive. As per news agency AP, the attack was reported around 10:15 am (local time) when the 11-year-old girl, wounded and terrified, locked herself in a room and called 911, saying her uncle had stabbed her and her siblings.The 911 operator used location tracking to pinpoint the address on 84th Street in Bensonhurst. When officers arrived, an uninjured boy led them inside. “At that point, the officers heard screams coming from behind the door to their left and immediately began forcing their way into the apartment,” Tisch said at a press briefing, reported CBS News.Inside, police encountered the suspect, identified as Long Qian Chen , holding a large bloodied meat cleaver. Officers repeatedly ordered him to drop the weapon, but he advanced toward them. “Two officers discharged their firearms, firing seven total rounds between them and striking the subject, ending the threat,” Tisch stated.Authorities also found a second bloodied knife at the scene. The suspect was rushed to hospital in critical condition. A motive is yet to be confirmed, but CBS News cited family members who said Chen has a history of mental illness.“This could have ended very differently,” Tisch noted, praising the 11-year-old for her bravery. “She hid in a room to call the police.” She also confirmed a fifth child, a young boy, ran outside to get help.As per the New York Post, disturbing images showed one of the girls covered in blood from head to toe outside the building. A neighbour, identified only as Maria, said, “I was shaking. I’m still shaking now… The two girls were just covered in blood.”Another neighbour, Humbert Huerta, saw the suspect being wheeled out: “They brought out a guy on a stretcher, all bloody without a shirt… They shot him twice.”Officials believe Chen may be the uncle or possibly the father of some of the children. Tisch confirmed the mother was not home at the time of the attack.State Assemblyman Lester Chang told reporters that one of the victims may have been a babysitter. The investigation is ongoing.","A 49-year-old man was shot by police on Sunday morning after he allegedly went on a violent rampage with a meat cleaver inside a Brooklyn apartment.

The Colorado artist behind a now-removed portrait of US President Donald Trump has denied claims by the president that she deliberately distorted his likeness, saying his comments have caused significant harm to her business.Sarah Boardman, a Colorado Springs-based painter, responded after Trump took aim at her work in a March 23 post on Truth Social. “Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado… was purposefully distorted,” Trump wrote. He also claimed the artist “must have lost her talent as she got older,” adding that he preferred no portrait at all to the one that had hung in the Colorado State Capitol.Boardman, who also painted official portraits of Barack Obama and George W Bush displayed in the same gallery, firmly rejected the accusation. As per news agency AP, she said in a statement, “I completed the portrait accurately, without ‘purposeful distortion,’ political bias, or any attempt to caricature the subject, actual or implied.”She explained that the Capitol advisory committee selected the reference photograph, monitored the portrait’s progress and approved the final result. “I fulfilled the task per my contract,” she added.The portrait had hung in the Capitol since 2019, funded by $10,000 raised by Colorado Republicans. It was removed the morning after Trump’s remarks and placed in museum storage.As per new agency AFP, the Democrat-led legislature confirmed the decision to take it down followed Trump’s public criticism.While Trump claimed “many people” in Colorado had complained about the painting, Boardman disputed this, saying she had received “overwhelmingly positive reviews and feedback” during its six-year display. “That has changed for the worse since President Trump’s comments,” she wrote.Boardman also expressed concern about the personal and professional fallout. “The additional allegations… are now directly and negatively impacting my business of over 41 years which now is in danger of not recovering,” she said.Trump praised the Obama portrait, also painted by Boardman, as looking “wonderful” in contrast to his own, which he described as “truly the worst.”Republican Senate Minority Leader Paul Lundeen has since said the Trump portrait should be replaced with one that reflects his “contemporary likeness.” However, a replacement has not yet been commissioned.","Sarah Boardman, a Colorado Springs-based painter, responded after Trump took aim at her work in a March 23 post on Truth Social.

Who is Erez Reuveni?

Erez Reuveni is an attorney with nearly 15 years at the US department of justice, where he most recently served as assistant director and briefly as acting deputy director of the office of immigration litigation .



. Reuveni has held multiple roles within the DOJ civil vivision, including senior counsel and trial attorney, handling some of the most sensitive immigration and constitutional law cases under various administrations.



He began his legal career with prestigious clerkships under Judge Jon O Newman on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and Chief Judge Mark Wolf in the District of Massachusetts.



Reuveni also worked as a litigation associate at Morrison & Foerster and was a fellow at Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society.



Reuveni holds a JD, summa cum laude, from Boston University School of Law, where he was a finalist in moot court and served as Articles Editor for the Law Review.



He earned his BA, magna cum laude, from Brandeis University in Politics, Economics, and Near Eastern Studies.

Erez Reuveni , a senior Justice Department lawyer, has been placed on paid administrative leave after a high-profile courtroom appearance where he failed to defend the government’s position in the controversial deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia , a Maryland man wrongly sent to El Salvador.As reported by ABC News, the DOJ cited a “failure to zealously advocate” for government interests as the reason for his suspension. Reuveni appeared frustrated and unable to provide legal justification during Friday’s hearing, where Judge Paula Xinis ruled that the deportation was unlawful and ordered Abrego Garcia’s return.According to Politico, Reuveni told the court that he had urged his DOJ superiors to bring Abrego Garcia back and admitted he couldn’t explain why he was detained or labelled as an MS-13 member.The DOJ later removed his name from official filings in the case. Attorney general Pam Bondi publicly criticised Reuveni, saying DOJ attorneys must “zealously advocate on behalf of the United States.” His supervisor, August Flentje, was also placed on leave for failing to oversee Reuveni's conduct.","Erez Reuveni, a senior Justice Department lawyer, has been placed on paid administrative leave after a high-profile courtroom appearance.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia: Federal Judge again orders Trump administration to return man wrongly deported to El Salvador,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/federal-judge-again-orders-trump-administration-to-return-man-wrongly-deported-to-el-salvador/articleshow/120044453.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

A US federal judge has, for the second time, ordered the Trump administration to return a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador, despite warnings he would face danger there.The man, 29-year-old Kilmar Abrego Garcia , remains jailed in El Salvador’s infamous Center for the Confinement of Terrorism (Cecot), after being mistakenly sent back last month.In a sharp rebuke, US district Jjdge Paula Xinis on Sunday ruled that the government had no legal grounds to detain or deport Abrego Garcia. “They had no legal authority to arrest him, no justification to detain him, and no grounds to send him to El Salvador, let alone deliver him into one of the most dangerous prisons in the Western Hemisphere,” Xinis wrote in her order, as per news agency AP.Abrego Garcia had previously been granted protection from deportation in 2019 by an immigration judge. Despite this, US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) deported him in what the White House has called an “administrative error”. The Trump administration has also tried to link him to the MS-13 gang , though his lawyers say there is no evidence to support that claim.Judge Xinis dismissed government arguments that the courts lacked authority to intervene. “Having confessed grievous error, the defendants now argue that this Court lacks the power to hear this case, and they lack the power to order Abrego Garcia’s return,” she stated in the ruling.Justice Department lawyer Erez Reuveni, who represented the government in court, admitted, “We concede he should not have been removed to El Salvador” and when asked why Garcia was held, responded, “I don’t know,” according to AP.Reuveni has since been placed on administrative leave.Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News Sunday, “He’s on administrative leave now and we’ll see what happens,” while likening Reuveni’s courtroom remarks to “a defense attorney walking in, conceding something in a criminal matter.”The department of justice has appealed Judge Xinis’ order to the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that compelling the executive branch to act on foreign soil is unconstitutional.The Trump administration said such an order would force the US government to “compel a certain action by a foreign sovereign,” which it called “constitutionally intolerable”.Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, a US citizen, has not spoken to her husband since his deportation. His attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, slammed the government's inaction, saying, “Plenty of tweets. Plenty of White House press conferences. But no actual steps taken with the government of El Salvador to make it right,” reported BBC.Judge Xinis has ordered that the government “facilitate and effectuate” Abrego Garcia’s return by Monday night.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador last month.

US National Security Breach Yemen: Revealed – How Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg got his name added to Signal war chat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/revealed-how-atlantics-jeffrey-goldberg-got-his-name-added-to-signal-war-chat/articleshow/120042286.cms,"File photo: The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg (Picture credit: AP)

A startling error by US national security adviser Mike Waltz reportedly led to The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg being mistakenly added to a top-level Signal chat discussing American strikes in Yemen.According to three unnamed sources quoted by The Guardian, the breach stemmed from a phone contact mix-up traced back to the 2024 campaign, a mishap that US President Donald Trump considered firing Waltz over.The internal White House investigation found that Goldberg’s number was saved on Waltz’s phone under a completely different contact, Brian Hughes, now spokesperson for the National Security Council.The confusion began when Hughes, in October 2024, forwarded Goldberg’s critical email about Trump’s stance on wounded US soldiers to Waltz. The message included Goldberg’s signature block, complete with his phone number.Waltz didn’t contact Goldberg, but somehow his number was saved in the wrong contact card due to an iPhone's contact suggestion algorithm, reported The Guardian.The error went unnoticed until March 13, when Waltz created a Signal group chat called “Houthi PC small group” to coordinate military plans. Intending to add Hughes, Waltz inadvertently added Goldberg.The group included 18 senior officials, among them Vice President JD Vance, defense secretary Pete Hegseth, secretary of state Marco Rubio and others.Goldberg’s presence was only discovered after sensitive operational messages had already circulated.Despite the gravity of the error, Trump reportedly chose not to fire Waltz, more irritated by the fact that he had Goldberg’s number at all, given Trump’s long-standing contempt for The Atlantic, than by the security lapse itself. He was also reassured by the internal review, which showed no classified data had been shared.Goldberg declined to offer details but told The Guardian, “I’m not going to comment on my relationship with Mike Waltz beyond saying I do know him and have spoken to him.”In public remarks, Waltz said he had “never met, don’t know, never communicated with” Goldberg. On Fox News, he later admitted, “We made a mistake. We’re moving forward,” taking “full responsibility” for the breach and suggesting the contact may have been “sucked in” through iPhone syncing.Trump, addressing the incident during a Newsmax interview, downplayed its impact. “It wasn’t classified, as I understand it,” he said. “The attack was a tremendous success… We feel very comfortable.” He also signalled a retreat from using Signal, saying, “We won’t be using it very much,” advocating instead for in-person meetings with “solid lead walls and a lead ceiling and lead floor.”The episode prompted a forensic review by the White House IT office and drew sympathy from within Trump’s circle, who noted Signal had been authorised for inter-agency communication due to the lack of a secure alternative. Even the Biden administration had failed to implement a replacement, reported The Guardian citing sources.",The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was mistakenly added to a top- level Signal chat discussing American strikes in Yemen.

Australian MMA coach Renato Subotic claimed he was mistakenly detained and jailed in the United States over a visa issue, describing his experience as a “chaotic” and humiliating ordeal that saw him locked up with violent inmates and denied basic rights.Subotic, who had travelled to the US to conduct a seminar, said the incident has left him shocked at how quickly someone's freedom can be taken away.The 33-year-old, who has coached Australia’s national MMA team, was stopped at the border and taken to an isolated room where he says he was interrogated for three hours. “The officer interviewing me looked like he was looking for something wrong,” Subotic wrote on Instagram, adding that despite being cooperative and providing full details of his trip, he was told there had been a mistake with his visa and he was being taken to jail.Further describing his ordeal, he said that he was handcuffed, stripped of his belongings, and forced into a prison uniform before being taken to a federal facility where he was fingerprinted and photographed. “They walked me to my block – 4B. The moment the door opened, it was chaos. Fights between gangs, people screaming, arguing over food, what to watch on TV, crazy people running around. Madness,” he wrote.Inside the cell, Subotic claimed he was met with a mattress stained with “p*** and blood.” When he later returned to find two men stealing his blanket, a physical altercation broke out.A guard responded and told him, “You got a good welcome.

It shouldn’t have gone this way.”Subotic said he respects immigration rules but slammed the decision to imprison him. “It’s insane how easily someone can take away your freedom… Just like that, you’re treated like the worst criminal,” he said, adding that he’s now back in Australia and consulting lawyers.His case comes as US President Donald Trump's administration ramps up immigration enforcement .

The 33-year-old, who has coached Australia’s national MMA team, was stopped at the border and taken to an isolated room.

White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett came out defence of President Donald Trump 's trade policies, dismissing concerns about increased costs for American consumers amid the massive backlash and recession fears.""So the fact is, the countries are angry and retaliating -- and, by the way, coming to the table. I got a report from the [US Trade Representative] last night that more than 50 countries have reached out to the president to begin a negotiation, but they're doing that because they understand that they bear a lot of the tariff.""Further defending Trump administration policies, he added, ""I don't think that you're going to see a big effect on the consumer in the US, because I do think that the reason why we have a persistent long-run trade deficit is these people have very inelastic supply,"" Hassett explained during his appearance on ABC News' ""This Week"" with George Stephanopoulos.This comes as Trump, earlier this week, announced comprehensive tariffs affecting nearly all US trading partners, including a universal 10% tariff on imports and additional specific tariffs for certain nations. The announcement triggered an immediate decline in stock markets and prompted retaliatory measures from various countries. Democratic politicians and economic policy critics expressed serious concerns about potential recession risks and deteriorating relationships with allied nations.Meanwhile, J P Morgan went ahead to project a US recession by the end of 2025, attributing it to the tariffs. The forecast indicates a potential GDP decline and higher unemployment. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell echoed the concerns, highlighting that tariffs may cause higher inflation and slower growth.The broad-based 10% tariffs became effective on Saturday, whilst country-specific tariffs are scheduled to commence on Wednesday.","Kevin Hassett, White House National Economic Council Director, spoke on ABC's ""This Week"" Hassett dismissed concerns about increased costs for American consumers amid the massive backlash and recession fears.

Ice stupas

Harvest seasons multiply

HUSSAINABAD: At the foot of Pakistan's impossibly high mountains whitened by frost all year round, farmers grappling with a lack of water have created their own ice towers.Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan, a remote region home to K2, the world's second-highest peak.Farmers in the Skardu valley, at an altitude of up to 2,600 metres (8,200 feet) in the shadow of the Karakoram mountain range, searched online for help in how to irrigate their apple and apricot orchards.""We discovered artificial glaciers on YouTube,"" Ghulam Haider Hashmi told AFP.They watched the videos of Sonam Wangchuk , an environmental activist and engineer in the Indian region of Ladakh, less than 200 kilometres away across a heavily patrolled border, who developed the technique about 10 years ago.Water is piped from streams into the village, and sprayed into the air during the freezing winter temperatures.""The water must be propelled so that it freezes in the air when temperatures drop below zero, creating ice towers,"" said Zakir Hussain Zakir, a professor at the University of Baltistan.The ice forms in the shape of cones that resemble Buddhist stupas, and act as a storage system -- steadily melting throughout spring when temperatures rise.Gilgit-Baltistan has 13,000 glaciers -- more than any other country on Earth outside the polar regions.Their beauty has made the region one of the country's top tourist destinations -- towering peaks loom over the Old Silk Road, still visible from a highway transporting tourists between cherry orchards, glaciers and ice-blue lakes.Sher Muhammad, a specialist in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan mountain range that stretches from Afghanistan to Myanmar, however said most of the region's water supply comes from snow melt in spring, with a fraction from annual glacial melt in summers.""From late October until early April, we were receiving heavy snowfall. But in the past few years, it's quite dry,"" Muhammad, a researcher at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), told AFP.The first ""ice stupas"" in Gilgit-Baltistan were created in 2018.Now, more than 20 villages make them every winter, and ""more than 16,000 residents have access to water without having to build reservoirs or tanks"", said Rashid-ud-Din, provincial head of GLOF-2, a UN-Pakistan plan to adapt to the effects of climate change.Farmer Muhammad Raza told AFP that eight stupas were built in his village of Hussainabad this winter, trapping approximately 20 million litres of water in the ice.""We no longer have water shortages during planting,"" he said, since the open-air reservoirs appeared on the slopes of the valley.""Before, we had to wait for the glaciers to melt in June to get water, but the stupas saved our fields,"" said Ali Kazim, also a farmer in the valley.Before the stupas, ""we planted our crops in May"", said 26-year-old Bashir Ahmed who grows potatoes, wheat and barley in nearby Pari village which has also adopted the method.And ""we only had one growing season, whereas now we can plant two or three times"" a year.Temperatures in Pakistan rose twice as fast between 1981 and 2005 compared to the global average, putting the country on the front line of climate change impacts, including water scarcity.Its 240 million inhabitants live in a territory that is 80 percent arid or semi-arid and depends on rivers and streams originating in neighbouring countries for more than three-quarters of its water.Glaciers are melting rapidly in Pakistan and across the world, with a few exceptions including the Karakoram mountain range, increasing the risk of flooding and reducing water supply over the long term.""Faced with climate change, there are neither rich nor poor, neither urban nor rural; the whole world has become vulnerable,"" said 24-year-old Yasir Parvi.""In our village, with the ice stupas, we decided to take a chance.""","Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan. More than 20 villages make the ice stupas every winter, which provides 16,000 residents access to water.

Who are the militant groups?



Poll Do you believe the rise in militant attacks in Pakistan is primarily due to the influence of groups based in Afghanistan? No, not at all Yes, definitely

Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim. It said that the Taliban provided support to the TTP and that some attacks were launched from Afghan territory.As a consequence, the Pakistani government has urged the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan to act against the allegedly responsible criminals. Kabul, on the other hand, denies that the militants are in Afghanistan.","Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.The operation, in Katlang, a remote hilltop area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was aimed at militant hideouts and resulted in the deaths of 12 suspected terrorists. However, it also led to the deaths of 10 civilians, including women and children, sparking outrage.Government spokesman Muhammad Ali Saif confirmed the casualties and said that the location was being used as a hideout and transit point for terrorists. He admitted that unarmed civilians were present at the site.""The safety of civilians is always a top priority during such operations. However, due to complex geography, terrorists using civilian populations as cover, and the urgent nature of the operation, unintended consequences can sometimes occur,"" said Saif, as quoted by the Associated Press.The provincial government has now promised an inquiry into how the operation led to civilian deaths.Local residents reported that the victims were nomads from the Swat region who had been living in the Shamozai mountains with their livestock. Their families protested by placing their bodies on the Swat Highway, demanding justice.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur called the incident “highly condemnable and tragic.” He assured that every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties but acknowledged the challenges of military operations in complex terrains where militants embed themselves among civilians.The government said medical aid is being provided to the injured, and compensation for the victims' families is being arranged. A provincial press note said the operation had ""neutralised several high-value militant targets"" but admitted that the “fog of war” sometimes leads to unintended consequences.","Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.

IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme | Dawn News English

Pakistan's citizens may have to pay additional taxation as a new carbon levy is anticipated following a USD 1.3 billion agreement with the IMF for climate change initiatives PTI reported citing official sources.Alongside this, the IMF agreed to release approximately USD 1 billion as the second tranche of the previously agreed USD 7 billion loan.""The IMF team has reached a SLA with the Pakistani authorities on the first review of the 37-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), and a new 28-month arrangement under the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) with total access over the 28 months of around USD 1.3 billion,"" the Fund said in a statement.The total IMF loan now amounts to USD 8.3 billion with this RSF arrangement. Upon approval from the IMF's Executive Board, Pakistan would receive immediate access to approximately USD 2 billion to strengthen its balance of payment position.The new agreement requires additional commitments from the tax-burdened population, including a new carbon levy, increased water rates, and liberalisation of the automobile sector. Dawn newspaper reports that a reduction in power rates is expected, funded by reallocating the existing petroleum levy.Senior officials familiar with the SLA and MEFP indicated that the prime minister would announce an approximate Rs 7 per unit reduction in average electricity rates, effective from April 1, 2025.The implementation of new measures - carbon levy, water pricing and automobile sector reforms - will commence from July 1, 2025. Fiscal consolidation will continue through reduced energy subsidies and controlled development spending.Officials confirmed that whilst the government sought GST reduction on electricity, the IMF instead permitted the use of increased petroleum levy to offset power tariffs. A Rs 10 per litre increase in petroleum levy would provide approximately Rs 1.80 per unit relief.The government has agreed to implement a carbon levy of Rs 3-5 per litre or equivalent on all hydrocarbons, including petroleum products and coal, with gradual increases planned. The revenue will fund climate-related initiatives.Automobile sector trade tariffs will decrease from 10.5% to 6% by FY 2030, ending what both parties agreed was excessive protection. These measures require cabinet approval before implementation through the finance bill 2025-26.The authorities aim to achieve an FY25 underlying primary surplus of 1% of GDP minimum, maintaining consolidation in FY26. The focus remains on revenue mobilisation, spending efficiency and tax base expansion.Pakistan has committed to maintaining strict monetary policy to keep inflation within the SBP's 5-7% target range and preserve foreign exchange market functionality while building reserves.The RSF programme includes strengthening public investment processes, improving water resource management, enhancing disaster financing coordination, addressing climate-related risks, and promoting environmental-friendly transportation to reduce pollution impacts.",IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme. New carbon levy is anticipated following a USD 1.3 billion agreement with the IMF for climate change initiatives.

"For Nepal businesses, most valuable currency's stability",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/for-nepal-businesses-most-valuable-currencys-stability/articleshow/120028092.cms,"KATHMANDU: Beneath the cluttered skyline of tangled wires, scaffolds, prayer flags, and pro-monarchy banners fluttering over recent protests, entrepreneurs and business owners in Kathmandu have grown accustomed to fast-changing ministries just as they have to the valley's notoriously erratic weather.Across boardrooms, shop floors and startup hubs, one sentiment rises above the rest: political stability, regardless of who delivers it-king or elected leader-is now the most valuable currency in Nepal's economy.Since declaring itself a federal democratic republic in 2008, Nepal has cycled through 12 prime ministers. Most held office just long enough to introduce fresh policies, which their successors promptly scrapped or reversed.The consequences, entrepreneurs say, aren't just political. They affect operations. Each new regime, entrepreneurs say, arrives not just with a different tone but with a dramatically different playbook. Business policies shift abruptly - from tax incentives to trade norms - often reversing the decisions of the previous administration. For those investing capital or hiring at scale, this volatility makes long-term planning feel less like strategy and more like guesswork.""We're not concerned about the political system,"" said a hotelier in Thamel. ""What we need is stability and regimes that take consistent decisions.""This inconsistency has contributed to a steady exodus of Nepali workers. Over 6 lakh Nepalis --people say the true figure is higher -- left the country last year for jobs abroad, mainly in Malaysia, South Korea and the Gulf. For many, migration has become a substitute for economic opportunity at home. Labour migration, once seen as a temporary fix, has become a structural feature of the economy. The economic footprint of this exodus is staggering. Remittances touched nearly $11 billion in 2023, accounting for over a quarter of Nepal's GDP. The money keeps families afloat, funds education, builds homes - and props up a national economy struggling with investment uncertainty and anaemic job creation.But the business community knows that exporting human capital is no long-term growth model. With domestic opportunity stalling, they are looking outward for trade, investment, and regional infrastructure partnerships - particularly with India. In 2022-23, India accounted for 64% of Nepal's total trade, valued at approximately $8.85 billion, according to India's ministry of external affairs. Yet entrepreneurs believe much of that relationship remains under-leveraged.Two newly built international airports in Pokhara and Bhairahawa remain underutilised, despite significant investment. Entrepreneurs cite aviation restrictions as one reason growth remains stifled. Himalayan Airlines, which has Chinese investors, has not been granted permission to fly to Indian cities. To be sure, Nepal has long requested new air entry points into India - via Janakpur, Nepalgunj and Mahendranagar - to shorten routes and improve connectivity. But progress has been slow, with Indian authorities citing security sensitivities, particularly near the Gorakhpur airbase. For now, all international flights into Nepal must detour through Simara, adding fuel costs and operational inefficiencies. ""We understand the concerns,"" said an aviation executive. ""But we believe there's space for flexibility that can benefit both nations.""On land, too, mobility remains uneven. Indian vehicles entering Nepal face nominal fees - Nepal Rs 250-500 (INR 150-300) per day - and little paperwork.In contrast, Nepali vehicles crossing into India are subject to cumbersome requirements: prior approvals, bank guarantees and multiple layers of documentation. Even individual movement faces friction. Entrepreneurs report delays in visa processing and heightened scrutiny at Indian airports.","Since declaring itself a federal democratic republic in 2008, Nepal has cycled through 12 prime ministers.

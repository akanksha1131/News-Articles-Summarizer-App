There's no grand cypher. If you have curiosity, imagination, and the willingness to try something new, you can find the treasures that I've hidden,"" Collins-Black said.The chests contain diverse items appealing to various interests, including sports memorabilia like Michael Jordan 's 1986 rookie card , alongside precious metals and historical artefacts.Notable items include Jacqueline Onassis's diamond and sapphire brooch, a fourth-century BCE gold Greek laurel, a Picasso-designed coin, and a rare lunar rock specimen.One chest contains a single Bitcoin, currently valued at approximately $100,000, with potential for increased value before discovery.Collins-Black has confirmed that all chests are positioned in safe, accessible locations above ground, within 3 miles of public roads, and not on private property.""I created this treasure hunt because I live for adventure,"" Collins-Black explained, revealing he developed the concept during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.""I hope to ignite that same sense of wonder and curiosity in everyone who joins this journey,"" he added, according to WKRC.This initiative follows a similar treasure hunt by Forrest Fenn, an art dealer from New Mexico, who around 2010 concealed a $2 million chest of valuables in the Rocky Mountains, leaving cryptic poetic clues.The decade-long search claimed at least five lives before Fenn announced its discovery in June 2020. However, the finder's identity remained undisclosed, and Fenn's subsequent death left questions about the treasure's discovery unanswered.","Jon Collins-Black has hidden five chests of valuables across the United States.

Florida woman sentenced to 25 years for shooting black neighbour dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-never-intended-to-kill-anyone-florida-woman-sentenced-to-25-years-for-shooting-black-neighbour-dead/articleshow/115676802.cms,"A White Florida woman has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for manslaughter after fatally shooting her Black neighbour during a long-running dispute.Susan Lorincz, 60, was convicted in August for killing 35-year-old Ajike “A.J.” Owens in June 2023, following a confrontation outside Lorincz’s home in Ocala. The two women fought over Owens' children playing near Lorincz's property.The dispute between the neighbours had been ongoing for some time.Owens, a mother of four, had gone to Lorincz's door to confront her about allegedly throwing objects at her children—something Lorincz denied. According to testimony, Owens was pounding on Lorincz’s door when she fired a single shot through it.Lorincz claimed she acted in self-defence, saying she feared for her life and had been harassed by Owens for years. However, the jury did not accept this claim.Despite facing up to 30 years in prison, Lorincz received a slightly reduced sentence from Circuit Judge Robert Hodges, who took into account her troubled childhood and mental health issues. ""The shooting was completely unnecessary in this case,"" Judge Hodges said. ""The shooting, I find, was based more in anger than in fear.""In a statement to the court, Lorincz expressed regret over the tragedy, saying, ""I so wish I could go back and change things so she was still here. I never intended to kill anyone.""Owens' family, who pushed for the maximum sentence for Lorincz, shared their grief over the loss, with Owens' mother, Pamela Dias, saying, “We’re hurting with a pain that will never, never go away.”Lorincz’s lawyer argued for a lighter sentence, citing her mental health and claiming Owens was the aggressor. However, the judge emphasised the lasting impact on Owens' children, who will grow up without their mother.","Susan Lorincz, 60, was convicted in August for killing 35-year-old Ajike “A.J.” Owens in June 2023.

'Will just get pilots killed': Elon Musk suggests fighter jets be replaced by drones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/will-just-get-pilots-killed-elon-musk-suggests-fighter-jets-be-replaced-by-drones/articleshow/115676915.cms,"Elon Musk (File photo)

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk , selected by US President-elect Donald Trump to lead efforts to reduce federal government spending, made headlines Monday by criticising modern fighter jets and advocating for drones as the future of air warfare .""Manned fighter jets are obsolete in the age of drones anyway. Will just get pilots killed,"" Musk said on his social media platform, X, where he heads companies such as SpaceX and Tesla.Musk reserved pointed criticism for the F-35 , a state-of-the-art fighter jet produced by US defence giant Lockheed Martin .The aircraft, which entered service in 2015, is renowned for its stealth capabilities and intelligence-gathering functions but has faced scrutiny for high costs and technical challenges.""Meanwhile, some idiots are still building manned fighter jets like the F-35,"" Musk posted, sharing a video of drones flying in precise formation. He labelled the F-35 ""an expensive (and) complex jack of all trades, master of none,"" arguing that its design flaws stemmed from overly ambitious requirements.The F-35 aircraft has been adopted by several nations, including Germany, Poland, Finland, and Romania, despite enduring criticism for its high operating costs and development challenges, particularly with its advanced software systems.Mauro Gilli, a researcher at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, defended the aircraft's role in modern warfare . ""What makes the F-35... expensive is the software and the electronics, not the pilot per se,"" Gilli said on X. He added that reusable drones would still require the same advanced electronics as the F-35, undermining Musk's argument that removing pilots would significantly cut costs.Gilli also pointed out the strategic impact of the F-35, arguing that its existence forces geopolitical rivals like Russia and China to invest heavily in countermeasures. ""By simply existing, the F-35 and the B-1 force Russia and China into strategic choices they would not have to make otherwise (i.e., budget allocations),"" Gilli explained. ""Even if Musk were right (and he is not), deleting the programs would relax these constraints on them.""","Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk made headlines Monday by criticising modern fighter jets.

Trump Jan 6 Case: Jack Smith files motion to dismiss Jan 6 case against Donald Trump before his inauguration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jack-smith-files-motion-to-dismiss-jan-6-case-against-donald-trump-before-his-inauguration/articleshow/115670335.cms,"Jack Smith asked the court to drop election intereference charge against Donald Trump before his inauguration on January 20.

Special counsel Jack Smith Monday asked a federal judge to dismiss the four charges against President-elect Donald Trump of plotting to overturn the 2020 election before his inauguration on January 20. Smith cited longstanding Justice Department policy shielding presidents from prosecution while in office as he moved the motion. In court papers. prosecutors said the Justice Department's position ""is that the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated.”“It has long been the position of the Department of Justice that the United States Constitution forbids the federal indictment and subsequent criminal prosecution of a sitting President,” Smith’s team wrote in a filing.Donald Trump reacted to the legal victory and called for an immediate end to the weaponization of the justice system. ""The American People re-elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate to Make America Great Again. Today's decision by the DoJ ends the unconstitutional federal cases against President Trump, and is a major victory for the rule of law. The American People and President Trump want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and we look forward to uniting out country,"" Trump's communications director Steven Cheung said.The decision was expected after Smith's team began assessing how to wind down both the 2020 election interference case and the separate classified documents case in the wake of Trump's victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. The Justice Department believes Trump can no longer be tried going by the longstanding policy that says sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted.The 2020 election case brought last year was once seen as one of the most serious legal threats facing the Republican as he vied to reclaim the White House. But it quickly stalled amid legal fighting over Trump’s sweeping claims of immunity from prosecution for acts he took while in the White House.The US Supreme Court in July ruled for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution, and sent the case back to US District Judge Tanya Chutkan to determine which allegations in the indictment, if any, could proceed to trial.The case was just beginning to pick up steam again in the trial court in the weeks leading up to the November 4 election. Smith’s team in October filed a lengthy brief laying out new evidence they planned to use against him at trial, accusing him of using “resorting to crimes” in an increasingly desperate effort to overturn the will over voters after he lost to President Joe Biden.(With agency inputs)",Donald Trump reacted to the legal victory and called for an immediate end to the weaponization of the justice system.

Damian Williams , the first Black US Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), announced his resignation, effective 13 December 2024, just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration.His departure clears the way for a new appointee to lead the high-profile office, known for tackling financial fraud and public corruption cases .Williams, appointed by President Joe Biden in 2021, described his decision as “bittersweet.”In his farewell statement, he said, “It is bitter in the sense that I am leaving my dream job, leading an institution I love that is filled with the finest public servants in the world. It is sweet in that I am confident I am leaving at a time when the Office is functioning at an incredibly high level — upholding and exceeding its already high standard of excellence, integrity, and independence.”High-profile convictions under Williams’ leadershipDuring his tenure, Williams oversaw significant convictions, including Sam Bankman-Fried , founder of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, on fraud charges involving the theft of $8 billion in customer funds.Additionally, Archegos Capital founder Bill Hwang was found guilty of stock market manipulation, and former New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez was convicted on corruption charges.Williams also brought charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams and musician Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, both of whom have denied the allegations.Williams emphasised the importance of his office's independence and praised its career attorneys, stating, “They are worthy custodians of this office's tradition of doing the right thing, the right way, for the right reasons.”As per the news agency Reuters, Edward Y Kim, Williams’ deputy, will serve as acting US Attorney following his departure.Trump has announced plans to nominate Jay Clayton , former chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to lead the SDNY.According to NBC News, Trump described Clayton as “a highly respected business leader, counsel, and public servant.” The appointment requires Senate confirmation.Williams’ resignation reflects a broader pattern of US Attorneys stepping down before transitions to Trump-led administrations.His predecessor, Preet Bharara, was fired by Trump in 2017 after initially being asked to remain. Geoffrey Berman, another predecessor, was similarly removed amid allegations of political pressure.Williams maintained the SDNY’s reputation for impartiality despite the Trump administration's controversial approach to the Justice Department.As per Reuters, Williams closed an investigation into Trump’s former lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, without filing charges, while also prosecuting a case involving an alleged Iranian plot against Trump.In his statement, Williams reaffirmed his belief in the integrity of the SDNY, calling its attorneys “patriots.”","Damian Williams, the first Black US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced his resignation, effective 13 December 2024.

Who is DB Cooper?

A parachute has been linked to the infamous hijacker, who checked in as Dan Cooper on 23 November, 1971, escaped into thin air with ransom money, has been found. On the crime’s anniversary, McCoy’s children have claimed to have found the parachute Cooper allegedly used.The parachute was discovered in the garage of Richard Floyd McCoy II, a man many believe was DB Cooper.The FBI which closed the case in 2016 is now investigating this new clue. DB Cooper hijacked a Northwest Orient Airlines flight 53 years ago, demanding $200,000 in ransom, and escaped by parachuting out of the plane.Richard McCoy was previously linked to another plane hijacking, where he escaped with $500,000, strengthening suspicions about his connection to the Cooper case.After their mother’s death, McCoy’s children contacted YouTuber Gryder in 2022. Gryder, who studies the case, said the military parachute found in their father’s garage could be real, calling it 'one in a billion.' The siblings believe their father might have been Cooper and suspect their mother also knew about the crime.On Monday, Gryder shared a video stating that the FBI had reopened the investigation. He said agents contacted him after seeing his earlier videos about the parachute discovery.Cooper, dressed in sunglasses, a suit, and a tie, demanded $200,000 and four parachutes, promising to release 36 passengers once the items were ready in Seattle. After receiving them, he ordered the plane to take off toward Mexico. Over southwestern Washington, he opened the rear exit, leaped into the night with two parachutes and the cash, and vanished. Delayed police searches yielded no trace, and he was never seen again.This is the FBI’s first activity on the case since 2016. Gryder’s friend, retired pilot Laura Savino, confirmed the FBI is taking the matter seriously. So far, the FBI hasn’t returned the parachute, adding to the belief that it might be crucial evidence.","DB Cooper hijacked a Northwest Orient Airlines flight 53 years ago, demanding $200,000 in ransom, and escaped by parachuting out of the plane.

Right now a Caravan coming from Mexico, composed of thousands of people, seems to be unstoppable in its quest to come through our currently Open Border.

He said that from the China a massive amount of drugs particularly Fentanyl are being sent to US.""Representatives of China told me that they would institute their maximum penalty, that of death, for any drug dealers caught doing this but, unfortunately, they never followed through, and drugs are pouring into our Country, mostly through Mexico, at levels never seen before.

He also said he would impose an additional 10% tariffs on goods from China.

Why did Gaetz stepped down?

US President-elect Donald Trump has endorsed Jimmy Patronis, Florida’s former chief financial officer (CFO), to take over Matt Gaetz’s seat in Congress, as reported by the Independent. Gaetz stepped down after facing allegations of sexual misconduct and a federal investigation into sex trafficking. He also withdrew his bid to become Trump’s attorney general, calling the controversy a distraction.Trump took to Truth Social to praise Jimmy Patronis as a “fourth-generation Floridian” and a dedicated ally to the MAGA movement .“Jimmy Patronis, chief financial officer for the Great State of Florida, has done a tremendous job as CFO, where he also serves as the State’s Fire Marshal, and as an important member of the Florida Cabinet. I hear that Jimmy is now considering launching a campaign for Congress in Florida's 1st Congressional District!” Trump wrote.“A fourth-generation Floridian from the beautiful Panhandle, and owner of an iconic seafood restaurant, Jimmy has been a wonderful friend to me, and to MAGA. As your next Congressman, Jimmy would work tirelessly alongside of me to Grow our Economy, Secure our Border, Stop Migrant Crime, Strengthen our Incredible Military/Vets, Restore American Energy DOMINANCE, and Defend our always under siege Second Amendment,” he added.“Should he decide to enter this Race, Jimmy Patronis has my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN, JIMMY, RUN!” Trump concluded, putting his full weight behind Patronis.In response, Patronis stepped down as CFO on Monday and declared his intention to run for Florida’s 1st district seat. On X (formerly Twitter), he said, “Put me to work, Mr. President. @realDonaldTrump I am here to serve.” Florida governor Ron DeSantis announced the dates for the special election to fill Gaetz’s seat. The primary is set for January 28, with the final election on April 1.Patronis, a Panama City-based restaurateur and Trump loyalist , has held public office since 2017. Earlier this year, he backed the “Freedom Fighters Fund,” a proposed bill aimed at aiding Floridians, including Trump, facing legal battles. The legislation, however, was shelved following opposition from DeSantis.Within hours of stepping down, Patronis announced his candidacy for Florida’s Congressional District 1, which covers parts of Escambia, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, and Walton counties.Gaetz, 42, resigned earlier this month amid allegations of sexual misconduct and drug use, just as the House Ethics Committee was set to release a “highly damaging” report on its investigation. Although Gaetz denied the allegations, he described them as a “smear” and called the confirmation process for his attorney general nomination a “distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.”Despite his resignation, the Ethics Committee has not released its report, citing the conclusion of its investigation. Former Trump adviser John Bolton called Gaetz the “worst cabinet-level appointment in history.”Gaetz’s withdrawal paved the way for Trump to nominate Pam Bondi, a former Florida attorney general, as his pick for attorney general. Meanwhile, Gaetz has yet to announce his next career move.As Patronis steps into the political spotlight, he brings with him a reputation as a loyal Trump ally eager to carry forward the MAGA agenda.",US President-elect Donald Trump has endorsed Jimmy Patronis to take over Matt Gaetz’s seat in Congress.

ISLAMABAD: Amid fierce teargas clashes with law enforcement personnel, tens of thousands of protesters of the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) reached the outskirts of the capital, Islamabad, on Monday to demand the release of their incarcerated party chief, with his wife Bushra Bibi saying the demonstration would continue until the former PM was released from jail.Vowing not to allow the protest, the govt has blocked all routes into and out of Islamabad with shipping containers, and heavy contingents of police and other security forces have been deployed across the capital city. The protesters, however, intend to set up camp at Islamabad D-Chowk, a large square near a number of significant govt buildings, including the PM’s office, parliament and the Supreme Court.Imran has billed the ongoing protest as the “final call” to meet three demands — his release from jail, along with hundreds of party workers who were detained over the last two years, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment which curtailed the powers of the judiciary, and the return of the “stolen mandate” of the Feb 8 elections.A convoy of protesters from the south-western province of Balochistan, which has travelled for four days and includes women and children, has been waiting at Islamabad’s entry point for other convoys to reach and then collectively march to the capital. “We are waiting for the main convoy, led by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM Ali Amin Gandapur, to arrive,” said Shahjehan Bazai, a PTI supporter. Imran’s wife has been part of the convoy led by Gandapur.“As long as Imran is not with us, we will not end this march,” she told supporters at a stop near the Hazara Interchange. “I will stay there till my last breath, and all of you have to support me. This is not just about my husband but about the country and its leader,” said Bushra, who was sentenced alongside Khan in Jan but released on bail in late Oct.Tensions between the two sides escalated into violence on Monday when thousands of people resumed their march towards the capital. Clashes erupted in the city’s suburbs, with footage showing PTI supporters setting police vehicles ablaze and hurling stones. Police shot tear gas at protesters who responded with slingshots.The party claimed that many of its members have been arrested in crackdowns across Pakistan. “We have already detained more than 4,000 Khan supporters, including five parliamentarians,” said Shahid Nawaz, a senior police officer in eastern Punjab.Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said authorities would arrest more of Khan’s supporters if they reach Islamabad’s Red Zone (D-Chowk), which has been sealed off. “Anyone reaching it will be arrested,” he said.The protest, which govt is determined to foil with force, was originally scheduled to be staged on Nov 24, but the convoys took a breather last night after PTI leaders said they were in “no hurry” to reach the federal capital for their “do or die” protest as workers and supporters from across the country attempted to defy arrests, baton charges and tear gas to participate in the agitation.","Tens of thousands of protesters of the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) reached the outskirts of the capital, Islamabad, on Monday.

Hundreds of supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan converged on the outskirts of Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, on Monday, demanding his release and vowing to march on parliament for a sit-in protest.Authorities imposed a strict security lockdown, erecting barricades on highways to block the demonstrators, as Khan’s party reported clashes and unrest in other parts of the country.As the protests continue, one policeman has been reported killed. Numerous individuals from both sides have also sustained injuries during violent confrontations between Imran Khan's followers and security personnel near Islamabad on Monday. The casualties were confirmed by both a government minister and representatives from Khan's political party, according to Reuters.In regards to the protest, in an update provided Monday evening, PTI said that the convoy from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa entered Islamabad while others are expected to reach as soon as the obstacles clear.""The convoy of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa entered the limits of Islamabad! Convoys are reaching Islamabad from all over Pakistan. We did not stop until we reached Islamabad,"" said PTI. ""Where there are obstacles, as soon as they are removed, those caravans will again leave for Islamabad. These caravans will hit Islamabad like tsunami waves every day. This will continue until we win Khan's demands and the war for true freedom. We will not stop, we will not bend. We will persist. And will remain steadfast. Will die freed!"" added the party.Khan’s wife Bushra Bibi, also a part of the march, addressed the rally near Hazara Interchange saying, “My brothers, we will not end this march till Imran is not with us,” she said. “I will stay there till my last breath, and all of you have to support me. This is not just about my husband but about the country and its leader.”The procession is being headed by KP Chief Minister Amin Ali Gandapur. Several PTI officials, including Sanam Javaid Khan, Babar Saleem Swati, Faisal Javed, and Omar Ayub Khan were also part of the demonstration.Speaking to Dawn.com at Attock's Burhan Interchange, PTI's Shaukat Yousafzai confirmed the advancing convoys, noting their slow progress due to size and obstacles. He claimed police retreated upon seeing the “huge rally.” Yousafzai confirmed Gandapur’s intention to reach D-Chowk “peacefully but at any cost.” He added that the party would continue its protest until “innocent political prisoners,” including Khan, are released. Yousafzai criticized the government as incompetent, focused only on “baton-charge the public and block the roads.”PTI’s Barrister Gohar also affirmed the protest would continue. “This is Khan sahib’s final call, there is no such thing of calling this off,” he stated. Roads leading to Islamabad’s red zone, except for Margalla Road, are blocked.Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari questioned the effectiveness of the protest. “In this ‘final call’ […] I don’t think there will be a bigger disappointment than this,” she remarked. Bukhari noted approximately 80 arrests were made during Sunday’s protests in Punjab.The protest, initially scheduled for November 24, was delayed. The Islamabad High Court ruled the protest unlawful and directed the government to maintain order, especially with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko’s arrival in Islamabad for a three-day visit. PTI leader Asad Qaiser said the march would take a few days to reach Islamabad.Police used tear gas against protesters near Attock, who responded by throwing stones and setting a toll booth and van on fire. However, PTI brought large industrial fans to counteract tear gas. Ikram Khattana, PTI’s social media head in KP, said six locally manufactured fans are part of the Peshawar convoy, as reported by Dawn.The administration remains firm on preventing protesters from entering Islamabad. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi announced arrests for any attempting entry. Deputy PM Ishaq Dar called the protest a “well-thought out conspiracy,” noting its timing coincided with Lukashenko’s visit.Additionally, provincial Information Minister Uzma Bukhari, whilst confirming that authorities had detained approximately 80 of Khan's followers said, ""We wouldn't let them storm the capital.""The demonstration, which Khan termed as the ""final call"", represents one of numerous rallies organised by his party advocating for his freedom since his imprisonment in August last year. Their previous demonstration in Islamabad in early October resulted in unrest.Khan, who was removed from power through a parliamentary vote in 2022 following disagreements with Pakistan's influential military establishment, faces various accusations including corruption and incitement to violence, all of which he and his party consistently reject.","Hundreds of supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan converged on the outskirts of Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, on Monday.

They include five parliamentarians. Pakistan has sealed off Islamabad with shipping containers and shut down major roads and highways connecting the city with PTI strongholds in Punjab and northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces. Tit-for-tat teargas shelling between the police and the PTI was reported on the highway bordering Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Earlier, Pakistan suspended mobile and internet services ""in areas with security concerns.""

On Sunday, the group said live metrics showed problems with WhatsApp that were affecting media sharing on the app. Khan's supporters rely heavily on social media to demand his release and use messaging platforms like WhatsApp to share information.PTI spokesman Sheikh Waqas Akram said Khan's wife Bushra Bibi was travelling to Islamabad in a convoy led by the CM of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ali Amin Gandapur. ""She cannot leave the party workers on their own,"" said Akram.

He revealed that both sides had raised militias soon after Thursday’s incident.A local administration official said the dead in the latest clashes included 18 Shias and 14 Sunnis. Nearly 50 others were wounded in overnight fighting.Dr Qaisar Abbas, a district health officer in Kurram, confirmed the casualties and described the condition of nine wounded as serious.Eyewitnesses said armed men broke into stores, petrol stations, homes and govt buildings in Kurram’s Bagan and Bacha Kot neighbourhoods after Friday prayers. Social media users shared videos and pictures of a burning market with orange flames piercing the night sky. Gunfire can also be heard in the background.Businesses, educational institutions and markets remained closed across Parachinar and surrounding areas for the second consecutive day on Saturday. Describing the situation as extremely tense, officials said mobile phone signals remain suspended across the district. Internet services, however, have been blocked in the region for several months.About 150 people have been killed in recent months due to escalating sectarian violence in the mountainous district, which borders Afghanistan on three sides.Previous clashes in July and Sept, which had killed dozens of people, ended only after a council of elders called for a ceasefire.Meanwhile, thousands of people participated in a sit-in in Parachinar, where protesters criticised govt’s failure to protect civilians. Shop owners in the region had announced a three-day strike on Friday to protest against the attack while locals described an atmosphere of fear across the district.No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, which came a week after authorities had reopened a key highway in the region that had been closed for months following deadly clashes. Speculation also surrounds the involvement of the banned terrorist group Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has recently been active in the lower part of Kurram.

PESHAWAR: A mob ransacked and set fire to two police check points on Friday to protest the killing of nearly 50 people by militants in the restive province in northwest Pakistan . Heavily-armed militants on Thursday ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing around 50 people, mostly Shias, in one of the worst attacks in the region in recent years.Rescue authorities said around 50 people, including eight women and five children, were killed and 20 others injured in the attack while police initially confirmed 45 deaths. The toll was raised to 47 on Friday.No group claimed responsibility for the attack on passenger vans.On Friday, in response to the Thurday's killings, all markets and educational institutions in Parachinar remained closed even as enraged locals blocked the main road by burning tires.After a lot of protests, the crowd ransacked Bab-e-Kurram, an entry point to Baggan Main Bazar and burnt two police check points at Palachinar.Deputy Commissioner Kurram Javed Ullah Mehsud said efforts are underway to save the lives of those injured in the barbaric shooting. ""We will restore the routine life as quickly as possible,"" he said.A grand jirga (traditional council) will be called to discuss problems hampering restoration of peace in the district.Meanwhile, funeral prayers were offered for the individuals who were killed in the incident in Bagan and Ochit, Lower Kurram.Tribal leaders from Turi and Bangash communities, including Jalal Bangash, expressed their deep concerns.They stated that for the past one and a half months, they had been demanding the government to ensure safe travel routes.Two weeks ago, more than 1,00,000 people participated in a peace march to reopen and secure the main highway, after which the government assured them of safe convoys.In September, more than 50 people were killed and 120 others injured in clashes spread over eight days between Shia and Sunni tribes over a piece of land in Kurram district.The intensity of the fighting had led to the closure of the Parachinar-Peshawar main road and the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border, disrupting transportation and movement.The road blockade has caused a shortage of essential items, including food, fuel, and medicines, worsening the situation for residents.The fighting had spread to areas such as Balishkhel, Sadda, Khar Kallay, Peewar and Maqbal in the district, which borders Afghanistan's Khost, Paktia, Logar and Nangarhar provinces, which are considered strongholds of the ISIS and the Pakistan Taliban.Similar clashes in the same region in July left dozens of people dead and more than 225 injured.","Heavily-armed militants on Thursday ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

History of sectarian violence in Kurram district

Heavily-armed militants ambushed ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district on Thursday, killing around 50 people, mostly from the minority Shia community. The attack is one of the worst in recent years in Pakistan's volatile northwest, a region frequently plagued by sectarian violence and militant assaults.The convoy was en route from Parachinar to Peshawar when gunmen opened fire.Javed Ullah Mehsud, the deputy commissioner of Kurram, confirmed that 45 people have died in the attack on the convoy, while rescue teams rushed to assist the wounded.Although no group has officially claimed responsibility for the attack, the region is known to be under the influence of the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has been linked to similar attacks in the area.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) government spokespersons indicated that the convoy, initially reported to have included 200 vehicles, was traveling through areas dominated by militant groups, raising fears of further escalations in an already tense region.Pakistan’s President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the ambush, calling it a ""cowardly and inhumane act"" and urging that those responsible be brought to justice. He also called for immediate medical aid for the injured.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif echoed Zardari’s sentiments, terming the attack a “brutal” assault on innocent citizens. ""The enemies of the peace of the country attacked the convoy of innocent citizens which is tantamount to brutality. All attempts of anti-national elements to destroy the peace of the beloved country will be thwarted,"" he stated, promising to track down the perpetrators.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur also condemned the attack, directing a delegation of provincial officials to visit Kurram district to assess the situation and report back. He has also ordered the establishment of a Provincial Highways Police unit to secure roads in the region.""Targeting innocent civilians is extremely tragic and condemnable. Those involved in this incident will not escape the grip of the law,"" Gandapur added, offering condolences to the victims' families and announcing financial assistance for them.The area has long been a hotspot for sectarian tensions between Shia and Sunni Muslims, primarily stemming from a longstanding land dispute.This volatile region has witnessed multiple sectarian clashes this year. In October, at least 16 people, including women and children, were killed in similar violence. In September, more than 50 people were killed and 120 injured in clashes between Shia and Sunni tribes over land disputes. This violence led to the closure of critical roads and disrupted essential services in the area. Similar clashes in July resulted in dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries.Kurram district borders Afghanistan’s Khost, Paktia, Logar, and Nangarhar provinces, known as strongholds for groups like ISIS and the Pakistani Taliban, complicating efforts to curb violence in the area.","Militants ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district on Thursday, killing around 50 people.

Bannu has seen heightened militant violence of late, including the abductions of cops, attack on a prison, attack on a girls’ school, and shootouts that have left several security officials dead.On Monday, over half a dozen policemen were abducted from a checkpost in an adjacent North Waziristan tribal district. They were later recovered by police, with the help of tribal elders.Over the weekend at least eight security personnel were killed and three injured in fierce gun battles with militants in Tirah valley of Khyber tribal district, bordering Afghanistan.On Saturday, at least seven security officials were killed and 18 others wounded in Baluchistan’s Kalat region in a pre-dawn terrorist attack on a checkpost.

The panel has proposed a review by a reputed law firm and global investigative agency.The development comes at a time when Adani Power awaits its delayed payments.Meanwhile, in an extraordinary resolution, the committee, headed by retired high court judge Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury, stated that it needed more time to further analyse all contracts.The panel is gathering evidence that may lead to the potential renegotiation or cancellation of contracts in accordance with international arbitration laws and proceedings, the review committee said in its resolution.

Wounded Bangladesh protesters receive robotic helping hand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/wounded-bangladesh-protesters-receive-robotic-helping-hand/articleshow/115619038.cms,"(Reuters photo)

DHAKA: Squeezing rubber-covered robotic prosthetic hands , Bangladesh protesters wounded during the deadly revolution to topple autocratic leader Sheikh Hasina test out replacement arms for their lost limbs.""I'll be able to do some everyday tasks with this artificial hand,"" said student Hafeez Mohammad Hossain, 19, whose right hand was ripped off in gunfire on August 5.It was the same day protesters stormed Hasina's palace as she fled to India by helicopter.In the middle of the chaos, Hossain said a police officer levelled a shotgun at him and fired. He described searing pain as gun pellets lacerated his back and leg.Surgeons picked out the gunshot, but were unable to save his hand.""I can't write anymore,"" Hossain said. ""I'm struggling to learn how to write with my left hand.""On Thursday he was fitted with a prosthetic limb, alongside four other students who also lost their hands during the months-long protests in which at least 700 people were killed during a police crackdown.Robolife Technologies , a Bangladeshi organisation manufacturing artificial hands, said the prosthetic limbs use sensors connected to the nerves to move.The company says it allows users to grasp objects, to type and use a phone.""If you ask me whether they work like organic hands, I'd say no,"" said Antu Karim, who is working on the government-backed project to fit the limbs.""But these hands allow the boys to hold a glass if thirsty, or a spoon to eat,"" he added. ""At least, they won't be looked down upon for not having hands.""- 'Rely on others' -Hasina's 15-year tenure saw widespread human rights abuses , including the mass detention and extrajudicial killings of her political opponents.Limbless protesters held a rally earlier this month demanding the interim government who took over after Hasina's fall support those injured in the protests.Many say they have not received the aid they need.The four other former protesters who had arms fitted on Thursday included Mohammad Mamun Mia, 32, a father of two, whose hand was hacked off by a gang he said was loyal to Hasina's Awami League party.The new arm is far from perfect, but it has made a huge difference.""I'll be able to do some regular tasks with this hand,"" he said, saying that while he cannot work driving a tractor in the fields again, he hopes now to open a small business.Arif Hossain Sagar, 19, had his hand amputated after it failed to heal from an injury he sustained during the protests, and doctors worried about gangrene.""I can't do any regular activities now,"" Sagar told AFP. ""I rely on others for eating or bathing.""The new hand will return a degree of normality to his life, he said.Nayeem Hasan, wounded when attackers pounced on him as he went to donate blood to help those injured after a fire, broke into tears.The new arm would help him fulfil his simple dream.""I have a one-year-old daughter who wants me to hold her,"" Hasan said.","Hafeez Mohammad Hossain's right hand was ripped off in gunfire on August 5.

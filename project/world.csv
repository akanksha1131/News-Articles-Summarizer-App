California sports body widens entry for ‘biological female’ athletes amid trans athlete controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-sports-body-widens-entry-for-biological-female-athletes-amid-trans-athlete-controversy/articleshow/121452328.cms,"(Image credits: Facebook handle of California interscholastic federation)





The California interscholastic federation (CIF) announced a rule change this week to allow more girls to participate in the upcoming state track-and-field championships following public backlash over the inclusion of a transgender athlete, reported AP.In a statement issued Tuesday, the CIF said it would implement a ""pilot entry process"" to extend entry to more “biological female” athletes. The new rule allows any athlete who missed the automatic qualifying mark but had the next-best result in their section final to compete at the state level.“The CIF believes this pilot entry process achieves the participation opportunities we seek to afford our student-athletes,” the organisation said.The change only applies to this weekend’s competition. The CIF did not say how many athletes would be affected or whether the rule applies to all events or only those where a transgender athlete has qualified for the final. This could be the first time a high school sports governing body in the US has expanded competition in response to the participation of a transgender athlete.The change was introduced after US President Trump criticised the participation of trans athlete AB Hernandez, a transgender athlete competing in girls track and field.Trump threatened Tuesday to pull federal funding from California if the state did not bar transgender students from competing in girls’ sports.“THIS IS NOT FAIR, AND TOTALLY DEMEANING TO WOMEN AND GIRLS,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Hernandez is set to compete in the girls varsity triple jump, high jump, and long jump at the state finals. She won the Division 3 girls long jump and triple jump and placed seventh in the high jump at the Southern Section Division Finals on May 19.Parents and conservative advocates opposed to transgender girls competing in girls sports have criticized Hernandez and heckled her during postseason meets.After losing to Hernandez in the long jump at the sectional final, La Canada High School’s Katie McGuinness called on the CIF to revise its policy.California governor Gavin Newsom recently said on his podcast that it is “deeply unfair” for transgender girls to participate in girls sports.Last month, Democratic state lawmakers in California blocked bills that would have barred transgender girls from participating in girls sports.","California interscholastic federation (CIF) announced a rule change this week to allow more girls to participate in the upcoming state track-and-field championships.

"Donald Trump offers 'Golden Dome' to Canada for free, but only if it becomes 'cherished 51st US state'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-offers-golden-dome-to-canada-for-free-but-only-if-it-becomes-cherished-51st-us-state/articleshow/121452165.cms,"



US President Donald Trump said that Canada could be included in his proposed ""Golden Dome"" missile defense system at ""zero cost"", if it agrees to become the ""cherished 51st state"" of the United States or pay $61 billion to take part in the project.""I told Canada, which very much wants to be part of our fabulous Golden Dome System, that it will cost $61 Billion Dollars if they remain a separate, but unequal, Nation,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.""But (it) will cost ZERO DOLLARS if they become our cherished 51st State. They are considering the offer!"" he added.So far, Canada has not issued an official response to the proposal.Earlier this year, during a visit to Washington, then-defence minister Bill Blair said Canada was interested in joining the missile defense system, calling it “sensible” and in the country’s “national interest.”Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney also confirmed that Canada had held ""high-level"" talks with the United States about joining proposed ""Golden Dome"" missile defense system.""We are conscious that we have an ability, if we so choose, to complete the Golden Dome with investments in partnership (with the US). And it's something that we are looking at and something that has been discussed at a high level,"" Carney said.The ""Golden Dome"" initiative announced by Trump just last week, is a sweeping $175 billion plan aimed at building an advanced air and missile defense shield across North America by the end of his term in 2029.The system depends heavily on Canada’s help, especially using Arctic land to set up radar and tracking stations needed to detect missiles from countries like Russia and China.""Would it be helpful? Probably, but it's not vital or existential,"" said US Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska, downplaying Canada's role. But many defence experts and officials have argued otherwise.Retired US Air Force General Glen VanHerck emphasised that “what Canada really brings is terrain,” which significantly enhances North American early warning capabilities.“If we can position, or Canada positions, over-the-horizon radars further north in the Arctic, that dramatically increases the United States and Canada’s ability to see over the pole into Russia, into China and other places,” he added.Yet, Trump appeared to downplay Canada’s importance in the project during its unveiling.Despite ongoing talks and shared defense responsibilities through NORAD, Trump’s statehood remarks and aggressive posture risk straining US-Canada relations. North American neighbours Canada and the United States are partners in continental defense through the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).During a recent visit to the White House, PM Mark Carney firmly rejected Donald Trump’s statement that Canada should become the 51st US state, stating that his country is “never for sale.”Although some trade tensions have eased, the future of Trump’s proposed Golden Dome missile defense system remains uncertain without Canada’s full support.So far, no final agreement has been reached, but Trump continues to push the idea of closer ties, going as far as suggesting Canada join the US as a state.","US President Donald Trump said that Canada could be included in his proposed ""Golden Dome"" missile defense system at ""zero cost"" If it agrees to become the ""cherished 51st state"" of the United States or pay $61 billion to take part in the project, Trump wrote on Truth Social.

'Trump = traitor': Harvard protesters slam US President's education war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-traitor-harvard-protesters-slam-us-presidents-education-war/articleshow/121452417.cms,"Protesters listen to Harvard University students speak at a protest against President Donald Trump's recent sanctions against Harvard in front of Science Center Plaza.

Students rally amid graduation week

Trump's escalating war on academia

Courts intervene — for now

Alumni, faculty join legal pushback





Hundreds of Harvard University students staged a mass protest Tuesday after the US President Donald Trump's administration announced it would cancel all remaining federal contracts with the university, an aggressive move estimated to cost the institution $100 million.The decision, part of President Donald Trump's sweeping crackdown on elite universities he accuses of fostering liberal bias and antisemitism, triggered immediate backlash on campus. Protesters rallied against what many see as an authoritarian overreach designed to punish academic independence and international inclusion.Gathering near Harvard Yard just days before graduation, students waved placards and chanted slogans like ""Trump = traitor"" and ""Who belongs in class today? Let them stay!"", a direct reference to Trump's revocation of Harvard's accreditation to the US student and exchange visitor program. The move puts thousands of international students and scholars in limbo, with many now facing deportation or forced transfers.""I'm graduating this week, and instead of celebrating, I'm here protesting,"" said senior Alice Goyer, donning her academic gown. ""My international classmates don't know if they'll even be allowed to stay.""The department of homeland security had previously revoked Harvard's authorisation to host foreign students, one of several punitive measures aimed at forcing the university to overhaul its curriculum, admissions process, and DEI programs.The financial cuts announced Tuesday are the latest in a series of attacks against Harvard by the Trump administration. Billions in federal grants have already been frozen, and multiple legal challenges are now underway to overturn the measures.On Monday, Trump doubled down, labelling foreign students at Harvard as ""radicalised lunatics"" and vowing to ""purge the system.""Legal experts say the administration's actions are unlikely to hold up in court. ""The case is so strong that the courts will not let this stand,"" said Ray Brescia, a law professor at Albany Law School.A judge has issued a temporary restraining order on the student and exchange visitor program revocation, with a full hearing scheduled for Thursday, coinciding with Harvard's commencement ceremony.The stakes are high for international students, who make up 27% of Harvard's student body. Many now fear they may be forced to leave the country just as they complete their degrees.British student Jack, who declined to give his full name, said the fallout could impact Harvard's global standing. ""The cloud may pass, but the damage is done. If I were applying for a PhD today, I wouldn't choose the US.""Alumni are also stepping in. On June 9, a group called Crimson Courage plans to file a class-action lawsuit against the administration. Faculty members say the standoff has already harmed Harvard’s academic reputation.""I've had colleagues abroad tell me they're now warning students against applying to US universities,"" said Professor Ryan Enos at the rally. ""It's heartbreaking.""California governor Gavin Newsom, who has clashed with Trump on education policy, called the attacks on Harvard ""a betrayal of American values.""",Harvard University students staged a mass protest after the US President Donald Trump's administration announced it would cancel all remaining federal contracts with the university.

Major pervert:

Atomic bomb of pedophilia:





A French court is to give its verdict Wednesday in the trial of a surgeon who admitted to sexually abusing hundreds of patients over more than two decades, in one of the country's largest child sex abuse cases.Joel Le Scouarnec, 74, is already in prison after being sentenced in 2020 to 15 years for raping and sexually assaulting four children, including two of his nieces.In this trial, which began in February, he has admitted sexually assaulting or raping 299 patients -- 256 of them under 15 -- in hospitals in western France between 1989 and 2014, many while they were under anaesthesia or waking up after operations.Le Scouarnec is charged with 111 rapes and 189 sexual assaults and is set to emerge as one of the most prolific convicted sex predators in France's history.The victims have been represented by around 60 lawyers.""I hope the verdict will be commensurate with the horrors he committed,"" Amelie Leveque, one of the victims, told AFP.""But I don't believe it very much.""Victims and child rights advocates say the surgeon's case highlights systemic shortcomings that allowed Le Scouarnec to repeatedly commit sexual crimes.Prosecutor Stephane Kellenberger on Friday requested the maximum 20-year sentence for the retired surgeon and also made the rare demand that he should be held in a centre for treatment and supervision even after any release.""I am not asking the court for leniency,"" Le Scouarnec said in his closing statement in Vannes in the western region of Brittany on Monday.""Simply grant me the right to become a better person,"" he said.The verdict, which will be handed down by presiding judge Aude Buresi, is set to be announced from noon (1000 GMT).French law does not allow sentences to be added together even when there are multiple victims.One of the lawyers, Maxime Tessier, has asked the court to take into account the ""exceptional"" nature of Le Scouarnec's confession when he admitted all the charges against him in March.The retired surgeon also said he considered himself ""responsible"" for the death of two of his victims -- Mathis Vinet, who died after an overdose in 2021 in what his family says was suicide, and another man who was found dead in 2020.Le Scouarnec documented his crimes, noting his victims' names, ages, addresses and the nature of the abuse.In his notes, the doctor described himself as a ""major pervert"" and a ""paedophile"".""And I am very happy about it,"" he recorded.While Le Scouarnec has asked his victims for forgiveness, many of them have questioned the sincerity of his apologies, which he repeated almost mechanically over the weeks of the trial, sometimes word for word.""You are the worst mass pedophile who ever lived,"" said one of the lawyers representing the victims, Thomas Delaby, describing him as the ""atomic bomb of paedophilia"".The victims ""will never forgive you. Never,"" Delaby told the defendant.""Who are you trying to convince that you've changed?"" said another lawyer, Delphine Caro.""Admitting everything is admitting nothing,"" added a third lawyer, Giovanni Bertho-Briand.The surgeon practised for decades until his retirement in 2017 despite a 2005 sentence for owning sexually abusive images of children and colleagues raising their concerns.Le Scouarnec might stand trial again in the future, the public prosecutor said in his closing speech.The Lorient public prosecutor's office has opened two investigations linked to the retired doctor's case, one of which concerns ""possibly unidentified or newly reported victims"" of sexual assault and rape.There has been frustration among some that the trial has not had the impact in France they hoped for.The case has not won the attention given to the case of Dominique Pelicot, who was jailed last year for recruiting dozens of strangers to rape his now ex-wife Gisele.","Joel Le Scouarnec, 74, is already in prison after being sentenced in 2020 to 15 years for raping and sexually assaulting four children.

'We Want To Know Who...': Donald Trump Targets Harvard Over Foreign Students, Threatens $9B in Cuts

Trump-Putin ‘Secret’ Tango Troubles Zelensky; Despite Rap In Public, US ‘Accepts Russia…’





The Trump administration is directing federal agencies to cancel contracts worth approximately $100 million with Harvard University, a senior administration official confirmed Tuesday, escalating a growing standoff with the Ivy League institution.The move comes on top of more than $2.6 billion in federal research grants that have already been withdrawn from the university. The administration's latest action involves a draft letter from the General Services Administration (GSA), which instructs agencies to review existing agreements with Harvard and seek alternative vendors. A version of the letter was expected to be sent out Tuesday, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The New York Times first reported the existence of the letter.President Donald Trump has sharply criticized Harvard, branding it a “hotbed of liberalism and antisemitism,” amid ongoing tensions over the university's governance and policies. On April 21, Harvard filed a lawsuit challenging the administration’s push for sweeping changes in its leadership structure, admissions processes, and governance.Since then, the administration has retaliated by slashing federal support, restricting international student enrollment, and threatening to revoke the school’s tax-exempt status.A second administration official said about 30 contracts spanning nine federal agencies are under review for cancellation. These include services such as executive training programs for Department of Homeland Security personnel. While some contracts deemed critical may not be terminated immediately, agencies are being asked to prepare transition plans to shift services away from Harvard.The new directive targets only federal contracts and does not affect the university’s remaining research grants.","The move comes on top of more than $2.6 billion in federal research grants that have already been withdrawn from the university.

Court decision follows legal application to purge contempt

Controversial figure remains divisive

Robinson thanks Elon Musk





British TV channels interrupted their regular broadcast on Tuesday morning after Tommy Robinson was released from prison four months early.Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was jailed for 18 months for contempt of court after repeatedly breaching a 2021 injunction. The injunction had been granted to prevent him from making false claims against a Syrian refugee, who later won a libel case against him.GB News presenter Eamonn Holmes told viewers: “Tommy Robinson has been released from jail, that is four months early. He was originally jailed for 18 months for contempt of court after multiple breaches of an injunction, that was four years ago, but reportedly showed a ""change in attitude.”“He was originally due to be released on July 26,"" he added.Robinson looked visibly changed in his first public appearance since his release, sporting a thick beard and appearing older. Social media quickly reacted to the images, with many saying he was “unrecognisable.”Robinson’s early release came after a legal request to purge his contempt of court charge.His lawyers told the high court he had demonstrated a “commitment” to complying with the injunction. This commitment included refraining from repeating defamatory statements about the Syrian teenager.Although progress had been made, Justice Johnson said Robinson still showed “no real remorse or contrition.” Even so, he noted there had been a “change in attitude” since sentencing, which helped justify cutting the sentence.Lawyers representing the Solicitor General did not oppose the move, saying Robinson had taken necessary steps to follow the terms of the court order.Robinson remains one of the UK’s most controversial political figures. He co-founded the far-right English Defence League in 2009 and has faced multiple legal issues since. His supporters have often claimed he is unfairly targeted by the establishment, while critics have long denounced his inflammatory rhetoric and criminal record.His release will likely reignite debate over freedom of speech, contempt of court, and the limits of public discourse. The very issues Robinson himself has often used as rallying cries.Following Robinson's release, the reaction online was swift and polarised. Supporters celebrated his release, while critics questioned the decision and the message it might send.Tommy Robinson thanked Elon Musk as he was released early. Robinson said, ""I have to say a thank you to Elon Musk, because without X, if we didn't have X, everyone would just think I lied. No one would have got any other narrative."" Musk has shown support for Robinson, calling for his release and saying he was jailed ""for telling the truth.""Robinson is seen very differently by people. His supporters view him as a free speech martyr who tells the truth. However, his opponents call him a convicted fraudster who spreads lies and false information.","Tommy Robinson was released from prison four months early.

Annabelle Doll Missing: ‘They lost Annabelle?’ Internet meltdown over haunted doll - here’s what really happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-lost-annabelle-internet-meltdown-over-haunted-doll-heres-what-really-happened/articleshow/121392274.cms,"Annabelle doll (Screengrab from FB video posted by Ryan D. Buell.)

The haunted doll that terrifies millions

From horror icon to internet meme





The infamous Annabelle doll, known as one of the most feared haunted objects in the world, became the center of an internet firestorm in the past few days after social media users claimed it had mysteriously vanished during a paranormal tour in the US. The doll, currently touring the country as part of the “Devils on the Run” exhibit, reportedly wasn’t visible to visitors at a recent stop, sparking fears, conspiracy theories, and viral panic online.The speculation intensified after a fire broke out at the historic Nottoway Resort in White Castle, Louisiana- just days after Annabelle had been displayed in the state. While officials confirmed that no injuries occurred and dismissed any supernatural link to the blaze, social media users quickly pointed to the doll’s presence as a chilling coincidence.“So the streets are saying after they moved the Annabelle doll out of the Warren museum (when they explicitly said never to move it) she's now gone missing.” one user posted on X (formerly Twitter), echoing the sentiments of thousands who feared the worst. Another exclaimed, “WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN THEY LOST THE ANNABELLE DOLL??? ONE OF THE MOST HAUNTED POSSESSIONS?? THAT ANNABELLE?""Despite the viral meltdown, the panic was short-lived.Dan Rivera of the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR), which oversees the Warren Occult Museum’s collection, released a video showing the doll safe and sound in its protective glass case back in Connecticut.“Some wild and crazy internet rumours this morning claiming that we lost Annabelle. She/it is NOT lost,” read the caption alongside the video, posted by Ryan D. Buell.The Annabelle doll’s legend dates back to the 1970s, when it was reportedly given as a gift to a nurse in Hartford, Connecticut. What appeared to be a harmless Raggedy Ann doll soon exhibited disturbing behavior- moving on its own, leaving handwritten notes, and allegedly attacking one of the occupants.The case caught the attention of famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, who concluded that the doll wasn’t possessed by a child’s spirit, but manipulated by a demonic entity. The Warrens took the doll into their care and placed it inside a sealed glass case in their Occult Museum, where it has remained under lock and key- until recently.Though the museum in Monroe, Connecticut, remains closed to the public, Annabelle is currently on a national tour, part of the “Devils on the Run” exhibit. The event showcases haunted artifacts from the Warrens' collection and has drawn massive interest across the country. In May, the doll made headlines after appearing at the former Moundsville State Penitentiary in West Virginia- a notoriously haunted site. A video of the doll being moved into the penitentiary racked up over 9 million views on TikTok, reigniting public fascination with the paranormal.Annabelle’s legend exploded into the mainstream with the 2014 release of Annabelle, the horror film that spun off from The Conjuring franchise. The series has since grossed more than $800 million globally, turning the doll into a pop culture icon—and a consistent source of real-world fear.Following its West Virginia appearance, Annabelle’s tour has included stops in New Orleans and is scheduled to continue in San Antonio, Texas, and other cities, including locations in Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky.In the meantime, whether the doll ever left the museum or whether the sightings were part of a promotional stunt remains unclear. What is certain, however, is that Annabelle continues to captivate and terrify the public imagination.(This is a top Google Trends topic)","The Annabelle doll is currently touring the country as part of the “Devils on the Run’ exhibit.

The body of longtime Las Vegas freelance writer Matthew Kelemen, 56, was discovered last week inside a container at a downtown business.Las Vegas police said they responded to a report of a “foul-smelling odor” on May 20, leading to the grim discovery. Kelemen's cause and manner of death were still under investigation, the coroner's office in Las Vegas said Tuesday.Kelemen's 63-year-old roommate was identified by police as the suspect in his death. However, the man died last week following a high-speed car chase involving the Utah Highway Patrol, reported AP.Police said the pursuit was unrelated to the investigation, but did not provide further details.Kelemen’s sister, Mikki Zaferatos said that her brother had described his roommate as “strange” and had been uncomfortable living with him.Kelemen was a well-known figure in Las Vegas’s media landscape, contributing film reviews, feature stories, and profiles to local outlets for nearly two decades.He wrote regularly for Las Vegas Weekly and served as a staff writer for the now-defunct magazines 944 and City Life after moving to the city in 2003. His final published piece, a story on Donny Osmond’s Strip residency, appeared just days ago in Las Vegas Magazine.","Matthew Kelemen, 56, was a longtime Las Vegas freelance writer.

Watch: SpaceX’s Starship spirals uncontrollably as fuel leaks in dramatic footage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-spacexs-starship-spirals-uncontrollably-as-fuel-leaks-in-dramatic-footage/articleshow/121452049.cms,"SpaceX's 9th test flight fails





SpaceX's Starship's ninth test flight started smoothly, leading many to believe it might be successful, but then the real trouble began.After the last two test flights ended prematurely with the destruction of the aircraft, Tuesday's Starship successfully reached orbit. However, the spacecraft failed to fully open its payload bay door, blocking the planned release of simulated Starlink satellites. Around 30 minutes into the mission, SpaceX confirmed a fuel tank leak aboard the vehicle.In the footage, the first-stage Super Heavy booster exploded shortly before its expected splashdown, and fuel leaks on the upper-stage vehicle caused it to spin uncontrollably before its planned re-entry through Earth's atmosphere.The company posted a statement on X reading, ""As if the flight test was not exciting enough, Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly. Teams will continue to review data and work toward our next flight test. With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today's test will help us improve Starship's reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multiplanetary.”“We’ve been dealing with some leaks on the Ship,” SpaceX communications manager Dan Huot said on the livestream.“This is also what led to that loss of attitude control. So at this point, we are kind of in a spin.”Due to the issue, mission controllers scrapped a planned demonstration to reignite one of Starship’s Raptor engines while in orbit.Despite the complications, Starship is still on course to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere and splash down in the Indian Ocean. However, the uncontrolled spin raises serious concerns about its heat shield surviving the descent.“As we are not able to control the attitude of the ship as we get into entry, it will enter in whatever orientation it is in at the time, which does not bode well for the ship’s heat shield,” Huot said. “So it is definitely coming down. It is definitely heading to the Indian Ocean, but our chances of making it all the way down are pretty slim.”Ahead of the ninth starship test, Space X chief Elon Musk emphasised the significance of tile functionality.In his discussion with YouTuber Tim Dodd, he stated, ""By far most important thing is high heating phase of re-entry and seeing how the tiles perform. Think of this as a tiles mission.""Musk explained that this testing is vital for SpaceX's quick reusability objectives, particularly for efficiently transporting humans to Mars, a goal he intends to achieve in the near future.In his assessment of NASA's Artemis programme, which plans to return humans to the moon, Musk described it as ""objectively feeble"" when compared to SpaceX's Mars mission.He criticised the limited scope of Artemis, stating, ""The goals of Artemis are so small. We should either do a base on the moon or we should send humans to Mars, not just try to do the same thing they did 56 years ago.""",SpaceX Starship fails to open its payload bay door.

White House tensions with Ivy League schools

Barron's college life





Did Barron Trump apply to Harvard and get rejected? That's the question swirling across social media amid political tensions between the US President Donald Trump's administration and elite universities.However, First Lady Melania Trump refuted speculation that her son, Barron Trump, had applied to Harvard University, calling the rumours ""completely false"" in a statement to The Palm Beach Post on Tuesday.""Barron did not apply to Harvard, and any assertion that he, or that anyone on his behalf, applied is completely false,"" Melania said, addressing the social media chatter that claimed the 18-year-old had been denied admission to the Ivy League institution.Since Trump returned to office in January, his administration has taken an aggressive stance against Ivy League universities, including Harvard and Columbia, accusing them of tolerating antisemitism during pro-Palestinian student protests.As part of its crackdown, the White House initially withheld $400 million in federal funding from Columbia University, conditioning the release of the funds on changes to campus policies.Separately, the department of homeland security cancelled nearly $3 million in grants to Harvard after the university declined to meet a list of demands, including eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, revising disciplinary policies, and banning face masks during campus demonstrations.These developments have fueled speculation about personal motives behind federal decisions and led to false reports surrounding Barron Trump's academic future.Barron recently completed his freshman year at New York University's Stern School of Business. He enrolled in September 2024, months before his father's re-election victory.In a December interview with Fox and Friends, Melania Trump opened up about Barron's college life, acknowledging that the experience has been shaped by his unique status.""I don't think it's possible for him to be a normal student. His experience at college is very different than any other kid,"" she said, adding, ""He's very strong, and he knows that he's in a different position than other children.""","First Lady Melania Trump calls rumours that her son Barron applied to Harvard ""completely false"" The 18-year-old recently completed his freshman year at New York University's Stern School of Business.

Why it’s tough to detect prostate cancer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-its-tough-to-detect-prostate-cancer/articleshow/121452171.cms,"Joe Biden

Usual, But Unexpected

A Tricky Customer





Former US president Joe Biden ’s health was a matter of intense focus while he was in office due to his episodes of forgetfulness and verbal slip-ups. But amid the speculation over his alleged cognitive decline, a far more serious illness was silently progressing inside his body. Biden, 82, was diagnosed with prostate cancer last week, and the disease has already metastasised to his bones. His condition has been characterised by a Gleason score of 9, near the top of the 6-10 scale used to grade prostate cancer severity.“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management,” his office said.Delayed diagnosis, experts say, is common in people who skip regular health check-ups or overlook clear signs of the disease. However, they add that late detection in someone as high-profile as Biden, who was president of the US until Jan this year and, therefore, was regularly monitored by a team of doctors, is unexpected and concerning.While some have questioned whether Biden’s cancer could have been detected earlier, experts stress that his doctors were likely following standard protocol. Specialists note that prostate cancer is usually easy to detect early through a simple blood test — Serum PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen).“Early detection is possible in 99% of cases through PSA testing,” said Dr Amrendra Pathak, senior urologist at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi.However, PSA screening isn’t routinely recommended for men over 70, as the risk of overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment may outweigh the benefits, according to reports on Medium, the online publishing platform.Leading medical bodies — including the US Preventive Services Task Force and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network — recommend discontinuing routine PSA testing after a certain age, unless the patient is in exceptionally good health. Given Biden’s age and prior treatment for an enlarged prostate, the absence of a PSA test during his 2024 physical appears to be in line with the guidelines.Even with regular screening, however, prostate cancer can evade early detection. In some cases, the disease is metastatic from the outset, leaving no window for early diagnosis. In others, it may progress rapidly between PSA tests or fail to trigger elevated PSA levels at all. Studies also show that roughly 15% of men with prostate cancer may have normal PSA levels, especially since what is considered a “normal” range increases with age.Dr Manav Suryavanshi, senior consultant and head of the urology division at Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, Faridabad added: “PSA is a critical marker, and in men who are predisposed to prostate cancer — due to family history, genetic mutations like BRCA1/2, or ethnicity — stricter and more frequent screening protocols are essential. In most clinical cases, if these protocols are followed rigorously, prostate cancer is usually detected at an early, localised stage where treatment is not only effective but also potentially curative. ”In early stages, when the disease is localised to the prostate, it can be cured by surgically removing the gland. But doctors say if it reaches a locally advanced stage, that is, if it spreads outside of the prostate gland into nearby tissues, multimodal therapy including surgery, radiotherapy, and hormonal treatment is required.Prostate cancer in India is on the rise, with nearly five lakh new cases being reported every year, said Dr Harit Chaturvedi, chairman, Max Institute of Cancer Care. The burden is expected to rise further due to population growth, increasing life expectancy, and an aging male population in the country.","Biden, 82, was diagnosed with prostate cancer last week, and the disease has already metastasised to his bones.

A fresh wave of suspected fake encounters in Balochistan has led to public anger, as rights activists accuse security forces of killing people in custody and staging the events to look like clashes.Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) on Monday claimed it had killed three militants in an operation in the Tang Kiryar area of Barkhan district. The bodies of Abdul Rehman Buzdar, Fareed Buzdar, and Sultan Marri were later shifted to the Basic Health Unit hospital in Rakni.However, the families of the deceased and Baloch rights groups strongly disputed the official account. They said all three had been missing for months, victims of enforced disappearance, and insisted the encounter was fake.The activists alleged that ""the men were executed after being kept in illegal detention.”A CTD spokesperson said that the men died during an exchange of fire and that weapons were recovered from the scene. But this version of events has been widely rejected.In a separate incident, another youth, Ghaus Bakhsh, was found dead in Awaran district’s Kolwah tehsil. He had reportedly been summoned to a nearby military camp, and his body was discovered just hours later, bearing visible signs of torture.This added to growing suspicions of custodial killings.The Balochistan Post reported both incidents, saying the deaths follow a pattern seen in other districts such as Dukki, Ziarat and Quetta. In those cases too, individuals who had previously gone missing later turned up dead in what were officially described as security operations.Human rights groups and Baloch activists say these cases point to a disturbing trend of state-led violence. They are calling for independent investigations and international attention to ensure accountability. “This is part of a systematic campaign,” said one rights campaigner. “There needs to be an end to the impunity,"" they added.",Rights activists accuse security forces of killing people in custody and staging the events to look like clashes.

At least 14 people were killed and more than 100 injured after powerful windstorms swept across central and northern Pakistan following a days-long heatwave, officials confirmed on Sunday.The storms, described as “particularly destructive” by authorities, battered the provinces of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa as well as Islamabad on Saturday afternoon and evening.Mazhar Hussain, spokesperson for the Punjab disaster management authority, was quoted by news agency AFP as saying, “This windstorm was particularly destructive. The wind speed was very high. There was so much dust in it that visibility was greatly reduced.”According to him, the extreme weather followed several days of intense heat, with temperatures exceeding 45°C. “There were three to four days in the recent heatwave where temperatures went up quite a lot,” he added, attributing the sudden storm to the intense build-up of heat.The majority of casualties were caused by collapsing roofs and walls, while at least two people died after being struck by solar panels dislodged by high-speed winds.In one tragic incident, lightning claimed the life of one man and injured three others.The storms uprooted trees, knocked over electric poles, and caused significant damage to vehicles and infrastructure. Social media was flooded with dramatic videos showing the aftermath, including a viral clip filmed inside a passenger plane struggling to land in Lahore before being diverted to Karachi amid severe turbulence.Islamabad and surrounding areas have also seen multiple unusual hailstorms over April and May, damaging vehicles and solar panels—marking a growing trend of erratic and extreme weather events in the country.Pakistan is widely recognised as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, with early summers and intense heatwaves becoming increasingly common.India is also battling extreme temperatures.

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) warned that severe heatwave conditions will continue in Rajasthan until May 27 and in Punjab, Haryana, and Jammu and Kashmir until May 26.Meanwhile, heavy monsoon rainfall has already arrived on India’s west coast, with IMD forecasting intense downpours over Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Goa in the coming week.Back in Pakistan, the Meteorological Department has predicted more storms on Sunday, raising concerns about further damage and casualties.","Powerful windstorms swept across central and northern Pakistan following a days- long heatwave.

Jailed former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has ruled out any negotiations with Pakistan's civilian government, declaring that only talks with the country’s military establishment are meaningful.In a post on X, Khan said, “Engaging in any talks with the puppet Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government is pointless. This illegitimate Form-47 installed government has already wasted two months. Its only objective is to cling to false authority. It holds no real power.”Khan, who has been behind bars since August 2023 in multiple cases following the collapse of his government in April 2022, stressed that negotiations would only be held with those who actually “hold power”, the military establishment, and only in the national interest.“I do not fear hardship as my resolve remains strong,” he said, while alleging that political cases, abductions, and forced press conferences were being used to dismantle his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. “All prove that the rule of law has been entirely dismantled. What we now have is the law of the jungle,” he added.Reiterating his stance from earlier this week, Khan stated that May 9, 2023, the day of violent protests after his arrest, was a “false flag operation” designed to crush PTI.“No CCTV footage has been presented to this day... The truth will be evident to all if the CCTV footage of that day is made public,” he added, as reported by news agency PTI.In a separate post, Khan also dismissed media reports suggesting that a deal was in the works with the military. “No one has approached me for any negotiations. News claiming otherwise is entirely false,” he said, adding that despite harsh jail conditions, including denial of access to his children and physician, he remains steadfast.He recently took a swipe at Army chief General Asim Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, saying “it might have been more fitting to give him the title of ‘King’ instead, because right now, the country is ruled by the law of the jungle. And in the jungle, there is only one king,” as per PTI.Meanwhile, the Punjab government said Khan has refused to undergo polygraph and voice analysis tests in 12 terrorism cases linked to the May 9 riots for the third consecutive time.Pakistani Punjab’s information minister Azma Bokhari accused Khan of defying court orders, saying he made repeated excuses to avoid the tests. “He must understand this is Adiala Jail, not his Bani Gala residence,” she said.The trial in the GHQ attack case, which was last heard in February, has been adjourned again until May 29. Separately, the hearing in the Toshakhana-II case was postponed to May 26.Khan’s party has also urged the Islamabad High Court to speed up hearings in the Al-Qadir Trust case involving Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi.

The group also called on international institutions to send human rights observers, document alleged violations, and engage with Sindh’s demand for peaceful self-determination.JSMM alleges that demographic engineering through state-sponsored resettlement has diluted Sindh’s ethnic composition, threatening the linguistic and cultural identity of the Sindhi people. Environmental degradation, particularly the diversion of the Indus river’s waters, has compounded local grievances, with widespread desertification of once-fertile lands cited as an ecological consequence of state policy.The statement firmly condemned Pakistan's security forces for committing serious human rights abuses in Sindh, including enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings of political activists, journalists, and student leaders. It mentioned that anti-terrorism legislation is being misused to target secular and nationalist movements, whereas religious extremists receive support from the state.Positioning itself as a secular, democratic movement, JSMM has reiterated its vision for a sovereign Republic of Sindhudesh, grounded in principles of equality, minority protections, and social justice. The group invokes international law including the United Nations Charter and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to support Sindh’s right to self-determination.Long before modern borders were drawn, Sindh flourished as the heart of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation which was a sophisticated urban society that emerged over 5,000 years ago along the banks of the Indus river. With advanced city planning, intricate craftsmanship, and a vibrant mercantile culture, Sindh was once a beacon of early human progress. Mohenjo-daro, one of the civilisation’s most iconic sites, still stands as a testament to the region’s intellectual and architectural legacy. This deep-rooted historical identity is central to the Sindhi nationalist narrative, which views contemporary political struggles as a continuation of a civilisational arc interrupted by colonial conquests and post partition state formation.I n the colonial era, Sindh existed as a distinct administrative region under British India before being annexed, and eventually was re-established as a separate province in 1936. Advocates for Sindhi autonomy argue that this period fostered a unique political consciousness, one that emphasised cultural plurality and regional pride. The Partition of 1947, however, redrew not just boundaries but identities. Over subsequent decades, Sindhi activists have pointed to a pattern of political marginalisation and centralised control, arguing that their historical autonomy has been systematically pulled apart.Framing Sindh’s struggle as both civilizational and contemporary, the charter situated the region within the historical legacy of the Indus valley civilization, asserting that Sindh was forced into joining Pakistan in 1947 and has since faced cultural erasure and economic exploitation. The document claims that Sindh's resources including oil, gas, coal, fertile farmland, and deep-sea ports have been systematically extracted to benefit other regions, while the local population remains economically marginalized.While JSMM’s claims are politically charged and remain unacknowledged by the Pakistani state, the charter marks a significant step in internationalizing what has largely been a domestic conflict.","The Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), a Sindhi nationalist group led by exiled chairman Shafi Burfat, has issued a renewed plea to the United Nations and other international communities.

Islamist leader freed after death sentence overturned by Bangladesh court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/islamist-leader-freed-after-death-sentence-overturned-by-bangladesh-court/articleshow/121432452.cms,"IANS image





Bangladesh’s supreme court on Tuesday overturned the conviction of ATM Azharul Islam, a senior leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami party, who had been on death row since 2014. The court ordered his immediate release, ending a legal battle that had spanned over a decade.Islam, who has been in custody since 2012, was originally convicted for crimes against humanity, including charges of rape, murder, and genocide during Bangladesh’s 1971 independence war from Pakistan. The conviction was delivered under the administration of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina , whose 15-year tenure ended last year amid widespread protests and her subsequent exile.The Jamaat-e-Islami party, of which Islam is a senior leader, had opposed Bangladesh’s independence and was aligned with Pakistani forces during the war, a role that remains a point of national sensitivity and political division in Bangladesh.Following his conviction, Islam appealed in front of the court multiple times. His lawyer, Shishir Monir, highlighted the acquittal as a form of justice, contrasting Islam’s fate with that of five other senior leaders from Jamaat-e-Islami and the Bangladesh National Party (BNP), who had been executed after their convictions. “He got justice because he is alive,” Monir said, noting that the Supreme Court’s appellate division had previously failed to adequately review evidence in other cases.During Hasina’s tenure, Jamaat-e-Islami was banned from political participation, and its leaders faced intensified legal scrutiny. The administration’s crackdown on the party was widely seen as an effort to address long-standing grievances related to the 1971 war and to diminish political opposition.Sheikh Hasina, now in self-imposed exile in India following the revolt last year, has been accused by the interim government and opposition groups of authoritarian tendencies. Her Awami League party was banned as part of the political upheaval that brought a transitional government to power, which has pledged to hold national elections by June 2026.Tuesday’s court ruling has reignited political debate in Bangladesh, with Jamaat-e-Islami supporters celebrating the release of their leader. Party head Shafiqur Rahman acknowledged the sensitive history surrounding Jamaat’s role in the 1971 war but urged for national reconciliation. “We seek your pardon if we have done anything wrong,” he said, emphasizing a desire to move forward while remembering those who had been executed in similar trials.","ATM Azharul Islam, a senior leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami party, had been on death row since 2014.

Who is Kami Rita? Nepal's Sherpa who broke his own record with 31st Everest summit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/who-is-kami-rita-nepals-sherpa-who-broke-his-own-record-with-31st-everest-summit/articleshow/121428623.cms,"Kami Rita (PTI)

Who is Kami Rita, Nepal’s own Everest Man?

Rita’s mountaineering journey dates back to 1992 when he joined an expedition to Everest as a support staff member.



His father was also among the first Sherpa guides.



In a successful mountaineering career spanning from 1994 to 2025, Rita has ascended the Everest, K2, Cho Oyu, Lhotse, and Manaslu.



He scaled Everest for the first time in 1994, and ever since then, he has stood on top of the 8,849-meter summit almost every year.



Over the past two years, Rita has summited Mt. Everest 30 times, achieving this by climbing it twice each season.



According to AP, Rita had vowed to climb the summit for the 31st and even a possible 32nd time before this expedition.







Dubbed as the “Everest man”, Nepal’s Kami Rita, 55, has successfully scaled the world’s highest mountain for the 31st time. Rita broke his own record on Tuesday, more than thirty years after he ascended his first summit.According to Mingma Sherpa of Seven Summit Treks based in Kathmandu, Rita was in good health and reached the summit at around 4 am under stable weather conditions.""This new feat cements his status as the record holder for the highest number of ascents to the top of the world - a record that no one else has come close to,"" said Mingma as reported by Kathmandu Post.Kami Rita was the guide for the Indian Army Adventure Wing Everest Expedition, which was led by Lieutenant Colonel Manoj Joshi.Every year, hundreds of climbers attempt to scale Mt. everest from Nepal’s side. This season itself, Nepal has issued more than 1,100 permits for mountaineers, including 458 for just Everest.Everest's summit was first reached by New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Nepal’s Tenzing Norgay Sherpa in 1953.","Nepal's Kami Rita, 55, has successfully scaled the world's highest mountain for the 31st time.

COLOMBO: Debt-stricken Sri Lanka hosted one of New Zealand's top ministers to discuss ways to deepen bilateral ties in areas such as trade, tourism and agriculture.Winston Peters, New Zealand's deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister, met Sri Lanka's foreign affairs minister Vijitha Herath in the capital, Colombo, on Monday. The five-day visit by Peters is scheduled to continue until WednesdayThe visit comes as Sri Lanka struggles to emerge from its worst economic crisis, which began in the Indian Ocean island nation three years ago.The countries have improved relations in recent years, establishing a New Zealand embassy in Colombo in 2021 and a Sri Lankan embassy in Wellington this year.The discussion Monday focused on advancing ties in trade, investment, agriculture, education, and tourism, Herath said.""We also explored expanding trade links in high-potential sectors such as dairy, processed food, fresh produce and discussed improving market access for Sri Lankan products,"" Herath told reporters.He commended New Zealand's support in developing Sri Lanka's dairy industry, saying it had a ""transformational impact on rural livelihood.""Sri Lanka has embarked on an effort to expand and modernize its domestic dairy industry in recent years, but still produces only about 40% of the country's demand for milk and dairy products, while the balance is imported.New Zealand is a key supplier of those dairy products, especially milk powder.In 2024, New Zealand exported $335 million in goods to Sri Lanka, with dairy products forming the bulk.Trade balance between the nations favors New Zealand, which in 2024 imported goods worth $64 million from Sri Lanka, including tea, coffee, apparel and rubber products.The discussion included reducing red tape at the border and how to ""increase Sri Lanka's market access capabilities,"" Peters said.""We discussed the growing number of New Zealand companies working with and investing in Sri Lanka or looking to work with Sri Lankan partners,"" said Peters, adding that those collaborations will benefit Sri Lanka's tourism, agriculture and healthcare sectors.Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy in April 2022 with more than $83 billion in debt, more than half to foreign creditors. It sought the help of the International Monetary Fund, which approved a $2.9 billion, four-year bailout package in 2023 under which Sri Lanka was required to restructure its debt.In September last year, Sri Lanka said it had concluded the debt restructuring process after reaching agreements with bilateral and multilateral creditors and private bondholders. Sri Lanka is seeking to obtain $17 billion in debt service relief.Sri Lanka's crisis was largely the result of economic mismanagement combined with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, along with 2019 terrorism attacks that devastated its important tourism industry. The pandemic also disrupted the flow of remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad.","Winston Peters, New Zealand's deputy prime minister, met Sri Lanka's foreign affairs minister.

DHAKA: Bangladesh security forces surrounded the national tax authority headquarters on Sunday as its employees extended a two-week-long strike over the interim government's reforms, reportedly leaving millions of dollars in taxes uncollected.Government orders to overhaul the powerful tax authority, the National Board of Revenue (NBR), have sparked fury from ordinary employees to top management.""Tax, customs, and VAT -- all three wings will observe a complete work abstention from Monday,"" Joint Tax Commissioner Monalisa Saha Sushmita told reporters at the main NBR building in Dhaka, where police and armed security gathered.Bangladesh has been in turmoil since a student-led revolt ousted former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, ending her 15-year iron-fisted rule.The interim government -- led by Nobel Peace Prize microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus -- is trying to instil sweeping government reforms.The tax board protest reflects the divisions, rival loyalties and confusion between government branches and the caretaker administration.The government order issued on May 12 proposed splitting the powerful money-raising NRB into two.Crucially, it would also hand control of the new sections to government-chosen civil servants from outside the NRB.Sushmita claimed that the strike will mean, in effect, that ""imports and exports will also be halted"" and that tax revenues totalling between $122-163 million per day had not been collected since the strike began.It was not possible to verify those figures.Bangladesh is the world's second-largest garment manufacturer, while textile and garment production accounts for about 80 percent of the country's exports.The industry has been rebuilding after it was hit hard by last year's unrest.In separate protests on Sunday, hundreds of civil servants demonstrated in Dhaka against a government order giving it greater power to sack employees for disciplinary breaches.""If the government proceeds with the amended ordinance, the interim government will face severe criticism,"" said Mohammad Nazrul Islam from the Inter-Ministerial Employees Association.",Government orders to overhaul the powerful tax authority have sparked fury from ordinary employees to top management.

DHAKA: Bangladesh began the first trial on Sunday at a special court prosecuting former senior figures connected to the ousted government of Sheikh Hasina, the chief prosecutor said.The court in the capital Dhaka accepted a formal charge against eight police officials in connection to the killing of six protesters on August 5 last year, the day Hasina fled the country as the protesters stormed her palace.The eight men are charged with crimes against humanity.

They inhaled a gas and scaled Everest in days. Is it the future of mountaineering?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/they-inhaled-a-gas-and-scaled-everest-in-days-is-it-the-future-of-mountaineering/articleshow/121451558.cms,"Photo/Agencies

With xenon, 'you feel better.'

The use of the gas is 'against climbing ethics.'





Climbing Mount Everest typically takes weeks, with most of that time spent at the foot of the mountain adjusting to the thin air. But four British men last week shrank that timeline dramatically, traveling from London to the summit and back in less than a week, according to the organizer of their expedition.They skipped the adjustment period, in part, by inhaling a secret weapon: xenon gas.Their feat has roiled the world of mountaineering and prompted an investigation by the Nepalese government, as use of the gas is fiercely debated. Some research has shown that xenon can quickly acclimatize people to high altitudes, even as some experts say the benefits, if any, are negligible and the side effects of its use remain unclear.Organizers said the gas was key to the speed of the climb, but their approach has prompted a broader debate that strikes at the core of mountaineering: Should scaling Mount Everest , one of sporting's greatest accomplishments, be made easier -- available to more people during a quick vacation -- with the help of a performance enhancer?""It is a provocation, especially for traditional mountaineers, who feel bad about this idea that you can climb Everest in less than a week,"" Lukas Furtenbach, who organized the exhibition, said in a phone interview from the base of the mountain.""This showed that it can work.""Furtenbach said that beginning in 2026 he planned to offer two-week round-trip excursions to Mount Everest using xenon gas, cutting the typical time needed to scale the mountain by several weeks.""This can be the future of commercially guided mountaineering on Mount Everest,"" he said.For those who live at lower elevations and have traveled to the mountains, the discomfort of altitude sickness is all too clear. Symptoms include nausea, headaches and disrupted sleep, and in some cases it can lead to brain swelling or even death.As you go higher, less oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream with each breath. That is why so many people who climb Everest use supplemental oxygen.Xenon, an odorless gas, has been known for years to activate a molecule called the hypoxia-inducible factor, which is also turned on when people acclimate to low oxygen, said Hugh Montgomery, a professor of intensive care medicine at University College London and a mountaineer who led an expedition to Mount Everest to study how humans respond to low oxygen.""So what these people claim to have done,"" he said, ""is basically found a way to switch on the adaptation to low oxygen levels.""The group took what was known from medical science, he said, ""and have now applied it, recreationally, to sport mountaineering.""Montgomery said scientists were still unsure how xenon triggers this response.While some doctors have used the gas in the past to ""precondition"" patients to low oxygen levels -- for example, before major heart surgery -- the practice hasn't really caught on because ""it hasn't been as protective as one would hope,"" he said.Mike Shattock, a professor of cellular cardiology at King's College London, said ""xenon probably does very little, and there is virtually no reputable scientific evidence that it makes any difference.""Experts cautioned that self-medicating with xenon, which has the effects of anesthesia, could lead to overdose or death, and more study was needed to understand how the gas works and its use in mountaineering.On Mount Everest, the weeks of training and acclimation on the lower levels of the mountain are typically required to survive the ""death zone,"" the area above 26,000 feet where the air is particularly thin.The British group, which included four former special forces members, took a different approach.About 10 weeks before the expedition, the men began sleeping in hypoxic tents, which lower oxygen levels in the air and gradually acclimatized the hikers to conditions on Mount Everest, Furtenbach said.While hypoxic tents have been used by some climbers for years, the big innovation for the British expedition came two weeks before the excursion, when the men flew to Limburg, Germany, outside Frankfurt, where a doctor, Michael Fries, had been experimenting with inhaled gases in his clinic.The men wore masks hooked up to ventilators as an anesthesiologist slowly introduced higher levels of xenon into their systems.Furtenbach, who has tried xenon gas on his own mountaineering trips since 2020, said that after the treatment, users experienced enhanced breathing and the sensation of more lung volume, and ""when you do your workout or training, you feel better.""After arriving at the base of Everest, the British group climbed to the summit in less than three days, which Furtenbach said was one of the fastest times for a group that hadn't acclimatized on the mountain. (According to the Nepalese government, the record for the fastest climb overall is held by Lakpa Gelu, a Sherpa, who reached the top of the mountain in just under 11 hours.)The rapid climb by the British expedition and the use of the gas caught the eye of the Nepalese government, and the fallout has been swift.Himal Gautam, director of Nepal's tourism department, which is responsible for regulating expeditions on the nation's mountains, said in an interview that using the gas was ""against climbing ethics,"" and that it would hurt the country's tourism industry and the Sherpas who help climbers by reducing their time on the mountain.Gautam said his department was looking into the use of the gas by the British climbers, one of whom, Alistair Carns, is also a member of Parliament.In an interview, Carns said that his expedition had been in touch with the ministry and clarified with the department that it had not taken the gas on the mountain.He added that many people who want to climb Mount Everest don't have the time to spend multiple weeks acclimating.""The reality is if I had six to eight weeks to climb Everest, I would, but I'm a government minister, and I don't have time,"" he said. ""What we've done is we've proven that you can reduce the timeline safely.""Others in the mountaineering community have warned against the use of the gas.In January, the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation, a global network that promotes and protects the sport, released a statement that said there was no evidence that xenon gas improved performance, adding that ""inappropriate use can be dangerous.""The federation noted that xenon has been on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of banned substances since 2014 and is not approved in all countries.""From a medical point of view, off-label use without a scientific basis and with unknown health risks must be rejected,"" the statement said.Furtenbach argued that his expeditions were still using Sherpas -- five accompanied the British climbers to the summit -- and that shorter times on the mountain were safer, as they reduce the chance that climbers will be exposed to other health threats, including avalanches, hypothermia or falls.He said the prohibition of the gas by the World Anti-Doping Agency didn't apply to mountaineering because it is not a regulated competitive sport.Use of the gas gets at a core question about why people climb mountains in the first place, Montgomery said.""Is it really a good idea that we can all have what we want, when we want, as quick as we want?"" he asked. ""Are we missing out on the sacrifice you sometimes have to make to get the achievement?""""I'm not a critic,"" he added. ""But maybe just bagging every hill at speed means you miss out on the joy you could have had.""","Xenon gas can quickly acclimatize people to high altitudes, some research shows. Some experts say the benefits, if any, are negligible and the side effects of its use remain unclear. Four British men last week traveled from London to the summit and back in less than a week.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121451579,imgsize-856938,width-400,resizemode-4/121451579.jpg"

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

"Right-wing, anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson released early from prison: Why was his jail term controversial?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-was-tommy-robinsons-jail-term-controversial-right-wing-anti-islam-activist-released-early-from-prison/articleshow/121435178.cms,"Far-right activist Tommy Robinson, after being released from jail (Photo: X)

The first was in June 2023 and focused on Robinson promoting a film called Silenced, which included defamatory claims. It was also pinned to the top of his X profile and shared in interviews. The second was filed in August and concerned Robinson playing the film at a rally in Trafalgar Square and included six further breaches.





Far-right activist Tommy Robinson was released early from prison on Tuesday after a high court judge reduced his sentence for contempt of court by four months.Robinson's real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. He was serving an 18-month jail term for breaching a court order that barred him from repeating false allegations about a Syrian refugee. The 42-year-old left HMP Woodhill in Buckinghamshire on Tuesday, after the court accepted that he had shown a “change in attitude” and taken steps to comply with the injunction.In October 2024, Robinson was sentenced to 18 months—14 months as punishment and four months as a coercive measure to push him to follow a 2021 injunction. That injunction followed a successful libel case by Jamal Hijazi, a schoolboy Robinson falsely accused online of attacking girls, despite a viral video in 2018 showing Hijazi being assaulted.Although the sentencing judge noted Robinson showed “no remorse or contrition”, Mr Justice Jeremy Johnson ruled last week that the coercive part of the sentence had served its purpose.After the release, Robinson appeared visibly changed, with longer hair and a beard.In a video shared on his X account, he gave an assurance that he would not repeat the allegations.“He has given an assurance that he will comply with the injunction in the future, that he has no intention of breaching it again,” said Justice Johnson. “I consider it appropriate to grant the application.”The Solicitor General brought two contempt cases against Robinson after he ignored the high court’s order.In total, he admitted to ten breaches of the injunction. The court heard Robinson’s behaviour had led to a campaign of abuse against Hijazi and forced the teenager’s family to move house for their safety, reports the Independent.Despite previously fleeing the country to avoid legal consequences, Robinson returned and was taken into custody in October 2024.Robinson's legal team argued that he had removed much of the offending content and no longer intended to defy the injunction. The judge accepted this, but warned that any future breaches could land him back in prison for up to two years.Contempt of court, though classified as a civil offence, can still lead to criminal penalties such as imprisonment. It typically involves behaviour that disrupts the legal process, like breaching reporting restrictions or sharing material that could affect active cases. In Robinson’s case, the offences stemmed from defying a legal reporting ban, rather than any direct attempt to influence the outcome of a trial.",Far-right activist Tommy Robinson was released early from prison on Tuesday.

King Charles to outline Mark Carney's priorities in Canada's Parliament amid Trump annexation threat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/king-charles-to-outline-mark-carneys-priorities-in-canadas-parliament-amid-trump-annexation-threat/articleshow/121427902.cms,"AP photo





King Charles III will outline new Prime Minister Mark Carney's government priorities in a speech in the Canadian Parliament on Tuesday. It's widely viewed as a show of support in the face of annexation threats by US President Donald Trump.Trump's repeated suggestion that the US annex Canada prompted Prime Minister Carney to invite Charles to give the speech from the throne. The king is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies.Carney said in a statement the visit speaks to the ""vitality of our constitutional monarchy and our distinct identity.""It is rare for the monarch to deliver what's called the speech from the throne in Canada. Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, did it twice in her 70-year reign, the last time in 1977.The speech is not written by the king or his UK advisers as Charles serves as a nonpartisan head of state. He will read what is put before him by Canada's government.Carney , the new prime minister and a former head of the Bank of England, and Canada's first Indigenous governor general, Mary Simon, the king's representative in Canada, met with the king on Monday.Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, but Carney has been eager to show the differences between Canada and the United States. The king's visit clearly underscores Canada's sovereignty, he said.Carney won the job of prime minister by promising to confront the increased aggression shown by Trump.The new US ambassador to Canada, Pete Hoekstra, said sending messages to the US isn't necessary and Canadians should move on from the 51st state talk, telling the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that if there's a message to be sent there are easier ways to do that, such as calling him or calling the president.A horse-drawn carriage will take the king and queen to the Senate of Canada Building for the speech. It will accompanied by 28 horses - 14 before and 14 after. He will receive the Royal Salute from the 100-person guard of honor from the 3rd Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment before entering the chamber for his speech.The king will return to the Uk after the speech and a visit to Canada's National War Memorial.","King Charles III will outline new Prime Minister Mark Carney's government priorities in a speech in the Canadian Parliament on Tuesday.

LONDON: Salman Rushdie said Monday he was ""pleased"" with the maximum 25-year jail sentence handed to a man who tried to kill him with a knife at a New York cultural centre in 2022.""I was pleased that he got the maximum available, and hopefully he uses it to reflect upon his deeds,"" Rushdie told BBC radio in an interview.Hadi Matar was sentenced to 25 years in a New York court on May 16 after being convicted of attempted murder and assault. Video footage played during the trial showed Matar rushing onto stage and plunging a knife into Rushdie that left the British-American author blind in one eye.Last year, Rushdie published a memoir recounting the experience called ""Knife"", in which he has an imagined conversation with Matar. ""If I was to really meet him... I wouldn't get very much out of him,"" Rushdie said. ""And so I thought, well, I could open it by myself. I'd probably do it better than a real conversation would."" afp","Hadi Matar was sentenced to 25 years in a New York court on May 16 after being convicted of attempted murder and assault.

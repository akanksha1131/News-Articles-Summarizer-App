"Middle-East conflict: Palestinian factions approve ‘technocratic government’ for Gaza; Rubio says no Hamas, no plan B",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/middle-east-conflict-palestinian-factions-approve-technocratic-government-for-gaza-rubio-says-no-hamas-no-plan-b/articleshow/124798915.cms,"AP file photo





A week after US President Donald Trump signed the Gaza peace plan in Egypt, Hamas said a committee of technocrats will take over governing postwar Gaza, representing several Palestinian factions.The groups said they had agreed to the arrangement after Hamas claimed to have received “clear guarantees” from mediators that “the war has effectively ended.”Hamas said in the statement that Palestinian factions agreed in a Cairo meeting to hand “over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a temporary Palestinian committee composed of independent ‘technocrats’, which will manage the affairs of life and basic services in cooperation with Arab brothers and international institutions”.The Hamas statement did not specify who would serve on the proposed Palestinian technocratic committee, which is expected to require US approval before taking shape.The statement also called for a meeting to “agree on a national strategy and to revitalise the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.”Hamas, which is not part of the PLO, is facing its longtime rival, Fatah, the group that dominates the organisation.This comes amid an appeal from Fadwa Barghouti, wife of prominent Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti, who urged Trump on Friday to intervene for her husband’s release from an Israeli prison.In a letter to Trump, she asked him to push for his discharge. Marwan Barghouti has been serving multiple life sentences since 2002 for deadly attacks on Israelis but is seen by many Palestinians as a potential unifying figure for their national movement.Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement on Friday that Hamas “cannot be involved in governing Gaza in the future.”He added that all countries backing Trump’s plan, providing funding, personnel, or both, have agreed to this.He also said that “there is no plan B” for Gaza, only Trump’s broad peace plan, and warned that Israel’s annexation of the West Bank would “threaten the peace process.”Rubio also said Israel has fulfilled its commitments under the first phase of the 20-point Trump plan, which began with the ceasefire on October 10.He added that Israel would need to be “comfortable” with the composition of the international force set to enter Gaza during the second phase, which is still being finalized, as cited by the Times of Israel.",Hamas said a committee of technocrats will take over governing postwar Gaza. The groups said they had agreed to the arrangement after Hamas claimed to have received “clear guarantees” from mediators that “the war has effectively ended”,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124798942,imgsize-1296008,width-400,resizemode-4/ap-file-photo.jpg"
Watch: Diwali celebrations go wrong; fireworks set homes on fire from New York to Canada,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-diwali-celebrations-go-wrong-fireworks-set-homes-on-fire-from-new-york-to-canada/articleshow/124797933.cms,"Diwali fireworks hit homes (X)





Illegal Diwali fireworks sparked major house fires in both the United States and Canada this week, leaving families homeless and prompting renewed calls for tougher enforcement of fireworks bans.In New York state's Queens (South Ozone Park), a fire broke out around 2:25am on Wednesday after fireworks, believed to be part of a Diwali celebration, flew into a home and ignited flames that spread to three houses on Foch Boulevard and Lincoln Street, according to the FDNY, reported CBS News.Surveillance footage showed fireworks shooting directly into one of the homes before bright orange flames engulfed the area. “I was up and I smelled the smoke and saw the fire,” said neighbor Mohiuddin Saif. “Came running down, called my mother- and father-in-law… we basically all just ran outside at the same time.”Three people inside the first home managed to escape, though two were hospitalized, officials said. Neighbors described chaotic scenes as thick smoke filled the sky and heat melted exteriors of nearby houses.One resident, Juanita Colon, said her family lost everything.“We got nothing now because everything is ruined. My son has no clothes. We have to be in a hotel room living out of a hotel,” she told CBS News.Saif said he had called 911 around midnight to report people setting off fireworks in the street. “I was told that somebody would come and check. But then I was waiting, nobody came,” he said. “I did take some pictures, videos… then, I just went back to my bed.”Multiple 311 complaints were reportedly made about fireworks and noise before the fire. “It was all night, since 9 p.m.,” said neighbor Ruth Ragoonauth. “You can celebrate to a certain time, but why celebrate until 1, 2, 3 in the morning when people’ve got to get up early to go to work?” added Charlie Cuebas.By afternoon, the street was littered with melted vehicles, hollowed-out homes, and leftover boxes of fireworks. “It’s crazy, it’s totally gone,” a resident said. “At least they were able to get out. That’s the most important thing, their life.”A similar incident was reported in Edmonton, Canada, where a family also lost their home after alleged illegal Diwali fireworks set it ablaze, as permits are required within city limits.Edmonton fire rescue estimated damages at around $175,000, and police charged three people with arson, according to Yegwave. The fire also spread to a neighboring house.The homeowner, whose Millwoods residence was destroyed, said his family “lost their house” and called for tougher penalties against illegal fireworks use.Authorities in both New York and Edmonton have reiterated that fireworks are strictly prohibited without a permit, even during cultural celebrations such as Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights.","Illegal Diwali fireworks sparked major house fires in both the United States and Canada this week, leaving families homeless and prompting renewed calls for tougher enforcement of fireworks bans.

An Indian nurse working at Singapore’s Raffles Hospital has been sentenced to one year and two months in jail for molesting a male visitor. The court passed the sentence on Friday.He also received two strokes of the cane, a form of corporal punishment for the same.The 34-year-old nurse, Elipe Siva Nagu, committed the offence in June this year inside a patient’s toilet at the hospital on North Bridge Road, according to court documents.Deputy Public Prosecutor Eugene Phua told the court that the victim had gone to visit his grandfather, who was admitted to the hospital.At around 7.30 pm, the victim went to use the toilet and Elipe looked inside while he was using it. On the pretext of wanting to “disinfect” the victim, Elipe put soap on his hand and molested him.The victim, shocked by the incident, did not react immediately and later returned to his grandfather’s bedside. The case was reported to the authorities a few days later, and Elipe was arrested on June 23.DPP Phua informed the court that the incident caused the victim emotional distress, including recurring flashbacks. The hospital suspended Elipe from his nursing duties following the offence, news agency PTI reported citing The Straits Times.In a separate case last month, another Indian national and Singapore permanent resident, Ankit Sharma, 46, was jailed for four years for molesting a woman in a nursing room at Changi City Point mall.","Indian nurse jailed for one year and two months for molesting male visitor.

Will ask him about Fentanyl: Trump

What to expect in Trump-Xi meeting

US-China ties





US President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday, reaffirming the meeting that had been questioned following an escalation in trade tensions.Leavitt informed reporters that Trump departs for Malaysia late on Friday night and will also visit Japan and South Korea. In South Korea, he is scheduled to meet Xi next Thursday after addressing the APEC CEO Summit.""On Thursday morning local time, President Trump will participate in a bilateral meeting with President Xi of the People's Republic of China, before departing to return home,"" Leavitt said.Trump on Thursday (local time) took a tough stance on China's alleged role in smuggling fentanyl into the US via Venezuela.He accused China of using Venezuela as a transit point for fentanyl, evading US and Mexican port controls. Trump, during a press interaction at the White House, stated that the first question he would ask the Chinese leader would be about fentanyl.""I'm meeting with President Xi... The first question I'm going to be asking him about is fentanyl. They make $100 million selling fentanyl into our country. They lose $100 billion with the 20% tariff.So it's not a good business proposition... It's one of the things we're talking about... They pay a very big penalty for doing that... We'll see what happens at the end of next week... I'm meeting with President Xi, actually, in South Korea. ..,"" said Trump.There is a lot at stake, so pressure is building on both leaders Trump and Xi to calm trade tensions that risk damaging the world’s two biggest economies.In this meeting, Trump is expected to crack a deal with Xi as he recently offered to lower tariffs on Chinese exports to the US but insisted that Beijing, too, had to make concessions, including resuming purchases of US soya beans, curbing the flow of ingredients used to make the opioid fentanyl – which has caused an overdose epidemic in America – and lifting restrictions on the export to the US of rare earth minerals, which are needed to manufacture hi-tech products such as smartphones, Guardian reported.Rare-earth stocks continue to be at the top of investors’ minds as the market weighs potential outcomes of a meeting between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies.A failure to reduce trade tensions could further harm US industries that are already grappling with the impact of Trump’s tariffs.The President was optimistic ahead of his meeting with Xi, telling reporters this week: “I think we’re going to end up having a fantastic deal with China … it’s going to be fantastic for the entire world”.Time is of the essence, however, as Trump and Xi’s meeting, yet to be confirmed by Beijing, is scheduled to occur just as additional duties of 100% on Chinese exports to the US are set to take effect.The leaders are also expected to discuss Taiwan, amid concerns that Trump might hesitate in Washington’s support for the democratic, self-governing island under pressure from Xi.Beijing has reportedly requested the White House to declare opposition to Taiwan independence – a move that would please China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province that must be reunified with the mainland.Trade tensions between the United States and China intensified in recent weeks following President Trump's announcement of 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese exports, set to take effect two days after the leaders meet.Trump's pledge followed China's announcement of newly imposed export controls on rare earth metals and related technologies in electronics and military goods.The new US tariffs would be “over and above any tariff” that China is already paying, Trump wrote in a social media post earlier this month. Trump added on Wednesday that his priority is to end Russia's war in Ukraine.Xi “would now like to see that war end,” the president said. It will be the first in-person meeting between the leaders since 2019, when the two met in Japan at the G20 summit, as per Politico.","US President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea.

NYC Mayoral Debate Heats Up: Watch Mamdani & Cuomo’s Fiery Clash Over Hamas, Islamophobia &…





New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani continues to hold a double-digit lead in the race, but his advantage over Andrew M. Cuomo tightens considerably when Republican Curtis Sliwa is excluded from the contest, according to a new poll.A new poll from AARP and Gotham Polling indicates that Democrat Zohran Mamdani maintains a lead in the New York City mayoral race with 43.2%.Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo follows in second place at 28.9%, while Republican Curtis Sliwa holds third place with 19.4%. The race is entering its final phase, with the next debate scheduled for Wednesday, early voting set to commence in five days, and Election Day 15 days away, CBS news reported.CBS News New York reports that the same poll suggests a tight race between Cuomo and Mamdani should Sliwa withdraw, placing Cuomo four percentage points behind Mamdani—within the poll's margin of error. In such a scenario, Mamdani would lead with 44.6% against Cuomo's 40.7%.""I’m not dropping out,"" Sliwa declared, reaffirming his participation in the race. Last week, Cuomo had expressed that Sliwa's continued campaign would hinder his chances of defeating Mamdani.However, on Monday morning, Cuomo altered his stance, stating on Fox News that Sliwa is ""irrelevant.""""He does take a certain number of votes, and to that extent, he is a spoiler. I believe he’s, ultimately, irrelevant, because he’s not a viable candidate and I don't think people are gonna throw away their vote,"" Cuomo stated.Sliwa responded, ""I’m not dropping out. One person, one vote. That’s how we determine elections. I never heard a caveat that said one person, one vote, and of course others need to drop out along the way.""Mamdani welcomed Sliwa's participation, stating, ""It’s genuinely positive for our democracy that there’s another candidate in this race who believes New York City voters should pick their next mayor, not billionaires who mostly live somewhere else.""He also criticised Cuomo for focusing on other candidates, noting, ""We are spending this time speaking directly to New Yorkers. Andrew Cuomo is spending it speaking about the other candidates.""

Orionid meteor shower peaks over US tonight: When and where to catch the blazing trails,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/orionid-meteor-shower-peaks-over-us-tonight-when-and-where-to-catch-the-blazing-trails/articleshow/124715574.cms,"The Orionid meteor shower peaks tonight across the US, offering up to 20 meteors per hour for stargazers / Photo credit: NASA / Twitter [@NASA]

What’s the buzz about the Orionid Meteor shower?

Best time across the US

Peak Date: Night of October 20 into the morning of October 21.

Best Time: After 1:00 a.m. local time until the start of dawn. This is when the radiant point is highest in the sky.

Where to Look: The shower gets its name from its radiant—the point where the meteors appear to originate which is located in the well-known Orion constellation . Look toward the eastern sky after midnight, where the constellation will be rising, eventually climbing highest toward the south-southeast before sunrise.

Why is 2025 the best year to watch?





Tonight, stargazers across the United States have a cosmic treat: the Orionid meteor shower peaks, offering up to 20 shooting stars per hour. From New York to Los Angeles, the best viewing is after midnight until dawn, with clear, dark skies giving skywatchers a front-row seat to Halley’s Comet debris streaking across the night sky. Don’t miss this annual celestial spectacle—perfect for a late-night blanket and a hot cocoa under the stars.If you love a little magic in the night sky, tonight is your chance! The Orionid meteor shower, born from debris left by Halley’s Comet, is lighting up the sky. Peak viewing starts late October 20 into the early hours of October 21, 2025, giving skywatchers across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres a stellar show.This year, you can expect up to 20 meteors per hour streaking across the sky, creating a dazzling display of “falling stars.” The best part? No telescope needed, your eyes are enough to enjoy the spectacle.The best time to see the Orionids in 2025 will be during their peak activity, which occurs on the night of Monday, October 20, into the early morning of Tuesday, October 21. For U.S. viewers, the key viewing window is between midnight and dawn.During the peak, observers under a clear, dark sky can expect to see an average of 10 to 20 meteors per hour.Pro-Tip: You do not need to look directly at the Orion constellation. Meteors will appear across the entire sky. In fact, looking 45 to 90 degrees away from Orion will give you longer, more impressive meteor streaks due to an effect called foreshortening.Even if you can’t reach these far-off locations, any dark spot away from city lights will dramatically improve your meteor viewing experience. Remember to bring a blanket, snacks, and binoculars if you have them.This year’s Orionid meteor shower comes at a perfect astronomical timing: it coincides with a new moon. That’s great news for stargazers because a new moon means the sky is naturally darker, with no moonlight washing out the faint meteors. Without the interference of a bright moon, even the smallest, faintest meteors become visible to the naked eye. This makes it easier to spot streaks shooting across the sky at up to 66,000 mph, producing the iconic “falling star” effect that makes meteor showers so magical.Another advantage this year is the late October timing. During this period, much of the United States experiences cooler, crisp autumn nights, which often coincide with clearer skies. Unlike summer evenings that may be hazy or humid, fall nights offer better air transparency, helping meteors appear brighter and more vivid. For US viewers, this combination of a new moon, cool autumn skies, and the Orionids’ peak activity makes 2025 a particularly prime year to witness the meteor shower.Even casual stargazers or families watching from their backyard can enjoy a spectacular display of up to 20 meteors per hour, creating a true “sky full of falling stars” experience that’s hard to forget. The Orionids aren’t just any meteor shower, they’re remnants of Halley’s Comet, streaking through our skies after millions of years. Tonight is a chance to witness 20 meteors per hour, make wishes, and share the moment with friends and family. So grab your blanket, maybe a thermos of cocoa, and head outside - your personal cosmic show awaits.","The Orionid meteor shower peaks tonight across the US, offering up to 20 meteors per hour for stargazers.

The GOP government, MAGA bigwigs and senior federal officials have placed blame on Blue state California after an 18-wheeler semi-truck crash killed three people earlier this week.The incident involved an undocumented immigrant named Jashanpreet Singh, whose commercial driver’s licence was issued despite federal restrictions.US President Donald Trump’s Transportation Secretary, Sean Duffy, released a report Thursday accusing California of violating federal law by issuing a commercial driver’s license to Indian-origin Jashanpreet Singh.The 21-year-old Singh allegedly caused a crash on the I-10 Freeway while under the influence of drugs. The incident left three people dead, including a Pomona High School basketball coach and his wife, and four others injured.Duffy said California ignored a federal order to halt noncompliant licences and revoke improperly issued credentials, claiming the failure cost ""three innocent souls."" He added, ""My prayers are with the families of the victims of this tragedy. It would have never happened if Gavin Newsom had followed our new rules.California broke the law and now three people are dead and two are hospitalised. These people deserve justice. There will be consequences.""The Department of Transportation’s 2025 Annual Program Review and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) found flaws in California’s system for licensing non-domiciled commercial drivers, reports Fox News. The audit revealed ""systemic policy, procedural, and programming errors,"" including licences that remained valid after federal work authorisation expired.Singh’s licence was issued on June 27, 2025, and federal investigators flagged compliance failures on September 26. Despite a federal emergency rule limiting eligibility to drivers with certain employment-based visas, California upgraded Singh’s licence on October 15. The FMCSA review found more than one-fourth of sampled non-domiciled licences in California were incorrectly issued, prompting an order to halt new licences and review existing ones under threat of losing up to $160 million in federal highway funding.Dashcam footage from the crash showed Singh’s truck colliding with a white SUV, pushing a red sedan into a fireball, and striking other vehicles and utility trucks before coming to a stop.Singh illegally entered the United States via the southern border in March 2022 and was released pending an immigration hearing under former President Joe Biden’s alternatives-to-detention policy. He has no lawful immigration status, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Singh was arrested at the scene for driving under the influence and vehicular manslaughter and booked into West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga.","Jashanpreet Singh, 21, allegedly caused a crash on the I-10 Freeway while under the influence of drugs.

Donald Trump’s son hits back at Chelsea Clinton over White House demolition: ‘Your parents stole furniture’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trumps-son-hits-back-at-chelsea-clinton-over-white-house-demolition-your-parents-stole-furniture/articleshow/124794717.cms,"Chelsea Clinton condemns Trump’s ‘erasure of history’

Trump Jr. revives old Clinton controversy



White House demolition sparks wider outrage



Political families, old rivalries





A fresh political feud has erupted between two of America’s most prominent political dynasties after Donald Trump Jr. fired back at Chelsea Clinton over her criticism of President Trump’s controversial East Wing demolition. Responding to Clinton’s USA Today op-ed, which accused Trump of “erasing American heritage” by tearing down the historic wing to build a private ballroom, Trump Jr. took to social media with a sharp retort: “Lol, your parents tried stealing furniture and silverware from the White House… and let’s not talk about the intern. Sit this one out.” His post quickly went viral, reigniting decades-old tensions between the Clinton and Trump families.In her op-ed published earlier this week, Chelsea Clinton criticised what she called President Trump’s “pattern of destruction” — both literal and institutional. She argued that the East Wing demolition represents “yet another attack on America’s collective heritage, democracy, and the rule of law,” comparing it to Trump’s previous decisions to pave over parts of the Rose Garden, remove historic artworks, and “personalise the people’s house.Clinton wrote, “The erasure of the East Wing isn’t just about marble or plaster — it’s about President Trump again taking a wrecking ball to our heritage.” She warned that the project, which has already begun under tight security, reflects “a dangerous mindset that places ego above history.”The East Wing, traditionally home to the First Lady’s offices and hosting spaces, was demolished last month as part of what Trump described as a “necessary modernisation.” The President has announced plans to replace it with a multi-purpose ballroom and events hall, a decision that has drawn criticism from historians and preservationists.Donald Trump Jr.’s response, however, took the debate in a very different direction. His remark referenced a 2001 controversy in which former President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton were accused of removing White House furniture and gifts worth over $28,000 when they left office.After media scrutiny and public backlash, the Clintons returned many of the items, later claiming that the removals were based on a misunderstanding of which pieces were personal gifts versus federal property. The General Services Administration (GSA) confirmed that several items were indeed government-owned and had to be returned.Trump Jr.’s jab, combining the “stolen furniture” reference with an allusion to the Monica Lewinsky scandal, served as a pointed reminder of the Clintons’ most damaging historical controversies. Within hours, his post had been shared widely on X (formerly Twitter), sparking fierce debate among supporters and critics alike.President Trump’s ongoing renovation of the White House complex has drawn mixed reactions from the public and preservation experts. The East Wing demolition follows earlier changes during his second term, including the removal of historic rose bushes planted during the Kennedy era, the installation of gold-trimmed interiors, and the relocation of several archival artefacts to private Trump properties.Critics argue that these moves reflect an attempt to reshape the White House into a personal legacy project. “This is no longer restoration — it’s reinvention,” said Dr. Margaret O’Leary, a Washington architectural historian. “The East Wing symbolised the softer, civic side of the presidency, often associated with the First Ladies. Its demolition carries deep cultural meaning.”The National Trust for Historic Preservation has expressed concern that many features of the White House, added after the Truman reconstruction of the 1950s, are being lost without adequate public consultation.The exchange between Trump Jr. and Chelsea Clinton revives a long-running political rivalry between two dynasties that have dominated American political discourse for decades. The Clintons’ prominence began in the 1990s, while the Trumps rose to political power in 2016 — both families defining opposing poles of US politics.Chelsea Clinton, who has largely avoided direct political office, has become a frequent critic of Trump policies, particularly on issues of democracy and historical preservation. Trump Jr., meanwhile, has emerged as one of his father’s most combative defenders, often taking to social media to spar with critics and frame attacks as partisan hypocrisy.Political observers say the latest clash reflects a broader partisan battle over American identity and legacy, intensified by Trump’s third-term ambitions and his ongoing cultural remodelling of national institutions.","Chelsea Clinton wrote an op-ed in USA Today condemning the demolition of the East Wing of the White House.

When asked by ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Mary Bruce if he had decided on a name, Trump smiled and said: ""I won't get into that now."" The president has previously branded his construction projects with his own name, and this appears to be no different.The 90,000-square-foot ballroom is being built after the entire East Wing of the White House was demolished. A White House official confirmed that $350 million has been raised for the project, with construction currently costing $300 million. The official said Trump ""has received such positive and overwhelming support for the ballroom that he continues to receive donations"" but did not explain what would happen with the additional $50 million raised.When asked how much of his own money he would contribute, Trump replied: ""Oh, millions of dollars. Yeah. Well, I also give, you know, I give a lot of money to the White House. The White House is, as you know, I give my salary, and I usually like to steer it to the White House because this house was a little bit abandoned.""The new ballroom is part of Trump’s vision to leave a personal mark on the White House. It will be one of the largest additions to the East Wing in modern history when it's completed in 2026.Fundraising for the ballroom has exceeded expectations, with supporters contributing more than the projected construction cost.

Indian immigrants most economically beneficial







Daniel Di Martino, a researcher of the Manhattan Institute, pushed back the anti-Indian rhetoric of social media triggered by Diwali celebrations and the recent California crash caused by an Indian driver, and claimed that Indians are the best major counrty of origin group of immigrants. ""The average Indian immigrant and his or her descendants will save the federal government $1.7 million over 30 years,"" the researcher said.The research comes as the Donald Trump administration is trying to preserve jobs for Americans and exploring ways to prevent them from being filled by H-1B visa holders brought from countries like India and China for high-skill jobs, only to be assigned entry-level positions at a lower pay. The administration has imposed a $100,000 fee for sponsors who will bring H-1Bs, hoping that this exorbitant amount would arrest the inflow of foreigners in the US job market.The researcher claimed that Indian immigrants are the most economically beneficial immigrant group in the U.S., with an average Indian immigrant reducing the national debt by over $1.6 million over 30 years and increasing GDP more than immigrants from any other country.Behind Indian immigrants are the Chinese, who reduce the debt by over $800,000 over 30 years. Next, Filipinos reduce the debt by over $600,000. Colombians and Venezuelans reduce the debt by $500,000 and $400,000, respectively.The research paper also suggested granting more green cards to Indians, limiting visa issuances to people from other countries for at least 10 years so that the backlog of Indian immigrants clears up first. It said Indian immigrants now wait for decades to get a green card while in other countries, the waiting period is a maximum of two years. The research paper said ending per-country caps would expand the national debt by over $1.1 trillion over 30 years and result in an economy 0.7% smaller with a debt-to-GDP ratio 2.4% larger.","An average Indian immigrant reduces the national debt by over $1.6 million over 30 years and increasing GDP more than immigrants from any other country.

A tragic night and a painful awakening

The science behind sleep and screens

A mother’s call for digital boundaries





Turning personal tragedy into a nationwide warning, a Virginia mother is urging parents to rethink the role of smartphones in their children’s lives, especially at night. Summer Bushman, from Salem, Virginia, lost her 10-year-old daughter Autumn to suicide earlier this year after months of bullying, both in person and online. In an interview with CBS News, she revealed that Autumn often used her phone in bed at night, a habit she now believes played a devastating role in her death. “She was looking at her phone just before it happened,” Summer said. “I wish I had never let her keep it in her room.”Autumn was, by all accounts, a bright and joyful child, a fourth-grade cheerleader who filled her home with music and dance. “She turned my living room into a stage,” her mother recalled. But behind her bubbly exterior, Autumn was struggling with relentless teasing about her braces and appearance.Like many children today, she sought connection through her phone, the same device that became a portal for cyberbullying. Late-night messages and social media comments compounded the hurt. What once might have ended at the school gates now followed her home, glowing quietly from her pillow.Psychologists call this the “24-hour schoolyard”, the digital extension of peer pressure and cruelty that leaves children little space to recover.On March 21, Autumn took her own life in her bedroom. When her mother found her, the phone’s screen was still on. “She used to say she needed her alarm,” Summer said softly. “And every morning when I went to wake her, the alarm was ringing.”The tragedy reflects a troubling pattern seen across the world. In the United States alone, youth suicide rates have risen by over 50% in the past decade, with growing evidence linking social media use, especially at night, to depression and self-harm. A 2019 Lancet Psychiatry study found that adolescents spending more than three hours a day on social media were twice as likely to report mental health issues.Late-night phone use does more than expose children to online harm; it directly affects their mental and physical health. Screens emit blue light, which suppresses the hormone melatonin, disrupting natural sleep cycles. Sleep deprivation, in turn, intensifies anxiety, impulsivity, and depression, all factors linked to suicide risk.A recent Virginia Tech study reinforced this connection. Researchers found that nearly 75% of adolescents who attempted suicide were using screens shortly before and that most incidents occurred after 8 p.m. “It’s pretty dangerous for bullied children to have their phones at night,” lead researcher Dr. Abhishek Reddy noted. “During the day, they have access to support, counsellors, teachers, parents. At night, that access disappears. ”For Summer, her daughter’s loss has become a mission. She now advocates for parents to remove phones from bedrooms, restrict nighttime use, and encourage healthier sleep routines. “If I could go back, I’d take that phone away,” she said. “She deserved to live a long, happy life. Now, I’ll never see her go to prom, get married, or chase her dreams.”Her message echoes growing calls among educators and child psychologists to delay smartphone access for young children altogether. Some schools in the US and Europe are now implementing “phone-free hours” or collecting devices during class to curb dependency.","Summer Bushman lost her 10-year-old daughter Autumn to suicide earlier this year.

U.S.-Venezuela ‘War’: On Trump’s Orders, Pentagon Deploys ‘World’s Largest’ Warship To Caribbean

Drug raids or regime pressure?





Trump’s Drug War: Echoes of war on terror









Amid growing concerns that Washington’s anti-drug campaign could evolve into a new ""war on terror"" — or a prelude to toppling Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro — the US military on Friday deployed the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford to waters off South America. The Pentagon said the move aims to expand operations against drug traffickers and ""illicit actors,"" even as the buildup in the Caribbean and near Venezuela deepens speculation about the Trump administration’s broader intentions in the region.US defense secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Gerald R Ford and its strike group to move under the US Southern Command to ""bolster US capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States,"" Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a social media post.The USS Ford, currently stationed in the Mediterranean Sea with three destroyers, will take several days to reach South America, news agency Associated Press reported.The announcement followed Hegseth’s statement earlier on Friday that the US military carried out its tenth strike on a vessel suspected of drug trafficking , killing six people in the Caribbean Sea. Hegseth said the vessel was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang.In a post on social media, he said the strike occurred overnight and marked the second time the Trump administration linked its operations to the gang, which originated in a Venezuelan prison.The strikes, which began in September, have increased from one every few weeks to three this week, killing at least 43 people so far. Two recent strikes were conducted in the eastern Pacific Ocean, expanding the area of operations to major drug-smuggling routes.A 20-second black-and-white video posted online showed a small boat stationary on the water before being hit by a projectile, resulting in an explosion. The footage ended before the aftermath was visible.Hegseth said the strike took place in international waters and was the first conducted at night.""If you are a narco-terrorist smuggling drugs in our hemisphere, we will treat you like we treat Al-Qaeda,” Hegseth said. ""Day or NIGHT, we will map your networks, track your people, hunt you down, and kill you.”The latest strike resembled the first one announced last month, which also targeted the Tren de Aragua gang. The Trump administration has labeled the group a foreign terrorist organization, blaming it for violence and drug trafficking in several cities.While the origin of the latest boat was not confirmed, officials said that at least four of the targeted vessels came from Venezuela.The strikes, along with a significant US military buildup in the Caribbean and near Venezuela, have led to speculation that Washington could be preparing to act against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who faces narcoterrorism charges in the USOn Thursday, the US military flew two supersonic bombers near Venezuela’s coast.The Trump administration says its operations are aimed at stopping drug trafficking into the US, but Maduro claims they are part of an effort to remove him from power.Maduro praised Venezuelan forces and civilian militias for conducting defense drills along the country’s 2,000-kilometer coastline.""In the span of six hours, 100% of all the country’s coastline was covered in real time, with all the equipment and heavy weapons to defend all of Venezuela’s coasts if necessary,” Maduro said on state television.Elizabeth Dickinson, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, said the US actions appeared to be more about political influence than drugs.""An expression that I’m hearing a lot is ‘Drugs are the excuse.’ And everyone knows that,” Dickinson said, as quoted by news agency AP. ""The messaging here is that the US is intent on pursuing specific objectives. And it will use military force against leaders and countries that don’t fall in line.”Hegseth has compared the strikes on drug traffickers to the US war on terror after the September 11, 2001 attacks.President Donald Trump recently declared drug cartels to be unlawful combatants and said the US was in an ""armed conflict” with them, invoking the same legal authority used after 9/11.Asked by reporters on Thursday if he would seek a congressional declaration of war against the cartels, Trump said, ""I think we’re just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK? We’re going to kill them, you know? They’re going to be like, dead.”Lawmakers from both parties have raised concerns about Trump ordering military strikes without congressional approval or detailed explanations.

'Thug' Indian Truck Driver Crash In Florida Sparks US Visa Freeze, Triggers Illegal Immigration Row

Harjinder Singh, 'no name', then Jaspreet Singh: Indian truck drivers earning a bad name in US





Why Punjabi drivers falter at US driving test









New information surfaced about 28-year-old Harjinder Singh , an Indian-origin truck driver, who caused a crash in Florida, killing three people, because he took a wrong U-turn earlier this year. Many details emerged about the illegal migrant from India and how he got his commercial driving license despite struggling to speak english, but now it has been revealed that he failed his commercial driver's license test 10 times over two months before finally receiving a license in 2023 in Washington state. Investigators with the Florida AG’s office learned Singh failed his CDL knowledge exam in Washington state 10 times between March 10, 2023, and May 5, 2023. They also learned he failed his air brakes knowledge exam twice.The company that trained Singh for his CDL claimed that he could speak English though on several occasions later it has been found out that he struggled with English.Harjinder Singh pleaded not guilty during his first hearing.Several incidents of Indian-origin truck drivers grappling with US traffic rules and causing accidents have now come to the fore.The leniency of the authorities concerned in issuing the license has also drawn scrutiny.For example, New York state issued a CDL to an Indian named Anmol, whose license had ' No Name Given ' written on it. ICE officers came across Anmol during a routine inspection and he was arrestd as ICE determined that he was staying in the US illegally.The most recent case is that of 21-year-old Jashanpreet Singh , who caused a multi-vehicle crash on a California freeway when he was driving under the influence.The CDL written exam is in English, and language barrier is one of the main reasons for Indian-origin drivers failing at driving test. Technical vocabulary like “air brake leakage rate”, “coupling system,” “pre-trip inspection terms” can be confusing if English isn’t strong. The pre-trip portion requires drivers to verbally describe every truck part and safety function — often in English — and this section alone fails many applicants.",Harjinder Singh failed CDL knowledge test 10 times in 2 months in Washington state before getting a license.

Sikh truck drivers and California on the radar









At a time when Indian-origin truck drivers are dominating headlines in the US for horrific accidents, a major cargo theft ring has been busted in California, with 12 men charged, including 11 'Singhs'. Referred to as 'Singh Organization' by the cops, the group acquired or fraudulently used real trucking companies to bid on shipping contracts. When they won these bids, they used to take possession of the cargo that was to be shipped, but instead of delivering it to the right destination, they diverted it and stole it.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

'Drugged' Sikh Truck Driver Behind Fiery Crash in California Reignites Illegal Immigration Debate





More than 100,000 immigrant truckers from India are in the hot seat in America after a sweeping US federal audit conducted amid twin fatal crash investigations involving Sikh drivers showed widespread malpractice in issuance of commercial driving licenses (CDLs)The US Department of Transportation (DOT), through its Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), recently announced findings from a nationwide audit revealing that several states issued CDLs to non-qualified applicants, including undocumented immigrants, in contravention of federal standards on legal status and English proficiency.Among the worst-flagged states: California. The audit found that as many as 25 % or more of “non-domiciled” CDLs issued in California were improperly granted—‌including licenses valid months after a driver’s authorized stay in the US had expired.Although the audit’s publicly disclosed numbers do not precisely tally all immigrant truckers of Indian origin, two high-profile fatal crashes in California and Florida involving truck drivers later identified as undocumented immigrants from India have become flashpoints in the regulatory crackdown.In Florida, the Harjinder Singh case has drawn particular attention. Singh, described by Florida authorities as an “illegal alien truck driver” charged with killing three people in a crash in August, is now under investigation by the Florida Attorney General’s Office.Investigators say that in just two months between March 10 2023 and May 5 2023, Singh failed his CDL test ten times in the state of Washington. Additionally, he twice failed an air-brakes knowledge test, and the Washington company that provided his behind-the-wheel training attested he could speak English proficiently — a claim Florida prosecutors say is false.The case has pitted Republican- governed Florida against Democrat-run California and Washington state. Florida AG’s office has sued the two states in the Supreme Court asking the Court to stop them from issuing CDLs to illegal immigrants and accusing them of failing to comply with federal safety and immigration-status requirements when issuing CDLs.The Trump administration has also lashed out at California and Washington, backed by pressure from vociferous MAGA activists, invoking familiar tirades about immigrants taking away American jobs even though industry reports point to a shortage of truck drivers in America.“Licenses to operate a massive, 80,000-pound truck are being issued to dangerous foreign drivers – often times illegally. This is a direct threat to the safety of every family on the road…” US transportation secretary Sean Duffy said, calling the issue of non-domiciled CDLs a “national emergency.” Canada too has joined in tightening issuance of CDLs to immigrants.For many immigrant truckers from India, the developments feel alarming. On one hand, thousands of Indian-origin drivers—many working legitimately, often in vulnerable employment situations—now face potential license revocations or employment loss. On the other hand, a wave of heightened scrutiny threatens to stoke xenophobic attitudes in the trucking industry and beyond. Local TV stations in Florida have also conducted sting operations purportedly showing immigrant trucker applicants fudging English proficiency tests with devices through which they are fed answers from outside.Advocates warn that the narrative — “undocumented immigrant trucker causes fatal crash” — can easily fuel discrimination against Indian truckers generally, regardless of their legal status or safety record. Immigrant truckers of Indian-origin say they are already facing suspicion at truck stops, more frequent stops by law enforcement, and a sense of being “guilty by association.”In a rather forlorn social media post, the more educated Sikh driving cohort sought to counter the stereotypes. “Yes, we speak English. Yes, we understand the laws, the roads, the rules. We came here the right way — legally.We respect this land, its people, and its values. But sometimes, when we stop at a rest area or fuel station, we feel the looks — the doubt, the distance. We’re judged not by our hearts or our work, but by the mistakes of a few. That hurts… because we’re part of the same road, the same dream,” the post read.","More than 100,000 immigrant truckers from India are in the hot seat in America after a sweeping US federal audit conducted amid twin fatal crash investigations involving Sikh drivers.

Investment linked green card: USCIS proposes lower EB-5 fees amid investor litigation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/investment-linked-green-card-uscis-proposes-lower-eb-5-fees-amid-investor-litigation/articleshow/124780595.cms,"file photo

Court notice cites overcharging







In a rare move, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has proposed reducing several key EB-5 (investment linked green card ) visa filing fees, this is a significant shift, given that immigration-related charges have largely risen in recent years due to inflation, staffing costs and processing backlogs.The proposal spells good news for future investors, particularly because it follows months of ongoing litigation contending that the steep fee hikes introduced on April 1, 2024, were unlawful.Under the proposed rule, which will take several months to finalise, the fee for filing Form I-526E (initial EB-5 application), which in April 2024 was hiked by 204% to $11,160, will be reduced to $9,625. Similarly, the fee for Form I-829 (to remove conditions on permanent residency) is proposed to drop from $9,535 to $7,860.The EB-5 program allows foreign nationals to obtain a US green card by investing in job-creating projects. To qualify, investors typically invest $800,000 to $1,050,000, depending on the project's type and/or location, and must create or preserve at least 10 full-time American jobs.Most investors route their funds through regional centres (USCIS-designated entities) that pool EB-5 capital into large-scale projects.Over 90% of EB-5 investments in recent years have been made through these centres rather than via direct investments.Despite the high investment threshold, the EB-5 route has attracted growing interest from H-1B workers and high-net-worth individuals in India, as it offers a comparatively shorter wait time for a green card than the decades-long employment-based queue.Once the EB-5 application is approved and the investor completes a consular interview or adjustment of status, they receive a two-year conditional green card. A second application is later filed to remove these conditions and obtain permanent residency — fees at all stages were significantly increased last year.Ishaan Khanna, president of the American Immigrant Investor Alliance and one of the plaintiffs in the earlier lawsuit, described the proposed reductions as a “commendable and long-overdue effort” to realign fees with actual processing costs.“For EB-5 investors the 15–20% lower fees are positive, but we continue to be concerned with processing delays. Even with higher fees in place until the final rule is published, the agency isn’t coming close to meeting the processing time goals Congress established in the Reform and Integrity Act (RIA),” Khanna said.Immigration attorney Matthew Galati, who represents EB-5 investors in ongoing litigation, welcomed the fee reduction but said it indirectly validates their case.“It is a pleasant surprise that USCIS is proposing lower filing fees now that the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act’s fee study is finally completed. We filed a lawsuit (still pending) stating that the 2024 fee rule was unlawful,” Galati said.With the lower-fee proposal, USCIS is effectively conceding that EB-5 applicants were overcharged for approximately 18 months, he explained. “Future applicants should be very happy with this news. But those who filed from April 2024 through today, and those still awaiting adjudications beyond the RIA’s deadlines despite a surplus of resources, will likely be quite angry,” said Galati.Following the announcement of the proposed fee cuts, attorneys for the investors filed a notice in the Colorado district court on Oct 23, arguing that the government’s move confirms their claim that EB-5 applicants have been overcharged since April 2024 in violation of federal law.The plaintiffs — led by Samantha Moody and represented by attorneys Galati, Jonathan Wasden and Jesse Bless contend that the current fee levels are “arbitrary, capricious and unlawful,” as the RIA requires fees to reflect only actual processing costs and adhere to 90–240 day timelines. Since the government plans to continue charging the existing rates until the new rule is finalised, the plaintiffs have urged the court to grant summary judgment and strike down the April 2024 fee rule.The EB-5 program is currently authorised by law, via the EB‑5 (RIA, which re-authorised the program (including the Regional Center component) through September 30, 2027. At present, it is unclear, if post this date, the Gold Card, introduced by the Trump administration will replace the EB-5 program.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has proposed reducing several key EB-5 visa filing fees.

'Not bulletproof': FATF warns Pakistan against terror funding; greylist exit does not shield from scrutiny,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/not-bulletproof-fatf-warns-pakistan-against-terror-funding-greylist-exit-does-not-shield-from-scrutiny/articleshow/124798444.cms,"Terror funding for attacks in India







The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Saturday cautioned Pakistan that its removal from the greylist in October 2022 does not make it immune to scrutiny over money laundering or terrorist financing.FATF President Elisa de Anda Madrazo in a press briefing said, “Any country that is on the greylist or has exited it is not bulletproof against criminal actions, whether by money launderers or terrorists. We invite all jurisdictions, including those who have been delisted, to continue their good work to prevent and deter crimes.”Madrazo emphasised that all countries, including those recently delisted, must continue tightening safeguards against illicit financial activities. Her remarks come amid reports that Pakistan-based terror groups, including Jaish-e-Mohammad, have been using digital wallets and crypto channels to fund terror operations while masking financial flows.While Pakistan met key compliance benchmarks to exit the FATF greylist, it remains under follow-up by the Asia Pacific Group (APG), as the country is not a FATF member. The follow-up ensures Islamabad continues aligning with FATF’s global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terror financing (CTF) standards.The greylist, formally known as the list of jurisdictions under increased monitoring, identifies countries with “strategic deficiencies” in curbing financial crimes and terror funding. India’s National Risk Assessment 2022 has highlighted Pakistan as a high-risk source of terror financing, citing persistent threats despite formal FATF compliance. A recent FATF report also noted rising instances of state-sponsored terrorism and flagged Pakistan’s National Development Complex as a proliferation risk in South Asia.In July this year, the global terror funding watchdog reported that explosives used in terrorist attacks in India were procured through e-commerce platforms. The revelation came in connection with attacks in Pulwama and at the Gorakhnath temple in Uttar Pradesh.Digital platforms, including social media, messaging apps, and crowdfunding sites, are increasingly being exploited for terror financing. Reported forms of support range from direct financial contributions to logistical or material assistance, as well as the provision of training.The Pulwama attack in 2019, planned and carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammed, saw transfer of large quantities of explosives in the country. A massive amount of the components used in the explosive devices used in the attack was acquired via electronic commerce platforms.The agency also said that the Pahalgam terror attack also could not have taken place without financial backing and without any route to transfer funds between terrorists and supporters.The FATF wrapped up its fourth plenary session in Paris under Madrazo’s presidency, attended by delegates from over 200 jurisdictions. The session approved the first mutual assessments under FATF’s new risk-based framework and removed Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Nigeria, and South Africa from the greylist after completion of their action plans.Reaffirming FATF’s global mission, Madrazo said, “FATF remains committed to strengthening standards and ensuring implementation so we can protect people by reducing terrorist financing worldwide.”","Pakistan's removal from the greylist in October 2022 does not make it immune to scrutiny over money laundering or terrorist financing.

'World Has Not Forgotten': India Blasts Pakistan’s Double Game on Terror at UN, Reminds Of Pahalgam

Why tomato prices are spiking





Impact of past trade trends





Why the border is closed





What this means for Pakistanis









Pakistan is witnessing a sharp surge in the prices of essential goods, particularly tomatoes, which have risen over 400 percent to around 600 Pakistani rupees ($2.13) per kilogram, following the closure of border crossings with Afghanistan.The move comes after clashes erupted between the two neighbours earlier this month, marking the worst fighting along their shared frontier since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.The closure of all trade and transit routes since October 11 has created severe shortages of fresh produce, grains, dairy, and other essentials. Khan Jan Alokozay, head of the Pak-Afghan Chamber of Commerce in Kabul, told Reuters, “With each passing day, both sides are losing around $1 million.”Tomatoes, a staple in Pakistani kitchens, have been particularly affected. About 500 containers of vegetables meant for export are spoiling daily due to the blockade, Alokozay said. In total, around 5,000 containers are stranded on both sides of the border, according to a Pakistani official at the Torkham crossing in northwest Pakistan. The official added that apples and grapes, largely imported from Afghanistan, are also in short supply.The disruption comes at a critical time when fresh produce from Afghanistan and northern Pakistan would normally enter local markets. The blockade has severed a trade route that contributes significantly to the $2.3 billion annual trade volume between the two countries, which includes fruit, vegetables, minerals, medicine, wheat, rice, sugar, meat, and dairy products.The price surge in tomatoes is also partly linked to longstanding cross-border trade dynamics. According to a PTI report, in 2011, Indian traders capitalised on higher tomato prices in Pakistan, sending trucks laden with produce across the Attari-Wagah border. Truckloads of tomatoes from Delhi and Nashik entered Pakistan daily, pushing up domestic prices in Indian markets. Experts noted that floods in Sindh and other Pakistani producing regions often exacerbate local shortages, further driving up prices.Currently, Pakistani consumers are facing a similar pattern, as reduced local supply coincides with the absence of imports due to the border closure. According to R P Gupta, director of the National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation, key producing regions such as Nashik, Pune, and Ahmadnagar in India usually cater to northern markets during this period. The absence of cross-border supplies intensifies the domestic price pressure in Pakistan.The recent clashes along the 2,600-kilometre frontier were triggered after Islamabad demanded that Kabul control militants who attack Pakistan from Afghan territory. The Taliban has denied harbouring such groups. Although a ceasefire brokered in talks hosted by Qatar and Turkey last weekend has largely held, the border remains closed. The next round of negotiations is scheduled for October 25 in Istanbul.Consumers in Pakistan are now paying significantly higher prices for basic staples. The scarcity of tomatoes, apples, and grapes is compounded by perishable stock spoilage, and there is growing concern over rising costs for other essentials. The commerce ministry has not issued a comment on the matter, leaving traders and residents to cope with soaring prices and limited availability.As the border closure continues, analysts warn that the inflationary impact on essential food items may persist, straining household budgets and local markets across Pakistan.","Pakistan is witnessing a sharp surge in the prices of essential goods, particularly tomatoes, which have risen over 400 percent to around 600 Pakistani rupees ($2.13) per kilogram.

Massive Violence Erupts In Pakistan After TLP’s Pro-Palestine March Turns Ugly





Pakistan’s cabinet on Thursday approved a proposal to ban the extremist Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party under the country's Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) after it recently staged violent protests in the country.The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, which discussed the Punjab government’s request to outlaw the religious group under the ATA of 1997, news agency PTI reported.The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said in a statement that the cabinet ""unanimously"" approved the ban. As per the PTI report, Pakistan's interior ministry presented a summary of the Punjab government’s request and briefed the meeting on the ""violent and terrorist activities of TLP in the country.""""The meeting was informed that this organisation, established in 2016, has incited violence across the country. Due to the organisation, incidents of violence have occurred in different parts of the country,"" the statement added.The PMO noted that the TLP was banned in 2021, but the ban was lifted after six months on the condition that the party would not carry out unrest or violent activities. The current ban was also justified by the group reneging on the guarantees given in 2021.""In the past, security personnel and innocent bystanders have been killed in violent protests and rallies by the TLP. The federal cabinet, after a briefing given to the meeting and the recommendation of the Punjab government, unanimously concluded that the TLP is involved in terrorism and violent acts,"" the statement said, as cited by PTI.After the ban, the TLP will be added to the list of proscribed groups maintained by the Pakistan's National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA), which already includes militant groups such as Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), Lashkar-e-Toiba, and extremist organisations like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Jaish-e-Mohammed.Before the listing, the federal government must refer the matter to the Pakistan Supreme Court within 15 days for approval. Once confirmed by the court, which has the final authority to ban a political party, the TLP will be officially added to the list of proscribed organisations.Earlier, the Pakistan's Punjab government had decided to ban the TLP in a meeting chaired by chief minister Maryam Nawaz on October 16, five days after the party began a protest march in Lahore. The TLP had launched a ""Gaza solidarity"" march on October 11, aiming to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy. The march was halted at Muridke, around 60 km from Lahore, and dispersed on October 13.Clashes between police and TLP supporters at Muridke left around 16 people, including policemen, dead and over 1,600 injured. The TLP has a history of violent protests since 2017, when it staged a major protest and laid siege to Islamabad.Pakistan’s anti-cybercrime agency also arrested over 100 social media activists of the TLP for inflammatory posts. ""We have arrested 107 social media activists (of TLP) for inflammatory posts besides blocking 75 such accounts,"" Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said at a press conference.Punjab police said they have arrested over 6,000 TLP activists following last week’s clashes. The government has sealed 61 seminaries run by the party and handed control of TLP mosques and seminaries to the Auqaf Department.","Pakistan's cabinet approved a proposal to ban the extremist Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party under the country's Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

Jaish-e-Mohammed Launches Online Jihad Course For Women In Pakistan, Targets Mass Recruitment





Days after Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) announced the formation of its first-ever women’s wing, Jamaat-ul-Mominaat, the group has now launched an online training course to expand recruitment and collect funds from women, according to media reports.The digital course, namely ‘Tufat al-Muminat’ aims to attract as many women as possible to the outfit’s network. The initiative is being led by Sadiya Azhar, sister of JeM chief Masood Azhar Her husband, Yusuf Azhar, was killed in Operation Sindoor on May 7, when armed forces targeted JeM’s headquarters at Markaz Subhanallah in Bahawalpur.Sources said that Masood Azhar’s sisters, Sadiya and Samaira Azhar, will conduct 40-minute online classes daily, beginning November 8, using meeting platforms to teach women about their “duties” from the perspectives of jihad, religion and Islam.Each participant enrolling in the course is reportedly being asked to pay a donation of PKR 500 and fill out an online form.Intelligence sources indicate that the program is part of JeM’s broader effort to rebuild its base and financing network following significant losses in airstrikes during Operation Sindoor earlier this year.The announcement comes weeks after JeM publicly introduced its women’s brigade on October 8, followed by an event titled ‘Dukhtaran-e-Islam’ held in Rawalakot, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, on October 19 to mobilise women supporters.Security officials say JeM’s decision to involve women marks a major shift in its operational strategy.The organisation, along with others such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen, had previously avoided using women in active combat roles.Sources suggest that this move is viewed as a potential signal that JeM could begin training female suicide attackers, similar to tactics employed by groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, Hamas and LTTE.The development also underscores Pakistan’s continued tolerance of terror infrastructure on its soil. Despite Islamabad’s claims at global platforms of being a victim of terrorism and its assertions of compliance with FATF regulations, JeM and other banned groups reportedly continue to operate and collect donations openly through their network of markaz (centres).In September, Masood Azhar was also reported to have made a public appeal for funds during an address at Markaz Usman O Ali in Bahawalpur.Meanwhile, intelligence inputs suggest that JeM, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen have shifted their bases to Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to avoid Indian airstrikes after Operation Sindoor.According to media reports, JeM has additionally launched an online fundraising campaign via EasyPaisa, seeking to raise Rs 3.91 billion for constructing 313 new centres across Pakistan.'","Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) has launched an online training course to expand recruitment and collect funds from women.

China successfully launched a Pakistani remote sensing satellite into orbit on Sunday, accompanied by two of its own satellites, underscoring the deepening space collaboration between the two long-time allies.A Lijian-1 Y8 carrier rocket carrying three satellites—the Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite (PRSS-2) and China’s AIRSAT 03 and 04—was launched from a commercial aerospace innovation pilot zone in northwest China. The launch successfully placed all three satellites into their planned orbits, according to state-run Xinhua news agency.A remote sensing satellite is equipped with specialised sensors and cameras that observe and measure the physical characteristics of the Earth or other areas from space.It collects data on things like forest fires, temperature changes in oceans, cloud patterns, volcanic activity, urban growth, farmland changes, and the topography of the ocean floor. This helps scientists and researchers monitor large-scale environmental and geographic changes over time, according to USGS.This mission marks the third Pakistani satellite China has helped launch this year, following PRSS-1 in July and PRSC-EO1 in January.In recent years, China has played a key role in expanding Pakistan’s space capabilities, including the launch of a multi-mission communication satellite last year.Back in 2018, China also deployed two Pakistani satellites: PRSS-1, Pakistan’s first optical remote sensing satellite, and PakTES-1A, a smaller observation satellite.","China successfully launched a Pakistani remote sensing satellite into orbit on Sunday.

Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire after several days of deadly cross-border clashes, Qatar’s foreign ministry said on Sunday. The announcement came after at least 10 people were killed in Pakistani airstrikes that followed an earlier truce.“During the negotiations, the two sides agreed to an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of mechanisms to ensure lasting peace and stability between the two countries,” Qatar’s ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement.Officials from both sides met in Doha on Saturday to ease tensions.

Pakistan's field marshal Asim Munir has yet again engaged in anti-India rhetoric issuing veiled nuclear and economic threats while claiming that the ""misconceived"" immunity of India's geographic vastness will be shattered by the reach and lethality of their weapon systems.Speaking at the Pakistan military academy in Abbotabad (where Osama Bin Laden lived and was killed by the US) on Saturday, the rabble-rouser army chief threatened that a response far beyond the expectations of the initiators (India/Afghanistan) can be expected, if a fresh wave of hostilities is triggered.""With diminishing distinction between combat and communication zones, the reach and lethality of our weapon systems will shatter the misconceived immunity of India's geographic vastness,"" he added.He cautioned and advised the India's military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment.

What's happening?

Operation Sindoor and the Muridke connection





A state at war with itself





An imploding picture









“You can’t keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbours.”External affairs minister S Jaishankar issued a stern warning to Pakistan at the United Nations in 2022. Three years later, Pakistan is yet to mend its ways, and the warning rings truer than ever. Then, both leaders accused Pakistan of nurturing terror groups for strategic leverage. Now, the country is confronting the full consequences of that strategy.Pakistan is in turmoil at all fronts, and at the centre of the latest crisis lies Muridke - the same city India struck during Operation Sindoor , a swift 22-minute campaign that targeted terror hubs including Markaz Taiba, the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba.This week, Muridke is again in the spotlight as it turned volatile after Pakistan’s law enforcement cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP). The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.In a move dripping with irony, the provincial chief minister chaired what her office called an ""extraordinary"" meeting, ordering arrests of ""extremist leaders"" and seizure of assets linked to the same group once courted by the establishment.Over 2,700 people have been detained, and Section 144 has been imposed across Punjab, banning gatherings and protests.Mosques associated with the TLP have been sealed, its social media accounts suspended, and its top brass is being added to Pakistan’s Fourth Schedule—a list of individuals suspected of terrorism or sectarianism.Officials have also announced plans to recommend a federal ban on the party, freeze its assets, and prosecute its leaders under anti-terror laws. AI tools are being deployed to track wanted individuals.Authorities say the TLP’s so-called ""Gaza solidarity"" march to Islamabad had turned, as one official put it, ""bloody as always.""The timing and geography of the crackdown are significant. Muridke was among the nine key sites targeted during Operation Sindoor in May following the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.During the four-day campaign, the Indian Air Force destroyed at least six Pakistani fighter jets, two high-value surveillance aircraft, a C-130 transport plane, over ten drones, several cruise missiles, and radar installations.One of its central objectives was Markaz Taiba, Lashkar-e-Taiba’s nerve centre in Muridke — just 25 km from the International Border. The facility, built with donations reportedly including Rs 10 lakh from Osama bin Laden, trained the 26/11 Mumbai attackers.For decades, Pakistan’s national security doctrine rested on militant proxies—to gain ""strategic depth"" against India and influence over Afghanistan. That policy has now imploded.Islamabad is fighting multiple insurgencies at once - from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) in Balochistan, and even rogue Taliban factions across the Durand Line.According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), more than 2,400 security personnel have been killed in 2025 so far—the bloodiest year since 2015. The violence is now driven by what analysts call a ""Quad of Terror"": the TTP, Baloch insurgents, Islamic State–Khorasan (IS-K), and Taliban breakaway groups.Since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul, Pakistan’s western frontier has unravelled. The TTP, long sheltered in Afghanistan, now launches near-daily attacks. The BLA targets Chinese projects in Gwadar and convoys in Balochistan. Despite repeated military operations, the insurgency only appears to be deepening.Drone strikes, air raids, and mass arrests have failed to stem the violence. Meanwhile, reports of enforced disappearances, civilian casualties, and militarisation have eroded public trust, especially in Balochistan.The TLP ban, border tensions with Afghanistan, and the fallout of Operation Sindoor together expose a grim truth that India has warned of several times: Pakistan’s long experiment with extremism has backfired catastrophically.When Hillary Clinton stood beside then-foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, in 2011 and delivered the ""snakes in your backyard"" warning, it was a diplomatic metaphor. Today, it's Pakistan's reality.What began as a policy of control has spiralled into a crisis of survival. Pakistan's greatest threat is no longer at its borders: it's the legacy of its own choices.","Pakistan cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.

Fierce Border Clash Between Pakistan, Afghanistan Intensifies With Tanks, Shelling, High Casualties

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif on Friday said that his country can no longer maintain its past relations with Afghanistan, alleging, without evidence, that the Taliban leadership is ""sitting in India’s lap"" and warning of a ""heavy price"" for cross-border terrorism, signalling a public hardening of Islamabad’s stance toward a regime it once helped install.His comments came after at least six people, including two children, were killed and seven others injured in airstrikes conducted by Pakistan in Afghanistan’s southeastern Paktika province. The strikes reportedly violated a recent ceasefire agreement between the two countries. Media reports said that representatives from both sides are expected to meet in Doha, Qatar, to address the situation.""Pakistan can no longer afford to maintain relations with Kabul as it did in the past,"" Asif said in a social media post.""All Afghans residing on Pakistani soil must return to their homeland; they now have their own government/caliphate in Kabul... Our land and resources belong to 250 million Pakistanis,"" he added.""Self-respecting nations do not thrive on foreign land and resources,"" Asif said.He stated that despite Pakistan’s efforts and sacrifices over the past five years, Kabul has not responded positively. ""Pakistan issued 836 protest notes to the Afghan side and another 13 demarches,"" he said.Asif warned that Pakistan will now respond more strongly to acts of terrorism. ""There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,"" he said.He also alleged that Afghanistan has become a ""proxy of India"" and is working with New Delhi and the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) against Islamabad.""The rulers of Kabul, who are now sitting in India’s lap and conspiring against Pakistan, were once under our protection, hiding on our land,"" Asif said, without providing any evidence for his claim.Earlier this week, MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, while addressing the weekly press briefing, said that Pakistan is habituated in blaming its neighbours for its internal problems. ""On the developments that are happening on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, we are closely monitoring the situation three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbors for its own internal failures. And three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories. India remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan,"" he had said.The Pakistan defense minister reiterated that Pakistan is prepared to defend itself against any aggression from Afghanistan.Earlier this week, Asif said that Pakistan is ready to respond if the Afghan Taliban ""wish for war.""

Kabul has denied these claims, saying that Afghan soil is not being used against any neighbouring country.Tensions between the two nations have grown following repeated attacks by the TTP, allegedly launched from Afghan soil.

In the weeks leading up to the Pahalgam attack, Munir had stirred controversy by invoking the two-nation theory—the ideological foundation of Pakistan’s creation—urging citizens to inculcate in their children a sense of distinction from Hindus. He had further escalated tensions by describing Kashmir as Pakistan’s “jugular vein,” a phrase long associated with Islamabad’s territorial ambitions.Just days after the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed 26 lives, Munir reiterated his stance, declaring, ""The two-nation theory was based on the fundamental belief that Muslims and Hindus are two separate nations, not one.

A 16-year-old Virginia high school student was hospitalized with life-threatening injuries after being stabbed at school by a 15-year-old fellow student.In a press conference held after the West Potomac High School incident in Alexandria, officials with the Fairfax County Police Department confirmed that the victim is now in stable condition, People reported.Because both students are minors, their identities were not made public.“Three students got into a physical fight inside the school and one 16-year-old victim was stabbed,” Fairfax County Police Maj. Elizabeth Melendez was quoted as saying. Melendez added that a school resource officer “was with the victim within seconds, and additional officers were on the scene within minutes.”The suspect was taken into custody, and no other individuals were believed to be involved in the stabbing at the time of the press conference.“He will be charged with malicious wounding,” Melendez said of the 15-year-old.Detectives remained at West Potomac High School to investigate after the victim was transported to a local hospital.Police Chief Kevin Davis stated that the knife had been recovered from the “very active criminal investigation.” He added that school staff “acted with a sense of relentless urgency” in the moments following the stabbing to protect the students.The two teens “are known to each other,” the chief confirmed.Classes remained in session after the 15-year-old was taken off campus and the situation was contained.The county schools superintendent, Michelle Reid, said at the news briefing that lunch was on a modified schedule as staff monitored the students. She added that grief counselors were also available to students and staff.“While there’s a sense, obviously a shock, that this would happen... I’m very proud of the response of our staff to this incident,” Reid said. “They responded quickly and admirably and may have saved a life today.”When asked by a reporter why the students had to continue with classes the same day of the stabbing, Reid explained, “At this time, because of the seriousness of the incident, we want to make sure students have access to counseling services, and are not going out in the community in perhaps unsupervised settings.”One parent who did not appear on-camera in the police department's livestream seemed audibly upset at Reid’s response and the school’s “lockdown” protocol, which prohibited them from picking up his daughter who was “freaking out in there.”Davis also confirmed that a video of the fight has been posted on social media.“We have the video, just like you have the video, but the video doesn’t tell the entire story,” the police chief told reporters.","A 16-year-old Virginia high school student was hospitalized with life- threatening injuries after being stabbed at school.

Navigating trade tightrope: US juggles tariff politics and global market trust,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/navigating-trade-tightrope-us-juggles-tariff-politics-and-global-market-trust/articleshow/120567078.cms,".

A growing split in US economic messaging is evident, as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent ’s call for international cooperation collided with president Trump ’s renewed threats of trade tariffs and a hardline message from the White House press room.Speaking at the Institute of International Finance, Bessent reassured investors that the US remained committed to its global leadership role, even while levelling sharp criticism at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for drifting from their core mandates. “America first does not mean America alone,” Bessent said. “It is a call for deeper collaboration and mutual respect among trade partners.”But any attempt at tempering international unease was quickly overshadowed by a firm statement from the White House. US press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox Newon Wednesday that “there will be no unilateral reduction in tariffs against China,” effectively closing the door on speculation sparked by president Trump himself.Trump had floated the idea that the administration's sweeping 145% tariffs on Chinese goods could “come down substantially,” raising hopes of a thaw in trade tensions. But Leavitt made clear that tariffs will remain in place unless Beijing agrees to a new deal. “The president has made it clear China needs to make a significant deal with the United States of America,” she said. “And we are optimistic that will happen.”Bessent, a former hedge fund manager, has been attempting to walk a delicate line between Trump’s protectionist instincts and the need for global financial stability. While not backing a full withdrawal from the IMF or World Bank—a policy floated in the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025—he criticised both institutions for “mission creep” and prioritising issues like climate change and gender equality over economic fundamentals.Even as he called for reform, Bessent ’s tone marked a departure from the more radical elements of Trump’s economic policy. He acknowledged the importance of multilateral institutions in fostering stability and hinted at the possibility of a recalibrated relationship with China. “There is an opportunity for a big deal here,” he said, suggesting mutual economic rebalancing—more US manufacturing and increased Chinese consumption.The confusion surrounding trade policy reflects a broader challenge within the administration: reconciling nationalist economic policies with a desire to project financial leadership abroad. For development bankers and global markets, Bessent’s speech may have brought some relief—but Leavitt’s blunt message was a reminder that the White House remains committed to a confrontational approach.",Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been attempting to walk a delicate line between Trump’s protectionist instincts and the need for global financial stability.

"Donald Trump cracks down on colleges, equity programs in new executive orders: What it means",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-cracks-down-on-colleges-equity-programs-in-new-executive-orders-what-it-means/articleshow/120567198.cms,"US President Donald Trump in a new executive order signed Wednesday (local time) targeted the college accreditation process , a key mechanism through which universities gain access to federal financial aid, intensifying his administration's ongoing conflict with elite academic institutions such as Harvard University, The Hill reported.The order, which has not yet been publicly released, was described by the Wall Street Journal as an effort to curb what Trump considers “ideological overreach” in higher education and to promote “intellectual diversity” on campus.The executive directive seeks to make it easier for institutions to switch accreditors, thus encouraging competition in an accreditor space that has long been criticized for its rigid bureaucracy and limited accountability.“University accreditation is currently a process controlled by a number of third-party organisations that are, by statute, by law. Many of those third-party accreditors have relied on a sort of woke ideology to accredit universities instead of accrediting based on merit and performance,” said White House staff secretary Will Scharf.The directive authorises the Secretary of Education to hold accreditors accountable, including potential denial, monitoring, suspension, or termination for poor performance or violations of the Civil Rights Act, CNN reported. It also empowers the Attorney General and Education Secretary to investigate and terminate instances of unlawful discrimination in higher education institutions, including law and medical schools.The order is part of a broader reshaping of higher education governance by Trump’s Domestic Policy Council, led by figures such as deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. It follows a $2.2 billion funding freeze targeting Harvard, announced just a week earlier, underscoring a deepening standoff between Trump’s administration and elite academic institutions over issues of academic freedom, oversight, and alleged political bias.Further executive actions announced Wednesday include mandates to train students in artificial intelligence, enforce laws on foreign gifts to universities, and launch a White House initiative on historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). “That’s a big deal,” Trump said of the AI training push. “We have literally trillions of dollars being invested in AI.”The political backdrop to the order is fraught. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threatened to revoke Harvard’s certification to enrol international students unless the university complies with demands to provide records on “illegal and violent activities” involving foreign students. According to the DHS, Harvard must submit the records by April 30, 2025, or face immediate consequences.Harvard, which has nearly 6,800 international students — roughly 27.2% of its total enrollment for 2024–25 — said in response that it “will not surrender their independence or relinquish their constitutional rights.”This intensifying federal scrutiny of accreditation also follows similar grievances aired by Republican figures like Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who last year sued the Biden administration, declaring he would not “bow to unaccountable accreditors who think they should run Florida's public universities.”The move has sparked anxiety within academic circles, as a revocation of accreditation could deprive universities of federal student loans and Pell grants — critical funding lifelines for both institutions and students alike.","US President Donald Trump in a new executive order signed Wednesday (local time) targeted the college accreditation process.

Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has expressed deep sorrow and outrage over the deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, that killed at least 26 people on Tuesday. Most of the victims were tourists.Taking to X, Sunak wrote, “The barbaric attack in Pahalgam has stolen the lives of newlyweds, children, and families simply seeking joy. Our hearts break for them. To those mourning – know that the UK stands with you in sorrow and solidarity. Terror will never win. We grieve with India.”The Resistance Front (TRF), a group linked to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack. Gunmen opened fire near a popular tourist meadow close to Pahalgam town, in what has become the worst attack in the region since the 2019 Pulwama bombing.Global leaders including US president Donald Trump have voiced their condemnation and support for India. Trump called the attack “deeply disturbing” and said the United States stood firmly with India in its fight against terrorism.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who returned early from a visit to Saudi Arabia, chaired a high-level security meeting in Delhi. India has since suspended the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan as part of its response.Earlier, Defence minister Rajnath Singh assured the nation of a ""loud and clear"" response to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 28 people, mostly tourists.Rajanth Singh said that the government would hunt down not only the perpetrators who carried out the ghastly attack, but also those behind the scenes.","Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has expressed deep sorrow and outrage over the deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, that killed at least 26 people on Tuesday.

Trump Believes He's Reached A Deal With Russia

,

US president Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he believed Russia was ready to strike a peace deal to end the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, but blamed Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy for holding up progress.Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump said, “I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelensky. I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelensky. So far it’s been harder,” news agency AFP quoted him as saying.Earlier the same day, Trump took to Truth Social to criticise Zelenskyy for rejecting any agreement that legitimises Russia’s annexation of Crimea, which occurred in 2014. Trump called this stance “very harmful” to peace efforts and accused Zelenskyy of making “inflammatory statements” that have stalled negotiations.Zelenskyy, however, has remained firm. Speaking at a press event on Tuesday, he reiterated that Ukraine’s constitution does not allow for the surrender of its territory. “There’s nothing to talk about here,” he said, referring to Crimea.Relations between the two leaders worsened after a heated Oval Office meeting in February. Trump reportedly raised his voice and accused Zelenskyy of risking global conflict. In response, Trump paused military aid to Ukraine, including intelligence sharing.Meanwhile, efforts to broker peace through high-level diplomatic meetings have faltered. US officials Marco Rubio and Steve Witkoff withdrew from scheduled talks in London, weakening the prospects of a near-term agreement. Despite this, Ukrainian officials, including presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak, continued to meet with Western allies in the UK.Zelenskyy later acknowledged that “emotions have run high” but stressed the importance of dialogue. “Each side contributed meaningfully,” he posted online. “It is this joint work that can lead to lasting peace.”",US president Donald Trump said he believes Russia is ready to strike a peace deal to end the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro reopened his official home to the public for an Easter egg hunt on Tuesday, barely a week after a fire , started by an alleged arsonist, destroyed one of the wings at the residence.“I'm not going to live in fear,” Shapiro told reporters on the west lawn of the residence, along the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania's capital Harrisburg.He further said ""the smell of smoke is gone from the living quarters,"" adding that he hoped the fire-damaged rooms would have been ""restored by mid-summer."" However, the 51-year-old Democrat declined to detail the security improvements which have been made or would be made.The fire broke out in the early hours of April 3 as Shapiro, his wife, their children, extended family members and dogs slept upstairs, just hours after having celebrated the Jewish holiday of Passover with members of Harrisburg's Jewish community.Shapiro, 51, is the first-term governor of Pennsylvania, America's fifth-most populous state.Cody Balmer, 38, allegedly scaled the nearly 7-foot iron security gate, crossed the grounds and smashed windows with a hammer, ignited two glass bottles filled with gasoline, crawled inside, and finally slipped off into the dark minutes later. The rooms he allegedly lit ablaze were where the Shapiro family had held the Passover Seder just hours earlier.The suspected arson attack caused damage worth millions of dollars, according to fire officials, and there were no injuries. State troopers roused the governor and his family and evacuated them to safety.Balmer has been in jail since turning himself in, on charges which include attempted homicide, arson, assault and burglary. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for May 28 to determine whether the case would go to trial. He has not entered a plea.Balmer's family says he suffers from mental illness , though he denied this in court. As per officials, Balmer expressed ""hatred"" for Shapiro, and say they are investigating whether ""religious or political bias"" could explain why he ""hated"" the politician.According to police affidavits, the accused was asked what he could have done had he encountered Shapiro. He replied he would have ""hit"" the Pennsylvania governor with a sledgehammer.State police have hired a former state police commissioner, Jeffrey Miller, to conduct a security review of the governor's residence.","Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro reopened his official home to the public for an Easter egg hunt on Tuesday.

There’s nothing to talk about here.’ This statement is very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia,” Trump posted on Truth Social.Trump suggested that Crimea was effectively lost under former President Barack Obama and should not be a sticking point. He continued: “Nobody is asking Zelenskyy to recognize Crimea as Russian Territory but, if he wants Crimea, why didn’t they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?”He warned that Zelenskyy’s remarks could prolong the bloodshed. “It’s inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy’s that makes it so difficult to settle this War… He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country.”The US president, who claims he is close to brokering a deal, said he is committed to ending the conflict, not out of allegiance to either side, but to prevent further loss of life. “I have nothing to do with Russia, but have much to do with wanting to save, on average, five thousand Russian and Ukrainian soldiers a week, who are dying for no reason whatsoever.”Hours after Trump's post, Zelenskyy took to social media to claim ""emotions were high"" but insisting that recent talks involving the US, UK, France, Germany and Ukraine had been constructive. “Each side was not just a participant but contributed meaningfully,” he posted, adding that Ukraine would continue to act in accordance with its Constitution and was confident the US would honour its commitments.He reiterated that Ukraine would not accept the loss of its territory, citing the 2018 Crimea Declaration from the US State Department: “The United States reaffirms as policy its refusal to recognize the Kremlin’s claims of sovereignty over territory seized by force.”Zelenskyy’s position was backed up by remarks he made earlier this week, saying, “There is nothing to talk about. It is our land, the land of the Ukrainian people,” ahead of a planned peace summit in London. However, the Biden-era initiative to freeze territorial lines and allow Russia to retain occupied areas has met with resistance in Kyiv.Meanwhile, Trump continues to criticise Zelenskyy personally, telling reporters, “The man with ‘no cards to play’ should now, finally, GET IT DONE.” He also hinted at potential meetings with global leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, though no meetings are confirmed.Vice President JD Vance called the US proposal “very fair,” and said it’s now up to both Ukraine and Russia to accept or walk away. “It’s time for them to either say ‘yes’ or for the United States to walk away from this process.”","US president claims Zelenskyy's refusal to compromise is jeopardising peace efforts.

Twelve states sue Donald Trump administration in trade court over ‘chaotic and illegal’ tariff policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/twelve-states-sue-trump-administration-over-chaotic-and-illegal-tariff-policy/articleshow/120566080.cms,"A coalition of 12 US states filed a lawsuit on Wednesday in the US Court of International Trade in New York, seeking to overturn President Donald Trump’s tariff policy, which they say is unlawful and has disrupted the national economy.The legal challenge accuses Trump of abusing emergency powers under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to unilaterally impose tariffs without Congressional approval. The plaintiffs argue that only Congress has the authority to levy tariffs and that the president can only invoke IEEPA in response to “unusual and extraordinary threats” from abroad — not to enact sweeping changes to trade policy.“By claiming the authority to impose immense and ever-changing tariffs on whatever goods entering the United States he chooses, for whatever reason he finds convenient to declare an emergency, the President has upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy,” the lawsuit states.The 12 states listed as plaintiffs include Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Vermont. They are asking the court to declare Trump’s tariffs illegal and to bar federal agencies and officials from enforcing them.Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes condemned the tariff approach in a statement. “President Trump’s insane tariff scheme is not only economically reckless — it is illegal,” she said. “No matter what the White House claims, tariffs are a tax that will be passed on to Arizona consumers.”The Justice Department has not yet responded to the suit.The multistate filing comes on the heels of a separate lawsuit filed last week by California Governor Gavin Newsom, who warned that his state — the largest importer in the US — could lose billions in revenue due to the tariffs. Newsom called the policy “the worst own-goal in the history of this country.”Responding to Newsom’s challenge, White House spokesperson Kush Desai defended the administration’s stance: “The Trump administration remains committed to addressing this national emergency that’s decimating America’s industries and leaving our workers behind with every tool at our disposal, from tariffs to negotiations.”Trump, who has imposed aggressive tariffs on China — including an additional 145% on certain imports — and threatened more on other trade partners, insists the measures are key to revitalising US manufacturing. However, the states argue that the strategy lacks legal grounding and is harming the American economy.","A coalition of 12 US states filed a lawsuit on Wednesday in the US Court of International Trade in New York, seeking to overturn President Donald Trump’s tariff policy.

It’s important that each side was not just a participant but contributed meaningfully,” Zelensky said on X, noting that “the American side shared its vision” alongside Ukraine and the other European nations.In what seemed to be an indirect response to US President Donald Trump’s criticism of Zelensky being unwilling to recognize Russian control of Crimea, Zelensky vowed Ukraine would abide by its constitution. He also shared a screenshot of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s 2018 Crimea Declaration which rejected Russia’s occupation of the peninsula.“Ukraine will always act in accordance with its Constitution and we are absolutely sure that our partners — in particular the USA — will act in line with its strong decisions,” he said.",US President Donald Trump slammed Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement on Crimea.

Is Trump taking Ozempic? Conspiracy theories swirl while mystery skin patch reappears on his hand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-trump-taking-ozempic-conspiracy-theories-swirl-while-mystery-skin-patch-reappears-on-his-hand/articleshow/120562463.cms,"Donald Trump's weight loss triggers speculations over Ozempic while the mystery greenish patch on his right hand reappears.

But what is the mysterious bruise?



Donald Trump's annual physical results have declared that he is in excellent health at the age of 78. His resting heart rate was recorded at 62 beats per minute and it was revealed that he takes two medicines for cholesterol control. His fitness was attributed to his active lifestyle as he has been regularly playing golf and winning -- even after becoming the president, his height was recorded as 75 inches (6 feet 2 inches) and his weight was 224 pounds (102 kg).Trump lost 20 pounds since his last presidential physical test in 2020 and the whispers are that a little pharmaceutical help was taken, Daily Beast reported. Elon Musk has been open about taking GLP-1 drugs to shed a few extra pounds but it will remain a secret whether Trump too used them. “Nothing would do more to improve the health, lifespan and quality of life for Americans than making GLP inhibitors super low cost to the public,” he posted on X. GLP-1 receptor agonists are used to treat diabetes and obesity, and include Ozempic and Wegovy.Dr Lisa Oldson, an obesity medicine specialist, told The Daily Beast she is doubtful a diet change alone could account for Trump’s distinctly slimmer look. “Most people don’t lose [weight] that fast without meds,” she said. “When we look at people losing 30 pounds, 40 pounds, 50 pounds, 80 pounds, 100 pounds,” Oldson said, “that’s much more often due to the newer meds, the GLP agonists,” and not because of diet and exercise alone.Though Trump is in the pink of his health, the mysterious bruise that appeared several times -- before, reappeared on Wednesday when the president held an impromptu press meet outside the White House. Trump was found to have some benign lesions, also known as actinic keratosis (AK), which are rough, scaly patches or bumps on the skin caused by long-term sun exposure.","Trump lost 20 pounds since his last presidential physical test in 2020 and the whispers are that a little pharmaceutical help was taken.

"Students SEVIS Record Restored: All 133 international students, including many Indians, win lawsuit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/all-133-international-students-including-many-indians-who-filed-a-lawsuit-get-their-sevis-records-restored/articleshow/120562167.cms,"File photo

The Trump administration has followed the orders of the US district court (northern district of Georgia) and reinstated the SEVIS records of all 133 students who had filed this lawsuit.As reported by TOI on April 20, the court had issued issued a temporary restraining order, requiring department of homeland Security (DHS) to reinstate plaintiffs’ SEVIS records retroactive to March 31, 2025. US govt agencies were ordered to file a notice of compliance of the reinstatement by Tuesday evening.Charles Kuck, who represented the students, many of them Indians, said: “All students are now reinstated.” They can now continue to study or work under the optional practical training (OPT) programme. The next hearing is slated in the coming days.In some, but not all of the 133 cases, the state department has revoked the student’s visa. The revocation of an F-1 visa (which is granted for duration of status) does not necessarily impact the person’s lawful presence in the country. As such, plaintiffs contended it is the SEVIS registration termination that has rendered them vulnerable to devastating immigration outcomes such as detention and deportation.Increasingly, in the courts, the US agencies are taking a stand that SEVIS termination does not result in irreparable harm. Based solely on their latest contention, if a SEVIS record is terminated a student can continue with studies in the US. However, SEVIS termination notices received by students from their designated school officials ask them to self deport at the earliest as there is no grace period following a SEVIS termination. Further, it automatically terminates the work authorisation granted for an OPT programme .In a press conference American Immigration Lawyers Association 's President-Elect Jeff Joseph said, “We believe SEVIS termination does impact the status of international students. Thus, most of the lawsuits being filed are not challenging the actual visa revocation, but SEVIS termination.” He said US agencies are increasingly pointing out in court that SEVIS termination is just a credential revocation, it has no underlying impact on legal status. But this is directly contrary to their own outward facing guidance on their website, in response to inquiries as well as their own policy-guidance and training materials for DSOs.“It is our hope that if govt takes the position SEVIS termination has no impact on status, they revise their guidance... so that the kids can go back to school, to work and do what they intended to do, which is to come here and educate themselves and use that education to benefit all of us here in the US,” he added.","The Trump administration has reinstated the SEVIS records of all 133 students who had filed this lawsuit.

JD Vance Pope: Why won't JD Vance attend Pope Francis's funeral? Here's what he said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-wont-jd-vance-attend-pope-franciss-funeral-heres-what-he-said/articleshow/120562192.cms,"JD Vance has spoken up about being one of the last few visitors Pope met hours before his death.

Why JD Vance is being trolled for a coincidence?



Vice President JD Vance was one of the last visitors of Pope Francis on Easter morning on Sunday, hours before his death on Monday. Given the antithetical relationship between the Donald Trump administration and the late Pope, JD Vance has literally been blamed for Pope's death, albeit some of it was part of internet fun. On Wednesday, as the vice president was in Agra, India, he commented on how he reflected on his meeting with the Pope hours before the Pope passed away and said it was 'pretty crazy'.On being asked as to whether he's planning to attend the funeral of the Pope, Vance said he is neither planning to attend the funeral nor planning not to attend it. He said it was not yet decided who from the government would attend the funeral.The White House, however, announced that President Trump would be attending the funeral. He would leave Washington on Friday morning to fly to Rome and return Saturday evening.JD Vance's chance meeting with the Pope hours before Pope's death is a coincidence but Vance is being mercilessly trolled for this. Right-wing American author Ann Coulter even congratulated JD Vance while commentators, comedians are not letting this opportunity to mock Vance go. JD Vance is the Internet's favorite meme and hence Vance trolling is back.“I know you’ve not been feeling great, but it’s good see you in better health,” Vance told the Pope during his brief meeting. Social media users wondered how fateful Vance's words were that the Pope died soon after.A priest serving as a translator spoke for the pope during their brief conversation.“These are for your children,” the priest said as someone presented Vance with chocolate eggs. Next came a tray of additional gifts, including rosaries and a Vatican tie.“Thank you,” Vance said as he held the dark tie. “So beautiful.”They posed for a photo, Vance standing to the pope’s right before bidding him farewell. “I pray for you every day,” Vance said. “God bless you.”Jimmy Kimmel commented that now everyone knows that JD Vance is bad at praying too.JD Vance said he thought about the chance meeting a lot. ""It’s pretty crazy, actually,” he said. “Obviously, when I saw him, I didn’t know that he had less than 24 hours still on this Earth,” Vance added. “I think it was a great blessing. But, you know, he saw a lot of people. I think he affected a lot of lives. And I try to just remember that I was lucky I got to shake his hand.”","JD Vance was one of the last visitors of Pope Francis on Easter morning on Sunday, hours before his death.

The Hamilton Police on Wednesday provided an update in the Aril 17 shooting death of Harsimrat Randhawa , an Indian student, and said that they have recovered two vehicles involved in the shooting.Acting Det.-Sgt Daryl Reid told reporters at a Wednesday morning news conference that the white Hyundai Elantra was recovered on Sunday in a residential area in northwestern Toronto. It has since been towed back to Hamilton for forensic analysis, he said.On Monday, Hamilton police executed a search warrant at a central Hamilton residence and recovered the black Mercedes SUV, Reid said. The White Hyundai, police said, was probably the target vehicle towards which the shots were fired. Randhawa lost her life as she was caught in the crossfire and a stray bullet struck her chest. The shots also hit two houses in the area but no one was injured. Randhawa was taken to a hospital, where she died.Police said the 21-year-old international student who was going into her second year studying occupational physiotherapy at Mohawk College had no time to react to the bullet that immediately killed her. She had just left the gym when she was shot. ""She had taken a city bus to that location and had been waiting to cross the street. This was when she was struck by a stray bullet,"" Reid said.Randhawa had zero capability of avoiding what was about to unfold in front of her. She had just stepped off of the city bus, was waiting to cross the street, from my understanding, and everything unfolded so quickly she had no time at all to react.""""We know from watching that video that there were numerous cars that just passed through at that very moment. Many of those people have come forward and I thank those people for coming forward to assist us,"" he said.""But we know there are more people out there that might have even the smallest piece of information that could help us, and putting all of those little pieces together is what we need to do.

The United States on Wednesday launched a fresh attack on China’s economic approach, calling its export driven model “unsustainable,” which harms not only China but also the rest of the world.Speaking at the IIF Global Outlook Forum in Washington, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent stressed rising concerns around trade imbalances that US President Donald Trump hopes to address through his sweeping tariff policies.Still, Bessent insisted that, “America First does not mean America alone.”He also defended Trump administration ’s moves, labeling them as a measure to encourage ""deeper collaboration and mutual respect among trade partners,"" while fixing ""intentional policy choices"" by other nations that have weakened US manufacturing and put its security ""at risk.""Taking aim at the “status quo” of persistent global trade imbalances, warning, ""it is not sustainable for the United States, and ultimately, it is not sustainable for other economies.""His comments came amid ongoing trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies.

Will JD Vance attend Pope's funeral?



Vice President JD Vance has broken his silence after two days of brutal trolling on social media about being among the last few visitors that Pope Francis met hours before his death.

As Vance was in India with his family, he opened up about the coincidence and said he thought about it a lot in the past two days.Vance said it was pretty crazy but a great blessing for him that he could meet the Pope in his final hours.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan attempted to distance itself from Sunday’s murderous terrorist attack on tourists in Pahalgam that claimed at least 26 lives, with defence minister Khawaja Asif claiming on Wednesday his country had “nothing to do” with the massacre of Indian tourists and referring to it as a “home-grown” uprising against India’s “Hindutva regime”.Speaking to a Pakistani TV channel, Asif alleged there were rebellions across the Indian states of Nagaland, Kashmir and Manipur. The minister’s remarks reflect Islamabad’s narrative of framing the violence as a local response to Indian policies, contrasting with India’s accusations of Pakistani support for militant groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba The minister’s statements, steeped in denial and deflection, sidestepped Pakistan’s well-documented ties to terror groups.Asif’s comments come soon after Pakistan army chief General Asim Munir’s provocative April 16 speech in which he had described Kashmir as Pakistan’s “jugular vein” and vowed support for the “Kashmiri struggle”. This rhetoric, paired with Asif’s denial, paints a picture of a state unwilling to confront its complicity.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s foreign office issued a statement expressing concern over the loss of lives but stopped short of condemning the attack as terrorism, a move critics see as tacitly endorsing the violence. “We extend our condolences to the near ones of the deceased and wish the injured a speedy recovery,” foreign office spokesperson Shafqat Khan said. This carefully worded response, coupled with Asif’s claim that the attack reflects “local uprisings”, has drawn sharp criticism for whitewashing the role of Pakistan-based terror outfits.",Pakistan attempted to distance itself from Sunday’s murderous terrorist attack on tourists in Pahalgam that claimed at least 26 lives.

Gunmen kill two policemen guarding polio team in Pakistan’s Balochistan province,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/gunmen-kill-two-policemen-guarding-polio-team-in-pakistans-balochistan-province/articleshow/120548284.cms,"Representative image

Two Pakistani police officers were shot dead on Wednesday while protecting a polio vaccination team in the Teeri area of Mastung district in Balochistan, officials confirmed, marking the second fatal attack on such teams since the nationwide inoculation drive began earlier this week.According to local administrator Manan Tareen, the attack occurred when two unidentified gunmen riding a motorcycle opened fire on the officers as they stood guard outside a house where the health workers were administering polio drops to children.“One of the policemen died on the spot while the other was critically injured and later died at the hospital,” Tareen told AFP. “The team of health workers remained unharmed, as they were inside a house conducting vaccinations.”The identity of the attackers remains unknown, and no group has claimed responsibility for the assault. However, such attacks have been routinely carried out by militant outfits who view the vaccination campaigns with suspicion, often accusing them of being cover operations for espionage.Shahid Rind, a spokesperson for the provincial government, confirmed the death toll and said security agencies are investigating the attack. He added that despite the assault, vaccination efforts would continue and security around teams would be reviewed and strengthened.This incident follows a similar attack earlier this week in the restive province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where a police officer was gunned down while accompanying a vaccination team.Polio remains endemic in only two countries—Pakistan and Afghanistan—and efforts to eradicate the virus have been severely hampered by repeated attacks on health workers and their security escorts. Since 2012, more than 100 health workers and police personnel have been killed in such targeted assaults in Pakistan.The Pakistani government has continued its fight against polio with support from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international partners. The current nationwide campaign aims to immunize millions of children under the age of five, especially in high-risk areas like Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.","Two Pakistani police officers were shot dead on Wednesday while protecting a polio vaccination team.

‘Out of sheer helplessness’: Over 1 lakh Afghans left Pakistan under latest deportation campaign,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/out-of-sheer-helplessness-over-1-lakh-afghans-left-pakistan-under-latest-deportation-campaign/articleshow/120515188.cms,"Poll Do you believe Pakistan's mass deportation of Afghans is justified? No, it's inhumane. Yes, for national security.

In the past three weeks, more than 100,000 Afghans have fled Pakistan as a result of the mass cancellation of residence permits that came into effect since April, the country's interior ministry revealed.The ministry told news agency AFP that 100,529 Afghans have left the country so far this month.This latest phase of this deportation campaign by the Pakistani government was launched on 1 April, labelling many Afghans as “terrorists and criminals,” and holding the Taliban-led government in Kabul responsible for a rise in cross-border attacks.Analysts argue that the move is aimed at pressurising Afghanistan’s rulers, as Pakistan grapples with worsening security challenges along its frontier.Since the deportations began, long convoys of families can been seen heading toward border crossings such as Torkham, many returning to a homeland they barely know.“I was born in Pakistan and have never been to Afghanistan,” said 27-year-old Allah Rahman, who was waiting to cross the border. “I was afraid the police might humiliate me and my family. Now we’re heading back to Afghanistan out of sheer helplessness.”Afghan Prime Minister Hasan Akhund strongly condemned Pakistan’s actions, calling them “unilateral measures,” in a statement issued after Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar visited Kabul for talks. Akhund urged Islamabad to “facilitate the dignified return of Afghan refugees”.Refugees and human rights groups have reported a surge in arbitrary arrests, harassment, and extortion targeting Afghans, especially in Punjab and Sindh provinces. While many are being forcibly expelled, others are choosing to leave voluntarily, fearing mistreatment or detention. The UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) noted that in April alone, 12,948 Afghans were arrested or detained in Pakistan, which accounts for more than the total number for the entire previous year.Pakistan’s border regions have come under increasing strain, particularly from attacks by separatists in Balochistan and by Pakistani Taliban fighters in the northwest. Last year marked the deadliest period for Pakistan in over a decade.Millions of Afghans have taken refuge in Pakistan over the past 40 years, fleeing conflict and instability. But support for hosting them has waned, as Pakistan’s own economic and security problems deepen.“They came here for refuge but ended up taking jobs, opening businesses. They took jobs from Pakistanis who are already struggling,” said Tanveer Ahmad, a 41-year-old barber in Islamabad.The UNHCR revealed that more than half of those being deported are children.

Mob lynches Ahmadi businessman in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/mob-lynches-ahmadi-businessman-in-karachi/articleshow/120494757.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The death of Laeeq Cheema , a 47-year-old Ahmadi businessman, killed by a frenzied mob for praying in a Karachi worship hall, has ignited outrage, exposing the relentless persecution of Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya community.The attack, led by activists of the far-right Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) enraged over Cheema allegedly filming them on Sunday, underscores a state-backed system of bigotry.Pakistan’s 500,000 Ahmadis face an apartheid-like existence, stripped of religious freedom since the 1974 second amendment to the constitution declared them non-Muslims. Ordinance XX of 1984 bans Ahmadis from identifying as Muslims or using Islamic symbols, with violations risking imprisonment or death under blasphemy laws. Over 4,100 Ahmadis have faced charges since, including 335 for blasphemy, fuelled by TLP’s hate-filled rhetoric at Khatm-e-Nabuwat conferences. Urdu media and businesses amplify this bigotry, with shops in Punjab and Sindh refusing service to Ahmadis.The Karachi lynching is not isolated. In 2023, 34 attacks targeted Ahmadi worship sites, with police often complicit, demolishing graves or detaining victims instead of attackers.After Cheema’s killing, a TLP-affiliated union council chairman and over a dozen others were arrested, but justice remains doubtful. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan condemned police for taking 25 Ahmadis into “protective custody”, calling it state-enabled persecution. Posts on X labeled it “religious apartheid”.The military, though not directly involved, shares blame for this impunity. General Zia-ul-Haq’s 1980s Islamisation policies entrenched anti-Ahmadi laws, and the military’s political dominance lets groups like TLP thrive. The state’s inaction against TLP’s violent campaigns, like the 2017 Islamabad sit-in, emboldens mobs. Last June, 11 Ahmadis in Punjab faced FIRs after TLP complaints, with police caving to extremists.Ahmadis live in fear, hiding their identities to avoid harassment, job loss, or violence. Many boycott censuses, shun public worship, and face grave desecration. Cheema’s death highlights their vulnerability, with women especially trapped by religious and gender discrimination.","Laeeq Cheema, a 47-year-old Ahmadi businessman, killed by a frenzied mob for praying in a Karachi worship hall.

Poll Should the federal government halt the canal project in response to protests? No, it should continue Yes, it should be halted

A Pakistani Hindu state minister was attacked with tomatoes and potatoes in Sindh on Saturday by protesters opposing the federal government’s proposed canal projects, which critics say will reduce the province’s share of irrigation water.Kheal Das Kohistani , state minister for religious affairs in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, was targeted by a group of demonstrators in Thatta district, however, he remained unharmed.The attack, which took place amid rising tensions over the Green Pakistan Initiative , drew swift condemnation from both federal and provincial authorities. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif termed the assault on Kohistani “unacceptable” and assured of “a thorough investigation” into the incident. “The attack on the public representatives is unacceptable. The persons involved in the incident would be given exemplary punishment,” he said.Federal information minister Atta Tarar also called it “an attack” and sought a report from the Sindh Inspector General of Police and the federal interior secretary.Sindh chief minister Syed Murad Ali Shah issued a stern warning against taking the law into one’s own hands and instructed Hyderabad’s deputy inspector general to arrest the culprits immediately.Kohistani, a member of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), hails from Sindh’s Jamshoro district and was first elected to parliament in 2018. He returned to the National Assembly in 2024 and was later appointed as a state minister.The protestors chanted slogans against the PML-N-led federal government, accusing it of threatening Sindh’s agricultural livelihood by backing controversial canal projects in Punjab under the Green Pakistan Initiative.The plan, supported by the federal government, Punjab authorities and the military, includes the construction of six new canals to irrigate Cholistan. Opponents argue it will cut downriver water flow to Sindh, worsening irrigation issues in the province.Political tensions flared further after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari issued a strong warning to the PML-N at a rally in Hyderabad. He said the PPP would withdraw support from the federal government if the canal plan wasn’t shelved.In response, PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif directed the federal government to initiate talks with the PPP to resolve the dispute amicably.Rana Sanaullah, a senior PML-N leader and adviser to the prime minister, later stated, “Politics should not be played over the issue of water. Matters must be resolved through dialogue.” He reiterated that the 1991 Water Accord and 1992 IRSA Act protect inter-provincial water rights.","Kheal Das Kohistani, state minister for religious affairs in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, was targeted by a group of demonstrators in Thatta district.

"‘No right to appeal for Kulbhushan Jadhav’: ICJ only granted consular access, Pakistan SC told",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-right-to-appeal-for-kulbhushan-jadhav-icj-only-granted-consular-access-pakistan-sc-told/articleshow/120450503.cms,"Poll Do you believe Kulbhushan Jadhav should have the right to appeal his conviction? No, the conviction should stand Yes, he deserves an appeal

The Pakistani Supreme Court was told on Wednesday that Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav was never granted the right to appeal his conviction because the 2019 ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) only required consular access , not a legal right to challenge his sentence, the Dawn reported.Pak defence ministry counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed, appearing before a seven-judge constitutional bench, said the ICJ ruling did not obligate Pakistan to provide Jadhav, who was convicted of espionage and terrorism, with an automatic right to appeal. “The ICJ verdict addressed only the consular access issue under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention. It never directed Pakistan to extend appeal rights,” he told the court.The bench is currently hearing 38 intra-court appeals, including from the federal and provincial governments, against the Supreme Court’s October 2023 judgment that struck down military trials for civilians involved in the May 9 riots.Responding to criticism that Pakistani citizens convicted by military courts after the May 9 violence are not being given the same appeal options as Jadhav, Haris argued that Pakistan’s 2021 ICJ (Review and Re-consideration) Act was a “unique jurisdiction” created specifically for compliance with the ICJ ruling, not a general legal provision.The Dawn reported Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar pointed out that the ICJ law stemmed from earlier Pakistani court rulings like the 2017 Said Zaman Khan case, which had expanded the rights of the accused. Justice Musarrat Hilali added that the Said Zaman ruling, initially contested by the government, was eventually cited in Pakistan’s defence before the ICJ.The case of Jadhav, a former Indian Navy officer, remains one of the most high-profile legal controversies between India and Pakistan. Captured in Balochistan in 2016, Jadhav was sentenced to death by a military court in 2017. India moved the ICJ, which ordered Pakistan to grant him consular access but stopped short of overturning the conviction.Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan is expected to weigh in on whether Pakistani civilians tried in military courts post-May 9 should be allowed to appeal, a decision that could have broader implications for the ongoing constitutional debate.Justice Jamal Mandokhail pressed the government on whether military court proceedings can begin without filing a formal FIR. The counsel replied that under Section 157 of the Pakistan Army Act, a court of inquiry can initiate proceedings and no FIR is needed.","Pakistani Supreme Court told Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav was never granted the right to appeal his conviction.

Poll Do you support Pakistan's recent deportation of Afghan refugees? No, it harms vulnerable families. Yes, it's necessary for national security.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar met Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul on Saturday to mend frayed bilateral ties strained by security concerns and the contentious repatriation of Afghan refugees.The high-level talks, which included meeting with Afghan interim prime minister Mullah Muhammad Hassan Akhund and other officials, focused on trade, security and people-to-people ties, but the shadow of Pakistan’s intensified deportation drive loomed large, particularly for low-income Afghans facing upheaval.The visit, described by Pakistan’s foreign office as a “reflection of commitment to enhance sustained engagement”, follows a recent Pak-Afghan joint coordination committee meeting in Kabul. Dar emphasised “brotherly ties” and opportunities for trade, stating, “Our link with Central Asia depends on Afghanistan as a partner.”However, the talks come as Pakistan has expelled over 80,000 Afghans since April 1, targeting those deemed “illegal”, including many low-income families integrated into Pakistani society for decades.Afghanistan’s foreign ministry expressed deep concerns over the expulsions, with Muttaqi urging “dialogue based on trust” to resolve the issue. “The forced deportation of Afghans is unacceptable and undermines mutual respect,” he said, highlighting the plight of vulnerable returnees facing economic hardship and insecurity in Afghanistan.Since Nov 2023, Pakistan has repatriated 907,000 Afghans, with 44,000 still awaiting relocation to Western countries.In Pakistan’s border regions, low-income Afghan families, many of whom fled conflict decades ago, face acute distress. Akbar Khan, a Peshawar restaurant owner, said, “I’ve been here 50 years. This is my home, but now we’re being uprooted.” The rugged border terrain complicates enforcement, with many returnees using illegal channels to re-enter Pakistan.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister met Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul.

Ahmadiyya minority beaten to death by anti-blasphemy group in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/ahmadiyya-minority-beaten-to-death-by-anti-blasphemy-group-in-pakistan/articleshow/120412129.cms,"A member of Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya community was beaten to death on Friday after a mob of radical surrounded an Ahmadi place of worship in Karachi’s Saddar neighbourhood.The crowd, having many from the anti blasphemy political groupTehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), forced their way through narrow streets chanting anti-Ahmadi slogans before surrounding the colonial-era worship site. Tensions quickly escalated when the group accused the minority community of violating Pakistan’s controversial anti-Ahmadi laws.“One member of the community was killed after the mob identified him as an Ahmadi,” said Muhammad Safdar, a senior police official in Karachi.“They attacked him with sticks and bricks.”Police said members of several religious parties were part of the mob. To protect others from further violence, officers took around 25 Ahmadis into custody and moved them away in a police-escorted van after negotiating with the crowd, which had swelled to around 600 people.The Ahmadiyya community, considered heretical by Pakistan’s state and many religious groups, has long faced systemic discrimination. Ahmadis, who have a population of almost 10 million worldwide, consider themselves Muslims and have faith identical to mainstream Islam in almost every manner. Though they regard themselves as Muslim, a 1974 constitutional amendment declared them non-Muslim, and a 1984 ordinance criminalised many of their religious practices.Friday’s killing is the latest in a long history of persecution. According to community records, six Ahmadis have been killed in 2024 so far, with over 280 killed since 1984. Thousands more have faced criminal charges, including hundreds under Pakistan’s harsh blasphemy laws.Abdul Qadir Ashrafi, a 52-year-old businessman who took part in the protest, said the group’s intention was to pressure police to act against the Ahmadis.“We requested that the place be sealed and that those conducting the Friday prayers be arrested, with criminal proceedings initiated against them,” he told AFP.The human rights commission of Pakistan condemned the attack, saying it was ""appalled by the orchestrated attack by a far-right religious party on a colonial-era Ahmadi place of worship.""“This failure of law and order is a stark reminder of the continued complicity of the state in the systematic persecution of a beleaguered community,” the commission posted on social media platform X.Mob violence has become an all-too-common response to accusations of blasphemy in Pakistan, often with deadly consequences. In a similar incident last year, dozens of churches were torched in the city of Jaranwala after a Christian man was falsely accused of blasphemy.","A member of Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya community was beaten to death on Friday after a mob of radical surrounded an Ahmadi place of worship in Karachi.

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.Hundreds, including Christian, Buddhist, Hindu and Islamic religious figures, attended a vigil Monday in memory of the victims at the church of St. Anthony, targeted in the attacks.Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, told the attendees Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, prefect of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints in the Vatican, has included the names of 167 catholics who died in the bombings in the churches of St. Anthony in Colombo and St. Sebastian in Negombo ""in the catalogue of the witnesses of the faith in its order book, considering the context of their heroism.""He said they were chosen ""due to violent opposition to their faith motivated by 'odium fidei,' the hate of the faith."" Ranjith also said seven victims of other faiths were ""respectfully remembered.""Witnesses of faith are those who sacrificed their lives for their belief. Pope Francis formalized in 2023 a new category of recognition by the church of people who lost their lives while professing the catholic faith and created a special Vatican commission to catalogue their cases.

This killing follows a pattern of systematic persecution of Hindu minorities under the interim government even as the perpetrators of previous such events roam with impunity. We condemn this incident and once again remind the interim government to live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities, including Hindus, without inventing excuses or making distinctions.”",Congress strongly condemned the murder of Hindu leader Bhavesh Chandra Roy in Bangladesh.

"Sri Lanka Church Shooting: Gunfire at Sri Lankan church days before Easter bombings anniversary, suspect arrested",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/gunfire-at-sri-lankan-church-days-before-easter-bombings-anniversary-suspect-arrested/articleshow/120426345.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

A gunman opened fire at a church in Sri Lanka’s Manampitiya village on Friday evening, raising safety concerns just days ahead of the country’s Easter Monday commemorations for the victims of the 2019 Easter bombings.While no injuries were reported, the shooting damaged a church window, triggering a swift police investigation.The incident occurred around 7 pm (local time) at the Living Christ Church located at Ayurveda Place, Manampitiya, approximately 160 kilometres northeast of the capital, Colombo.As per a police statement cited by news agency AFP, “Initial investigations suggest that the suspect had targeted the church due to a personal enmity with the pastor.”The suspect, identified as a 38-year-old resident of Main Road, Manampitiya, was arrested after police received a tip-off and launched a search operation, reported Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.A locally-made firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was recovered from his possession.According to eyewitness accounts gathered during the preliminary investigation, the man approached the church gate, appearing to assess the area, then returned to the road and fired a single shot before fleeing.Police are continuing their probe into the incident.The attack comes as Sri Lanka remains on high alert during the Easter season. Armed police and military personnel have been deployed to nearly all churches across the island, especially with this year marking six years since the Easter Sunday bombings of 2019 that killed 279 people, including 45 foreigners.Over 500 others were wounded in the coordinated suicide attacks on three churches and three hotels.This year, the Catholic Church is set to formally honour the bombing victims as ""Heroes of the Faith"" in a special memorial on Monday.However, many within the Church continue to express frustration over what they say is a lack of accountability and transparency. As per AFP, the Church has repeatedly accused successive Sri Lankan governments of shielding those with links to the bombers. High-level investigations in the past have suggested ties between military intelligence units and those responsible for the attacks.","A gunman opened fire at a church in Sri Lanka’s Manampitiya village on Friday evening.

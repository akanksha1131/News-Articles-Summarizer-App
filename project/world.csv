Tough talk on Europe and China

Ukraine war exposes a rift

EU unity at risk?

US President Donald Trump and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni struck an unusually upbeat note on Friday as they met at the White House, signaling hope for a new US-EU trade deal and highlighting a growing ideological alignment between the two conservative leaders .“There will be a trade deal, 100 percent,” Trump declared confidently, seated beside Meloni during her charm offensive in Washington. The far-right Italian leader echoed the optimism: “I’m sure we can reach a deal.”Meloni, who became the first European leader to meet Trump since he imposed 20% tariffs on EU exports earlier this year, now suspended for 90 days, has pitched herself as a key intermediary between the US and Europe. “Even if we have some problems between the two shores of the Atlantic, it is the time that we try to sit down and find solutions,” she said.Throughout her visit, Meloni emphasized their shared worldview—from curbing immigration to battling “woke” ideology. “The goal for me is to make the West great again, and I think we can do it together,” she said, co-opting Trump’s signature slogan.Trump, who hosted her for a working lunch and Oval Office meeting, praised Meloni as “fantastic” and said she had extended an invitation to visit Rome soon—an offer he’s considering, potentially in conjunction with a broader EU leaders' meet.While the atmosphere was friendly, Trump returned to familiar criticisms. He accused the EU of trying to “screw” the US on trade and said the bloc needed to “get smart” on immigration and step up defense spending in Nato.“Everybody wants to make a deal and if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them,” Trump warned, adding he was “in no rush.”He also claimed that China had “reached out” about resolving their trade war, despite his imposition of a steep 145% tariff following the April 2 “Liberation Day” tariffs. “I think we're going to make a very good deal with China,” he said.The Russia-Ukraine war remained a point of friction between the two. Meloni has been a firm supporter of Ukraine and recently called Russia’s Palm Sunday strike on Sumy “horrible and vile.” Trump, meanwhile, has shifted toward a more sympathetic stance on Moscow and has publicly attacked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.“I don't hold Zelensky responsible but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started,” Trump said with Meloni beside him. “I'm not a big fan of the Ukrainian.”Meloni’s outreach has raised eyebrows in Brussels and across European capitals. While the European Commission stressed that the bloc alone can negotiate trade deals, it welcomed the Italian PM’s initiative as “coordinated with Brussels.”Still, some European leaders aren’t convinced. “If we start having bilateral discussions, obviously it will break the current dynamic,” warned France’s Industry Minister Marc Ferracci.According to Italian media, one aim of Meloni’s visit was to pave the way for a meeting between Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.After wrapping up her US trip, Meloni is expected back in Rome Friday to host US Vice President JD Vance. But her decision to personally engage Trump comes at a high-stakes moment. The tariffs he’s threatening could hit Italy hard—nearly 10% of its exports go to the US.Yet for now, both leaders are betting on their chemistry. As Meloni puts it, “I am aware of what I represent and I am aware of what I am defending.”",Giorgia Meloni is the first European leader to meet Trump since he imposed 20% tariffs on EU exports earlier this year.

Alps Are Freezing ! ❄️ Homes & Cars Buried Under Mountains of Snow | France, Switzerland, Italy

A powerful and rare spring snowstorm struck the Alps on Thursday, dumping over a metre of snow in just a few hours and causing widespread disruption across France, Italy, and Switzerland. Authorities in all three countries responded by closing roads, cancelling trains, and urging residents to stay indoors.At least one death has been reported. In Italy’s Piedmont region, firefighters found the body of a 92-year-old man inside his flooded home. In the French resort of Val Thorens, a woman went into cardiac arrest after being caught in an avalanche.In France, resorts such as Tignes and Val Thorens were temporarily closed due to high avalanche risk. In Tignes, more than 1.1 metres of snow fell overnight, prompting officials to order a lockdown. “All cars are covered up to the roof,” said Mathis, a hotel employee. “Just walking outside is worrying.”Similar scenes were reported in Sion, Switzerland, where all 36,000 residents were told to stay home. Roads in several regions were shut due to fallen trees and avalanche dangers. The Mont Blanc tunnel, a key route between France and Italy, was closed to heavy trucks, causing traffic jams and leaving dozens of lorries stuck on the A43 highway.Trains were also cancelled, and around 3,300 homes in France’s Savoy region lost power. In Milan, parks were shut due to flooding and strong winds.While snow in April is not unusual, the volume and intensity of this storm took many by surprise. Retired ski instructor Yann Geaudry told news agency AFP that once the sun returns, melting snow could quickly trigger flooding in lower areas.","A powerful and rare spring snowstorm struck the Alps on Thursday, dumping over a metre of snow in just a few hours.

'Biggest risk we have to face is Donald Trump': Canada PM Mark Carney,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/biggest-risk-we-have-to-face-is-donald-trump-canada-pm-mark-carney/articleshow/120397710.cms,"Donald Trump and Mark Carney (R)

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Thursday said that eliminating trade barriers within the country would deliver greater economic benefits than anything US President Donald Trump could undermine through his ongoing war, as he made his case for re-election in the final debate before the April 28 vote.He also termed Trump as a ""biggest risk"" to Canada, which came in the backdrop of his aggressive tariff policies and continuous assertion to add Canada as ""51st state"" of US.Carney, who assumed office last month after Justin Trudeau’s resignation, has set a July 1 target to establish free trade among Canada’s 10 provinces and three territories. He said the country’s long-standing internal trade barriers have stifled economic potential for decades and that a breakthrough agreement is already in place.""We can give ourselves far more than Donald Trump can ever take away,"" Carney said during the debate. “We can have one economy. This is within our grasp.”Framing the US president as a threat to Canada’s sovereignty and prosperity, Carney said the country is facing ""the greatest crisis of our lifetimes"" and described Trump's economic tactics as endangering the very existence of Canada.He defended his government’s retaliatory tariffs against US goods, saying they are impacting Americans “where it hurts,” and signalled readiness to negotiate a new bilateral trade agreement with Trump’s administration immediately following the election.“The biggest risk we have to face is Donald Trump. We've got to get that right,” Carney said. “I jumped into politics now because I believe I'm best placed to address what I called the Trump crisis in this perilous moment.”Carney's rise to leadership came swiftly after Trudeau stepped down amid declining approval ratings, rising living costs, and mounting public pressure. Former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Carney won the Liberal leadership and became prime minister within weeks.Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre sought to redirect voter frustration toward the Liberal government’s record, arguing that a fourth term would mean more economic hardship for Canadians.“We can’t afford a fourth Liberal term of rising housing costs,"" Poilievre said, accusing the governing party of hostility toward the energy sector. He pledged to roll back what he called “anti-energy laws, red tape and high taxes.”But Carney used Trudeau’s absence to distance himself from the previous government. “It may be difficult, Mr Poilievre, you spent years running against Justin Trudeau and the carbon tax and they are both gone,” he said. “I am a very different person than Justin Trudeau.”Carney’s leadership and combative stance against Trump appear to have resonated with voters. In January, a Nanos poll had the Conservatives leading the Liberals by 27 percentage points.The latest poll released Thursday shows the Liberals ahead by five points, a dramatic reversal in just three months. The January survey had a margin of error of 3.1 points; the latest poll’s margin is 2.7.Trump’s trade measures and inflammatory remarks, including a veiled threat to turn Canada into the “51st state”, have stirred a wave of Canadian nationalism that has boosted Liberal support heading into the election.","Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney made his case for re-election in the final debate before the April 28 vote.

'A disgrace': Donald Trump targets Harvard university amid $2.2 billion funding freeze,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-disgrace-donald-trump-targets-harvard-university-amid-2-2-billion-funding-freeze/articleshow/120397391.cms,"Trump calls Harvard University 'a disgrace'

‘A disgrace’: Donald Trump hits out at Harvard University

US President Donald Trump intensified his administration’s ongoing clash with Harvard University on Thursday, labeling the Ivy League institution “a disgrace” as federal agencies take unprecedented steps against its funding, tax status, and ability to host international students.Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Trump delivered a scathing rebuke of the university, citing what he called its failure to uphold American values. “I think Harvard’s a disgrace,” Trump said calling them ""obviously antisemitic"".Further talking about the reports that the Internal Revenue Service was planning to remove Harvard's tax-exempt status, Trump addressing the press at the White House claimed to not know the status of their findings. He did not think a final ruling had been made, and indicated other schools were under scrutiny. ""I'm not involved in it. It's being handled by lawyers. I read about it just like you did,"" he said about the reports. However, talk about the exemption he said, ""Tax-exempt status, I mean, it's a privilege. It's really a privilege, and it's been abused by a lot more than Harvard.""Then naming other universities he went on to say, ""When you take a look whether it's Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, I don't know what's going on, but when you see how badly they've acted and in other ways also. So we'll, we'll be looking at it very strongly.""The scriticism came after the Department of Homeland Security formally ordered Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students allegedly involved in “illegal and violent activities.” In a separate action, the administration canceled two federal grants worth $2.7 million and froze over $2 billion in additional funding for research and academic programs.Read full story: Donald Trump administration asks Internal Revenue Service to strip Harvard of tax-exempt status over campus antisemitism Harvard, the oldest and wealthiest university in the United States, became a primary target after refusing to comply with federal demands to discipline student activists, revise admissions policies, and monitor international students for ideological alignment with “American values.”In an open challenge to the government, Harvard President Alan Garber declared Monday that the university would not submit to politically driven demands, citing constitutional protections. “Harvard will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” the university said in a statement.Earlier, Trump has also questioned whether Harvard should retain its tax-exempt status as a nonprofit, writing on Truth Social that the university’s actions may violate laws governing charitable institutions. While federal law bars the president from directly initiating an IRS investigation, officials confirmed that a review into Harvard’s tax standing was underway before his remarks.Former Harvard President and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers condemned the effort, calling it “an abuse of executive power,"" as quoted by Reuters.The administration’s aggressive stance has sparked alarm across academia, especially among international students. At Harvard, where 27% of students come from abroad, many expressed fear that their legal status is in jeopardy.“Harvard without its international community is simply not Harvard,” said Leo Gerdén, a Swedish senior studying economics and government. “We feel like targets, and it’s terrifying.”With tensions escalating and institutions like Columbia University following Harvard’s lead in defying government pressure, the standoff appears far from over. “This is not just about Harvard,” said democracy professor Archon Fung. “It’s about whether academic institutions can remain independent in the face of political coercion.”","US President Donald Trump intensified his administration’s ongoing clash with Harvard University on Thursday.

Watch: Italian reporter asks Donald Trump if he called Europeans 'parasites'; Giorgia Meloni reacts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-italian-reporter-asks-donald-trump-if-he-called-europeans-parasites-giorgia-meloni-reacts/articleshow/120396477.cms,"AP photo

During a joint press conference at the White House between Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni and US president Donald Trump, an Italian journalist asked Trump if he had ever called Europeans ""parasites.""The question was asked in Italian, after the journalist requested to switch languages. Meloni quickly stepped in and responded, ""No, he never said that.""She then turned to Trump and asked him, “Have you ever said Europeans are parasites? Have you said that?” Trump denied the claim, saying, “I have never said that. I don’t even know what you’re talking about.”A March 2025 article in The Atlantic cited leaked Signal messages from Trump administration officials that described Europeans as parasites in the context of discussions around airstrikes in Yemen.The awkward exchange at the press meet did not derail the leaders’ meeting, focused on trade and diplomacy. Trump, who recently imposed 20 percent tariffs on EU exports, said a deal with the European Union was “100 percent” possible. Meloni echoed that confidence and said she was sure they could find common ground. She invited Trump to visit Rome and possibly meet other EU leaders.Meloni’s visit marked her as the first European leader to meet Trump since his tariff announcement. She used the opportunity to underline their shared stances on immigration, defence spending, and cultural issues. “The goal for me is to make the West great again,” she said, mirroring Trump’s MAGA slogan.""Even if we have some problems between the two shores of the Atlantic, it is time that we try to sit down and find solutions,"" she said.But even as Trump sounded confident about reaching a deal with the 27-nation European Union, which he has accused of trying to “take advantage” of the United States, he said he was in “no rush.” “Everybody wants to make a deal — and if they don’t, we’ll go ahead and make the deal for them,” he added.Some EU members expressed concern about Meloni’s direct engagement with Trump, fearing it could undermine EU unity. France’s industry minister warned that individual deals might “break the current dynamic,” reported Associated Press.Meloni returns to Rome on Friday and is set to host US vice president JD Vance. Trump’s tariff threats remain a key issue, especially for Italy, which sends around 10 percent of its exports to the US.","Italian journalist asked Trump if he had ever called Europeans ""parasites"" Trump denied the claim, saying, ""I have never said that.

Power blackout hits all of Puerto Rico as residents prepare for Easter weekend,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/power-blackout-hits-all-of-puerto-rico-as-residents-prepare-for-easter-weekend/articleshow/120366069.cms,"Power blackout hits at Puerto Rico as residents prepare for the Easter (Source: AP)

SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO: A power blackout hit all of Puerto Rico on Wednesday as the heavily Catholic US territory prepared to celebrate the Easter weekend.All 1.4 million clients were affected, Hugo Sorrentini, spokesman for Luma Energy, which oversees the transmission and distribution of power, told The Associated Press. By late Wednesday night, crews had restored power to nearly 100,000 clients, or about 7%, although the number was expected to fluctuate.Hotels were near capacity, with thousands of tourists celebrating Easter vacations on the island. Tourism officials rushed to reassure them that many hotels and other businesses were operating with generators.Meanwhile, at least 328,000 clients were without water. ""It is unacceptable that we have a failure of this magnitude in the transmission of the electrical system,"" said governor Jenniffer Gonzalez, who cut short her weeklong vacation and flew back to Puerto Rico on Wednesday night.Officials said 90% of clients would likely have electricity 48 to 72 hours after the blackout occurred. It was not immediately clear what caused the shutdown, the latest in a string of major blackouts on the island in recent years.Thousands of Puerto Ricans were fuming over the latest outage, with many renewing their calls that the government cancel the contract with Luma and Genera PR, which oversees generation of power on the island.""This is a total disaster,"" said Orlando Huertas, 68, as he sipped a drink with a friend at a streetside bar and criticized the government for not doing enough to tackle the chronic outages.Dozens of people were forced to walk on an overpass next to the rails of the rapid transit system that serves the capital, San Juan, while scores of businesses including the biggest mall in the Caribbean were forced to close. Professional baseball and basketball games were cancelled as the hum of generators and smell of smoke filled the air. Traffic became snarled as police officers were deployed to busy intersections.Reggaeton superstar Bad Bunny echoed the collective rage, writing on X: ""When are we going to do something?"" The governor pledged late Wednesday that she would cancel the contract with Luma, but noted that while government officials have started analyzing the contract and finding possible replacements, it wouldn't be a quick process.Gonzalez also said that she has requested an in-depth investigation into the blackout, noting that officials already have warned there won't be enough generation of power for this summer, when demand peaks. ""Puerto Rico can't be the island where the power goes out all the time,"" Gonzalez said. ""We're going to take action. Let people have no doubts.""While power restoration on the main island of Puerto Rico was moving slowly to protect equipment, emergency generation stations restored power to the tiny neighboring island of Culebra and parts of neighboring Vieques, said Josue Colon, the island's so-called energy czar and former executive director of Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority.Those without generators crowded around grocery stores and other businesses to buy ice across Puerto Rico. ""I'm desperate. My generator is broken,"" said Carmen Suriel, who worried about the impact of the blackout on her two children, a six-month-old and a five-year-old with Down syndrome, as the temperature rose across Puerto Rico on Wednesday.Alma Ramirez, 69, said she was frustrated with the constant outages, some of which had already damaged her TV and microwave, forcing her to buy new appliances. ""They have to improve,"" she said of the government. ""Those who are affected are us, the poor.""The island of 3.2 million residents has a more than 40 per cent poverty rate, and not everyone can afford solar panels or generators. While there was a push to use more renewable energy sources under the administration of former US President Joe Biden, which provided Puerto Rico with mega generators and other resources, experts worry that won't happen under U.S. President Donald Trump.Roughly 117,000 homes and businesses on the island have solar rooftops. Meanwhile, petroleum-fired power plants provide 62 per cent of Puerto Rico's power, natural gas 24 per cent, coal 8 per cent and renewables 7 per cent, according to the US Energy Information Administration.Daniel Hernandez, vice president of operations at Genera PR, said at a news conference that a disturbance hit the transmission system shortly after noon on Wednesday, during a time when the grid is vulnerable because there are not many machines regulating frequency at that hour.Veronica Ferraiuoli, acting governor and secretary of state for Puerto Rico, said the White House reached out to local officials and said they are available if needed. Pablo Jose Hernandez, Puerto Rico's representative in Congress, said he would work to ensure that ""Washington understands the real and urgent situation Puerto Ricans face every day.""""The electric grid crisis is frustrating, and after years of blackouts, it feels like it's going from bad to worse,"" he said. The last islandwide blackout occurred on New Year's Eve.Puerto Rico has struggled with chronic outages since September 2017 when hurricane Maria pummeled the island as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing a power grid that crews are still struggling to rebuild. The grid already had been deteriorating as a result of decades of a lack of maintenance and investment under Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority, which is struggling to restructure more than $9 billion in debt.","All 1.4 million clients were affected, spokesman for Luma Energy said.

Chicago shooting in Lincoln Park leaves man dead; 2 seen fleeing scene

Kevin Patel, a 28-year-old man, was shot and killed in Chicago’s Lincoln Park neighbourhood on Wednesday night.According to the Chicago police department, the shooting happened around 9:20 pm in the 800-block of West Lill Avenue. Officers responded to reports of gunfire and found Patel lying on the sidewalk with a gunshot wound to the chest. He was rushed to Illinois Masonic Medical Center, where he later died. The Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office later confirmed his identity.Garrett Moores, a neighbour who rushed to Patel's side, described the desperate attempt to save his life. “I grabbed towels and ran down,” he said. Guided by a 911 operator, Moores and another neighbour tried chest compressions and worked to keep Patel conscious. “You almost build a personal connection in those moments. It was devastating,” Moores added, reported ABC 7 Chicago.The incident happened just yards away from 43rd Ward Alderman Timmy Knudsen’s office. He addressed the violence in a statement, calling it a reminder of the ongoing fight against citywide crime. He said he has asked for increased patrols and more support from City Hall, especially with summer approaching.Witnesses reported seeing a man and a woman running from the area shortly before police arrived. No arrests have been made, and Area Three detectives are continuing the investigation.","Kevin Patel, a 28-year-old man, was shot and killed in Chicago’s Lincoln Park neighbourhood on Wednesday night.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday softened his tone for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and said he does not blame him for the Russian invasion. However, he continued to criticise his leadership regarding the handling of the war.""I don't hold Zelenskyy responsible but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started,"" Trump told reporters at the White House during a joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. ""I'm not blaming him, but what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job, OK? I am not a big fan.""This comes days after Trump accused Ukraine of starting the war and blamed Zelenskyy for “millions” of deaths. The Ukrainian leader had earlier this week invited Trump to visit Ukraine to witness the destruction firsthand, during an interview with CBS. In response, Trump issued threats against the broadcaster.Meanwhile, Trump said a long-delayed minerals agreement with Ukraine was likely to be signed next Thursday. “We have a minerals deal which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday... next Thursday. Soon. And I assume they're going to live up to the deal. So we'll see,” he said.Kyiv and Washington had previously been close to finalising the agreement, but a heated clash in February between Trump, Zelenskyy and US Vice President JD Vance at the White House had stalled progress.Ukraine’s economy minister Yulia Svyrydenko confirmed on X that a “Memorandum of Intent” had been signed with Washington for an “Investment Fund for the Reconstruction of Ukraine.”While she offered no details, Svyrydenko said the memorandum marked significant progress.“There is a lot to do, but the current pace and significant progress give reason to expect that the document will be very beneficial for both countries,” she wrote.According to The New York Times, the memorandum, signed via video call with US treasury secretary Scott Bessent, fell short of a full minerals agreement. Bessent said a final deal was expected by April 26 and noted the deal could allow the US to earn up to $500 billion through access to Ukraine’s rare earth resources.Trump has framed the agreement as repayment for military assistance sent by the Biden administration.Earlier drafts of the deal reportedly included plans to redirect a portion of Ukraine’s resource revenues to fund postwar reconstruction, a clause critics have described as exploitative. The document signed on Thursday omitted such specifics, as well as references to US security guarantees.","US President Donald Trump says he does not blame Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the Russia-Ukraine war.

Van Hollen, who travelled to El Salvador this week to push for Abrego Garcia’s release, said he met the detainee on Thursday and called his wife to “pass along his message of love.” Earlier that day, Van Hollen said he was denied access to the high-security CECOT prison, where he believes Abrego Garcia had been held.“They stopped us because they are under orders not to allow us to proceed,” the senator said, describing how soldiers turned his vehicle away just kilometres from the facility.The Trump administration acknowledged the deportation as a “mistake” and the US Supreme Court has urged officials to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return. However, El Salvador’s Vice President Félix Ulloa reportedly told Van Hollen that their government has no intention of sending him back.Meanwhile, human rights groups have accused President Bukele’s administration of mistreating detainees in the country’s sprawling gang prison system. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national and former Maryland resident, has not been charged with any crime in the US , though Trump officials have claimed he has ties to the MS-13 gang — allegations his lawyers say remain unsubstantiated.“This is about due process and the rule of law,” Van Hollen said. “We won’t give up until Kilmar has his due process rights respected.”The senator’s visit has deepened partisan tensions back home. While Democrats argue the deportation exemplifies the Trump administration’s disregard for court orders, Republicans have rallied around the crackdown. GOP lawmakers, including Rep. Riley Moore of West Virginia and Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, have toured the CECOT prison in support of Trump's immigration policy. Moore wrote on social media that the facility “houses the country’s most brutal criminals,” while Smith praised Trump for its expansion to include “illegal immigrants who broke into our country and committed violent acts against Americans.”More Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, are reportedly planning similar visits. Since March, El Salvador has received over 200 deportees from the US , many accused of gang affiliations, and detained them in the controversial maximum-security prison outside San Salvador.Court documents show the US government has repeatedly declined to disclose its plans for Abrego Garcia’s repatriation, further fuelling legal battles and international scrutiny over the case.","El Salvador President Nayib Bukele posted photos of Kilmar Abrego Garcia sipping margaritas with US Senator Chris Van Hollen.

Trump: ‘The gun doesn’t do the shooting, the people do’

United States' president Donald Trump responded on Thursday to the shooting at Florida State University that left two people dead and six others injured, calling it “terrible” and a “shame.” However, he stood firm on his long-held position against tightening gun laws .Speaking to reporters, Trump said, “These things are terrible. But the gun doesn’t do the shooting, the people do.”When asked whether stricter gun laws would be considered in light of the attack, Trump said he remained committed to protecting the second amendment. The second amendment to the United States constitution protects the right to keep and bear arms.“As far as legislation is concerned, this has been going on for a long time,” he said. “I have an obligation to protect the second amendment. I ran on the second amendment… and I will always protect the second amendment,” said Trump.The shooting, which took place on the Florida State University campus in Tallahassee on Thursday, left two dead and six injured.

That rule was overturned by the supreme court in 2024.In February this year, Trump signed an executive order directing attorney eneral Pam Bondi to examine the rollback of Biden-era gun regulations.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives currently lacks a permanent director.

US President Donald Trump said on Thursday the United States and China were in talks on tariffs. He expressed confidence that the countries, the world's two largest economies, would reach a deal to end what has been a bitter trade war .""Yeah, we're talking to China. I would say they have reached out a number of times,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, news agency AFP reported.The US leader also revealed the two sides had been in talks since he upped tariffs on China to a whopping 145 per cent, after Beijing retaliated to his sweeping ""Liberation Day"" worldwide levies, which he announced on April 2.However, Trump was cagey when asked if he had spoken directly with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, despite having dropped several hints in the past that he has.""I've never said whether or not they've happened. It's just not appropriate,"" he stated .However, on being pressed by reporters if Xi had reached out to him, Trump replied: ""You'd think it was pretty obvious that he has, but we will talk about that soon.""Trump's administration is locked in a war of sky-high reciprocal tariffs with superpower rival China, leaving world markets unnerved.""I think we're going to make a very good deal with China,"" he said at the White House earlier, as he hosted Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni for talks aimed at ending US tariffs on the European Union.","US President Donald Trump said on Thursday the United States and China were in talks on tariffs.

Some witnesses said the shooter was a white male with light hair. One student said she saw the gunman arriving in an orange Hummer and he looked like a ""normal college dude"".""I was leaving the union with my food. There's a road next to it and I was walking and this guy pulls up in an orange Hummer, and he gets out with a rifle and shoots in my direction.

Following the talks, Baloch paid courtesy visits to chief adviser professor Muhammad Yunus and Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain.

Baloch separatists kill 8 Pakistanis in Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/baloch-separatists-kill-8-pakistanis-in-iran/articleshow/120262403.cms,"ISLAMABAD:

Eight Pakistani car mechanics were shot dead in Iran late Saturday, sparking outrage and deepening fears that the country was becoming a hub for anti-Pakistan militants after Afghanistan.Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack in Sistan-Baluchestan province, escalating tensions between the neighbouring countries as Pakistan demanded swift action. The eight workers hailed from Punjab -- Pakistan’s most populous province -- and were killed at a workshop in Mehrestan district, near Afghanistan’s border, Pakistani authorities said.BNA framed the killings as retaliation against perceived Punjabi dominance in Balochistan’s economic and political spheres. “We will not allow outsiders to exploit our land and resources,” BNA said in an online statement, echoing long-standing Baloch grievances over resource exploitation and marginalisation. The outfit has aligned itself with the broader Baloch insurgency led by groups like Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif called the attack “barbaric”. “We demand the perpetrators be brought to justice swiftly,” he said, urging Tehran to act. Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to help the victims’ families and repatriate the bodies. Foreign minister Ishaq Dar issued a similar condemnation. “This attack challenges our sovereignty. We cannot allow our citizens to be targeted abroad,” Dar said.Iran’s response was measured but conspicuously vague. Ambassador Reza Amiri Moghadam condemned the killings as “inhumane and cowardly”, calling terrorism a “chronic plight” that demands regional cooperation. Yet, Tehran offered no concrete assurances of cracking down on groups like BNA, prompting scepticism in Islamabad.Thousands of Pakistanis, particularly from economically deprived areas, travel to Iran on a regular basis to take up informal jobs in sectors such as vehicle repairs, construction, and agriculture.In Jan 2024, nine Pakistani labourers were killed and three critically injured in a similar attack in Saravancity, also located in Iran’s southeastern border region. Like in the latest killings, the victims in that case worked in an automobile repair shop. These murders occurred at a time when Pakistan and Iran were attempting to repair diplomatic relations after tit-for-tat missile and drone attacks.","Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack.

The resolution also demanded an immediate halt to any plans or work related to the project until an agreement with all provincial governments, especially Sindh, was reached to ensure that the province's rights were fully protected and respected.While addressing a PPP rally in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh on the anniversary of Pakistan's former Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's execution, Bhutto said that the PPP had always fought for peoples' rights to water, Dawn reported.He said, ""The workers of the PPP have grown old fighting for the fair distribution of water."" Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said, ""Be it Musharraf's unilateral canal proposal, or that of the PTI founder, there is no forum where we have not taken up our struggle."" He stated that the IRSA report shows there are water shortages in Punjab also, Dawn reported.He said, ""If we take water from here (Sindh), it'll harm farmers in South Punjab.

Poll Do you believe that Pakistan is adequately prepared for earthquakes? No Yes

A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.Tremors were felt across many parts of the Valley, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or property damage. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometres, with coordinates of 33.63 degrees North latitude and 72.46 degrees East longitude.According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the recent earthquake struck at a shallow depth of 10km, increasing the likelihood of aftershocks.Shallow earthquakes are typically more dangerous than deeper ones because the seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface, causing stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and higher casualties.Pakistan, located on the boundary of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, is one of the most seismically active countries. The nation frequently experiences destructive earthquakes due to its position on major fault lines. Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and Gilgit-Baltistan lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir are on the north-western edge of the Indian plate. The collision of these plates makes the region highly susceptible to violent earthquakes.Earlier, Pakistan’s neighbor Tajikistan was also jolted by a 4.2 magnitude earthquake.","A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.

Poll Should the Pakistani military have a role in politics? No, it undermines democracy. Yes, they provide stability.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political landscape remains a battleground of competing forces, with the military, former prime minister Imran Khan, and the current govt under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif locked in a tense struggle.The interplay of US foreign policy and the Pakistani diaspora’s growing voice adds further complexity to a nation grappling with economic woes, security threats and democratic erosion.Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars. Convicted on corruption and state secret charges, the cricketer-turned-politician retains a fervent base, accusing the military and Sharif’s govt of colluding with the US to orchestrate his downfall.Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) alleges widespread rigging in the Feb 2024 elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secure power through a fragile coalition. PTI supporters, galvanised by Khan’s claims, have staged protests, clashing with the security forces and deepening the political divide.The military, longtime kingmaker in Pakistani politics, appears to have shifted allegiance. Once Khan’s backer in his 2018 rise, the army soured on him after policy disputes and his public criticisms of General Asim Munir, the current army chief.Analysts suggest the military now props up Sharif’s govt, a dynamic evident in legislative moves like the 2023 Pakistan Army Act amendment, which stifled dissent and empowered the armed forces. This hybrid regime – blending electoral democracy with military influence – has drawn scrutiny for undermining constitutional norms, yet the generals show no sign of relinquishing their grip.However, Shehbaz Sharif, re-elected in March 2024 as PM, faces a legitimacy crisis. His coalition, including the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and other smaller factions, struggles to address surging militant attacks, crumbling infrastructure, and an economy reliant on IMF bailouts.Sharif vows to mend ties with Washington but his govt’s dependence on military support raises questions about its autonomy. Khan’s call for an election audit, echoed in a letter to the IMF, threatens to derail these efforts as Pakistan awaits a critical loan installment.The US role remains contentious. Khan’s unproven claims of a Washington-led conspiracy resonate with a populace wary of foreign interference, a sentiment rooted in decades of strained relations. The Biden administration, while engaging Sharif’s govt, has maintained robust military ties with Pakistan, prioritising counter-terrorism over democratic concerns. This ambivalence has fuelled Khan’s narrative, even as US officials dismiss his allegations.Meanwhile, the Pakistani diaspora, particularly in the US, has emerged as a vocal force. Pro-democracy activists, many aligned with PTI, have lobbied Congress, securing bipartisan support for resolutions condemning elections irregularities and Khan’s detention. Over 100 lawmakers have urged his release, while some advocate sanctions against military leaders like Munir. This diaspora-driven pressure marks a shift, challenging the traditional US-Pakistan security nexus.As Pakistan teeters between chaos and stability, the military’s shadow looms large, Khan’s defiance endures, and Sharif’s govt navigates a treacherous path. With the US and Pakistani diaspora adding external weight, the nation’s democratic future hangs in the balance.","Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars.

Poll Do you support the call for a long march by Sardar Akhtar Mengal? No, I do not support it. Yes, I support it.

ISLAMABAD: A tense standoff unfolded across Balochistan on Monday as a shutter-down strike and widespread road blockades sparked by nationalist leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal ’s call for a “long march” from Lakpass to Quetta paralysed the Pakistani province.The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists, including women leaders of Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC), amid escalating clashes with authorities.Shops businesses and schools remained closed in cities like Quetta, Kalat, Mastung Khuzdar, and Gwadar. Mengal’s supporters blocked key highways, including the Quetta-Karachi national highway.The provincial govt’s deployment of containers, trenches, and police checkpoints at Lakpass, roughly 30 km from Quetta, stalled the march, forcing demonstrators onto rugged mountain routes.Reports of police using teargas and shelling BNP-M workers have intensified the unrest.Mengal, addressing a sit-in at Lakpass, accused the state of oppression and vowed to press forward. “The state may crush us, but we won’t bow,” he declared, signalling plans to escalate the march into province-wide resistance. The protest began March 28 in Wadh, Mengal’s hometown, following the arrest of BYC leaders, including Mahrang Baloch, during a crackdown on their Quetta sit-in. A suicide bombing near the rally on March 29 left Mengal unharmed but underscored the volatile stakes.Balochistan’s govt, led by chief minister Sarfraz Bugti, has taken a hard line. His spokesperson, Shahid Rind, warned Mengal of arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Act if the march entered Quetta’s Red Zone.Negotiations have faltered, with Mengal dismissing the provincial govt’s delegations as powerless to meet demands. BYC, however, rallied behind Mengal, urging highway blockades and strikes to amplify pressure.Analysts see it as a critical juncture for Balochistan, where grievances over state repression, enforced disappearances and resource exploitation fuel dissent. The shutter-down has disrupted public life, with Quetta’s land links to 12 districts severed for over a week. With cellular networks down and security tightened, the province braces for what Mengal’s supporters call a defining fight.","The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists.

Harvest seasons multiply

HUSSAINABAD: At the foot of Pakistan's impossibly high mountains whitened by frost all year round, farmers grappling with a lack of water have created their own ice towers.Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan, a remote region home to K2, the world's second-highest peak.Farmers in the Skardu valley, at an altitude of up to 2,600 metres (8,200 feet) in the shadow of the Karakoram mountain range, searched online for help in how to irrigate their apple and apricot orchards.""We discovered artificial glaciers on YouTube,"" Ghulam Haider Hashmi told AFP.They watched the videos of Sonam Wangchuk , an environmental activist and engineer in the Indian region of Ladakh, less than 200 kilometres away across a heavily patrolled border, who developed the technique about 10 years ago.Water is piped from streams into the village, and sprayed into the air during the freezing winter temperatures.""The water must be propelled so that it freezes in the air when temperatures drop below zero, creating ice towers,"" said Zakir Hussain Zakir, a professor at the University of Baltistan.The ice forms in the shape of cones that resemble Buddhist stupas, and act as a storage system -- steadily melting throughout spring when temperatures rise.Gilgit-Baltistan has 13,000 glaciers -- more than any other country on Earth outside the polar regions.Their beauty has made the region one of the country's top tourist destinations -- towering peaks loom over the Old Silk Road, still visible from a highway transporting tourists between cherry orchards, glaciers and ice-blue lakes.Sher Muhammad, a specialist in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan mountain range that stretches from Afghanistan to Myanmar, however said most of the region's water supply comes from snow melt in spring, with a fraction from annual glacial melt in summers.""From late October until early April, we were receiving heavy snowfall. But in the past few years, it's quite dry,"" Muhammad, a researcher at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), told AFP.The first ""ice stupas"" in Gilgit-Baltistan were created in 2018.Now, more than 20 villages make them every winter, and ""more than 16,000 residents have access to water without having to build reservoirs or tanks"", said Rashid-ud-Din, provincial head of GLOF-2, a UN-Pakistan plan to adapt to the effects of climate change.Farmer Muhammad Raza told AFP that eight stupas were built in his village of Hussainabad this winter, trapping approximately 20 million litres of water in the ice.""We no longer have water shortages during planting,"" he said, since the open-air reservoirs appeared on the slopes of the valley.""Before, we had to wait for the glaciers to melt in June to get water, but the stupas saved our fields,"" said Ali Kazim, also a farmer in the valley.Before the stupas, ""we planted our crops in May"", said 26-year-old Bashir Ahmed who grows potatoes, wheat and barley in nearby Pari village which has also adopted the method.And ""we only had one growing season, whereas now we can plant two or three times"" a year.Temperatures in Pakistan rose twice as fast between 1981 and 2005 compared to the global average, putting the country on the front line of climate change impacts, including water scarcity.Its 240 million inhabitants live in a territory that is 80 percent arid or semi-arid and depends on rivers and streams originating in neighbouring countries for more than three-quarters of its water.Glaciers are melting rapidly in Pakistan and across the world, with a few exceptions including the Karakoram mountain range, increasing the risk of flooding and reducing water supply over the long term.""Faced with climate change, there are neither rich nor poor, neither urban nor rural; the whole world has become vulnerable,"" said 24-year-old Yasir Parvi.""In our village, with the ice stupas, we decided to take a chance.""","Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan.

Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim. It said that the Taliban provided support to the TTP and that some attacks were launched from Afghan territory.As a consequence, the Pakistani government has urged the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan to act against the allegedly responsible criminals. Kabul, on the other hand, denies that the militants are in Afghanistan.","Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

He added, “We urge the Government of India and West Bengal to take all steps to fully protect the minority Muslim population .”The violence erupted during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act and spread across Murshidabad, Malda, South 24 Parganas, and Hooghly, with incidents of arson, stone-pelting and road blockades.On Thursday, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee criticised the Centre for what she described as weakening the coordination between central and state agencies. “Earlier, areas from 15 km of the border were under the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF). Now, that has been extended to 50 km by the Union home minister,” Banerjee said. “Previously, we used to have access to information about people who were coming to the state from other countries and the purpose of their visit.

(Thailand's Government Spokesman Office via AP)

BANGKOK: Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and the leader of Myanmar 's military government, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing , visited the Thai capital on Thursday for diplomatic talks widely assumed to focus on efforts to restore peace in war-torn Myanmar.Authorities said the talks would focus on humanitarian assistance following an earthquake in March that devastated Myanmar, and to promote the extension of a fragile ceasefire to facilitate aid delivery.Anwar also met with Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who said they discussed issues of bilateral interest, including development along their mutual border and how nations in the region can respond to the new tariff policies of U.S. President Donald Trump.There was scarce official news of Min Aung Hlaing's activities on Thursday, and he had not been seen in public.But the unusual top-level contacts and rare trip abroad by Min Aung Hlaing, as well as the involvement of former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, suggest a more substantive political agenda. Thaksin is serving as an informal chief advisor to Anwar, current chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian nations, meeting occasionally with the Malaysian leader on various issues.Thaksin, who is the father of current Prime Minister Paetongtarn and seen as pulling the strings of her government, has focused on back-channel diplomacy to end Myanmar's conflict.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government in February 2021, leading to armed conflict across the country.The United Nations last week warned that damage caused by the March 28 quake will cause food shortages and a possible public health emergency, worsening the existing humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, where the civil war had already displaced more than 3 million people.Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, a spokesperson for Myanmar's military government, said on Wednesday that the death toll from the 7.7 magnitude quake had reached 3,725, with 5,106 injured.Ahead of his Bangkok trip, Anwar announced that he would push for an extension of the soon-to-expire ceasefires declared by the Myanmar army and its foes, pro-democracy resistance forces and ethnic minority armed groups, to ease aid efforts.The U.N. Human Rights Office has accused the military of ongoing attacks after the earthquake, and independent Myanmar media and witnesses say the army has conducted numerous airstrikes and artillery attacks since the quake.However, some experts hope what is known as ""disaster diplomacy"" can turn the current ceasefires into a broader peacemaking effort where other have failed before.The 10-member ASEAN, to which Myanmar belongs, agreed soon after the army's 2021 takeover on a Five-Point Consensus peace plan, but Myanmar's military government failed to implement it. The regional bloc has since largely barred Min Aung Hlaing and senior members of his ruling council from its high-level meetings.Min Aung Hlaing's attendance at a BIMSTEC summit of leaders of nations in Bangkok earlier this month was a rare exception and drew criticism for legitimizing his rule. Thailand has been accused by the opponents of military rule in Myanmar of failing to pressure the generals to make any concessions that could end Myanmar's violent struggle.Thaksin claimed to Thai media that he met with Min Aung Hlaing during the BIMSTEC summit and urged him to engage in peace talks with resistance forces. He has said he met separately with ethnic minority groups engaged in fighting against the military.Critics of the military government said Min Aung Hlaing's visit to Bangkok is not aimed at ensuring that aid is delivered based on actual needs.""Rather than supporting the people of Myanmar, these actions risk legitimizing the illegal military coup and reinforcing the regime responsible for their suffering. Therefore, we firmly object to any such decisions,"" said a joint statement Wednesday by the shadow National Unity Government, the country's leading resistance group, and other groups battling the military government.Opponents of the army accuse it of weaponizing aid, and say foreign humanitarian assistance should be delivered outside military channels.","Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and the leader of Myanmar's military government, Senior Gen.

The government doesn't want to jeopardise diplomatic ties,"" the officer added.Saudi Arabia is a constant donor of financial and humanitarian aid to Bangladesh and its more than two million Bangladeshi workers are the largest cohort of foreign labourers in the kingdom.Alam appeared without legal counsel during a court hearing on Thursday and rejected the allegation brought against her, urging her arrest to be nullified.The Daily Star newspaper reported Alam as saying she had been contacted by the diplomat, who had asked her to commence a relationship.Her father, Badrul Alam, has also said ""the ambassador and Meghna were in a relationship"".""My daughter refused his marriage proposal because he already has a wife and children,"" he told AFP following the arrest.The Saudi embassy in Dhaka did not respond to queries Thursday.Police said after Alam's arrest on April 9 that the model, a former winner of the Miss Earth Bangladesh beauty pageant, had been accused of ""disrupting state security"" and ""prejudicing the country's financial interests"".Her detention under the Special Powers Act was criticised by rights groups.""We call on the authorities to either charge Meghna with an internationally recognizable crime or release her,"" Amnesty International wrote Friday on social media platform X.","Meghna Alam, 30, was initially held without charge under the South Asian nation's controversial law.

'Power of a woman'

KANDALAMA: Time for the daily staff meeting at Sri Lanka's Hotel Amba Yaalu where woman manager Jeewanthi Adhikari jokes: ""This won't look very serious, there are only girls around the table.""The hotel, on the shores of Lake Kandalama in the green hills of central Sri Lanka, opened in January with a unique selling point -- its staff are exclusively women.It is a first in the country, designed to promote women in a tourism sector where men hold up to 90 percent of hotel jobs.""The chairman wanted to start a new hotel with a new concept,"" said Adhikari.She explained how the idea sprouted from twin blows that hammered the island's tourism industry -- first Covid-19, then the 2022 financial crisis and subsequent political unrest that toppled the president.""It has been really a bad time,"" the 42-year-old said, noting that when there were employment vacancies, only men got the job. ""We wanted to give opportunity and attract more women.""Owner Chandra Wickramasinghe, president of the Thema Collection group which runs 14 hotels, said he wanted to showcase what women can do if given the chance.""Unfortunately, in Sri Lanka in the hotels, there is no gender equality,"" he said.The blame rests on a mix of factors -- lack of training, a culture where women are seen first and foremost as mothers, and very low wages which lead to the perception that women may as well stay at home.""In our men's society, when it comes to women working in hotels, it's one nice girl in the reception and housekeepers to clean,"" he said.""I wanted to go a little bit further.""For the 33 rooms of the Amba Yaalu -- meaning ""best friend"" in the island's Sinhala language -- a team of 75 women handle every task, including those traditionally seen as for men.They are enthusiastic, like maintenance worker Hansika Rajapaksa.""People think it's difficult for women to be involved in maintenance,"" the 28-year-old said.""But after coming here and undergoing training, we also can carry out the work that is expected of us without any difficulty"".Meanwhile, Dilhani, who gave only her first name, feels confident in her role as a security officer after 15 years in the army.""I have experienced war... I have manned roadblocks,"" she said. ""With that experience, it is very easy to do our work here.""Others want to set an example.""This a good opportunity for women to demonstrate their talents, to showcase our skills and courage to the new generations"", said 23-year-old chef Upeka Ekanayake.Old habits were initially hard to break, manager Adhikari said.""Our experienced staff were used to working around male colleagues,"" she said. ""Automatically, they waited for someone else to do things, because that is how they had been trained.""But the owner said he shrugged off the doubts of colleagues.""Some people didn't believe in it,"" said owner Wickramasinghe, who dismissed the misogynists who scoffed that an all-women team would just ""start gossiping"".The hotel has been welcomed as an ""excellent initiative"" by Nalin Jayasundera, president of the association of tour operators.""We want to encourage even more women to join the tourism industry,"" he said, adding it made a ""very good impression on our customers"".Clients have taken notice.""I felt like I could speak up and answer questions ahead of my partner without them looking to him for confirmation,"" one Canadian tourist wrote in a review on a booking website.Women's rights activist Nimalka Fernando said the initiative was ""really path-breaking for Sri Lankan society"".While she noted Sri Lanka was the first nation to elect a woman as prime minister -- Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 1960 -- tradition, culture and the labour market continue to block women's rights.She points out that women dominate the sectors that provide the country with its main sources of income: textiles, tea and foreign remittances.""Women are treated as an exploitable commodity,"" she said. ""The important thing now is to give dignity to female labour.""The Amba Yaalu is only the first step, acknowledges its manager, but it is making a change.""We have single mothers and mothers with two or three kids,"" Adhikari said. ""Here, they don't have to suppress what they want to do in their life.""Wickramasinghe sees it as a way to highlight the lesson he learned as a boy.""I'm inspired by my mother... she became a single parent with eight children,"" he said.""She was working in a hospital at the same time and she managed very well. So I realised the power of a woman... that they can do wonders.""","Hotel Amba Yaalu opened in January with a unique selling point -- its staff are exclusively women.

A moderate earthquake struck the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan early Wednesday morning, with tremors felt across parts of the seismically active zone.According to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS), the earthquake measured 5.9 on the Richter scale and occurred at 4.43 am IST, with its epicentre located at latitude 35.83 N and longitude 70.60 E.The NCS also reported that the quake struck at a depth of 75 kilometres beneath the Earth's surface.While there were no immediate reports of casualties or large-scale damage, experts remain concerned about the impact on communities already vulnerable due to ongoing humanitarian challenges.Afghanistan is one of the most disaster-prone countries in South Asia. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) has repeatedly warned that Afghanistan remains highly exposed to natural hazards such as floods, landslides, and earthquakes.According to UNOCHA, frequent seismic activity continues to damage regions with weak infrastructure, saying, “These frequent earthquakes in Afghanistan cause damage to vulnerable communities, which are already grappling with decades of conflict and under-development and have left them with little resilience to cope with multiple simultaneous shocks.”Afghanistan's susceptibility to earthquakes stems from its position on several active fault lines, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.According to the Red Cross, the Hindu Kush mountain range, where the latest quake occurred, is especially active and experiences earthquakes on a near-annual basis. A significant fault line also runs through Herat province, further raising the risk of future tremors.",A moderate earthquake struck the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan early Wednesday morning.

'Nothing in record suggests danger': US judge blocks Trump admin's bid to deport Columbia University student,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/columbia-protest-trump-crackdown-on-protests-judge-blocks-bid-to-deport-columbia-student/articleshow/119510111.cms,"A US judge blocked the Trump government's order to detain and deport a Columbia University student, as President Donald Trump escalated his crackdown on foreign students linked to pro-Palestinian demonstrations.At an emergency hearing held on Tuesday, Manhattan judge Naomi Buchwald issued a temporary restraining order halting the government’s efforts to locate and deport a 21 year old student Yunseo Chung.""Defendants-respondents are enjoined from detaining the plaintiff-petitioner pending further order of this Court,"" Buchwald ruled, quoted by AFP.“I don’t think there is any evidence in the record that she would be a danger to the community,” Buchwald said in court before issuing the ruling.“The notion of putting this 21-year-old, who nothing in the record suggests is a danger … into ICE detention … is not a particularly appealing result,” the she said, quoted by the New York Post.Chung, a South Korean citizen and US permanent resident, was targeted by immigration authorities under the same measures that were used to detain Columbia graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, who is now facing deportation.The government argued that both students undermined US foreign policy, a charge that allows the secretary of state to expel non-citizens.Chung, who has reportedly been in hiding, filed a lawsuit against the government on Monday, arguing that immigration laws were being misused to suppress political speech.""Immigration enforcement -- here, immigration detention and threatened deportation -- may not be used as a tool to punish noncitizen speakers who express political views disfavored by the current administration."" her legal team said.""As of today, Yunseo Chung no longer has to fear and live in fear of ICE coming to her doorstep and abducting her in the night,"" Chung attorney Ramzi Kassem said, referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).According to her lawyers, Columbia's public safety department informed Chung that homeland security agents were seeking her arrest. Federal agents also searched two Columbia-owned residences on 13 March in connection with her case, they said.Legal challenges against Trump’s crackdownThe Trump administration has made Columbia University a central focus of its crackdown, cutting $400 million in federal funding on the grounds that the school failed to protect Jewish students from alleged harassment. Trump has framed pro-Palestinian campus demonstrations as antisemitic, while activists argue they are acts of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.On Tuesday, a group of university professors sued the Trump administration, calling its policies against foreign students and academics unlawful. The lawsuit, filed by the American association of university professors and the American federation of teachers, also seeks to reverse the funding cuts to Columbia.""The policy prevents or impedes Plaintiffs' US citizen members from hearing from, and associating with, their non-citizen students and colleagues,"" the lawsuit read.The Ivy league university responded by introducing measures to address antisemitism and regulate protests, but the administration has stopped short of fully meeting Trump’s demands.Khalil, who played a prominent role in leading student negotiations with university authorities, remains detained in Louisiana while his lawyers fight his deportation. Chung, in contrast, was not a high-profile protest organiser. Her lawyers acknowledge she was arrested and released for ""obstruction of governmental administration,"" with the case still pending in the New York courts.Todd Wolfson, of the American association of university professors, warned that the administration's actions could have broader implications.""The Trump administration is going after international scholars and students who speak their minds about Palestine, but make no mistake: they won't stop there,"" he said.","A US judge blocked the Trump government's order to detain and deport a Columbia University student.

Stranded in ice cold Alaska lake: How did a pilot and 2 children survive the cold night,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stranded-in-ice-cold-alaska-lake-how-did-a-pilot-and-2-children-survive-the-cold-night/articleshow/119507538.cms,"A pilot and two children miraculously survived for about 12 hours on the wing of a partially submerged plane in an icy Alaskan lake before being rescued by the Alaska Army National Guard on Monday.The Piper PA-12 Super Cruiser had taken off from Soldotna on a sightseeing flight to Skilak Lake on Sunday but never returned. With no locator beacon on board, a desperate search began after a Facebook post urged local pilots to help find the missing aircraft.Among those who joined the search was Terry Godes, who flew his own plane over the rugged terrain of the Kenai Peninsula early Monday. As he approached Tustumena Lake near a glacier, he spotted what looked like wreckage.“It kind of broke my heart to see that,” Godes said.However, he could spot three people on the top of the wing as he got closer and to his amazement, they were alive.“They were alive and responsive and moving around,” he said, adding that they waved at him as he flew over.Godes immediately alerted fellow searchers. Another pilot, Dale Eicher, relayed the coordinates to authorities, as he was closer to Skilak Lake and had better mobile reception.The Alaska Army National Guard dispatched a rescue helicopter from Anchorage, initially planning to hoist the survivors off the wing. However, strong rotor winds made it too risky, especially for the youngest child. Instead, the crew carefully manoeuvred alongside the wreckage and pulled the three on board.Lieutenant colonel Brendon Holbrook, who led the rescue operation, said the adult male had suffered from hypothermia, likely after falling into the water, while the children were relatively dry.The team initially planned to rescue the three survivors off the wing, but the powerful rotor winds made it too dangerous, especially for the youngest girl, who was being tossed around by the force, said Lt Col Brendon Holbrook, commander of the Guard’s 207th Aviation Regiment. Instead, the helicopter carefully positioned itself alongside the wreckage and brought them on board.“They spent a long, cold, dark, wet night out on top of a wing of an airplane that they weren’t planning on,” Godes said.Temperatures had dipped well below freezing overnight. The survivors had only basic clothing suitable for small-plane travel, but nothing to protect them from the extreme cold and biting winds.“It was literally the best possible scenario and outcome,” Holbrook said. “That plane was in the ice with the tail refrozen. If that tail hadn’t refrozen, it would have sunk.”The cause of the crash remains unknown, and the national transportation safety board, along with the Federal Aviation Administration, has launched an investigation.Tustumena Lake, a vast 60,000-acre body of water about 130 kilometres southwest of Anchorage, is notorious for its sudden, treacherous winds. Meteorologists say the surrounding mountains and glacier contribute to unpredictable turbulence in the area.Godes, who knows the region well, described it as a “recipe for chaos.”“Even under what would be considered a benign or relatively weak pressure gradient, the terrain helps turn the winds around, and occasionally they get a little squirrelly,” said Michael Kutz, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.The crash follows a string of recent aviation tragedies in Alaska. Last month, 10 people died when a small commuter plane crashed into sea ice near Nome. In 2019, a midair collision near Soldotna killed seven people, including a state lawmaker.While Monday’s crash could have ended in another tragedy, rescuers say luck and a series of small miracles kept the pilot and children alive.“It's a cold dark place out there at night,” Godes said.","The Piper PA-12 Super Cruiser had taken off from Soldotna on a sightseeing flight to Skilak Lake on Sunday but never returned.

South Korean firefighters make progress in containing wildfires in southeastern regions

South Korea has initiated a full-scale nationwide response to combat lethal wildfires in the southeastern region, said the acting president on Wednesday.""This is a full-scale national response,"" the acting president Han Duck-soo said announcing the elevation of the national wildfire crisis to its highest level.Multiple fires erupted over the weekend, with casualties increasing to 18 as one substantial blaze devastated villages and destroyed a historic temple.A safety ministry representative confirmed to AFP, ""Eighteen people died in the wildfires. Additionally, six people were seriously injured and thirteen suffered minor injuries.""Arid and gusty conditions have impeded fire containment efforts. The president informed an emergency meeting that the fires were ""developing in a way that is exceeding both existing prediction models and earlier expectations.""Despite Tuesday afternoon's emergency evacuations, casualties occurred. The situation worsened overnight with power outages, communication disruptions, and blocked roadways.According to Han, despite thousands of firefighters being deployed, strong winds of 25 metres per second prevented aerial operations using helicopters and drones. He noted that changing wind patterns and persistent dry conditions highlighted the inadequacies of traditional firefighting approaches.Han announced ongoing evacuations to temporary shelters and government efforts to provide emergency assistance and financial aid to displaced residents.Rainfall expected later Wednesday might assist in controlling the fires.Reports indicate the Uiseong fire started accidentally when someone tending to a family grave site unintentionally sparked the blaze.","Multiple fires erupted over the weekend, with casualties increasing to 18 as one substantial blaze devastated villages and destroyed a historic temple.

"'This will end it, hopefully': Trump signs executive order to overhaul US elections",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/this-will-end-it-hopefully-trump-signs-executive-order-to-overhaul-us-elections/articleshow/119507432.cms,"Federal agencies to play a bigger role

Legal challenges expected

Impact on voting

US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday, aimed to reshape the country’s election process, introducing strict requirements that could majorly impact how Americans vote. The order mandated documentary proof of citizenship to register for federal elections and required that all ballots be received by Election Day.Trump’s directive accused the US government of failing “to enforce basic and necessary election protections” and called on states to work with federal agencies to share voter lists and prosecute election-related crimes. States that refuse to comply could see their federal funding reduced, the order warned.The move aligned with Trump’s long-running claims of election fraud, despite a lack of evidence supporting widespread irregularities. Since losing the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden, Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on mail-in voting, arguing that it invites fraud, though, without proof.The executive order effectively bypassed congressional Republicans, who have been working on the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, a bill that sought to implement similar voter ID requirements. While it is already illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections, Trump and his allies argued that stricter measures are needed to restore confidence in the system.However, voting rights groups warn that the proof-of-citizenship requirement could restrict millions of voters. A 2023 report by the Brennan Center for Justice estimated that 21.3 million voting-age citizens, around 9 per cent, do not have documentary proof of citizenship readily available. The measure could also create complications for married women who have changed their names, as seen in recent local elections in New Hampshire.Trump’s order directed agencies such as the department of homeland security, the social security administration, and the state department to share data with election officials to help identify non-citizens on voter rolls. It also instructed the attorney general to prioritise election crime enforcement, especially in states that refuse to share information with federal authorities.A major change included in the order is a requirement that votes must be both “cast and received” by Election Day. This could affect 18 states and Puerto Rico, where current laws allow ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted if they arrive later.Trump’s executive order is likely to face immediate legal challenges. The US Constitution grants states primary authority over elections, and while Congress has the power to regulate voting through laws like the voting rights act, legal experts say the president’s ability to unilaterally impose changes is limited.Colorado’s democratic secretary of State Jena Griswold slammed the order as an “unlawful” attempt to manipulate the system, adding that Trump is “trying to make it harder for voters to fight back at the ballot box.”Democratic Congressman Joe Morelle of New York called the executive action “immoral and illegal,” while prominent election lawyer Marc Elias vowed to challenge it in court, stating, “This will not stand. We will sue.”The order also directed the US election assistance commission to update its guidelines, discouraging the use of barcodes and QR codes in the vote-counting process. Many states, including Georgia, rely on voting machines that use QR codes to tally votes. It remains unclear how the order will affect such systems..Georgia secretary of State Brad Raffensperger welcomed the move, calling it a “great first step for election integrity reform nationwide.” Wisconsin Republican Rep Bryan Steil, who chairs the House committee on elections, also praised the order as a “welcome action to secure our elections and prevent foreign influence,” news agency AP quoted.Meanwhile, Trump ally and election conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell has already begun fundraising off the announcement, claiming it will help fix “sick elections.”Trump, while signing the order on Tuesday, said, “This will end it, hopefully,” and hinted that more election-related actions would be announced in the coming weeks.Trump's executive order comes as the Republican national committee launched a massive effort to probe voter registration list maintenance nationwide. The committee sent public records requests this week asking for documents related to voter roll list maintenance in 48 states and Washington, DC, asserting that the public should know how states are removing ineligible people from voter rolls, including dead people and non-citizens.","US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday, aimed to reshape the country’s election process.

JD Vance says 'I just hate bailing Europe out again'



Fist, American flag and fire



The leak of the US' detailed plan to strike Houthi targets in Yemen on an encrypted messaging app signal put the Donald Trump administration in a tough spot while defense secretary Pete Hegseth brushed aside the allegations and said no war plan was being discussed. Hegseth discredited Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg who claimed that he was mistakenly added to the group where the war plans were leaked.Apart from the massive breach, which the White House has not denied, the chats -- now viral -- revealed the true feelings of Trump officials about Europe.As the 'Houthi PC small group' on Signal started discussing the war plans, JD Vance said he thought it was going to be a mistake. ""3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.""""I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself.

But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this. Nobody else even close. Question is timing.

Mike is national security adviser Mike Waltz who said it will have to be the US that reopens these shipping lanes.""Whether it's now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes. Per the president's request we are working with DOD and State to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans,"" Mike said in between.Another aspect of the leaked chats that went viral are the emojis that were shared in the group after the US dropped bombs on Houthis.

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

US security blunder reveals Trump top team disparaging Europe allies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-security-blunder-reveals-trump-top-team-disparaging-europe-allies/articleshow/119505063.cms,"Donald Trump

The TOI Correspondent from Washington:

President Trump and top US intelligence officials raced on Tuesday to stem a growing scandal after a journalist was accidentally added to a group chat about air strikes on Yemen’s Houthi rebels in a security breach.Trump brushed off the leak as a “glitch,” while the CIA director and the White House intelligence chief both claimed during a Senate hearing that no classified information was divulged in the conversation on the Signal messaging app. The president also defended his NSA Mike Waltz, who added Atlantic’s magazine’s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to the chat by mistake ahead of the air strikes.Goldberg, subsequently wrote an account revealing how shocked he was to be included in the group chat, an inadvertent flub when Waltz likely intended to loop in US trade representative Jamieson Lee Greer, who has similar initials.Amid growing questions about why Trump principals were using a commercial app to discuss national security issues and why Waltz would have Goldberg, a journalist from a publication loathed by Trump among his contacts, the US president stood by his NSA, telling NBC News the breach was “the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one. Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he’s a good man.”As much as the security breach, the big takeaway for the rest of the world and the region was the Trump administration’s expectation that Washington would be reimbursed for its bombing of Houthis, ostensibly aimed at keeping the sea lanes open and secure. In the exchange, Trump aides disparaged European allies, suggesting they were freeloaders and discussed extracting reimbursement for the bombing.Vice-President JD Vance, who was among the 18 principals in the discussion, expressed reservations about the bombing and its fallout, but went along with the consensus, telling defence secretary Pete Hegseth, “If you think we should do it, let go ahead. I just hate bailing Europe out again.” Hegseth replied: “I fully share your loathing of European freeloading. It’s PATHETIC.”At this point, a person going by the initials SM (likely Trump aide Stephen Miller) intervenes to say the President has been clear that the US has to be reimbursed for the bombing. “Green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return,” he says, adding, “We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement.”“If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost, there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return,” SM adds. There is no mention of India, a major player in the region which also shares with Washington the goal of keeping shipping lanes safe and secure.The exchange was in line with Trump’s view that European Nato partners are not spending enough money on defence, which, in turn, discounts the fact that a victorious US pressured its allies to largely disarm in return for a security umbrella it would provide. A shocked Europe is now on track to re-militarise and not depend on US security guarantees under the Trump regime.Trump’s director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe — who were both reported to be in the chat — endured a stormy Senate Intelligence Committee hearing over the leak. “There was no classified material that was shared,” Gabbard told the committee. She refused however to comment on whether Signal had been installed on her personal phone. Ratcliffe confirmed he was involved in the Signal group and had the app installed on his work computer, but said the communications were “entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.”Democrats and national security pundits, however, jumped on the security flub, relishing the White House’s discomfiture and demanding Waltz and Hegseth resign. Brutal memes, including one showing Putin looking at his cell phone and telling his colleagues, “Wait guys...P.Hegseth is typing...” and “Txt STOP to opt out of update on war plans” followed. Hillary Clinton, who was crucified by Trump and his aides, including Hegseth and Waltz, for her alleged mishandling of classified info and threatened with jail time, had the last laugh on the breach. She posted on X: “You’ve got to be kidding me”.(With input from agencies)","Trump brushed off the leak as a “glitch,” while the CIA director and the White House intelligence chief both claimed during a Senate hearing that no classified information was divulged.

Trump defends reciprocal tariffs, says US ripped off by every country

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said on Monday automobile tariffs are coming soon even as he indicated that not all of his threatened levies would be imposed on April 2 while some countries may get breaks. At the White House, Trump told reporters he may give “a lot of countries” breaks on tariffs, but provided no details.Bloomberg and Wall Street Journal reported earlier that the govt was narrowing its approach to the broad batch of levies Trump has been saying for weeks would be imposed April 2.Meanwhile, Trump said the US would impose tariffs on autos, pharmaceuticals and aluminium in “the very near future”. Two senior Trump officials — treasury secretary Scott Bessent and top White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett — said last week the administration is expected to focus the much-anticipated reciprocal tariff announcement April 2 on a narrower set of countries with the biggest trade surpluses and high tariff and non-tariff barriers.Scott Bessent referred to these as ‘Dirty 15’, a reference to 15% countries, while Hassett told Fox Business the focus would be on 10-15 countries. Auto tariffs would come in the next few days, Trump said, adding tariffs on lumber & semiconductor chips will follow “down the road”.“We’ve been ripped off by every country,” Trump said, predicting that sectoral tariff and reciprocal tariff expected on April 2 will raise ‘rather astronomical’ amounts of money for US coffers, letting tax rates to remain low or come down.He said the April 2 announcement will be a ‘liberation day’ for the US economy. The tariffs are aimed at shrinking a $1.2 trillion global goods trade deficit by raising US levies to levels charged by other countries and counteracting their non-tariff trade barriers. Trump said in Feb he intended to impose auto tariffs “in the neighbourhood of 25%” and similar duties on semiconductors and pharmaceutical imports, but later agreed to delay some auto tariffs after the three largest US automakers pushed for a waiver.(Reuters)","US President Donald Trump said on Monday automobile tariffs are coming soon.

President Trump Stops by Meeting with U.S. Ambassadors

US President Donald Trump on Monday defended national security advisor Michael Waltz, as his administration faces intense scrutiny over the recent Signal text chain leak that inadvertently exposed sensitive war discussions to a journalist.Waltz has been under fire after a staffer in his office mistakenly added Jeffrey Goldberg , editor-in-chief of The Atlantic , to a Signal group chat where high-ranking officials, including secretary of state Pete Hegseth, discussed planned military strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen. Despite the blunder, Trump dismissed calls for an apology, saying that Waltz was ""doing his best.""""I don't think he should apologise,"" Trump said during a meeting with ambassadors. ""I think he's doing his best. It's equipment and technology that's not perfect.""He added, ""And, probably, he won't be using it again, at least not in the very near future.""""Our National Security is stronger than it has ever been. We have had very successful and numerous attacks on that area (Yemen). These are the people (Houthis) that shoot down ships right out of the water. They also happen to be shooting anything that is flying through the area. There was no classified information, as I understand. They used an app that a lot of people in the government and the media use. The Houthis are on the run; the worst ones have been killed. This should have been done a long time ago. They randomly shoot missiles on ships, and they make their own missiles. The Atlantic is a failed magazine and nobody gives a damn about it. He (Mike Waltz) is a very good man and he will continue to do a good job,"" he said while responding to a question on whether he will make any changes after the controvery.During the meeting, Trump asked the NSA to say something on the issue, to which Waltz said, ""There are a lot of journalists in the city who have made big names for themselves, making up lies about this President. We are looking into how this one in particular got into the room. The world owes President Trump a favour. Under Biden, global shipping was shut down. We have a National security team that was coordinating these efforts.""Goldberg, who gained access to the high-level national security conversation titled ""Houthi PC Small Group,"" detailed in an article how he inadvertently received real-time updates on planned airstrikes in Yemen.""According to the lengthy Hegseth text, the first detonations in Yemen would be felt two hours hence, at 1.45 pm Eastern time,"" Goldberg wrote. ""So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1.55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city.""While Goldberg's unexpected access did not compromise the military operation, the breach has sparked widespread concern about security vulnerabilities within the Trump administration.During the meeting, Trump also raised questions about the security of encrypted messaging services like Signal, hinting at a potential shift to alternative communication tools.""Are people able to break into conversations? And if that's true, we're gonna have to find some other form of device,"" Trump said. ""And I think that's something that we may have to do. Some people like Signal very much, other people probably don't, but we'll look into it.""He tasked Waltz with investigating potential vulnerabilities, saying, ""Michael, I've asked you to immediately study that and find out if people are able to break into a system.""In response, Waltz assured the president that White House technical experts and legal teams were actively reviewing the situation.""And of course, we're going to keep everything as secure as possible,"" Waltz said. ""No one in your national security team would ever put anyone in danger. And as you said, we've repeatedly said the attack was phenomenal, and it's ongoing.""","President Donald Trump on Monday defended national security advisor Michael Waltz.

Political fallout

White House response

US President Donald Trump revealed that a staffer in national security advisor Mike Waltz 's office mistakenly added The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a Signal group chat where senior officials were discussing plans for an upcoming strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen.""It was one of Michael's people on the phone. A staffer had his number on there,"" Trump told NBC in a phone interview when asked how Goldberg ended up in the high-level chat.Despite the blunder, Trump insisted Goldberg's presence in the chat had ""no impact at all"" on the strike.Goldberg published a firsthand account on Monday detailing how he was unexpectedly included in a Signal group chat on March 11, reportedly titled Houthi PC Small Group. The chat allegedly involved high-ranking government officials, including Waltz, secretary of defense Pete Hegseth, CIA director John Ratcliffe , White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, secretary of state Marco Rubio, and Vice President JD Vance.Signal is an encrypted messaging app used for secure communication. Within the group, members reportedly discussed details of the strike on the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, including its timing.""According to the lengthy Hegseth text, the first detonations in Yemen would be felt two hours hence, at 1.45 pm Eastern time,"" Goldberg wrote. ""So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1.55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city.""The accidental inclusion of a journalist in a highly sensitive national security discussion has sparked backlash from Democrats, with calls for Hegseth and Waltz to resign or testify before Congress.Trump, however, stood by Waltz.""Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man,"" the president told NBC on Tuesday.Speaking separately to Fox News, Trump reiterated that Waltz would not be removed from his role, calling the incident a ""mistake"" but maintaining that ""nothing important"" was shared in the Signal thread.The White House communications director, Steven Cheung, dismissed the controversy as another attempt by Trump's opponents to stir outrage.""From the 'Russia, Russia, Russia' hoax of the first term to the fake documents case of the last four years… at every turn anti-Trump forces have tried to weaponise innocuous actions and turn them into faux outrage that Fake News outlets can use to peddle misinformation,"" Cheung posted on X.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also defended the administration, saying on social media that ""no war plans were discussed"" in the chat and ""no classified material was sent.""""Jeffrey Goldberg is well-known for his sensationalist spin. Here are the facts about his latest story,"" Leavitt wrote. ""The White House Counsel's Office has provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.""She added that the White House is investigating how Goldberg's number was mistakenly added to the thread but emphasised that ""thanks to the strong and decisive leadership of President Trump, and everyone in the group, the Houthi strikes were successful and effective. Terrorists were killed, and that’s what matters most to President Trump.""","A staffer in national security advisor Mike Waltz's office mistakenly added The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a Signal group chat.

US Vice President JD Vance announced Tuesday that he would accompany his wife, Usha Vance , on her upcoming visit to Greenland , intensifying pressure on the autonomous Danish territory that President Donald Trump has expressed interest in acquiring.Vance, a vocal advocate of Trump's foreign policy agenda, said that he would not only visit US Space Force personnel stationed in Greenland but also assess the region's security situation.""There was so much excitement around Usha's visit to Greenland this Friday that I decided that I didn't want her to have all that fun by herself, and so I'm going to join her,"" Vance said in a video statement.His announcement comes in the wake of strong criticism from Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen , who labeled the visit by the US Second Lady as ""unacceptable pressure"" on both Greenland and Denmark.Usha Vance is set to travel to Greenland from Thursday to Saturday, where she will attend the country's national dogsled race in Sisimiut. The event has been largely sponsored by the US consulate in Nuuk, according to Greenlandic media reports.Since returning to office in January, Trump has reignited his push for the US to acquire Greenland, citing national security concerns. He has refused to rule out the possibility of using force, further escalating tensions.In his video, Vance emphasised the territory's strategic importance, claiming that foreign nations seek to use Greenland to ""threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and, of course, to threaten the people of Greenland.""Vance added, ""Speaking for President Trump, we want to reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland.""Trump has also recently suggested that Canada should become the ""51st state"" of the United States, raising further concerns about his expansionist rhetoric.The visits from US officials have sparked political backlash in both Greenland and Denmark. Frederiksen condemned the trip, saying, ""You can't organize a private visit with official representatives of another country.""Meanwhile, US National security advisor Mike Waltz and energy secretary Chris Wright are also expected to travel to Greenland this week, according to reports.The visit comes at a sensitive time in Greenland's political landscape, as parties continue to negotiate a new coalition government following the March 11 elections.As a self-governing territory of Denmark, Greenland has long sought greater autonomy from Copenhagen. The region holds vast, untapped mineral and oil reserves, though the extraction of uranium and oil remains banned.With Arctic sea lanes becoming increasingly accessible due to climate change, Greenland has drawn growing geopolitical interest from the United States, China, and Russia, further complicating the situation.","US Vice President JD Vance announced Tuesday that he would accompany his wife, Usha Vance, on her upcoming visit to Greenland.

In a tragic incident, ex-Yankees star Brett Gardener's son, 14-year-old Miller, died following a sudden illness during a family vacation at a Costa Rican resort. Authorities initially thought the cause of the sudden death was asphyxiation but they ruled out asphyxiation Tuesday as they said after examining the body, it was found that his airways were not obstructed. The twisting update raises many questions about the sudden death, but no foul play is suspected yet.Authorities earlier warned that finding out the cause of the death could take months as there is a huge backlog in autopsies because of the country's high murder rate.Gardner was found dead in a Costa Rican hotel room on Friday while on vacation with his family. His family said in a statement on Sunday that other members of the family had fallen ill alongside their youngest son.“We have so many questions and so few answers at this point, but we do know that he passed away peacefully in his sleep on the morning of Friday, March 21st,” Brett and Jessica Gardner said in their statement.“Miller was a beloved son and brother and we cannot yet comprehend our life without his infectious smile,” the boy’s parents added. “He loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends. He lived life to the fullest every single day.”“Our hearts are heavy, and the Yankees family is filled with grief,” the team said in a statement. “It wasn’t just Brett who literally grew up in this organization for more than 17 years -- so did his wife, Jessica, and their two boys, Hunter and Miller.”Hotel La Mariposa and Restaurant Le Papillon, where the Gardners dined while on vacation, tried to distance itself from the teen’s tragic death. “In response to misinformation on social media, we would like to clarify that the Gardner family visited our Le Papillon restaurant on Tuesday evening, March 18, three days before Miller’s unfortunate passing,” the eatery said, according to Costa Rican outlet Diario Extra.",Gardner was found dead in a Costa Rican hotel room on Friday while on vacation with his family.

He said his part of the conversation was “entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information .” Ratcliffe also said the inclusion of a journalist in a sensitive Signal group chat among Trump administration officials discussing war plans was “of course not” appropriate.The comment from Ratcliffe came as Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet pressed him on the CIA’s rules regarding the handling of classified information and whether those rules were followed in the Signal chat.“Does the CIA have any rules about handling of classified information? Yes or no,” Bennet asked, prompting an affirmative answer from Ratcliffe.Bennet then asked Ratcliffe whether he agreed with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s view of the journalist who reported on the chat as “deceitful and highly discredited.” Ratcliffe responded that he didn’t know the journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg, and didn’t have an opinion about him as a person.Editor-in-chief of the Atlantic Jeffrey Goldberg reported Monday that he had been accidentally added to the chat, titled ""Houthi PC small group,"" ahead of a U.S. attack on Iran-backed Houthi sites in Yemen on March 15.","CIA director John Ratcliffe acknowledged that he was part of the Signal group chats from which have been leaked.

They think he was treated very unfairly. And I looked at the records, studied the records, and he was a victim of a crime, as far as I'm concerned. So we're going to undo that… Congratulations, Devon,"" Trump said before officially signing the pardon.Archer, who was involved in business dealings with Hunter Biden at Burisma Holdings , was convicted in 2018 for his role in defrauding a Native American tribe.

Conditions for implementation

US offers concessions on Russian agriculture

Ongoing military tensions

Russia and Ukraine have reached an agreement to halt military strikes in the Black Sea and on energy infrastructure following negotiations mediated by the United States . The talks, held over three days in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, mark a significant diplomatic effort as US negotiators shuttled between delegations from both countries.In parallel statements, the White House announced that both nations had ""agreed to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea."" The agreement also includes efforts to enforce a ban on attacks targeting energy sites in Ukraine and Russia.While Ukraine has welcomed the development, the Kremlin said that the agreement on the Black Sea would only take effect after restrictions on its agricultural sector are lifted. Moscow has long pushed for the removal of Western-imposed limitations, particularly those restricting Russian access to international financial systems.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy acknowledged that it remains to be seen whether the agreement will be fully implemented but emphasised that it represents ""the right steps"" toward peace. He also indicated that discussions had included the possibility of involving third-party nations in monitoring compliance, Turkey for the Black Sea and a Middle Eastern country for energy agreements.As part of the negotiations, the US pledged to ""help restore access to the world market"" for Russian agricultural and fertilizer exports. Although direct sanctions on Russian agriculture were never imposed, restrictions on payment systems had effectively limited trade. Moscow has frequently accused Western policies of exacerbating global food prices, particularly in developing nations.Russia said that the agreement would only come into force following the removal of sanctions on the Russian Agricultural Bank and other financial institutions engaged in food trade, including their reconnection to the SWIFT international payment system.Zelenskyy, while acknowledging that he was unaware of the full details of the US decision, expressed concern that such a move might weaken existing sanctions against Russia.Despite this diplomatic breakthrough, tensions remain high on the battlefield. Ukraine's defense minister Rustem Umerov noted that specifics of the Black Sea agreement were still being finalised. He warned that if Russian warships moved from the eastern part of the Black Sea, Ukraine would retain ""the full right to exercise self-defense.""Earlier this month, Ukraine accepted a US-proposed unconditional ceasefire, but Russia declined, with Kyiv accusing Moscow of seeking to strengthen its position before engaging in peace talks.Meanwhile, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov gave no indication that Moscow was willing to agree to a broader ceasefire, instead prioritising Black Sea shipping. He also accused Western nations of attempting to ""contain"" Russia, drawing comparisons to historical figures such as ""Napoleon and Hitler.""","Russia, Ukraine agree to halt strikes in Black Sea, energy sites in US-brokered talks.

QUETTA: The Balochistan government , under the leadership of chief minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti , has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities , as reported by ARY News.In a high-level meeting chaired by CM Bugti, which was attended by the IG Balochistan and the chief secretary, the government announced that it would target individuals involved in anti-state propaganda and activism.According to ARY News, CM Bugti instructed all commissioners and district officers to act swiftly against any government employees suspected of promoting anti-state narratives or participating in activities that challenge the state's authority. The government's move appears to be a direct attempt to suppress activism and dissent within the province, especially among those critical of the state's policies. Bugti also confirmed that individuals involved in such actions would be placed under strict surveillance by being added to the Fourth Schedule for closer monitoring.ARY News also reported that CM Bugti directed all heads of educational institutions in the province to ensure the national flag is hoisted and the national anthem is recited regularly. Educational leaders who fail to enforce these directives are being told to resign, which signals a heightened crackdown on any form of resistance within these spaces.This renewed focus on stifling activism in Balochistan reflects the government's broader strategy to assert control over the region, including monitoring and potentially silencing any opposition to its policies.This comes amidst the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. Activists in the Balochistan region have frequently organised protests and campaigns, calling attention to the region's marginalisation.In response, governments have implemented harsh crackdowns, often leading to the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. These actions have sparked widespread criticism from international human rights organisations, highlighting concerns over the suppression of political expression and the stifling of peaceful advocacy for regional rights.","The Balochistan government has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities.

Who is Mahrang Baloch?



Growing Baloch resistance



Challenging the narrative



Balochistan, a region rife with conflict, has become a powder keg as Pakistan confronts a growing insurgency and resistance movement, most recently illustrated with the hijacking of a train by the Balochistan Liberation Army.The shock attack resulted in around 60 deaths and brought to fore the boiling deep-seated tensions between the Baloch people and the Pakistani state.Following the attack, senior Pakistan ministers and army leaders held a special meeting to address the country's worsening security crisis.The Pakistan 'establishment', referring to the army, also turned its eyes towards more legitimate forms of protest.Pakistan police recently detained Mahrang Baloch , a leading human rights advocate and symbol of Baloch aspirations, igniting further unrest.Pakistan views the Baloch movement with increasing alarm, fearing the rise of separatist sentiments and challenges to its authority in the region, particularly because of Balochistan's vast area and crucial borders with hostile countries like Iran and Taliban-led Afghanistan.The arrest of nearly 150 activists, including Mahrang Baloch -- recognised by Time Magazine as one of its 100 Next Emerging Leaders -- has sparked international condemnation and raised concerns about human rights abuses and the suppression of Baloch voices in Pakistan.Pakistani authorities arrested Mahrang on Saturday under charges of terrorism, sedition, and murder after a protest in Balochistan's capital, Quetta, resulted in the deaths of three protesters.Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.Her sister, Iqra Baloch, condemned her arrest, stating on social media that her visit to Hudda Jail was reminiscent of when she saw her father behind bars 18 years ago. “Back then, Mahrang was by our side. Today, she is not,” she wrote.Mahrang has been a key figure in protests against enforced disappearances. Her father, Abdul Gaffar Langove, a nationalist leader, was forcibly disappeared in 2009, and his body was found three years later in Lasbela district, according to BBC.Since then, she took the decision to fight against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Now, the 32-year-old is continuing activism despite odds thrown at her, which include death threats, travel bans, detention etc.In December 2023, she helped organise a major march to Islamabad calling for action against enforced disappearances, which was met with police crackdowns.Mahrang's family has also alleged that authorities have denied them permission to meet her in jail or deliver food.Support for the Baloch resistance, both violent and non-violent, has been growing, especially among the youth.Many have been radicalised by ongoing human rights abuses in Balochistan, where an anti-insurgency crackdown — dubbed Pakistan's ""secret dirty war"" — has led to thousands of enforced disappearances and killings over two decades.Voice for Baloch Missing Persons reports that since 2009, around 1,500 missing individuals have been found dead, often brutally tortured, while 6,000 remain missing.Human rights groups say extrajudicial killings are rising, but the military denies involvement.Faith in political solutions has also eroded after allegations of military interference in the 2018 and 2024 elections, which sidelined popular Baloch nationalist leaders.Pakistan has been battling a separatist insurgency in Balochistan for years, with militant groups targeting security forces and foreign nationals.Authorities have often pointed towards the terror activities of the BLA to justify brutal crackdown, arrests and torture of Baloch residents.A major part of the Maharang's movement, however, is based on peaceful advocacy, which observers say presents a challenge to the state's narrative.The province, which is also the poorest, accounts for the lion's share of Pakistan’s total landmass but only 6% of its population, has been a site of insurgency and heavy military presence for decades.Activists claim that Islamabad suppresses political voices while exploiting the region's natural resources.Human rights groups argue that her arrest is part of a broader crackdown on Baloch activists. Protests, often led by women, continue in various parts of Balochistan demanding her release.The Pakistani government has not yet responded to calls for transparency regarding the charges against her.The arrest of Mahrang Baloch has scaled-up scrutiny of Pakistan’s policies in Balochistan, with rights groups calling for an independent investigation into the recent protests and the treatment of activists in the region.","Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.

Growing worries about deportations

Calls for international help

They entered my home in plain clothes, conducted an intense search, and arrested both me and my young daughter, taking us to a deportation detention camp,"" she said.""We were kept there in extremely harsh conditions for two days and one night, and we were only released after providing guarantees and due to the pressure of human rights activists.""DW spoke to several other Afghan female activists, who are also living in hiding as Islamabad looks to accelerate deportations to Afghanistan.Jamila Ahmadi, 27, said many of her fellow Afghan women had already been sent back to Afghanistan and warned that their lives, as well as hers, were in danger.""My activism, especially my efforts toward women's capacity-building before the Taliban takeover, my reporting on Taliban crimes, and my involvement with the National Directorate of Security (NDS), has placed me in significant danger,"" Ahmadi said.""If I am compelled to return to Taliban rule, it would clearly be a certain death.""Many women's rights activists only sought asylum in Pakistan when the situation became untenable in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.""In February 2021, I was attacked, resulting in a broken leg, but my determination remained unshaken,"" said Ahmadi.""Again, in September 2021, we were brutally beaten by the Taliban.""Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades.But over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with Afghanistan has deteriorated.Islamabad is angry with the Taliban authorities over the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions escalate, concerns about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan have increased.Islamabad is currently carrying out a huge drive to repatriate the roughly 4 million Afghans who have crossed the border in the past four decades.Pakistan already repatriated more than 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year, according to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).Legal experts and refugee rights activists have criticized the Pakistani government's deportation plans, particularly when it comes to deporting Afghan women's rights activists .""Sending activists back to Afghanistan, where they are very likely to be subjected to torture at the hands of the Taliban regime, would put them in greater risk,"" Osama Malik, a refugee lawyer in Islamabad, told DW.Ahmadi said her health had been affected by the deportation drive.""Unfortunately, for more than a month, the Pakistani police have made life difficult for refugees, including issues with visas and visa extensions.

""The responsibility of hosting Afghan refugees should not fall solely on Pakistan, as other countries can also accommodate them,"" the official added.Qaiser Khan Afridi, spokesperson for the UNHCR in Pakistan, said the agency was worried about the deportations.""UNHCR is especially concerned for Afghans who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, single women, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians.""""In view of these mounting challenges, UNHCR urged Pakistan to continue to provide safety to Afghans at risk, irrespective of their documentation status,"" said Afridi.Maria Noori, a 34-year-old activist from Kabul facing deportation, called on the international community to intervene and save the lives of Afghan female activists living in fear in Pakistan.""Being sent back to Afghanistan would mean facing torture, imprisonment, or even death. The international community must understand that deporting human rights activists, particularly women, is a direct threat to our lives, and immediate action is needed to protect us,"" she told DW.The lawyer Malik criticized Western governments for their inaction.""It is unfortunate that none of the Western countries have stepped up to immediately allow these female activists to travel to their countries,"" he said.Noori explained that the lack of a legal status and residency documents poses a big challenge.

Laptops, monitors, keyboards, and other electronic equipment intended for investigative purposes were instead carried away by opportunistic looters.Videos circulating on social media captured scenes of individuals, young and old, forcing their way into the building and openly making off with electronic devices. A large crowd gathered outside, and despite the presence of law enforcement, the looting continued unabated. Eyewitnesses reported that FIA officials struggled to control the situation, allowing the ransacking to proceed unchecked. Amid the chaos, some foreigners linked to the scamming operation reportedly escaped.Sources within the FIA, quoted by The Nation, indicated that the agency had been aware of the call center's illegal activities for some time but delayed action while awaiting approval from senior authorities.

Muhammad Yunus claims 'spread of false information' to 'destabilize' Bangladesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/muhammad-yunus-claims-spread-of-false-information-to-destabilize-bangladesh/articleshow/119488827.cms,"Muhammad Yunus (File photo)

The Chief Adviser to Bangladesh's interim government, Muhammad Yunus , addressed concerns about the proliferation of misinformation since the interim government assumed office, noting a significant increase in rumours across various media platforms.In his address to the nation on the eve of Independence Day and Eid-ul-Fitr celebrations, he warned about deliberate attempts to destabilise the country through false information, as reported by the Dhaka Tribune. He cited examples of manipulated images and misattributed incidents being circulated to create social unrest. He said, ""To destabilize the country, false information is being spread one after another to confuse the public. Rumors are being spread through innovative methods, such as combining one image with another, creating photo cards with one event and passing off another country's incident as our own, causing a stir on social media. As the election approaches, this will only get worse. You all know who is behind this and why.""Speaking about the July uprising, he emphasised that its first phase had concluded successfully, with the second phase now commencing. He stressed the importance of remaining vigilant against rumours, saying, ""The first phase of the July uprising has been successfully completed. With the end of the first phase, the second phase of the uprising has begun. We must always remember that we are in a state of war. Rumors' are the most powerful weapon of the defeated forces against the July uprising. Whenever you encounter a rumor, you must trace its source. Do not ignore rumors.""""Many experienced military experts are working behind these rumors day and night, with unlimited funds invested. Their main goal is to defeat the July uprising, but we will not let that happen,"" he added.Meanwhile, in a separate development regarding technological advancement, Dr Yunus announced ongoing negotiations with Elon Musk's Starlink, anticipating finalisation within three months.Yunus also talked about internal problems of the nations, citing corruption as harmful. ""Just like the people of the country, the international community wants us to be free from corruption because they want to expand trade with us. Without eradicating corruption, business and trade will not progress. There is no future for Bangladesh without being free from corruption,"" he said.Further emphasising commitment to a corruption-free administration, Yunus stated they aim to ""keep the current government term free from corruption"" while ensuring citizens remain protected from ""corruption fostered by government patronage in the future.""Regarding politically motivated cases, he mentioned that ""6,295 cases of politically motivated harassment filed during the previous fascist government's tenure have been recommended for withdrawal,"" with other similar cases being addressed gradually. During his address, Yunus also shared a positive outlook regarding inflation control, anticipating a reduction to under 8% by June. He noted that ""In February, inflation dropped to 9.32%, the lowest in 22 months, and we expect it to fall further in the coming months.""He also accused the previous administration of misappropriating $234 billion over the past 15 years, alleging cases of money laundering, including one instance where $33.3 million was transferred to a child's bank account under the guise of educational expenses.","Muhammad Yunus, Chief Adviser to Bangladesh's interim government, addressed concerns about the proliferation of misinformation since the interim government assumed office.

Concerns are rising about potential martial law or emergency rule in Bangladesh , with discussions about military intervention becoming more prominent. There are reports on social media that the armed forces might act against the Muhammad Yunus-led interim administration amidst escalating friction between the military, government, and student movements.The reported presence of Bangladeshi Army units in Dhaka has intensified coup speculation. Intelligence suggests that military personnel from the 9th Division, based in Savar, are systematically moving into the capital. Media outlet IANS reported that security sources indicate the army's intention to strengthen its authority, especially in Dhaka.The speculations are being fuelled further by a video of the army chief from last month. Army Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman had expressed concern that Bangladesh's independence could be at risk if people continued their divisive behaviour and mutual criticism. ""I am warning you. If you cannot forget your differences and work together, if you engage in mudslinging and fighting, the independence and sovereignty of this country and nation will be at stake,"" he said. Further continuing his warning, he added, ""I am telling you today, otherwise you would say that I did not warn you. This country belongs to all of us. We all want to live in peace and harmony. We do not want conflicts or fights. We are working towards that goal.""Amid the widespread speculation, the army has, however, denied any such reports. Army Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman rejected these claims on Monday and called for calm. Speaking to senior military officials at the 'Officer's Address' in Dhaka Cantonment, General Waker praised the forces' commitment, expertise, and strength, highlighting the importance of not being swayed by false information, as reported by Daily Star. His address followed extensive overnight speculations about potential martial law or emergency measures amidst ongoing political developments.General Waker highlighted critical issues, including public safety concerns, the spread of false information, and provocative statements. Emphasising that ""the country and its people remain the army's highest priority,"" he instructed forces to stay alert whilst avoiding provocative situations.Additionally, amid the mounting speculations and tensions, chief advisor to the interim government Muhammad Yunus is scheduled to deliver a televised address to the nation at 7 pm today (local time) on the occasion of Independence Day and Eid-ul-Fitr, according to the Chief Adviser's Press Wing.","Concerns are rising about potential martial law or emergency rule in Bangladesh.

DHAKA: A fresh controversy convulsed Bangladesh on Friday after the National Citizen Party (NCP), launched by Nahid Islam - man who led the anti-Sheikh Hasina movement - alleged that efforts are being made by the ""army"" to relaunch the Awami League under a new name, "" Refined Awami League "", as part of an India-sponsored conspiracy.The allegations came on a day the army had to be deployed in Dhaka along with police in view of demonstrations by student groups and hardline Islamist organisation Hefazat-e-Islam to demand a ban on the Awami League. On Thursday, Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said there are no plans to ban the Awami League but individuals within its leadership will be tried for ""crimes against humanity"".In a Facebook post, NCP leader Hasnat Abdullah said the proposal for this ""Refined Awami League, led by Awami league members Saber Hossain Chowdhury, Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury and Fazle Noor Taposh"" was placed before him and two others on March 11 by ""the cantonment"", an apparent reference to the army.Referring to the last year ""July uprising"" that led to the ouster of the Hasina-led Awami League govt, he said, ""In July, your powerful movement helped us discard all prescriptions from cantonment and agencies. If you stand by us again today, if you join us on the streets, we will once again defeat this Indian conspiracy to rehabilitate the Awami League.""""We were asked to accept the proposal in exchange for a seat-sharing agreement for the next national election,"" Hasnat said, adding, ""at the cantonment, we were told that more than one political party has already been given this proposal, and they have agreed to the rehabilitation of the Awami League on certain conditions.""He did not tell who approached him. ""We were further told that those who will lead this 'Refined Awami League' will start publicly admitting to the crimes of the Sheikh family from April-May onwards, distancing themselves from Hasina while pledging allegiance only to Bangabandhu's Awami League."" The proposal, he said, was immediately rejected with the assertion that efforts should be made to prosecute Awami members.In Oct last year, ex-environment minister Saber Chowdhury was freed from jail after bail in all six cases filed against him, while Shirin Chaudhury & Taposh were not arrested.","National Citizen Party (NCP), launched by Nahid Islam - man who led the anti- Sheikh Hasina movement.

Khaleda Zia's party open to return of Sheikh Hasina's Awami League but with a condition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/khaleda-zias-party-open-to-return-of-sheikh-hasinas-awami-league-but-with-a-condition/articleshow/119309200.cms,"Former prime minister Khaleda Zia 's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has stated it has no objection to the return of rival Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League to politics, provided it is under a clean leadership. This statement comes a day after the country’s interim government announced that it had no plans to ban the party.BNP spokesperson Ruhul Kabir Rizvi said that Awami League’s political comeback should be contingent on its leadership being free from criminal charges.“There should be no restriction on Awami League's return to politics if it selects a leader who is not guilty of any crime, has not killed students, and has not misappropriated or laundered money abroad,” Rizvi said, according to news agency PTI.He further added, “We have nothing to say if the people accept Awami League after a swift trial of those responsible for crimes committed under their regime.” However, he warned against the return of authoritarian rule, emphasizing that democracy should determine the party’s future.Rizvi’s remarks came after interim government chief Muhammad Yunus assured a delegation from the International Crisis Group that his administration ""has no plans to ban the Awami League."" However, he clarified that individuals within the party accused of serious crimes—including murder and crimes against humanity—would face prosecution in Bangladesh’s courts.Yunus also indicated that Awami League leaders could be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) following a UN fact-finding mission that uncovered potential crimes during the July-August 2024 protests, which led to Hasina’s ouster. ""It is very much on the table,"" he said.Hasina has been in India since August 5, 2024, after fleeing Bangladesh amid mass student-led protests that brought an end to her nearly 16-year rule. The Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has issued arrest warrants against Hasina and several of her former ministers, advisers, and military and civil officials for “crimes against humanity and genocide.”The debate over Awami League’s future intensified on Friday as two student groups from Dhaka University—the Bangladesh Democratic Students' Council (BDSC) and Inquilab Mancha—held separate protests demanding the party be barred from contesting elections.The BNP, however, has consistently opposed banning political parties. Following Hasina’s removal, the Students Against Discrimination (SAD)—which spearheaded the protests—also pushed for Awami League’s exclusion from politics. Some SAD leaders later formed a political party, the National Citizen Party (NCP), which is advocating for the establishment of a ‘Second Republic’ and the abolition of Bangladesh’s 1972 constitution.One of NCP’s key leaders, Hasnat Abdullah, claimed in a Facebook post that there was a “conspiracy to rehabilitate Awami League” under a refined version, allegedly backed by India. He alleged that on March 11, he and two other NCP members were approached by military officials with a proposal to accept the “Refined Awami League” in exchange for a seat-sharing arrangement.“We were told that multiple political parties had already agreed to the proposal on certain conditions,” Abdullah claimed. “According to them, having several opposition parties, including a weak Awami League, is preferable to having a single strong opposition.”He said the NCP outright rejected the proposal, arguing that Awami League should face prosecution instead of rehabilitation. However, those who made the offer allegedly warned that SAD and NCP would have to bear responsibility for any political crisis resulting from their refusal.Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), a former ally of BNP, has also backed NCP’s stance on Awami League. JeI chief Shafiqur Rahman asserted, “People will not accept the rehabilitation of Awami League.”As political tensions rise, calls for accountability and justice remain at the forefront of Bangladesh’s evolving political landscape.",Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) says it has no objection to Awami League's return to politics. BNP spokesperson Ruhul Kabir Rizvi said party's leadership should be free from criminal charges. Interim government chief Muhammad Yunus said he has no plans to ban the party. But he said individuals within the party accused of serious crimes would face prosecution.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119309172,imgsize-23694,width-400,resizemode-4/119309172.jpg"

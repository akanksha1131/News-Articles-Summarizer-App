'Avoid Travelling To Iran': Russia Urges Citizens To Avoid Persian Nation As Trump Hints At Strikes

Airlines suspend services to Israel, Gulf hubs

US military build-up raises stakes

Iran protests, disputed death toll





A fresh wave of flight cancellations has hit the Middle East as escalating tensions between the United States and Iran raise fears of a wider military confrontation, forcing major international carriers to suspend or scale back operations across the region.Air France, KLM, Lufthansa and several other airlines cancelled flights to Israel and key Gulf destinations late Friday, citing a worsening security situation, as per aviation news network Air Live.The suspensions, many of which extend through the weekend, have stranded thousands of passengers and disrupted regional air connectivity.According to Air Live, KLM and Air France halted flights not only to Tel Aviv but also to major hubs in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.KLM said it cancelled all overnight flights to Israel and the Gulf through Sunday and remains in “close contact with the government” while reviewing safety conditions.Lufthansa Group restricted flights to Israel to daytime operations and extended its avoidance of Iranian and Iraqi airspace, while North American carriers United Airlines and Air Canada scrapped scheduled services to Tel Aviv for Friday and Saturday.As per Times of Israel, Air France and KLM have cancelled flights to Israel, Dubai and Saudi Arabia until at least Sunday due to “security tensions in the region”. Lufthansa Group had already suspended night-time flights to Israel until at least the end of January.Last week, Iran had temporarily closed its airspace for nearly five hours amid concerns over possible US military action, forcing airlines to cancel, reroute or delay flights. Several carriers, including IndiGo and Air India, had said their international services were impacted, while Lufthansa and ITA Airways confirmed they would bypass Iranian and Iraqi airspace and suspend night flights to Tel Aviv.Aviation risk groups warned that missile and drone activity in the region posed a serious threat to civil aviation.The flight disruptions come as Washington ramps up its military presence in the Middle East.The Pentagon has been sending additional US assets into the region, including an aircraft carrier group and thousands of troops, as per news agency AP.US President Donald Trump has said an American “armada” is heading towards Iran, renewing warnings over Tehran’s handling of protests and its nuclear programme.“We have a massive fleet heading in that direction, and maybe we won’t have to use it,” US President Donald Trump told reporters, saying the deployment was precautionary.The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and accompanying destroyers are heading towards the region and are expected to join existing US naval assets in the Persian Gulf and Bahrain.“We have a lot of ships going that direction, just in case… I’d rather not see anything happen, but we’re watching them very closely,” Trump told reporters.Additional US Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle jets and military cargo aircraft have also been deployed, while the UK has sent Typhoon fighter jets to Qatar in a defensive role.The geopolitical escalation is unfolding against the backdrop of a severe crackdown on protests in Iran.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it has confirmed the deaths of 5,002 people, including 4,714 protesters, during recent demonstrations, while noting that the actual toll could be far higher due to a prolonged internet shutdown, reported news agency AFP.Iranian authorities have given a much lower official figure of 3,117 deaths, a number rights groups have disputed. HRANA said at least 26,852 people have been arrested, while Norway-based Iran Human Rights warned the final death toll could reach 25,000.Iran has rejected US claims that pressure from Washington halted planned executions of protesters, with its prosecutor general calling the assertion “completely false”.","Air France, KLM, Lufthansa and several other airlines cancelled flights to Israel and key Gulf destinations late Friday.

The Diary of a CEO



The question Bartlett put to ChatGPT

“I thought it would be curious ’cause we now have this new alien amongst us called AI. I thought it would be curious if I went on ChatGPT and I asked ChatGPT the question.”

“I’m a normal person who earns $50,000 a year. I want to be financially free in the future. Give me a one-sentence answer based on all of the wisdom in the world taken from every expert in investing ever.”





ChatGPT’s response, and why it raised eyebrows

“I then asked another question. How do I earn more?”

Passive Income Expert: Buying A House Makes You Poorer Than Renting!

Skills, AI, and a changing labour market

When people ask ChatGPT how to get rich, they usually expect something vague or fantastical. What surprised listeners ofwas not that the question came up, but how closely the AI’s response matched decades of orthodox investing advice.During a recent episode of The Diary of a CEO, host Steven Bartlett, who is also a business owner and avid investor, posed a deliberately simple prompt to ChatGPT, framed around the idea of an “ordinary” income and a long-term goal: financial freedom.Sitting opposite him was JL Collins, author of The Simple Path to Wealth and a leading voice in long-term, low-cost investing. Often called the “Godfather of FI” (Financial Independence), Collins is also known for his blog, jlcollinsnh.com, and his best-selling book, which has guided countless readers toward financial independence.Bartlett framed the experiment as a way of testing whether artificial intelligence could distil decades of investing wisdom into something coherent. With Collins sitting beside him, he explained why he wanted to bring AI into the conversation at all.He then read out the exact prompt.Before revealing what the chatbot produced, Bartlett turned the question back on Collins and asked what his answer would be. Collins did not hesitate. “Avoid debt. Live on less than you earn, and invest in surplus,” a mantra that he had previously used to summarise the philosophy laid out in his best-selling bookWhen Bartlett then read out ChatGPT’s response, the overlap was striking. The AI advised: “Focus on saving and consistently invest in low-cost broad-based index funds like the S&P 500 while living below your means and allowing compounding to work over time.”The resemblance was so close that Collins could only laugh. “I should sue them for mining my book,” he joked, half in disbelief, half in acknowledgement that the advice was, in substance, sound. ChatGPT’s response mirrored almost exactly the core philosophy Collins has promoted for years: minimise costs, avoid debt, invest broadly, and allow time to do the work.Bartlett pushed the exercise further with a second, more open-ended question.Collins again offered his instinctive response first, saying he would tell anyone in that position to “develop your skills.”Bartlett then read out the AI’s answer, which urged people to “focus on developing high-demand skills”, to seek career advancement, explore side hustles, or invest in assets that generate passive income, such as real estate or dividends.What lingered for Bartlett was not the familiarity of the advice, but the uncertainty beneath it. He said there was something important, and unresolved, in the emphasis on “high-demand skills”.The conversation on wealth then naturally shifted to the future of work and how technological change could affect income and financial freedom.When asked about what “high-demand skills” might look like in the coming years, JL Collins noted that the landscape is already shifting rapidly. Programming, for instance, used to be one of the most sought-after skills, but in the age of AI, Collins observed, its relative value is changing. He joked that the AI chatbot he had just queried had seemingly “mined his book” for advice, highlighting the growing presence of AI even in personal finance discussions.Collins’ concerns echoed wider anxieties voiced by tech leaders such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who has repeatedly warned about the potential for job displacement as automation accelerates. Altman told The Tucker Carlson Show, “I’m confident that a lot of current customer support that happens over a phone or computer, those people will lose their jobs, and that’ll be better done by an AI.”The fear is not hypothetical. Reports from the BBC indicate that several companies have already attributed recent layoffs to the “new realities” of AI. Forbes projects that by 2026, more human roles may be replaced to cut costs.Microsoft has also published a list of 40 jobs it considers most vulnerable to AI, ranging from interpreters, historians, and mathematicians to proofreaders, coders, journalists, data scientists, geographers, and even radio DJs. The breadth of at-risk roles underscores the wide-reaching impact of AI across technical, creative, and analytical professions.Despite these uncertainties, Collins emphasized that the core principles of building wealth remain unchanged. Avoiding debt, living below your means, and consistently investing continue to be the foundation of financial independence, even as the labour market becomes increasingly unpredictable.","The Diary of a CEO asked ChatGPT what a normal person should do to become rich.

"Will Earth lose gravity in 2026? Viral ‘Project Anchor’ claim sparks panic, NASA responds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/will-earth-lose-gravity-in-2026-viral-project-anchor-claim-sparks-panic-nasa-responds/articleshow/127325068.cms,"Will Earth Lose Gravity in 2026? Viral Claim Sparks Panic, NASA Responds/ AI rendered Image

The viral theory and its claims

Project Anchor

NASA’s response: gravity does not switch off

“The Earth will not lose gravity on Aug. 12, 2026. Earth’s gravity, or total gravitational force, is determined by its mass.

The only way for the Earth to lose gravity would be for the Earth system, the combined mass of its core, mantle, crust, ocean, terrestrial water, and atmosphere, to lose mass.”

“A total solar eclipse has no unusual impact on Earth’s gravity. The gravitational attraction of the Sun and Moon on the Earth, which doesn’t impact Earth’s total gravity, but does impact tidal forces, is well understood and is predictable decades in advance.”

What the hypothetical video describes

What If We Lost Gravity for 5 Seconds?

Why the scenario cannot occur

Project Anchor

A viral claim warning of catastrophic consequences if Earth were to “lose gravity” for seven seconds in August 2026 has spread rapidly across social media, drawing millions of views and fuelling speculation about hidden NASA projects and impending global disaster. The theory centres on a supposed leaked document and coincides with a real astronomical event, but scientists say the premise itself misunderstands how gravity works.At the centre of the rumour is a claim that Earth will experience a brief “gravitational anomaly” on 12 August 2026, a date that also happens to coincide with a total solar eclipse . According to posts circulating online, the event would trigger mass casualties, atmospheric collapse and widespread geological destruction. NASA has rejected the claim outright.The conspiracy theory alleges the existence of a leaked NASA document titled, supposedly made public in November 2024. According to the posts, the document describes a seven-second loss of gravity that would result in “40 million deaths from falls”, long-term economic collapse and global panic. Some versions of the claim assert that NASA quietly allocated $89 billion (£66bn) to mitigate the damage.The theory gained further traction through short-form videos on TikTok and YouTube, with users linking the alleged anomaly to the upcoming solar eclipse. Many of those videos point viewers to an older explainer uploaded in 2020 by the YouTube science channel What If, which explores a purely hypothetical scenario in which Earth suddenly loses gravity.According to an email from a NASA spokesperson, the agency told Snopes in unequivocal terms that the claim was untrue, stressing that there is no scientific mechanism by which Earth could suddenly lose its gravity.NASA also addressed the eclipse connection explicitly:In other words, gravity is not something that can pause briefly and resume. It is a consequence of Earth’s mass, and losing it would require the planet itself to lose mass on a catastrophic scale.The YouTube video most frequently cited in social posts was originally uploaded in 2020 to the What If science channel. It lays out a hypothetical chain reaction if Earth were to lose gravity, even briefly. The video explains that people positioned along the equator would experience the effects most intensely, because the planet spins faster there than it does at the poles, increasing outward momentum if gravity were suddenly removed.From there, it imagines immediate physical consequences. Anything not firmly anchored to the ground, people, vehicles, animals, trees, would lift off the surface. Bodies of water would no longer remain contained: rivers, lakes and oceans would rise and spread into the air, creating what the video describes as mid-air flooding as vast amounts of liquid leave the planet’s surface.The atmosphere, the video suggests, would begin to unravel as well. With gravity no longer holding gases in place, oxygen and other components of the air would start drifting into space. At the same time, a rapid drop in air pressure would cause severe trauma to the human body. Internally, the planet itself would be affected. Gravity normally compresses Earth’s interior; without it, the core would begin to expand, placing enormous stress on the crust and triggering widespread earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.The scenario continues with the claim that, when gravity returned, anything suspended in the air would fall back to the surface at once, compounding the destruction and dramatically increasing casualties. The scale of harm, the video argues, would not come from a single cause but from a combination of flying debris, oxygen loss, flooding and simultaneous geological disasters.Crucially, the video presents this as a thought experiment rather than a prediction. It does not argue that such an event is physically plausible, a distinction that has largely been stripped away as fragments of the scenario circulate across social platforms without context.As NASA notes, Earth’s gravity is inseparable from its mass. For gravity to disappear, the planet would have to lose its core, mantle, crust, oceans and atmosphere, an event that would itself render any discussion of survival academic.The only real astronomical event scheduled for 12 August 2026 is a total solar eclipse. While eclipses affect how sunlight reaches Earth, they do not alter gravitational forces. The pull exerted by the Sun and Moon changes tides, not gravity itself.There is no evidence of a project called, no budget allocation tied to gravitational containment, and no mechanism by which Earth’s gravity could briefly “switch off” and restart.The viral theory, scientists say, reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of basic physics rather than a suppressed scientific risk.","Claims that Earth will experience a brief ‘gravitational anomaly’ on 12 August 2026, a date that also happens to coincide with a total solar eclipse.

NBA YoungBoy reportedly frustrated after Kai Cenat ignores outreach





DJ Akademiks has added new details to the ongoing drama involving Kai Cenat, NBA YoungBoy, and rumors of an alleged affair. Speaking on stream, Akademiks claimed that NBA YoungBoy personally attempted to reach out to Kai Cenat to clear his name after online speculation linked him to Kai’s ex-girlfriend, Gigi Alayah. According to Akademiks, Kai did not respond to the outreach, which has left NBA YoungBoy’s camp frustrated. They believe the rumor has continued to spread because there was no direct conversation to shut it down early, despite YoungBoy strongly denying any involvement.The controversy began shortly after Kai Cenat announced his breakup on December 27, 2025, posting online that he was single and stepping away from relationships. Soon after, unverified posts started circulating on X, claiming Gigi Alayah had cheated on Kai with NBA YoungBoy. The story quickly gained traction across social media, pulling multiple high-profile names into the discussion. Gigi later responded publicly, denying the allegations and stating she ended the relationship herself, never cheated, and had no connection to NBA YoungBoy.Akademiks explained that while he is not placing blame on Kai Cenat, the lack of communication has allowed the rumor to linger.He claimed NBA YoungBoy wanted a direct conversation with Kai to deny the allegations and stop fans from associating his name with the situation. According to Akademiks, YoungBoy’s team believes the timing of the rumor was suspicious and possibly planted, especially given how quickly it spread following Kai’s breakup announcement.The rapper’s camp is reportedly unhappy because the situation continues to affect YoungBoy’s reputation, even though he has denied the claims. Akademiks urged Kai to take the call, suggesting that a private discussion could help put the issue to rest. However, as of now, no reconciliation or public clarification between the two has taken place. Fans continue to debate the situation, keeping the story alive in both hip-hop and streaming communities.For Kai Cenat, the drama occurs at a time when he has been very open and outspoken about seeking healing and personal growth after the breakup. On one hand, he may have decided to keep quiet on the rumors; nevertheless, the fact that he is keeping quiet is a big part of the debate. As long as there is no direct communication and statement between all parties involved, one will know how rumor and drama can escalate online concerning popular personalities.",NBA YoungBoy reportedly frustrated after Kai Cenat ignores outreach to clear his name.

Khaby Lame’s $900M deal introduces AI-powered brand expansion

“Digital Twin”





Khaby Lame, the world’s most-followed TikTok creator, has reached a major milestone by selling his main operating company, Step Distinctive Limited, in a deal valued at nearly $900 million. The transaction was finalized on January 23, 2026, and is being described as one of the largest business deals ever completed by an individual social media creator. Through this agreement, the acquiring company gains exclusive commercial rights to the Khaby Lame brand for the next three years. The deal highlights how internet fame, when managed correctly, can turn into a massive global business with long-term financial security.The significance of the deal rests not merely on its scale but also on its implications for the creator economy. The brand of Khaby was created arguably through a string of short silent comedy clips that the whole world came to admire. Khaby’s simplistic yet relatable commentary on ridiculously complicated life hacks earned his brand the universal touch that spans the globe. What the current deal also demonstrates is that individual creators are now able to command valuations previously granted to the big studios.The value of digital influencers is now arguably one of the biggest things in the space of advertising and entertainment.One of the most important parts of the agreement is the creation of a hyper-realistic AIof Khaby Lame. This digital version of the creator will be used to produce advertisements and promotional content without requiring Khaby to be physically present. Brands can now run campaigns in multiple countries at the same time, even when Khaby is not available to shoot content. Industry experts say this solves a major problem in influencer marketing, the limits of time, travel, and personal availability.Also, by licensing his digital avatar, Khaby is able to make sure that his unique look and personality are alive and kicking 24/7 while his team manages it and approves the content. The AI maintains his signature silent humor to ensure the authenticity of the image. This is a lesson in scaling one’s brand quicker while minimizing the workload for the celebrity, a trend that may define how celebrities work in the future.In a broader sense, however, the deal is also a function of a larger augmented landscape where digital consolidation is a valuable business in entertainment. As legacy companies merge to simply stay afloat, Khaby’s deal is historic in that a personal human brand is being monetized to an unprecedented scale. As AI technology blends into personal brands, Khaby Lame’s nearly $900 million exit serves as a new global bar to measure where personal brands are headed.","Khaby Lame, the world’s most-followed TikTok creator, has reached a major milestone by selling his main operating company, Step Distinctive Limited, in a deal valued at nearly $900 million.

Utilizing parental control tools to block access to adult or harmful materials.



Preventing children from sharing sensitive personal data or the private information of others.

Looking ahead





In a groundbreaking move to protect the youngest members of society, the UAE has officially enacted the Child Digital Safety Law, a regulation that shifts the focus of online safety from tech companies directly to the home.Under this new legal framework, parents and legal guardians are now held legally accountable for the digital footprints and online activities of their children. This isn't just a set of guidelines; it is a formal recognition that the virtual world is as significant as the physical one.The United Arab Emirates has issued a new Federal Decree-Law on Child Digital Safety aimed at protecting children from online risks and harmful digital experiences. This law took effect on January 1, 2026 and represents one of the most comprehensive approaches to child online protection in the region. It applies not only to digital platforms but also to parents, caregivers and internet service providers.The move is part of the UAE’s broader strategy to make 2026 the “Year of the Family”, putting children’s well-being at the centre of digital policy and safety initiatives. The law outlines specific ""Digital Due Diligence"" that parents are expected to follow.It moves beyond simply checking a child's browser history and enters the realm of active prevention.Guardians are now required to ensure that children are not accessing age-inappropriate platforms, particularly social media apps that have strict 13+ or 16+ age limits. Parents must monitor for signs of cyber-harassment and take immediate action if their child is being targeted or, conversely, if their child is engaging in bullying behavior toward others.Key responsibilities under the new law include:Under the Federal Decree-Law No. 26 of 2025 on Child Digital Safety, the UAE has established a strict penalty structure to ensure that the ""Digital Due Diligence"" is taken seriously. While the law is currently in a grace period for full operational compliance, the legal framework for fines is already clear.Parents and guardians found in significant breach of their monitoring duties, such as allowing children under 13 to bypass age restrictions or ignoring evidence of digital grooming, face administrative fines that typically begin at AED 5,000 for initial instances of neglect.For more severe cases, the law integrates with the existing Wadeema Law, where ""digital abandonment"" can lead to much steeper financial hits. If a child’s safety is directly compromised due to a lack of parental oversight, fines can reach up to AED 50,000 to AED 100,000.Furthermore, repeat offenders or those who intentionally facilitate a child's access to harmful content may see these amounts doubled. Beyond just the money, the law empowers courts to mandate ""digital rehabilitation"" courses for parents, ensuring they gain the technical skills needed to protect their families moving forward.Staying on the right side of the law begins with activating parental controls across all home devices and ensuring that your children only access age-appropriate platforms, strictly avoiding the ""under-13"" social media trap. Make it a habit to perform a weekly digital check-in to monitor for signs of cyberbullying or contact from strangers, and always utilize the Safe Use filters provided by your UAE internet service provider.Most importantly, foster an environment of open communication where your children feel safe reporting suspicious activity, ensuring that your home remains a sanctuary of ""Mindful Digital Citizenship"" rather than a source of legal liability.","The United Arab Emirates has issued a new Federal Decree-Law on Child Digital Safety aimed at protecting children from online risks and harmful digital experiences.

The mounting Dubai hospital bill and why it matters

Road safety on UAE highways: Beyond one crash

Insurance gaps and expat realities in Dubai and other UAE cities

What this means for road users in the UAE





An Indian expatriate in Dubai is confronting an overwhelming hospital bill of nearly Dh400,000 (approximately Rs 1 crore) after a serious motorbike accident on Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Road (E311) left him with multiple fractures and ongoing surgical needs. The situation raises broader questions about road safety, healthcare costs and insurance coverage in the UAE.On the early morning of January 18, 2026, 36-year-old Avinash Sequeira, a freelance events professional and member of the Ducati Owners Club, was on a routine weekend ride with friends when the accident occurred near Liwan, close to his home. After swapping bikes, due to a radiator leak on his own motorcycle, Avinash was heading home at around 50 km/h when the bike lost traction on a gentle curve, causing him to crash.He sustained multiple fractures to both legs and his right hip, according to medical reports. Passersby called emergency services and he was rushed to Fakeeh University Hospital for emergency trauma care. Avinash has since undergone two major surgeries to stabilise his injuries, including the insertion of steel rods in his femur and hip and faces two more surgeries, including reconstruction of the tibia below his right knee.Doctors have estimated a long recovery, months of rehabilitation before he can walk again and possibly further medical care beyond that.Without medical insurance, the costs of Avinash’s emergency care and surgeries have rapidly escalated to nearly Dh400,000, a figure that has alarmed his family and friends. Avinash’s father, Sunil Sequeira, told reporters that the family cannot afford the expenses. They were alerted to his crash when his iPhone automatically sent out an SOS alert, leading to prompt medical attention but also to soaring hospital bills.This story highlights a growing concern among many residents in the UAE: the high cost of emergency medical care for those without comprehensive health insurance, a gap that can place families under immense financial stress after accidents or sudden injuries. In some cases, expatriates have shared on local forums that lack of insurance coverage led to difficult negotiations over hospital deposits or bills in the tens of thousands for relatively minor injuries.While each accident has its own unique circumstances, Dubai Police and traffic authorities have repeatedly warned about the risks of fatigue, conditions, and behaviour on major roads such as E311 and Sheikh Zayed Road (E11). In late 2025, Dubai Police issued a public warning emphasising the dangers of fatigue driving, noting that even healthy drivers can lose control if they are unwell or overly tired, leading to high-speed collisions and serious injuries.Officers urged motorists to take regular breaks and ensure they are fully fit to drive, especially on long stretches like those on E311 and other arterial highways. Additionally, authorities have cracked down on reckless riding and high-speed behaviour, warning that passengers’ lives and riders’ own safety are at risk when traffic laws are ignored.For example, Dubai Police have arrested bikers travelling at speeds as high as 280–300 km/h on major roads, enforcing fines up to Dh50,000 and impounding vehicles to discourage dangerous conduct.The Indian biker’s lack of medical insurance underscores a broader challenge in the UAE and other Gulf States: while employers must provide health coverage for many workers, freelancers and contract workers are not always insured, especially if they work independently or under short-term arrangements. This situation is not unique. Online community posts from UAE residents reveal frequent discussions about surprise hospital costs when people without insurance or with limited plans require emergency treatment, from fractures to emergency scans or surgeries.Lack of insurance can also influence where and how patients are admitted and how expenses are handled by hospitals. The Sequeira family has appreciated the medical care and the quick response by emergency services but the financial burden looms large. They say they are relying on community support and the solidarity of fellow riders and friends as they navigate the mounting bills and long rehabilitation process.This high-cost hospital bill story reflects several intersecting issues in the UAE. For residents, especially those who drive or ride regularly, having comprehensive health and accident insurance can mean the difference between manageable costs and overwhelming financial strain after a crash.Dubai and UAE traffic authorities consistently stress safety measures such as obeying speed limits, staying alert and avoiding fatigue, crucial on high-speed corridors such as E311. A crash like Avinash’s illustrates how quickly routine rides can turn into life-changing events. For many expatriate families, a serious accident brings not just medical bills but time away from work, months of rehab and emotional strain. Friends and colleagues often rally together but the impact is deeply personal and long-lasting.As Avinash continues his recovery and additional surgeries, the road to normalcy is likely to be long and difficult. His case has sparked conversation among bikers and expatriate communities about insurance coverage, road risks and emergency planning for anyone operating vehicles on UAE highways.With serious injuries and steep medical costs and without insurance, families like the Sequeiras can face daunting choices about treatment, finances and long-term care. For residents, the message is clear: stay safe on the roads, ensure proper insurance coverage and be prepared for the unexpected because in a split second, an enjoyable weekend ride can turn into a life-altering accident.","An Indian expatriate in Dubai is confronting an overwhelming hospital bill of nearly Dh400,000 (approximately Rs 1 crore) after a serious motorbike accident.

No outdoor loudspeakers this Ramadan: Saudi Ministry issues clear mosque rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/no-outdoor-loudspeakers-this-ramadan-saudi-ministry-issues-clear-mosque-rules/articleshow/127232745.cms,"No outdoor loudspeakers this Ramadan/Representative Image

Outdoor loudspeakers restricted to Adhan and Iqama





Circular outlines Ramadan mosque preparations





Iftar arrangements and facility readiness









As Ramadan approaches, Saudi authorities have reaffirmed strict rules governing mosque operations, with a renewed focus on sound discipline, prayer timing, and preparations for worshippers. The measures are intended to preserve the sanctity of prayers while ensuring comfort, order, and consideration for surrounding communities during the holy month.Minister of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance Sheikh Abdullatif Al-Sheikh confirmed that mosques across the Kingdom will not be allowed to use external loudspeakers during prayers throughout Ramadan. He clarified that outdoor speakers may be used only for the Adhan, the call to prayer, and the iqama, the second call that signals the start of congregational worship.The restriction applies to all prayers during the fasting month and is aimed at maintaining calm during worship, while limiting noise beyond mosque premises.The announcement followed the release of a circular by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance on Tuesday, setting out detailed instructions for mosque readiness ahead of Ramadan.The circular stressed strict adherence to official prayer times in accordance with the Umm Al-Qura calendar.It specifically highlighted the importance of calling the Isha prayer at its designated time and observing the prescribed duration between the Adhan and the iqama for each prayer.Mosques were instructed to organise iftar meals only in designated courtyard areas. The ministry also emphasised the responsible management of water donations to meet mosque requirements, while discouraging the accumulation of large quantities in storage facilities.Relevant departments were directed to strengthen the work of mosque caretakers and maintenance teams to ensure that facilities are clean, safe, and fully prepared for Ramadan. Particular attention was placed on women’s prayer areas, which the ministry said must receive the same level of care and readiness as other sections of mosques.According to the ministry, the guidelines are designed to ensure that worshippers experience a high level of organisation and care throughout Ramadan. Officials said the measures aim to create a calm, orderly, and spiritually enriching environment inside mosques, while also maintaining respect for nearby residential areas during one of the busiest periods of the Islamic calendar.","Saudi authorities have reaffirmed strict rules governing mosque operations.

UAE weather today

Is it really going to rain?

Road safety alerts

Stay Updated: Monitor the NCM’s ""Red"" and ""Yellow"" alerts before heading out on long drives.

Drive Cautiously: Be prepared for sudden fog patches on major highways like E11 and E311.

Outdoor Prep: If you’re planning a desert camp, ensure your gear is moisture-resistant to handle the damp morning air.





After weeks of clear, dry skies, the UAE is bracing for a change in pace as a weak low-pressure system moves in from the east.According to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), residents can expect a shift toward more unsettled conditions starting Friday, January 23, 2026.While the weather today remains fair to partly cloudy, a layer of cloud cover is gradually building up, signaling the arrival of a more humid and ""unpredictable"" stretch of the winter season.This atmospheric disturbance, influenced by a similar weak system in the upper atmosphere, means the desert's typical golden sunshine will be shared with patches of grey.While no severe storms are on the horizon, the pattern brings a welcome variety to the season, making it the perfect time to enjoy the outdoors before the humidity levels spike overnight.If you’ve been waiting for a reason to use your umbrella, the weeknd might provide a light opportunity. The NCM has indicated that cloud cover will increase further by Saturday night and Sunday, particularly over coastal and northern areas.There is a tangible chance of light rainfall during this period, especially over the islands and coastal regions.Temperatures are varying significantly depending on where you are in the country.Coastal areas like Dubai and Abu Dhabi are seeing pleasant highs of 19°C to 24°C, while internal regions might hit 25°C.However, the real ""winter"" is happening in the mountains, where daytime temperatures struggle to pass 16°C and nighttime lows have been recorded as low as 5°C to 9°C.Earlier this week, Jebel Jais even recorded a seasonal low of 0.2°C, proving that the UAE's winter ""nip"" is very real.Yes, but rainfall today is more likely to be light rather than heavy. The NCM’s forecast indicates that scattered showers might develop, especially over northern emirates and along the coast.In recent days, light rain has already been observed in parts of the country, and temperatures dipped slightly, a pattern consistent with weak cloud systems passing through.This does not currently suggest widespread storms or heavy downpours, just a gentle wetting rain that may interrupt outdoor plans briefly.One of the most immediate impacts of this weather shift is the rising humidity.Forecasters expect humidity to surge overnight and into Saturday morning, particularly in western areas.This increase often leads to mist or fog formation during the early hours, which can significantly reduce visibility for morning commuters.To ensure a safe weekend, residents are encouraged to:This change in weather serves as a reminder of the unique beauty of a UAE winter. For many, the arrival of clouds and light drizzle is a celebrated event, signaling the peak of ""Karak tea season"" and outdoor gatherings.While the seas remain generally calm to moderate in the Arabian Gulf, the refreshing winds, reaching up to 35 km/h, add a crisp feel to the air.Whether the rain hits your neighborhood or just teases from the clouds, it’s a time to wrap up warm and enjoy the rarest of desert sights: a rainy day in the Emirates.","The UAE is bracing for a change in pace as a weak low-pressure system moves in from the east.

A routine drive can now take an unexpected turn for vehicle and motorcycle owners flagged for loud exhausts. Instead of heading straight to a workshop, repairs will first need official clearance.In Kuwait, vehicle and motorcycle owners are now required to obtain official approval before carrying out exhaust system repairs, under a new mechanism introduced by the General Traffic Department. The move is part of broader efforts to improve traffic services, streamline procedures, and enforce stricter compliance with approved technical standards.Under the new system, repair permits will be issued by the Technical Inspection Departments to vehicles and motorcycles found to be emitting excessive noise or operating in violation of approved technical specifications. Once a violation is detected, owners will receive an official exhaust repair form, which allows them to proceed with repairs only at authorised workshops and dealerships.The mechanism is intended to speed up the repair process while maintaining regulatory oversight. After completing the required repairs, vehicle and motorcycle owners must return to the Technical Inspection Department for a follow-up inspection.This step is mandatory to confirm that the exhaust system has been corrected and now fully complies with technical requirements.Authorities said the new approach is expected to improve service quality, boost operational efficiency, and help reduce noise pollution on Kuwait’s roads, while ensuring that modified or repaired exhaust systems meet approved standards before vehicles are allowed back into regular use.","Vehicle and motorcycle owners in Kuwait now need official approval before carrying out exhaust system repairs.

A single digital gateway for all applications





How the process differs by applicant type





Where ownership is permitted and where limits apply





Why the law matters for the economy









The waiting is over. Saudi Arabia ’s Real Estate General Authority has officially announced that the law allowing non-Saudis to own property entered into force yesterday, January 22. With this, applications are now being accepted through a unified digital platform, marking a decisive shift in how foreign individuals and companies can participate in the Kingdom’s real estate market under defined regulatory conditions.All applications for property ownership by non-Saudis are being handled exclusively through the official digital platform, Saudi Properties. The portal serves as the sole gateway for submitting requests, completing procedures, and verifying compliance with the law’s requirements.The service applies to residents living in the Kingdom, non-residents abroad, as well as non-Saudi companies and entities. Each category follows a defined pathway, with eligibility checks and approvals built into the system.REGA has emphasized that Saudi Properties is directly linked to the national real estate registration system. This integration is intended to improve transparency, ensure legal clarity, and protect ownership rights throughout the process.The application process varies depending on the applicant category.Residents of Saudi Arabia can apply directly through the Saudi Properties portal using their residency identity number.Eligibility requirements are verified automatically, and the entire process is completed electronically without the need for physical paperwork.For non-residents, the process begins outside the Kingdom. Applicants must approach Saudi missions or embassies abroad, where a digital identity is issued. This digital ID then allows them to submit property ownership requests through the Saudi Properties platform.Non-Saudi companies and entities that do not have a physical presence in Saudi Arabia face an additional structured step. They must first register with the Ministry of Investment via the Invest Saudi platform and obtain a Unified Number, known as 700. Only after securing this number can they proceed with ownership applications electronically.The regulation allows non-Saudi individuals, companies, and entities to own real estate across various regions of the Kingdom. However, ownership in key cities follows a more controlled approach.Riyadh and Jeddah, along with the holy cities of Makkah and Madinah, fall under a specific regulatory framework based on geographic zoning. The detailed Geographic Zones Document that will define eligible areas is expected to be announced in the first quarter of 2026.Ownership in Makkah and Madinah remains restricted. Only Saudi companies and Muslim individuals are permitted to own property in the two holy cities, whether they reside inside or outside the Kingdom.REGA has clarified that no specific residential or commercial projects have yet been officially approved for non-Saudi ownership. Any information circulating on such approvals has not been issued by the authority, and investors have been urged to rely solely on official announcements.Beyond ownership rules, the regulation is positioned as a strategic economic tool. According to REGA, the law aims to raise the quality of real estate development by attracting international developers and specialized companies.The authority expects the move to stimulate growth across residential, commercial, industrial, and tourism sectors. It is also projected to generate broader employment opportunities for Saudi citizens in real estate and urban development activities, while strengthening the sector’s contribution to non-oil gross domestic product.REGA has invited interested applicants to visit the Saudi Properties portal or contact the unified call centre on 920017183 for further information and guidance as the new system comes into effect.","Saudi Arabia has officially announced that the law allowing non-Saudis to own property entered into force yesterday, January 22.

Reality behind the snow





Imagine waking up, looking out your window in Dubai, and seeing the Burj Khalifa draped in a blanket of fresh, powdery snow. That was the dream His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (lovingly known as Fazza), shared with his millions of followers this Thursday.His Highness, who is basically Dubai’s unofficial ""Chief Storyteller,"" posted a viral image that looked like a scene straight out of a Disney movie, except the ""Castle"" was a world-famous skyscraper.While the photo was a creative ""what if,"" it perfectly captured the mood of a city currently obsessed with the cold. The caption by His Highness, “how the weather will feel tomorrow,” was a cheeky nod to the freezing winds currently whistling through the city's glass towers.While we aren't exactly skiing down Sheikh Zayed Road just yet, the ""Real Feel"" temperature in the UAE is getting pretty close to the vision shared by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan.

These winds are pushing clouds across the country and keeping the sun from heating up the desert floor, making this one of the most sustained cold periods the UAE has seen in years. The NCM has even issued warnings about fierce winds, reminding everyone that this winter ""nip"" has some real power behind it.There is something about a cold morning that brings a community together.

Discussions to resolve the future of Greenland have focused in recent days on proposals to increase Nato’s presence in the Arctic, give America a sovereign claim to pockets of Greenland’s territory and block potentially hostile adversaries from mining the island’s minerals.Those elements, described by eight senior Western security and diplomatic officials, offer the fullest picture yet of the contours of a potential Greenland compromise that President Trump announced Wednesday without details. His move appeared to at least temporarily defuse an American-made trans-Atlantic crisis over the Danish territory.Critically, the proposals under discussion would stop short of Trump’s goal of transferring ownership of all of Greenland to the US from Denmark, according to the officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity. The officials cautioned that many details have yet to be finalised.It is unclear if these discussions will ultimately yield agreement over the territory. Denmark, which publicly opposes ceding ownership of any Greenlandic land, may not agree to the plans on the table. Still, the officials said they were hopeful that they could simultaneously address Trump’s stated concerns about securing the Arctic against possible threats from Russia and China while holding to Europe’s “red line” that Greenland was not for sale.To do that, the proposals would:Create a significant new Nato mission in the Arctic. Multiple officials have dubbed this mission “Arctic Sentry,” in a nod to similarly named Nato missions in the Baltic Sea and Eastern Europe that are meant to counter an increasingly aggressive RussiaUpdate a pact signed between Denmark and the US in 1951. The pact gives the US military wide access to Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, for operations including the construction and operation of military bases. US officials have said they are concerned that this access could be curbed or ended if Greenland were to obtain independence. Nato officials have discussed expanding the 1951 pact with a new agreement that would effectively create pockets of American soil in the territory.Such an agreement would likely be modelled on a “sovereign base area” agreement in Cyprus, where Britain’s military bases are regarded as British territory. That would give the US greater control over the land than it currently exerts over US embassy sites. Trump and other officials have said that territory in Greenland could prove important for his plans to build a so-called Golden Dome missile defence system for the US, which could include components stationed in Greenland.Restrict non-Nato member countries, particularly Russia and China, from obtaining rights to mine the rare-earth minerals that lie deep under Greenland’s ice sheet.All of those plans have been under discussion inside Nato over the last year, as a direct response to Trump’s stated ambitions.","Proposals would stop short of transferring ownership of all of Greenland to the US from Denmark.

A Frisco, Texas, resident posted a video of himself asking mayor Jeff Cheney about his Indian investors at a recent council meeting. The video grabbed social media attention at a time when 'Indians in Texas' emerged as a major issue this week after attorney Aaron Reitz, who is contesting the Texas Attorney General election, spoke against Indians and called them unassimilable.Marc Palasciano, who calls himself a whistleblower, said at the council meeting that he would speak about the “Indian takeover in Frisco and H-1B fraud.”Comparing it with the alleged Somalian fraud in Minnesota, Marc said Frisco’s Indian population exploded by 4,510% over the last 20 years.“From 2% of the population to 33% of the population. As a reminder from the last time I spoke in June and July, let me remind you of the mayor’s donations. In 2021, 10% of donations above $1,000 were from people with Indian last names. In 2023, 55% of donations above $1,000 were from people with Indian last names — a 450% increase in donations above $1,000 from people with Indian last names. That seems like a red flag to me,” Marc said.“Now, let me ask a few questions to the mayor and city council that I don’t expect you guys to answer, but I’m going to ask them anyway. Mayor Cheney, for 2023, why were four of your top donors — Indian people — not living in Frisco or even Collin County and donating $5,000 to you?” he asked, insinuating that these donors were also getting something in return from the mayor.“I don’t understand why someone would donate to a mayor who doesn’t represent them, unless that mayor represents business interests that make them money. I’m sure it’s just a coincidence that all of you are in the real estate business and those four donors have over 158 businesses registered in their name,” Marc said.He then questioned Burt Thakur, the first Indian-origin city council member, about why he used a consulting firm whose CEO, Marc alleged, was convicted of fraud.“Why is one of your biggest donors an Indian in the North Texas real estate business who doesn’t live in Frisco? Why is another one of your biggest donors a white resident in Dallas in real estate? Why does one of your biggest donors have four companies hiring H-1B employees? And why does one of your donors have 23 H-1B companies registered to one address? I’ll end my questions there. We’ll see if your constituents or any news outlets apply pressure and force you guys to answer these questions,” Marc said.","A Frisco, Texas, resident posted a video of himself asking mayor Jeff Cheney about his Indian investors at a recent council meeting.

Indian American constitutional scholar Saikrishna Prakash said recent immigration restrictions in the United States stemmed from President Donald Trump’s hostility towards immigration itself rather than any targeted stance against India, and warned that executive power now dominated policy in ways Congress struggled to counter.Prakash, a Miller Center senior fellow and James Monroe Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of Virginia, spoke in an exclusive interview with New India Abroad on the sidelines of the Kerala Literature Festival in Kozhikode, Kerala.Discussing employment-based visas, including the H-1B programme, Prakash said the impact on Indians reflected broader immigration scepticism. “It’s not really about India per se. It’s about his distaste for immigration,” he said, adding that India benefited disproportionately from the programme and would therefore feel adverse effects more sharply.Prakash said the result could be a geographic redistribution of Indian talent. He noted that Indians might increasingly go to Europe, Australia, Singapore and Japan for education and jobs, and argued that India benefited from a strong and globally dispersed diaspora.The conversation also turned to Prakash’s new book, ‘The Presidential Pardon: The Short Clause with a Long, Troubled History’, which examined one of the least constrained powers in the US Constitution. He described the pardon clause as “about 20 words” long but said its impact extended far beyond its brevity, allowing presidents to forgive crimes entirely or reduce sentences. He said presidents now exercised “rather sweeping control” over the criminal process.Prakash said reactions to pardons were once less partisan but hardened as presidents commanded stronger loyalty within their parties. He argued that actions once seen as deeply controversial drew automatic approval from large segments of the electorate based on who issued them.On executive power more broadly, Prakash said US presidents steadily encroached on congressional authority, particularly through delegated powers in areas such as immigration. Congress, he said, became a bystander, divided internally while presidents acted decisively as party leaders.For Indian professionals in the United States, Prakash said constitutional law offered limited protection against sudden policy shifts. Courts could intervene when laws were violated, he said, but much immigration policy remained discretionary, leaving immigrants vulnerable to executive decisions.",Indian American constitutional scholar Saikrishna Prakash said recent immigration restrictions in the U.S. stemmed from President Donald Trump’s hostility towards immigration itself.

FBI director Kash Patel called Ryan Wedding 'modern day Pablo Escobar' after Wedding was arrested by the FBI in Mexico making this the agency's 500th capture in the history of the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list. ""When you go after a guy like Ryan Wedding, it takes a united front,"" Patel said, also thanking Canadian and Mexican authorities for their help in the investigation.44-year-old Wedding has been on the FBI radar since 2024 March when the FBI added the former Canadian Olympian to their most wanted list. Authorities believe Wedding, 44, is a member of the Sinaloa Cartel and had been hiding in Mexico for more than a decade while running and participating in a transnational drug trafficking operation.Patel said Wedding shipped hundreds of kilograms of cocaine from Colombia, through Mexico and Southern California to the United States and Canada.Attorney General Pam Bondi said Wedding was flown to the US, “where he will face justice.”“Director Patel has worked tirelessly to bring fugitives to justice. We are grateful to our incredible Ambassador Ron Johnson and the Mexican authorities for assisting us in this case,” Bondi said in a post on X.The former athlete was charged in a September 2024 superseding indictment with attempted murder and other counts related to the alleged drug enterprise. In November, a grand jury indictment was unsealed charging him in the death of a federal witness who was supposed to testify against him. The witness was fatally shot at a restaurant after authorities said Wedding “placed a bounty” on his head and used a Canadian website to find the witness and his wife.Prosecutors alleged that Wedding's entry to the drug world took place in 2008 six years after he represented Canada in the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.Wedding traveled to San Diego to buy cocaine, got arrested as the dealer was an undercover agent and he was sentenced to 48 months in federal prison.

Abraham George is not a Hindu like Vivek Ramaswamy, but he got a taste of his party’s hatred when the Indian-origin Republican leader called for a Florida-like ban on H-1Bs in Texas universities as well. George was born in India’s Kerala to Christian parents and came to the US when he was 16. As many equate H-1Bs with Indians, George was among the first to be asked to “go back to India.”Texas has been seeing a surge in anti-India sentiment as influencers make videos claiming there has been an Indian takeover of the state. From social media influencers, the narrative entered the political realm when conservative leader Alexander Duncan questioned why there are so many Hindu temples in the state and called Hindu gods “false.” Recently, Aaron Reitz, who is contesting for Texas Attorney General, called Indians unassimilated and unassimilable and said he would stop H-1B abuses in Texas.In October 2025, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis asked universities to end the use of the H-1B visa program. The policy has now been finalized, with a vote on the proposed ban scheduled for January 29. The proposal calls for a one-year pause on hiring through the H-1B visa program.Florida state universities employ more than 600 workers on H-1B visas at present.The H-1B visa program allows US companies — universities in this case — to hire skilled individuals from foreign countries. India has dominance in the IT sector, but many other nationals are hired in universities through the H-1B visa program.Reacting to the Florida development, Texas GOP chairman Abraham George said, “Texas should follow this. We should just ban it altogether.”“I’m already drafting bills for this,” Rep. Brent Money promptly replied to George.But social media was not impressed. Users asked “ricebag” George to “go back” and told him that he is not even considered an American in Texas.Though George was born and brought up in India, many of his family members were already in the US, including his grandfather. Stories about them planted in him a “deep admiration for America’s freedoms and opportunities,” his website said. His family started the US visa process when he was two, and they finally came to the US when he was 16.Despite his strong academic potential, George went to work, starting as a janitor’s assistant at an IT manufacturing company. He rose through the ranks and became the national sales director by the age of 22, his website said.","Texas has been seeing a surge in anti-India sentiment as influencers make videos claiming there has been an Indian takeover of the state.

Watch: ‘Dorito-shaped’ aircraft spotted over Area 51 sends the internet into a frenzy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-dorito-shaped-aircraft-spotted-over-area-51-sends-the-internet-into-a-frenzy/articleshow/127309800.cms,"A peculiar 'dorito-shaped' aircraft spotted near Area 51 has reignited alien invasion theories. Videographer Anders Otteson captured the triangular craft, distinct from known military planes. This sighting echoes similar past encounters, fueling speculation about classified flights and even coded military communications involving everyday items. The mystery deepens around the secretive base.

Doritos in the sky?

Netizens react to the dorito-shaped aircraft

2014 and 2026?

Snacks as codes?





A mysterious 'dorito-shaped' aircraft flying over US's enigmatic and highly classified Area 51 has raised theories of alien invasion again, online. The military base based in southern Nevada, has long held the attention of war theorists and weapon enthusiasts and the recent sighting has only amped up the intrigue.Anders Otteson, an off-grid videographer popular for documenting mysterious landscapes around the military installation shared a video footage of the aircraft on his YouTube channel Uncanny Expeditions, creating immense buzz on the internet.It was at 3 am on January 14, the Otteson was out in the desert when he recorded a strange aircraft flying in the sky. Believed to be an unidentified aerial phenomenon, it had an ""equilateral triangle"" shape, distinguishing it from the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber that Otteson filmed earlier that night.According to the YouTuber, while B-2 has a similar V-wing profile, the mystery aircraft had a flatter trailing edge, no visible wings and a jagged rear section. However, considering the limited visibility, he did not rule out the possibility of the aircraft actually being a B-2 or another military aircraft.“Are we looking at a classified test flight or run-of-the-mill training sortie?” the explorer asked. “I certainly think we have something interesting here.”The video of the aircraft sent many into a frenzy, worrying about aliens and UFOs. However, others were more fixated on the peculiar description of its shape, as a 'dorito'.""Do average americans don't know the word ""triangle""?"" wrote one X user.""Thus must be one of the many classified secret transport aircraft that were rarely seen in many black ops scenarios"" theorised another.""Obviously aliens. There’s no way it can just be a triangular shaped jet,"" claimed one.""And here's where all military spending will be shown to the world. The government is the one flying the UFOs if you haven't figured that out yet then geeze"" added another.""We are ruling out that it’s a Dorito?"" quipped one.The flying Dorito aircraft bears a striking resemblance to a similar-looking triangular UFO that was spotted in broad daylight over Kansas in 2014. As per Otteson, the aircraft matched the shape and flight trail of the previous ""unacknowledged triangle-shaped aircraft"".They also bring back speculations over the three triangular planes seen flying at high altitude in Amarillo in Texas. While these were more boomerang-shaped, the timing was just a month after the Kansas sightings.The following day, Otteson discussed his sighting with Dreamland Resort's Joerg Arnu in a livestream where the latter revealed that there had been an unusually high number of codewords picked up on the audio scanner that night.He suggested that the military had used playful mentions of everyday items, such as 'corona', 'pretzel', and 'Michelob', probably to conceal the true nature of what was happening.With Area 51 being one of the most enigmatic military bases in the United States, and closed off to the public, the conspiracy theories have been unending. And the 'Dorito-shaped' aircraft has just added fuel to the speculative fire.","Videographer Anders Otteson captured the triangular craft, distinct from known military planes.

ICE Agent LOSES COOL At Minnesota Protesters: ‘You Are Harassing Us…’ | Faceoff Caught On Cam





Podcaster Joe Rogan criticised US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids and the country’s hardline anti-immigration policies, claiming that enforcement efforts are increasingly targeting non-criminal migrants rather than violent offenders or cartel members.Speaking on a recent episode of, Rogan alleged that ICE agents were focusing on locations such as Home Depot parking lots — where day labourers often gather — instead of prioritising what he described as “gang bangers, criminals and cartel members.”“Then they start showing up at Home Depot. Instead of, like, looking for gang bangers, looking for criminals and cartel members, they go to whatever's easiest pickings so they can get numbers up,” the podcaster said.Rogan cited conversations with Ed Calderon, a former Mexican military operative who is now a US citizen and an analyst known for reporting on cartel violence. According to Rogan, Calderon had described what he called “horror stories” stemming from ICE raids.One such case involved a man who was brought to the United States as a baby and lived there for roughly two decades without gaining citizenship. Rogan said the man, who reportedly does not speak Spanish and has no criminal record, was deported to Tijuana despite having spent virtually his entire life in the US.“He’s essentially an American, he just doesn’t have the paperwork,” Rogan said. “They sent him to Tijuana. He can’t speak Spanish, doesn’t know what to do, has no money, and is suddenly living on the streets.”Rogan’s comments add to an ongoing national debate over immigration enforcement priorities, due process in deportation cases, and the treatment of long-term undocumented residents who were brought to the US as children. Critics of current enforcement strategies argue that deportations based solely on legal status, rather than criminal history, can lead to severe humanitarian consequences.ICE has previously stated that its enforcement actions are aimed at upholding federal immigration law and protecting public safety, though civil rights groups and immigration advocates continue to question how those priorities are applied on the ground.","Joe Rogan claims ICE agents are targeting non-criminal migrants rather than violent offenders or cartel members.

Bar leaders allege violence, warn of protests

What was the case?





Pakistan’s prominent human rights lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad. The incident triggered strong condemnation from legal bodies and rights activists over what they described as unconstitutional move.The lawyer couple was on its way to the Additional District and Sessions Court to appear in a case linked to controversial social media posts when police intercepted their vehicle. Arrest warrants had been issued against them on January 16 after the court cancelled their interim bail, news agency PTI reported.The arrest was confirmed by Imaan’s mother, Dr Shireen Mazari, a former federal human rights minister in the Imran Khan government, who said the couple was detained without explanation and taken to undisclosed locations.In a post on X, Mazari said that her daughter and son-in-law “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations,” adding that no arrest warrant or formal document was shown to them at the time, according to Dawn.Calling the incident a sign of repression, she wrote: “Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!”Mazari also shared videos on social media showing police vehicles following the lawyers’ car before blocking it on the road. In the footage, officers were seen opening the car doors, surrounding the vehicle and attempting to pull the occupants out. Another clip showed shattered car windows, which Mazari alleged were broken by the police during the arrest.In a separate post, she claimed that police had used force not only against the couple but also against senior members of the legal fraternity who were accompanying them.“Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari wrote, alleging that the arrest was carried out to prevent further embarrassment to authorities during court proceedings.Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) president Wajid Ali Gilani, who was present at the scene, said the arrest violated assurances given by authorities that the lawyers would be allowed safe passage to court.In a video message shared by Mazari, Gilani said the police attacked the convoy near Serena Chowk, broke car windows, forcibly removed the couple and pushed Imaan into a police vehicle. He also alleged that police officials assaulted IHCBA secretary Manzoor Jajja during the incident.“The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani warned, referring to the mass protests that once challenged military rule in Pakistan.The Islamabad High Court Bar Association, Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrests, calling them illegal and unconstitutional.The IHCBA and IBA announced a strike on Friday, while the IBC called for a nationwide lawyers’ strike on Saturday. The bar councils demanded the immediate release of the couple and an independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved.In a statement, the IBA said the arrest violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Pakistan’s Constitution, stressing that “every citizen has the right to defend themselves in court without fear.”Human Rights Commission of Pakistan strongly condemned the arrest of both lawyers. In a post on X, the organzation wrote: ""HRCP demands immediate disclosure of their whereabouts and holds the authorities fully responsible for any harm. Ms Mazari-Hazir and Mr Chattha must be released immediately.""The primary case against Mazari-Hazir and Chattha stems from a complaint filed in August 2025 with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), accusing Mazari of spreading content allegedly aligned with banned organisations. Her husband was implicated for reposting some of the content.They were indicted in October last year, and arrest warrants were issued after repeated non-appearances led to the cancellation of their interim bail.Additional cases linked to protests and an alleged scuffle outside the Islamabad High Court have also been filed against them, some of which are still under judicial review.","Iaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad.

Dozens feared missing



Compensation announced for victims’ families







The death toll from a devastating fire at a major shopping plaza in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, has risen to 26, with authorities warning that the number could climb further as search operations continue, as reported by Geo TV. The blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.Rescue teams gained fuller access to the building nearly 24 hours later, after firefighters managed to bring the inferno under control. Officials said smoke was still rising from the structure on Monday, complicating efforts to locate missing people.Rescue 1122 Sindh spokesperson Hassan Khan said 21 bodies had been recovered so far, adding that search operations were still under way. “The search will continue,” he said, as concerns remain over possible structural collapses inside the severely damaged building.Mohammed Shah, part of the Pakistan Navy’s rescue team, described the incident as a “deep-seated fire”, noting that smoke continued to emanate from the debris despite the flames being largely extinguished. Firefighters said the blaze had been brought 95 per cent under control, with cooling operations now in progress.Officials warned that the weakened structure posed serious dangers. Portions of the building’s front and back façades have collapsed, while cracks have been detected inside.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said authorities were still trying to establish the final death toll. Speaking at a press conference, he said around 65 people who were reported to have visited Gul Plaza remain unaccounted for, raising fears that casualties could rise sharply.“I cannot give a final number as of yet,” he said. “There has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident.”South DIG Syed Asad Raza said more areas of the plaza were yet to be cleared, and warned the number of fatalities could increase as debris is removed.The Sindh government has announced Rs10 million (£28,000) in compensation for the family of each person killed. “There can be no price tag on a life,” the chief minister said, adding that the compensation process would begin immediately.He also confirmed that one firefighter was among those who lost their lives.The cause of the fire has not yet been confirmed. Officials initially suspect an electrical short circuit, though a forensic investigation has been ordered. Police said samples had been collected for DNA matching to help identify victims.Authorities revealed that although the plaza had 16 gates, only three exits were open at the time of the fire, raising serious questions over safety compliance.Karachi has witnessed repeated fatal fires, often linked to poor safety standards, illegal construction and inadequate fire prevention systems. A government audit in 2024 found that the vast majority of commercial buildings in the city lacked proper fire safety measures.","Blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.

Karachi Gul Plaza Fire Claims At Least 10 Lives, Dozens Missing As Rescue Operations Continue





The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan’s Karachi has risen to 14 after rescue teams recovered eight more bodies from the debris, officials said on Monday.The blaze broke out late Saturday night at Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market on MA Jinnah Road in the city’s Saddar area. The fire was brought under control by Sunday night, but rescue operations continued as large parts of the building suffered severe structural damage.Six bodies were found soon after the fire erupted, with officials saying the victims likely died of suffocation. Dozens of injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals. As the fire spread rapidly, thick smoke and intense heat initially prevented rescue teams from entering the building.“Once the fire was doused, we didn’t wait for the cooling period and forcibly went in to rescue trapped people and we found eight more bodies, some badly charred,” Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Abid Jalal told PTI.Jalal said the fire had almost completely damaged the building, with both the front and rear portions collapsing due to weakened pillars.“The structure has become extremely unsafe, and we are still searching as there is a risk of further collapses,” he said.Gul Plaza, built in the early 1980s, houses around 1,200 shops spread across a basement, mezzanine and three upper floors. It has long been a prominent commercial hub in Karachi.Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site on Monday, said authorities feared that dozens of people could still be trapped inside. “We are extremely concerned and alarmed. Efforts are going on to find them but this is a national tragedy,” he told reporters.South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza said the casualty count could rise as large sections of the building were yet to be searched. Officials suspect an electrical short circuit may have caused the fire, though the exact cause will be confirmed after a full investigation.The incident has once again highlighted serious fire safety concerns in Karachi. In recent years, several commercial buildings in the city have caught fire due to poor safety measures, faulty electrical systems and illegal construction.A government audit in 2024 found that most shopping malls lacked proper fire safety systems, emergency exits and compliant wiring.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, while the Sindh government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.","The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan's Karachi has risen to 14.

Firefighting hampered by smoke, structure damage

Many still trapped





At least six people, including a firefighter, were killed after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road late on Saturday night. Several others were feared trapped more than 12 hours after the blaze erupted, as rescue operations continued into Sunday.Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said the fire broke out at around 10.45pm, when most shopkeepers were closing their stores or had already left for the night.Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said around 20 people had been pulled out of the building and shifted to hospital. He added that the complex layout of the mall was hampering rescue efforts. “Once the cooling starts, we will start further rescue operations, but the layout of the building is very complex as it houses a basement and mezzanine floor with hundreds of shops and stores,” Khan said, as quoted by Dawn.Television footage showed firefighters in protective gear battling intense flames shooting out of windows and balconies, as thick black smoke rose into the night sky and was visible from several blocks away.Dozens of fire engines were deployed, using ladders, water cannons and hoses to reach upper floors.According to officials, the fire spread rapidly after breaking out in an area where shopkeepers had stored imported garments, clothing and plastic household goods, which fuelled the flames. As many as 40 snorkels were pressed into service, and by Sunday afternoon around 60 per cent of the fire had been brought under control.However, the blaze caused severe structural damage. Rescue officials said cracks had appeared in the mall’s walls, while a DawnNewsTV correspondent reported that one side of the building had “completely collapsed”. The News International said poor ventilation and sealed windows had allowed smoke to fill the interior, severely hindering rescue operations.Sindh Labour and Social Protection Minister Saeed Ghani warned that many people could still be inside the building. District South Deputy Commissioner Khoso told Geo News, “There are fears that people are on the first and mezzanine floors. The rescue teams have not been able to reach these floors.”IG Aslam said a short circuit was suspected, though the exact cause would be determined once the fire was fully extinguished. Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah has ordered an inquiry, directing Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi to investigate the incident and submit a report.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, as attention once again turned to poor fire safety standards in Karachi, where deadly mall fires have occurred repeatedly, including one in November 2023 that killed 10 people.","At least six people, including a firefighter, have died after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road.

It fell from the Galapur bridge in Kot Momin tehsil into a dry canal as the driver lost control over the vehicle because of poor visibility,” the spokesperson said.Nine people were injured in the crash and are being treated at the Civil Hospital in Kot Momin, according to PTI.In a separate incident in Balochistan, at least nine people were killed and 15 others injured when a passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway near Gwadar early Saturday.Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police Aslam Bangulzai confirmed the accident, saying the coach was travelling from Jiwani to Karachi. “The accident took place early this morning on the Makran coastal highway as the passenger coach overturned due to over speeding,” Bangulzai said, as quoted by PTI.Dense fog has severely affected traffic movement across Punjab’s motorways and major roads during night and early morning hours since the onset of an extreme cold wave last month.As reported by Dawn, several motorway sections have been closed intermittently due to low visibility.Pakistan frequently witnesses fatal road accidents, with factors such as over-speeding, poor enforcement of traffic rules, driver fatigue and weak licensing controls cited as major causes.On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed in a head-on collision between a bus and a van on the Jhang-Faisalabad road in Punjab, according to PTI.","At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday.

Shaksgam Valley: India bristles over China's fresh claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shaksgam-valley-india-bristles-over-chinas-fresh-claim-dispute-explained/articleshow/126529230.cms,"Why China Building Roads In Shaksgam Valley Is A Direct Strategic Challenge For India In Kashmir

What is the Shaksgam Valley?

What is the dispute about?

Why does Shaksgam Valley matter strategically?

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh



The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth



The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications



Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims



For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?





NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The Shaksgam Valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region. It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east. It is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India's claims over Pakistan- occupied Kashmir, and China's growing footprint in the Himalayas.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126529183,imgsize-1792158,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"

Pact To Power Bloc: How Turkish Arms, Saudi Money And Pakistan Nukes May Align In Islamic NATO





Islamic Nato in the making? Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, this can be seen as an effort in direction to reshape security alignments in the Middle East region and beyond, as Bloomberg reported.The pact, initially signed by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in September, reportedly states that “any aggression” against one member would be treated as an attack on all -- a provision that mirrors Article 5 of Nato, of which Turkey is a member and fields the second-largest military after the US.Talks on Turkey’s entry are said to be at an advanced stage, with a deal appearing likely, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on condition of anonymity.Bloomberg reported that the expanded alliance reflects growing overlap in the strategic interests of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan across South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa.Turkey also sees the arrangement as a way to strengthen its security and deterrence posture at a time when questions persist over US reliability and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato, despite Washington’s close military ties with all three countries.Saudi Arabia would bring financial strength to the grouping, Pakistan its nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkey contributes military experience and a rapidly expanding defence industry, said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.“As the US prioritizes its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan said.Turkish defence ministry declined to comment on the report. Pakistan’s information ministry did not respond to requests for comment, while Saudi officials were unavailable over the weekend.If Turkey formally joins the pact, it would highlight a new phase in relations with Saudi Arabia, once rivals for leadership of the Sunni Muslim world. After years of strained ties, the two countries are now deepening economic and defence cooperation, including holding their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.Despite shared concerns over Shiite-majority Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia favour engagement with Tehran rather than confrontation. They also back a stable, Sunni-led Syria and support Palestinian statehood.Turkey and Pakistan already enjoy close military ties. Ankara is building corvette warships for Pakistan’s navy, has upgraded Islamabad’s F-16 fighter jets, and shares drone technology with both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Bloomberg previously reported that Turkey now wants both countries to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet programme.The trilateral defence discussions come after a ceasefire between India and Pakistan ended a four-day military clash and high tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Regional tensions remain high, however, with Pakistan and Afghanistan at odds following clashes and accusations by Islamabad that the Taliban is sheltering hostile militant groups.Turkey and Qatar have mediated talks between the sides, though those efforts have so far failed to produce a breakthrough, Bloomberg reported.","Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

‘Not 1, Not 1,000’: Jem Chief Masood Azhar Returns With Audio Threat As India Tightens Terror Noose

Def experts: Azhar’s statement sign of post-Sindoor frustration





A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","New audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar has surfaced on social media.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality





Pakistan on Saturday claimed that Iraq has expressed “keen interest” in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft, following talks between the air chiefs of the two countries.According to a statement issued by the Pakistan Army, air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, chief of air staff of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), met lieutenant general staff pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi, commander of the Iraqi Air Force, during an official visit to Iraq.The discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, including joint training, capacity building and operational coordination.“The Iraqi air chief praised PAF’s professionalism and technological advancement, expressed interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak trainer aircraft,” the statement said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Both sides also agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability between the two air forces.The JF-17 Thunder is a single-engine, lightweight combat aircraft jointly developed by China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.Pakistan has claimed that the aircraft proved its capabilities during last year’s conflict with India, although its effectiveness remains disputed.Pakistan had also deployed Chinese-origin J-10 fighter jets during the May 7–10 hostilities with India.The development comes days after Pakistan and Bangladesh air chiefs held talks on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 jets by Dhaka. However, Bangladesh has not officially confirmed any such plan.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif recently claimed that the country has seen increased interest in its fighter aircraft following the May 2025 standoff with India. Reports have also suggested that Pakistan is exploring similar defence deals with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, amid ongoing financial pressures.Notably, Pakistan has repeatedly relied on International Monetary Fund support in recent years, with the IMF approving a $7 billion bailout in September 2024 and an additional $1.4 billion loan in May 2025.",Iraq has expressed “keen interest’ in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft.

'Hindus Will Not Be Allowed To Stay': BNP Candidate’s Threat Sparks Alarm Amid Bangladesh Killings





Dhaka: In an apparent reference to Bangladesh's largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), BNP chairman and former PM Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman has said a ""certain party"" is trying to deceive voters, particularly women, with ""tickets to heaven"" if they align with it and vote for it in the parliamentary elections.In his maiden poll rally on Thursday in Sylhet, Tarique also warned of conspiracies being hatched to derail the polls through rigging. ""They are already cheating you. Now, think about how they will cheat you after the elections...They are not only deceiving people; they are making Muslims commit 'shirk' (act of ascribing divinity or worship to others alongside Allah). 'Nauzubillah' (we seek refuge in Allah),"" he said in veiled attack on former BNP ally JeI.Tarique also criticised the ""certain party"" for its stance against the 1971 Liberation War in multiple public meetings, amid high security as Bangladesh sees political violence intensifying ahead of the campaigning for which began Thursday.Nahid Islam, convener of JeI ally National Citizen Party, has accused ""one particular party"" of spreading misleading information among the public and creating an environment of fear.As the two rivals traded barbs, a leader of Tarique's party was critically injured after assailants opened fire on him in Dhaka's Keraniganj area on Thursday night. The incident comes amid two incidents of intense clashes between BNP and JeI workers this week that left several injured. BNP Hazratpur Union general secretary Mohammad Hasan Molla, 45, was shot on Thursday night, police said, adding he suffered a gunshot injury to the right side of his abdomen. Hasan's brother Rakib Molla said two unidentified men opened fire on Hasan .","Former PM Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman says a ""certain party"" is trying to deceive voters.

Ousted Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina says in an interview with Alpyu Singh that free and fair elections in her country are impossible under Muhammad Yunus’ interim govt and that India deserves a reliable neighbour. Excerpts:

has assumed office as

chairman recently. How do you look at his return?

Ex-PM Hasina Calls Yunus “Murderous Fascist,” Warns Bangladesh at Edge of Abyss

A lot of people are questioning whether an election could actually take place in Feb? If so, how will

How can India help in restoring peace in Bangladesh?

What do you think is the future of India-Bangladesh bilateral relations?

The people of Bangladesh should remember that Tarique Rahman has lived in exile in London for years, far removed from the daily realities faced by ordinary citizens. He fled the country because of his role in abetting his late mother, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, in the embezzlement of public funds. This is not a matter of political disagreement, but of accountability and integrity.BNP leadership has consistently aligned itself with extremist elements when it suits its short-term interests, even at the cost of national stability... it has chosen exclusion, intimidation, and opportunism. Bangladesh deserves leadership that governs from within the country, respects pluralism, and is accountable to the people, not figures who seek power through alliances with radical forces while remaining safely abroad.The question is not whether elections will take place but whether these will be elections in any meaningful or legitimate sense... At present, Bangladesh is ruled by an unelected regime that has appointed itself the authority to rewrite our country's constitution and amend our legislation to ban the nation's most widely supported party from participating in elections.Over half the voters in Bangladesh have confidence in Awami League and would vote for us if Awami League were allowed to participate.It is precisely this fear that has led them to ban us.A govt's most basic duty is to protect its citizens. The interim govt has not only failed in this responsibility, it has actively emboldened this repression. Under Yunus, extremist groups that my govt worked hard to contain have been empowered and elevated to positions of authority. These criminals, many of whom belong to known terrorist orgs, have been allowed to spread a hardline ideology that threatens to remove any trace of diversity from our country and carry out deplorable acts of violence against peaceful Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, Ahmadi Muslims with total impunity. The current climate is the direct result of the appeasement of fundamentalist forces.India has rightly condemned the human rights abuses and political repression that have become all too common under the Yunus regime. They are watching in dismay right now as Bangladesh descends into lawlessness, as minority groups face daily acts of violence, as political imprisonments become the norm, and as harmful, hostile rhetoric emanates from Dhaka. India understands that prosperity of our two nations is tightly linked.n India is Bangladesh's closest friend and longest-standing ally, a relationship built through geography, history and cooperation. Yunus has done considerable damage to this relationship through his empowerment of extremist groups who freely target religious minorities with impunity and his willingness to allow mobs to besiege Indian diplomatic premises and threaten representatives. This is recklessness by an administration with neither the experience nor the mandate to dictate Bangladesh's foreign policy.India deserves a reliable partner in Bangladesh, one that can maintain stability and honour its commitments. We must return to being the friend our neighbours knew they could trust.",Ousted Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina says free and fair elections in her country are impossible under Muhammad Yunus’ interim govt. She says India deserves a reliable neighbour. India has rightly condemned the human rights abuses and political repression that have become all too common under Yunus regime.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127333370,imgsize-753563,width-400,resizemode-4/ani-file-photo.jpg"

After capturing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and repeatedly threatening to take control of Greenland, US President Donald Trump has now set his sights on a new target: the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean.Trump has criticised ally, the UK, over a deal that would give Mauritius “ownership” of the archipelago, which comprises over 60 islands. His concern centres on the chain’s largest island, Diego Garcia, which hosts the well-known joint British-American military base, also known as Diego Garcia.The Republican’s outburst came despite his own administration welcoming the agreement, describing it as a “historic and monumental achievement.”The United Kingdom has “owned” and administered the Chagos Islands as the British Indian Ocean Territory since 1965, three years before Mauritius gained independence from the UK. Mauritius’ Constitution, however, includes the islands as part of its territory. During the 1960s and 1970s, up to 2,000 people were forced off the islands to allow the United States to build what became the Diego Garcia military base.The UK’s control of the archipelago and the forced removal of its local population led to international criticism and calls for sovereignty to be transferred to Mauritius.In 2022, negotiations began between the UK's then Conservative-led government and Mauritius and continued following the 2024 election of Keir Starmer and his Labour Party. Talks dragged on as Mauritius also witnessed a change in government and there were disputes over money, but the agreement was signed off in May 2025 after Britain had sought and received backing from the Trump administration.Under the treaty, which is currently in the ratification stage in the British parliament, the UK would pay Mauritius an undisclosed sum — reportedly about $100 million a year — for 99 years to control the islands.Washington has described the base, which hosts around 2,500 mostly American personnel, as “an all but indispensable platform” for security operations in the Middle East, South Asia, and East Africa. It has supported America's military operations from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2008, the US acknowledged that the base had also been used for secret flights transporting terror suspects.More recently, the United States deployed several nuclear-capable B-2 Spirit bombers to Diego Garcia amid an intense airstrike campaign targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels.In addition to its strategic security interests in the Indian Ocean, particularly regarding China, New Delhi has quietly encouraged London to return sovereignty of the archipelago to Mauritius. For India, there is also a historical context. The US decision to establish a full-scale military base on Diego Garcia was made during the Richard Nixon administration, which had sided with Pakistan in the 1971 India-Pakistan war and even sent a naval task force into the Bay of Bengal to try to pressure India. Instead of backing down, India, backed by the-then Soviet Union (mostly present-day Russia), went on to liberate Bangladesh — then East Pakistan — ahead of the arrival of the US Navy's USS Enterprise, the world’s largest and most powerful aircraft carrier at the time.In September last year, India announced a $680 million (over Rs 6,000 crore) economic package for Mauritius. The assistance, provided through grants and lines of credit, also supports development and the monitoring of the Chagos Archipelago’s marine protected area.The 99-year lease agreement between the UK and Mauritius ensures continued US access to the Diego Garcia base. However, if Trump were to take over the Chagos Archipelago, Mauritius would lose ownership of the islands, and all agreements, including India’s $680 million economic package, would be rendered automatically null and void. This could also undermine India’s strategic interests in the Indian Ocean.","Trump has criticised ally, the UK, over a deal that would give Mauritius “ownership” of the Chagos Archipelago.

Bangladesh’s interim government on Monday said that the majority of incidents involving members of minority communities in the country during 2025 were “criminal in nature” and not driven by communal motives, asserting that only 71 of the 645 cases recorded had communal elements.The statement, issued by the office of chief adviser Muhammad Yunus and later highlighted by him in a post on X, came days after India pressed Dhaka to “swiftly and firmly” deal with attacks on minorities and described as “troubling” attempts to attribute such incidents to extraneous reasons.Citing a year-long review of official police records from January to December 2025, the interim government said 645 incidents involving minority communities were documented nationwide based on verified FIRs, general diaries, charge sheets and investigation updates.“While every incident is a matter of concern, the data presents a clear and evidence-based picture: the overwhelming majority of cases were criminal in nature rather than communal,” the statement said.According to the data, 71 incidents were identified as having communal elements. These included 38 cases of temple vandalism, eight incidents of arson, one case each of theft and murder, and 23 other incidents such as threats to break idols, provocative social media posts and damage to worship pavilions.Police cases were registered in 50 of these incidents, with arrests made in an equal number, while preventive or investigative measures were taken in the remaining cases.The remaining 574 incidents, the government said, were linked to criminal or social disputes unrelated to religion. These included neighbourhood disputes (51), land-related conflicts (23), theft (106), prior personal enmity (26), rape (58) and 172 cases of unnatural death. Police registered 390 cases in this category, filed 154 unnatural death reports and made 498 arrests, with additional measures taken in 30 incidents.The statement stressed that accurate classification was necessary to counter misinformation and enable effective law enforcement.“While all crimes are serious and demand accountability, the data demonstrates that most incidents involving minority victims were not driven by communal hostility, but by broader criminal and social factors that affect citizens across religious and ethnic lines,” it said.However, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC) questioned the government’s assessment.“If the government thinks these are not communal incidents, the question then is whether anyone can take the law into their own hands,” BHBCUC leader Kajal Debnath said, warning that such statements could embolden criminals and create a sense of impunity.India has repeatedly raised concerns over attacks on minorities in Bangladesh, particularly Hindus. On January 9, external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “We continue to witness a disturbing pattern of recurring attacks on minorities as well as their homes and businesses by extremists,” adding that such incidents must be dealt with “swiftly and firmly”.Relations between India and Bangladesh have remained strained since the interim government headed by Yunus took charge following the collapse of the Sheikh Hasina government in August 2024, with New Delhi continuing to flag concerns over minority safety.","Bangladesh's interim government says majority of incidents involving members of minority communities in the country during 2025 were “criminal in nature’ The government says only 71 of the 645 cases recorded had communal elements.

China witnessed a miracle when a boy, who is just three years old, miraculously survived an extraordinary 18-storey fall from his residential building, with a tree breaking his fall.The event occurred on July 15 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, southeastern China, while the young boy was under his grandparents' supervision, South China Morning Post reported.The grandparents had stepped out briefly to purchase groceries, believing the child was asleep. They secured the flat's door to ensure his safety.Upon waking, the child entered the bathroom, which had an unprotected window. He climbed onto the toilet and subsequently the window, from which he fell.A tree intercepted his fall, enabling his survival. His father later placed a large red flower on the tree in appreciation.A passing resident discovered him and recorded a video, sharing it with the property management.The father, Zhu, initially doubted the 18-storey fall until viewing surveillance footage. He explained that an open window on the 17th floor altered his son's falling path, directing him towards the tree that cushioned his landing.At the hospital, staff termed his survival miraculous. His injuries included a broken left arm, spinal strain and internal organ damage, though his head remained uninjured.Remarkably, the conscious child requested: ""Ask Daddy to buy me a Bumblebee.""Zhu presented a large red flower to the tree, a traditional Chinese symbol of honour. The incident sparked online discussions, with comments ranging from criticism of parental oversight to expressions of relief at the boy's survival.","Three-year-old boy falls from 18-storey building in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China.

Devil’s Den murders row: Former teacher a 'monster’; tickled little girls and gave 'lot of special treatment',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/devils-den-murders-row-former-teacher-a-monster-tickled-little-girls-and-gave-lot-of-special-treatment/articleshow/123054374.cms,"



A former primary school teacher accused of brutally murdering a married couple in front of their two daughters at Devil’s Den State Park in Arkansas had previously displayed alarming behaviour towards young girls at a school in Texas, a concerned parent has claimed.Andrew James McGann, 28, is accused of stabbing Clinton David Brink, 43, and Cristen Amanda Brink, 41, to death on Saturday, while their daughters, aged 9 and 7, fled the scene unharmed.Authorities said McGann later confessed to the killing and was charged with capital murder following a five-day manhunt.In an interview with New York Post on Friday, Zacharri Polyak, whose son attended Donald Elementary School in Flower Mound, Texas, when McGann was a teacher there, alleged deeply troubling past behaviour.“This monster was around our children,” he said. Polyak recalled that McGann once put a little girl on his lap and said “things like, ‘I wish I could date you, I wish you could be my girlfriend,’ just really nasty like grooming behavior.”He also claimed McGann showed “a lot of special treatment to girls in particular,” adding, “He was giving them candy, bringing them Sonic drinks, playing tag with them, tickling them, just really suspect behavior.”Lewisville Independent school district, which oversees Donald Elementary, told New York Post that McGann was placed on administrative leave during the 2022–2023 academic year “following concerns related to classroom management, professional judgement, and student favoritism.”However, the district said an internal investigation “found no evidence of inappropriate behavior with students.” McGann resigned in May 2023.Polyak criticised the school’s response, “It should have been an immediate firing with reports to Child Protective Services,” he said.Another parent, Sierra Marcum, whose son was in McGann’s fourth-grade class, described him as distant and disengaged. “[He was] pretty cold. You could ask him a question, and he would give you a one-word response,” she told WFAA.“Overall, just pretty disinterested in his students.”Marcum said she raised concerns with the school after her son came home visibly upset. “Eventually, he told me that he and some other classmates had noticed that Mr. McGann was very touchy and showed a lot of favoritism to certain girls in the class,” she said. “I guess [the murder allegations] did surprise me, because while I thought he was off, I never thought he was violent.”McGann was later hired for the 2023–2024 school year at Spring Creek Elementary in Oklahoma. The district said McGann passed all legally mandated national background checks, and there had been no disciplinary issues during his time there.He had also secured a job at Springdale Public Schools in Arkansas, where he was due to start teaching in a week. Superintendent Jared Cleveland confirmed McGann’s hiring, but stressed that he “has not at any time come into contact with Springdale students or the families we serve,” according to 5 News.The shocking murders took place on a hiking trail in the Arkansas state park. Authorities say McGann ambushed the Brink couple, stabbing them to death while their daughters escaped and raised the alarm. He was eventually located and arrested mid-haircut at a local barbershop.McGann appeared in court on Friday (local time) and was ordered to be held without bail. Investigators have not yet established a motive for the killings.","Andrew James McGann, 28, is accused of stabbing a married couple to death in front of their two daughters.

"Washington mansion killings: 15-year-old 'killed' parents, siblings; was raised in ‘militant survivalist’ home",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/washington-mansion-killings-15-year-old-killed-parents-siblings-was-raised-in-militant-survivalist-home/articleshow/123053591.cms,"



A 15-year-old boy accused of murdering nearly his entire family in their $2 million lakeside mansion in suburban Seattle was raised under a “rigid, militant survivalist ideology” and kept isolated from the outside world, according to new court documents filed last week.Prosecutors allege that the teenager, whose identity remains protected due to his age, fatally shot his parents, Mark and Sarah Humiston, as well as his siblings Benjamin, 13, Joshua, 9, and Katheryn, 7, in the early hours of a morning in October last year.Only his 11-year-old sister survived after pretending to be dead when he shot her in the neck and hand. She managed to escape through a window and ran to a neighbour’s home for help.Court filings, obtained by KOMO News, suggest the family lived an extremely secluded and controlled life shaped by religious extremism and deep distrust of government and medical authorities.“A common theme that has been expressed amongst extended family, neighbors, and those who knew the Humistons is that the children were isolated from the outside world and did not engage socially with many peers – only a select few families that went to their church and were friends of their family,” the documents said, as cited by the New York Post.“Furthermore, initial reports indicate the home was abusive, tightly controlled, and dominated by extreme religious beliefs.”The children were homeschooled, and the entire family reportedly adhered to a rigid lifestyle based on survivalist values. The Humistons were described as intensely paranoid about government interference, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and harboured deep mistrust of medical professionals, especially in relation to the vaccine.According to the defence team, all the children had access to firearms, and it was Mark Humiston’s own handgun that the teenager used to carry out the massacre. Charging documents claim he opened fire at around 5 am, methodically checking the pulses of his victims after shooting them, New York Post reported.Despite the brutality of the attack, nearly 100 interviews with family members and acquaintances painted the boy as “kind, respectful, and deeply devoted to his family.”Even his maternal grandmother expressed sympathy for the accused, reportedly telling investigators that Sarah Humiston “was abusive and demeaning to the children,” and that she had once threatened to report the parents for alleged mistreatment.In an apparent effort to mislead investigators, the boy called 911 after the killings and claimed his 13-year-old brother had shot the family before killing himself after being caught viewing pornography the night before. He is said to have staged the crime scene to support this narrative, even placing the murder weapon in his brother’s hand before first responders arrived.The teen was arrested at the scene and now faces five counts of first-degree aggravated murder and one count of first-degree attempted murder.",15-year-old accused of murdering his entire family in their $2 million lakeside mansion in suburban Seattle.

'Too late Powell': Trump calls out Fed chief on interest rates; demands Jerome to step down after Kugler exits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/too-late-powell-trump-calls-out-fed-chief-on-interest-rates-demands-jerome-to-step-down-after-kugler-exits/articleshow/123053526.cms,"



Donald Trump has called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to resign, intensifying his attacks on the central bank’s leadership after Fed governor Adriana Kugler announced her early departure.“'Too Late' Powell should resign, just like Adriana Kugler, a Biden Appointee, resigned. She knew he was doing the wrong thing on Interest Rates. He should resign, also!” the US president wrote Friday(local time) on his social media platform, Truth Social.The post follows Trump’s earlier attacks on Powell, where he called him “too stupid” and “too political” for the job. “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell has done it again!!! He is TOO LATE, and actually, TOO ANGRY, TOO STUPID, & TOO POLITICAL, to have the job of Fed Chair,” he wrote.Trump further accused Powell of costing the country “TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS, in addition to one of the most incompetent, or corrupt, renovations of a building(s) in the history of construction,” adding, “Put another way, ‘Too Late’ is a TOTAL LOSER, and our Country is paying the price!”These comments follow the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates steady for a fifth straight meeting, despite his repeated demands for aggressive cuts.Trump has consistently argued that inflation is overstated and that slashing rates would stimulate growth, benefit homebuyers and ease the federal budget. However, the Fed’s preferred inflation metric is currently running at 2.6% annually, above its 2% target, and many economists warn that deep rate cuts could stoke inflation further.Fed governor Adriana Kugler, appointed by Joe Biden, also announced her resignation today, effective 8 August. This resignation came several months before her term was due to end in January 2026.Speaking to reporters, Trump claimed Kugler’s resignation was tied to disagreements over interest rates.“I understand it was over the fact that she disagreed with somebody from her party …she disagreed with ‘Too Late’ on the interest rate,” he said, as quoted by CNN.However, Trump said he was “very happy” to have an open seat on the Fed Board.","Donald Trump has called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to resign.

"Frozen in time: Tattooed remains of 2,500-year-old Siberian ‘ice mummy’ revealed; how were they made millennia ago?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/frozen-in-time-tattooed-remains-of-2500-year-old-siberian-ice-mummy-revealed-how-were-they-made-millennia-ago/articleshow/123035197.cms,"



In many cultures, tattoos have long symbolised rebellion or a break from tradition. But for others, they are deeply personal, woven into identity, heritage, and belief. Such was the case for the ancient Pazyryk people.An intricate body art of a 2,500-year-old Siberian “ice mummy” from this nomadic tribe has been uncovered using advanced infrared imaging, offering an extraordinary glimpse into their sophisticated tattooing culture and way of life.Discovered in 1993 on the Okok Plateau in Russia’s Altai Mountains, the mummy is believed to have belonged to a nomadic Pazyryk tribe that roamed the Eurasian plains between the 6th and 3rd centuries BC.Nicknamed as the “Ice Maiden”, the remarkably preserved 50-year-old woman is one of three bodies found frozen in permafrost, her skin still marked with striking inked designs across much of her body.Thanks to high-resolution infrared imaging, researchers have now uncovered a detailed array of animal motifs etched into her skin, including a leopard, stag, rooster and a griffin-like creature.Her arms are adorned with the leopard and stag, a half-lion half-eagle beast rests on her leg, while a rooster is inked onto her thumb, New York Post reported.Gino Caspari, lead researcher from the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology, told the BBC, “The insights really drive home to me the point of how sophisticated these people were.”“This made me feel like we were much closer to seeing the people behind the art, how they worked and learned. The images came alive,” he added.Caspari estimated the time and effort involved in tattooing the Ice Maiden, remarking, “If I was guessing, it was probably four and a half hours for the lower half of the right arm, and another five hours for the upper part.”“That’s a solid commitment from the person,” the researcher added.Emphasising the skill involved, Caspari said, “It would need to be performed by a person who knows health and safety, who knows the risks of what happens when the skin is punctured.”The tattoos were created using a process similar to modern techniques, starting with a stencil applied to the skin before the ink was inserted with a needle-like instrument.“And back in the day it was already a really professional practice where people put a lot of time and effort and practice into creating these images and they’re extremely sophisticated.”The study suggests that the tattoos held significance during life rather than in the afterlife, shedding light on the cultural practices and artistry of the Pazyryk tribe.“It suggests that tattoos were really something for the living with meaning during life, but that they didn’t really play much of a role in the afterlife,” Caspari concluded.","2,500-year-old Siberian ‘ice mummy’ has intricate tattoos on her skin.

Hundreds gathered at a New York mosque on Thursday to commemorate a Bangladesh-born police officer who lost his life protecting his adopted city when a shooter attacked an office building this week.Officer Didarul Islam ""did believe in the American dream, not as something handed down but as something built with your own hands,"" Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch addressed Islam's community as officers stood in formation outside the Bronx religious centre.Officials and New York's Bangladeshi community members gathered to honour the deceased officer during a service that highlighted his dedication to family, heritage and public service.The 36-year-old officer, a married father of two expecting a third child, was conducting an NYPD-approved private security assignment in uniform when he and three others were fatally shot Monday at the Manhattan high-rise housing the NFL's headquarters and various corporate offices.""To our family, he was our world. To the city, he was a proud NYPD officer who served with compassion and integrity. He lived to help others,"" Islam's widow said in a message delivered by a family member at the Parkchester Jame Masjid mosque, according to the Associated Press.Officers positioned on nearby rooftops provided security whilst fire engines displayed a large American flag across the street. A vehicle carried a digital display showing Islam's photographs and a tribute from his union.After immigrating to the United States, Islam established his career in America's largest police department. He viewed policing as ""a blanket of the community, there to provide comfort and care,"" according to the police commissioner.Initially serving as a school safety agent, Islam became a patrol officer less than four years ago and received a posthumous promotion to detective on Thursday.""He could have gone into any other occupation he wanted, but he wanted to put on that uniform, and he wanted to protect fellow New Yorkers. And he wanted to let us know that he believed in what this city and what this country stood for,"" Mayor Eric Adams told attendees.In Washington, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt commenced her briefing by conveying President Donald Trump's sympathies to Islam's family, noting he ""made the ultimate sacrifice in defence of his fellow New Yorkers.""Imam Zakir Ahmed emphasised the officer's immigrant background and Muslim faith, whilst noting Islam ""lived at a time when people like him are too often feared, vilified and made to feel like outsiders.""Following the service, attendees filled the streets for prayer, including Muslim officers, as their colleagues maintained formation behind them.The officer's casket, adorned with US and NYPD flags, was transported to Totowa, New Jersey, for burial.Julia Hyman, 27, another victim who worked at a real estate firm, was remembered at a Manhattan synagogue service on Wednesday.Funeral arrangements remain unannounced for security guard Aland Etienne and executive Wesley LePatner.Police identified Shane Tamura, 27, as the assailant, a former football player who recently worked in Las Vegas casino surveillance.

What is Desmond Watson doing during Buccaneers training camp?

Tampa Bay Buccaneers player Desmond Watson is in a very challenging position due to his weight. Here, July 2025, the team's training camp is already well under way in Tampa, Florida. At around 450 pounds, Desmond Watson is still not allowed to participate in team activities. You can almost feel how much he wants to play as he walks laps under the hot sun. But until he meets the team’s fitness standards, he must wait.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's biggest fear: ChatGPT-5 is coming in August and Altman is scared — know why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/openai-ceo-sam-altmans-biggest-fear-chatgpt-5-is-coming-in-august-and-altman-is-scared-know-why/articleshow/123034747.cms,"ChatGPT-5 feels “very fast,” says Sam Altman

ChatGPT-5 could redefine intelligence and risk

A stepping stone to AGI?

Internal and external pressure on OpenAI





As artificial intelligence continues to advance at an astonishing pace, even the leaders at its forefront are beginning to voice concern. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has openly admitted feeling “scared” about the upcoming release of GPT-5, the newest and most powerful version of ChatGPT. Scheduled to launch in August 2025, GPT-5 is expected to significantly surpass its predecessors in speed and capability. Yet it is precisely this rapid evolution that has led Altman to compare its development to the Manhattan Project. His candid remarks, shared during a recent podcast appearance, highlight growing unease about the lack of oversight, ethical uncertainty, and the accelerating race toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).Speaking on Theo Von’s This Past Weekend podcast, Altman confessed that testing GPT-5 left him with a profound sense of unease. “It feels very fast,” he said, referring not just to the model’s impressive processing power, but to the alarming speed at which AI is advancing overall. His remarks echoed the reflective anxiety of scientists involved in the Manhattan Project, who, after creating the atomic bomb, grappled with the unintended consequences of their innovation.Altman invoked a similar moment of reckoning, asking rhetorically, “What have we done?” The comparison underscores his concern that GPT-5, like nuclear technology before it, may mark a pivotal turning point—one where humanity’s ability to build something outpaces its readiness to understand or control the fallout.He emphasized that while technical achievements are accelerating, the moral, social, and legal frameworks to contain them are not keeping pace. He explicitly stated that testing GPT-5 left him “very nervous” and that its development feels reminiscent of a science fiction thriller.One of Altman’s most pointed comments was about the lack of control in AI development. “It feels like there are no adults in the room,” he said, suggesting that regulatory frameworks have not kept up with AI's breakneck speed. While OpenAI advocates for responsible deployment, the pace at which GPT-5 was built may have outstripped safety protocols and human readiness. These remarks have sparked fresh debate about who, if anyone, is truly in charge of monitoring such transformative technologies.While specifics about GPT-5 remain under wraps, insiders suggest it will feature major upgrades over GPT-4, including improved multi-step reasoning, longer memory, and more advanced multimodal capabilities. It is also expected to reduce model-switching delays, offering more seamless user interactions. But with power comes risk. Altman has openly said that GPT-4 “kind of sucks” compared to what’s coming next. That raises alarms about how much more potent and possibly uncontrollable GPT-5 could be. Concerns are mounting about how society will distinguish between authentic human thought and AI-generated insightAltman has long discussed AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, as OpenAI’s north star. But GPT-5 may be the company’s closest step yet to that goal. While Altman once claimed the arrival of AGI would pass with little societal upheaval, his new tone is more cautionary. If GPT-5 gets us significantly closer to AGI-level capabilities, the lack of global consensus on how to manage such a leap could become a major problem. The shift from AI that assists to AI that independently reasons and acts could happen faster than institutions can respond.Behind the scenes, OpenAI is reportedly under immense pressure from investors to transition into a for-profit entity by year-end. With Microsoft holding a 13.5 billion dollar stake in the company, and other competitors like Google DeepMind and Perplexity.ai surging forward, GPT-5 could be a make-or-break moment. Some reports even suggest OpenAI might declare AGI prematurely to end its contract with Microsoft, triggering new power dynamics in the AI sector.While some observers have dismissed Altman’s remarks as theatrical marketing, his track record suggests otherwise. His fear appears genuine, not of AI turning evil, but of humans losing control over the systems they’ve built. In a space where speed is often equated with success, Altman’s words might be the first honest pause in a race most of the world barely understands.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has openly admitted feeling “scared” about the upcoming release of GPT-5, the newest and most powerful version of ChatGPT.

Docus that hint at Hillary role in plan to tie Trump to Russia false?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/docus-that-hint-at-hillary-role-in-plan-to-tie-trump-to-russia-false/articleshow/123052613.cms,"



The Trump-era special counsel who scoured the Russia investigation for wrongdoing gathered evidence that undermines a theory pushed by some Republicans that Hillary Clinton 's campaign conspired to frame Donald Trump for colluding with Moscow in the 2016 election, information declassified on Thursday shows.The information, a 29-page annex to the special counsel's 2023 report, reveals that a foundational document for that theory was most likely stitched together by Russian spies. The document is a purported email from July 27, 2016, that said Hillary had approved a campaign proposal to tie Trump to Russia to distract from the scandal over her use of a private email server.The release of the annex adds new details to the public's understanding of a complex trove of 2016 Russian intelligence reports analysing purported emails that Russian hackers stole from Americans. It also shows how the special counsel, John Durham, went to great lengths to try to prove that several of the emails were real, only to ultimately conclude otherwise.The release of the annex was no exception. John Ratcliffe, the CIA director, said in a statement that the materials proved that suspicions of Russian collusion stemmed from ""a coordinated plan to prevent and destroy Donald Trump's presidency.""Kash Patel, the FBI director, declared on social media that the annex revealed ""evidence that the Clinton campaign plotted to frame President Trump and fabricate the Russia collusion hoax.""In reality, the annex shows the opposite, indicating that a key piece of supposed evidence for the claim that Hillary approved a plan to tie Trump to Russia is not credible: Durham concluded that the email from July 27, 2016, and a related one dated two days earlier were probably manufactured.Before the 2020 election, Ratcliffe, as director of national intelligence in Trump's first term, had declassified and released the crux of the July 27 email, even though he acknowledged doubts about its credibility. Officials did ""not know the accuracy of this allegation or the extent to which the Russian intelligence analysis may reflect exaggeration or fabrication,"" he said. Among some Trump supporters, the message became known as the ""Clinton Plan intelligence,"" as Durham put it in his final report.In his report, Durham used the US govt's knowledge of the supposed plan, via the Russian memos, to criticise FBI officials involved in the Russia investigation for not being more sceptical when they later received a copy of the Steele dossier and used it to obtain a wiretap order. Durham's report also mentioned that Clinton and others in the campaign dismissed the allegation as ridiculous. But Durham banished to the annex concrete details he had found that bolstered her campaign's rebuttal, burying until now the conclusion that the email he called the ""Clinton Plan intelligence"" was Russian disinformation.Durham was never able to prove any Clinton campaign conspiracy to frame Trump by spreading information that it knew to be false, but he used court filings to insinuate such suspicions. He brought charges of false statements against two people involved in efforts to scrutinize possible ties between Trump and Russia, which ended in acquittals.","A 29-page annex to the special counsel's 2023 report reveals that a foundational document for that theory was most likely stitched together by Russian spies. The document is a purported email from July 27, 2016, that said Hillary had approved a campaign proposal to tie Trump to Russia to distract from the scandal over her private email server.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123052623,imgsize-26654,width-400,resizemode-4/123052623.jpg"

The federal govt is suspending certain research funding to the University of California at Los Angeles, citing concerns about antisemitism and bias on campus, according UCLA chancellor Julio Frenk.In a message to students and staff, Frenk said the freeze could affect hundreds of grants from agencies including the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. He called the decision a blow to researchers and the broader public who benefit from their work in areas such as medical innovation and space exploration. ""This far-reaching penalty of de-funding life-saving research does nothing to address any alleged discrimination,"" Frenk said in the message on Thursday. The Los Angeles Times reported that the suspended grants are worth roughly $200 million.The funding freeze follows a federal investigation that found UCLA violated federal civil rights laws by failing to address antisemitic harassment on campus. This week, the department of justice's civil rights division said the university acted with ""deliberate indifference"" to reports of abuse targeting Jewish and Israeli students since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and the ensuing conflict. The department cited UCLA for failing to meet its legal obligations under the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.

Four people were killed Friday morning when a gunman opened fire at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana, before fleeing the scene and prompting a massive manhunt and town-wide lockdown by afternoon.The Montana Division of Criminal Investigation confirmed the shooting occurred around 10.30 am. All four victims were pronounced dead at the scene.Authorities swiftly launched a search operation, concentrating efforts in the nearby Stump Town area west of Anaconda, reported AP. More than a dozen local and state law enforcement officers, supported by helicopters, drones, and K9 units, joined the manhunt.The suspect, identified as Michael Paul Brown, lived next door to the bar and his home was cleared by a Swat team shortly after the incident.45-year-old Michael Paul Brown, also known as ""Mike,"" is a resident of Anaconda. He was reportedly last seen wearing a tie-dyed shirt, blue jeans, and an orange bandana.Authorities say Brown is believed to be armed with a .762-caliber assault rifle and was last seen driving a 2007 white Ford F-150 pickup truck with Montana license plate DTY493. He was seen heading to the Stump Town area, which is just west of Anaconda.Brown is considered armed and extremely dangerous. Officials are urging the public not to approach him and to report any sightings to 911 immediately.The owner of the Firefly Café in Anaconda said she closed her shop around 11 am Friday after a friend informed her about the shooting. Two hours later, she was still waiting for the official all-clear to reopen.“It’s a small town, so we all probably know someone who was there” at the shooting, she said as quoted by AP.Anaconda, a historic mining town with a population of about 9,000, is located roughly 75 miles southeast of Missoula. Surrounded by mountains and steeped in copper mining history, the town was founded in the late 1800s and is known for the massive, now-defunct smelter that still towers over the landscape.","Four people were killed Friday morning when a gunman opened fire at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana.

Local stations, iconic programming face fallout





The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), a pillar of American media for nearly six decades, announced Friday that it will begin a formal shutdown process following the complete loss of federal funding by the Trump administration. The decision comes after Congress rescinded $1.1 billion in appropriations for the next two budget years, effectively eliminating the organization's lifeline.“This marks the end of a historic era in which public broadcasting played an essential role in shaping America’s cultural and educational landscape,” said Patricia Harrison, CPB’s president and CEO.“Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations,” she added as quoted by AP.The move was driven by US President Trump, who has long targeted public broadcasting, labeling the CPB a “monstrosity” and accusing it of promoting cultural and political narratives he considers “un-American.” His administration has also shut down other publicly funded media institutions, including Voice of America, and in April, Trump dismissed three CPB board members in what they described as a politically motivated overreach.The senate appropriations committee reinforced the funding cut on Thursday by excluding CPB from its annual budget bill for the first time in more than 50 years. Democratic lawmakers made a final push to restore funding, but the effort fell short. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) offered, then withdrew, an amendment to reinstate funds, saying she would continue working to ""fix this before there are devastating consequences. ""In response, senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said, “We litigated this two weeks ago. Adopting this amendment would have been contrary to what we have already voted on.”Founded in 1967 and signed into law by former President Lyndon B Johnson, CPB has funded more than 1,500 public radio and TV stations, especially in small and rural communities. It has supported iconic programming such as “Sesame Street,” “Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,” NPR’s “All Things Considered,” and the documentaries of Ken Burns. It also plays a critical role in delivering emergency alerts and public safety communications across the country.Most of CPB’s funding has gone directly to local stations, including 330 PBS and 246 NPR affiliates. Roughly 70% of federal funding is distributed at the local level. NPR president and CEO Katherine Maher recently noted that about 96% of classical music broadcasts in the US air on public radio stations- programming that may now be in jeopardy.As part of its shutdown, CPB informed staff on Friday that most positions will end by September 30, the close of the fiscal year. A small transition team will stay on through January to manage final operations, including music licensing and royalty agreements.“Public media has been one of the most trusted institutions in American life, providing educational opportunity, emergency alerts, civil discourse, and cultural connection to every corner of the country,” Harrison said as quoted by AP.“We are deeply grateful to our partners across the system for their resilience, leadership, and unwavering dedication to serving the American people.”","The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) announced Friday that it will begin a formal shutdown process following the complete loss of federal funding.

""My jeans are blue,"" she said, triggering row that the ad was glorifying good genes.""I actually thought that one of the lessons (Democrats) might take is 'we're going to be less crazy.'

A Miami federal jury on Friday ordered Tesla to pay $329 million in damages over a deadly 2019 crash involving its Autopilot driver-assistance system, a rare courtroom defeat that could have major implications for the company and its self-driving technology.The verdict came after the jury found Tesla’s Autopilot system shared responsibility for the crash that killed 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and seriously injured her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo.The couple had been stargazing by the roadside in Key Largo, Florida, when they were struck by a Tesla vehicle. The driver admitted to being distracted by his cellphone but claimed he had relied on the Autopilot feature to control the car, reported AP.Jurors determined that Tesla's technology had failed to prevent the collision and that the company could not shift all blame to the human behind the wheel. The decision marks one of the first times Tesla has been held publicly accountable by a jury for a fatal crash involving its driver-assist software.The outcome comes at a critical time for Tesla and CEO Elon Musk, who is preparing to launch a fully driverless taxi service in several cities and continues to champion the safety of Tesla’s autonomous driving technology.The four-year legal battle revealed claims by the victims’ attorneys that Tesla had either hidden or misplaced key crash data, including internal logs and video footage recorded just before the impact. After a forensic expert hired by the plaintiffs uncovered the data, Tesla acknowledged it had the information but said it had been unaware of its location.The case stood out not just for its outcome, but because it made it to trial. Many similar lawsuits involving Tesla crashes have either been dismissed or quietly settled. Legal experts believe this verdict could change that.“This will open the floodgates,” said Miguel Custodio, a personal injury attorney not involved in the case, as quoted by AP. “It will embolden a lot of people to come to court.”Tesla has faced previous accusations of being slow to provide crash data to victims’ families — claims the company has consistently denied. In this case, however, the jury sided with the plaintiffs, concluding the automaker was at least partially responsible.","Jurors found Tesla's Autopilot system shared responsibility for the crash that killed 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and seriously injured her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo.

ISLAMABAD:





In a symbolic assertion of strategic alignment, Pakistan’s military hosted on Friday a grand ceremony at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi to mark the 98th anniversary of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), showcasing its deepening defence partnership with Beijing.The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump just days after Washington and Islamabad concluded new trade deals.While the tariff decision is believed to have been discussed between the two sides as part of broader trade negotiations, Trump’s typically blunt commentary on social media appeared aimed more at India than Pakistan. In recent days, Trump has taken jabs at New Delhi over its continued purchase of Russian oil and defence equipment, while casting Pakistan in a more favourable light.At GHQ, however, Pakistan’s military made its strategic loyalties unambiguous. Army Chief Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir hosted Chinese ambassador Jiang Zaidong and PLA defence attaché Maj Gen Wang Zhong at a ceremony that included military tributes, visuals of joint defence hardware, and strong political messaging. Munir described the Pakistan-China relationship as a “beacon of mutual trust and shared destiny” and referred to the PLA and Pakistan Army as “iron brothers”.The messaging was clear: Pakistan is reaffirming its long-standing alignment with China even as it navigates transactional ties with Washington and economic turbulence at home. With IMF conditionalities tightening and Western funding streams growing unpredictable, Islamabad continues to anchor itself in Beijing’s strategic orbit, particularly through projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).For China, the event was a diplomatic win. As Beijing faces intensifying rivalry with the US across the Indo-Pacific, its deepening influence over a nuclear-armed ally in South Asia reinforces its foothold in the region. The GHQ ceremony was a visual and political endorsement of China’s role as Islamabad’s primary defence and development partner.With Pakistan and China enhancing defence cooperation and projecting unity, New Delhi faces a more tightly aligned northern bloc just as it expands its own security ties with the US and with Indo-Pacific allies.Despite the potential economic fallout of the US tariffs, Rawalpindi appears undeterred. In an era of fluid alliances, Pakistan is betting on consistency with Beijing over the unpredictability of Western partners, a gamble that could reshape the regional balance in the years ahead.",Pakistan hosted ceremony to mark 98th anniversary of China's People's Liberation Army.

"Glacial bursts, cloudbursts kill 293 in Pakistan; another monsoon spell looms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/glacial-bursts-cloudbursts-kill-293-in-pakistan-another-monsoon-spell-looms/articleshow/122983132.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June as glacial lake outbursts, cloudbursts, and relentless monsoon rains triggered catastrophic floods across the country, from the Himalayas to the southern plains.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of another severe monsoon spell starting July 29, raising fears of fresh flash floods and landslides, especially in northern regions like Swat, Chitral, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Torrential rains have wreaked havoc across the country, sweeping away entire families, burying homes under landslides, and cutting off remote valleys. A sudden cloudburst near Babusar Top and Naran stranded scores of tourists, prompting military-led rescue operations by air and road. Washed-away bridges and blocked highways have hampered relief efforts.The NDMA, provincial agencies, and army teams are on the ground, but operations remain slow and patchy, especially in the hard-to-reach northern areas. Helicopter sorties continue, though poor weather and visibility are disrupting missions.Experts blame successive govts for ignoring climate adaptation and disaster preparedness, despite warnings. “The pattern is repeating itself — glacial melts, erratic monsoons, unprepared institutions. It’s a deadly mix,” said a disaster risk analyst in Islamabad.The crisis echoes the devastating 2022 monsoon floods, which killed over 1,700, submerged a third of the country, and displaced over 30 million people, causing $30 billion in economic losses. Yet, activists say climate resilience remains absent from Pakistan’s national priorities.With more glaciers than any non-polar country, Pakistan faces an increasing frequency of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) due to rising temperatures. Add to that deforestation, poor drainage, and unregulated construction, and experts say even routine monsoons now turn deadly.As another deluge looms, govt has advised evacuations from high-risk zones and warned tourists to stay away from northern areas. But for many already stranded, the warnings have come too late.","At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June.

Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi, officials confirmed on Monday.Among those killed was Zafran, who was identified as the mastermind of a November 2024 attack on two Chinese engineers in Pakistan's largest city. He carried a bounty of Rs 20 million.The operation was conducted late Sunday night in the Manghopir area by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and intelligence agencies, CTD official Raja Umer Khattab told. The TTP men opened fire when they saw security personnel approaching, triggering a firefight which lasted over an hour.Authorities recovered a suicide jacket, three grenades, a Kalashnikov rifle, two pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition from the site.On November 5 last year, a private security guard opened fire on two Chinese nationals at a textile mill in Karachi, injuring both before fleeing.Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in militant attacks—particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan—since the TTP ended its ceasefire with the federal government in late 2022.Founded in 2007, the TTP is an umbrella organisation of various extremist groups seeking to impose a strict version of Islamic law across Pakistan. It has claimed responsibility for numerous high-profile attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad, the 2009 assault on army headquarters, and multiple strikes on security installations.","Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi.

Pakistan tribal council threatens highway block over girl’s murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tribal-council-threatens-highway-block-over-girls-murder/articleshow/122939897.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: A tribal jirga (council of elders) in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway on July 29 after the killing of a nine-year-old girl sparked public outrage. Convened in Tank’s Gul Imam on Saturday, the jirga issued an 11-point charter of demands, warning of a full blockade if authorities fail to respond.Indus Highway (N-55) is a critical national artery that runs along the river, connecting Karachi in Pakistan’s south with Peshawar in the north and cutting through multiple provinces. The planned blockade at Pezu will impact trade routes, passenger transport, and military convoys.The protests gained momentum after a viral video showed residents confronting armed security personnel -- an extraordinary act in this militarised stretch of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The footage amplified long-standing anger over arbitrary detentions, raids without warrants, and what locals call collective punishment disguised as counterterrorism.“Our decision to block the highway remains. If our demands are accepted, we’ll reconsider.If not, Pezu will be shut down on July 29,” jirga leader Abdul Qayum Kundi said.Police have registered a case in the girl’s death, but authorities have yet to disclose any findings. Locals allege misconduct or negligence by security forces—claims that remain unverified but widely believed within the community.In a bid to defuse tensions, local officials delivered three sheep and (Pak) Rs 2.5 million (around $9,000) to the girl’s family -- an act rooted in tribal custom, meant to symbolise remorse and reconciliation. But jirga members view it as a token gesture. “This is hush money in ceremonial form,” said one elder.The jirga’s demands include the release of detainees not proven to have militant ties, an end to forced house searches, and a halt to arrests of suspects’ relatives. They also call for the return of confiscated weapons and an end to detentions based on vague accusations of mukhbiri (spying).The jirga’s demands echo those of the banned Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which for years challenged Pakistan’s security policies in its tribal belt.","A tribal jirga in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway.

‘Reject Pakistani Rule’: BNM Accuses Pakistan of Genocide in Balochistan, Launches Armed Resistance

Poll Do you think that protests and appeals by families of the abducted individuals can lead to change? Yes, they can raise awareness. No, they are largely ineffective.





The crisis of enforced disappearances in Pakistan's Balochistan region and beyond has deepened this week, as a disturbing string of abductions emerges from Karachi, Noshki, and Kech, according to The Balochistan Post (TBP).Among the most alarming cases is that of Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi.On Monday evening, he was reportedly abducted near the university's Maskan Gate. Eyewitnesses say he was taken by unidentified men in a vehicle while returning to his hostel with friends.Originally from Mashkay in Awaran district, Muslim Dad was a familiar face within the Baloch student community in Karachi. His sudden disappearance has sparked fear among his peers and left his family devastated.In Noshki, another troubling case unfolded earlier today when Hafeezullah, the son of Peer Mohammad and a resident of Qaziabad, was allegedly picked up from his home by Pakistani security forces. His family has raised alarm over his unknown whereabouts and is demanding his immediate release.TBP also reported two recent disappearances in Kech district.On July 23, 16-year-old shopkeeper Qambar Baloch was allegedly taken by men believed to belong to Military Intelligence and the ISI while he was in Jusak, Turbat. And on June 27, Imran Khan, a 26-year-old student of Balochi language and culture at the University of Turbat, was reportedly abducted by Frontier Corps and Military Intelligence personnel in Turbat city—in broad daylight.“These are not isolated cases. This is a pattern,” said a representative from Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), a group that has long campaigned for the safe recovery of abducted individuals. Despite repeated appeals and protests, most cases remain unresolved, with no accountability or formal investigations.","Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi, was reportedly abducted on Monday.

Pakistan Blames India For Tensions, Credits Trump For Ceasefire Between Nuclear Rivals





Beijing/Islamabad: Pakistan army chief Asim Munir, who is on his first visit to China after his elevation as the field marshal, on Friday held talks with top Chinese leaders and discussed ways to deepen cooperation across all sectors. Munir held separate meetings with V-P Han Zheng, top military official general Zhang Youxia and foreign minister Wang Yi, according to official media reports.This is Munir's first visit to China after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistam in response to the Pahalgam terror attack.

ISLAMABAD: As jailed former PM Imran Khan completes two years in prison, his sons – Sulaiman and Qasim – have stepped into the political spotlight, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release just days before Khan’s call for a nationwide protest on Aug 5, which has put the state on edge.Khan, arrested on Aug 5, 2023, remains behind bars despite some convictions being overturned. He is currently serving time in three major cases that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claims are part of a broader effort to keep him out of politics.He was convicted in the Toshakhana case, involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during his premiership. He was sentenced in the cipher case, accused of leaking classified diplomatic correspondence for political gain. And in the Al-Qadir Trust case, Khan and his wife were held liable for controversial land deals linked to a charitable trust.PTI has consistently maintained that the charges are politically motivated, aimed at “eliminating the most popular leader” in the country.Now, with most of PTI’s senior leadership jailed, exiled, or forced to resign, Khan’s sons have taken the international route. Based in the UK, the brothers have held meetings in Washington DC with US lawmakers, policy groups and human rights organisations, and are reportedly preparing to testify before congressional panels.Their message: Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in inhumane conditions, denied light, medical access, and family contact.The campaign has triggered speculation about whether the two sons might return to Pakistan, possibly to appear at the planned protest. While PTI has not confirmed this, party insiders say their presence could act as a powerful morale boost for the party’s dispersed support base.Meanwhile, the state has moved swiftly to neutralise any protest momentum. On July 22, an anti-terror court in Lahore sentenced eight senior PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, to 10 years in prison for their alleged role in the May 9 riots, when military installations were targeted after Khan’s initial arrest. Observers see the convictions as a tactical strike to undercut mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 protest. The verdicts have raised concerns among legal experts about the selective use of terrorism laws against political opponents.From prison, Khan has issued a call for unity among PTI ranks, urging supporters to “shun differences” and prepare for what he called a decisive moment for Pakistan’s democracy. But the party remains fractured and leaderless, with ongoing rifts between loyalists and factions seen as open to negotiations with the establishment.At the heart of the political storm is the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was controversially elevated to five-star rank in May. PTI blames him, along with PML-N and PPP leaders, for orchestrating what it calls a civil-military clampdown to sideline Khan and crush dissent.In a recent prison note, Khan mocked Munir as the “King of the Jungle”, accusing him of ruling the country through “fear, not law”.","Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release.

A visa fraud network is being run by some Pakistani consultants who are exploiting loopholes in the UK immigration system, with one firm claiming a “98% success” rate for entry, according to a report by The Telegraph.The investigation found that forged documents, including fake CVs, employment letters, and bank statements, were being sold for up to £50,000 to secure work and student visas.

These falsified materials were used to meet UK immigration criteria.One such forged application, including a bogus employment letter from a non-existent hospital riddled with grammatical errors, was successfully used to secure a UK work visa, it said.UK-based immigration lawyer Harjap Bhangal blamed the nation's ""broken system"" which was ""easy to manipulate"".“If you claim asylum before that visa runs out, you can still work.

They have found their market. [It’s] quite a sophisticated scam.”Last year, Pakistanis filed 10,542 asylum applications in the UK, the highest from any single nationality and an 80% surge from the previous year, the report said citing government data.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Electric vehicles account for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal.

Royal love triangle: Charles wept over Camilla night before marrying Diana; insiders say wedding was doomed from day one,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/royal-love-triangle-charles-wept-over-camilla-night-before-marrying-diana-insiders-say-wedding-was-doomed-from-day-one/articleshow/123042136.cms,"Royal love triangle: Charles wept over Camilla night before marrying Diana; insiders say wedding was doomed from day one

But he wasn't the only one in tears.

Diana’s Final Confession Unearthed | Camilla’s Role EXPOSED: Homewrecker Or Scapegoat?

An affair of the heart—and protocol

A doomed beginning, a tragic legacy

Camilla's shadow and Diana's grief





Princess Diana and King Charles had one of the most captivating and dramatic weddings in the world, but new claims reveal that the fairy tale was cracking before the cake was even cut. King Charles III reportedly wept the night before his 1981 wedding to Princess Diana, not from joy, but because he was still deeply in love with his ex-girlfriend, Camilla.""They both cried,"" royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital, adding that Diana, too, was heartbroken and cried the night before her wedding.""Diana was reluctant about marrying Charles, but was told by her sister it was too late. The tea towels with their joint images were already being sold. Charles was given cufflinks with a Camilla insignia, which he wore on his wedding day so that she could be included, which allegedly made him emotional,"" Turner added.Charles' long-standing affection for Camilla has never been royal gossip—it's a historic record. But the latest wave of commentary underscores just how reluctant he was to marry Diana in the first place. According to People magazine and biographer Sally Bedell Smith, Charles broke down in private the night before the wedding, emotionally torn between personal love and royal obligation.The pressure to marry a ""suitable"" woman—young, virginal, and of aristocratic blood—was intense. Camilla, divorced and viewed as ""unsuitable"" by the monarchy and the Church of England, was out of the question.Still, Charles found his own way to keep her close: on the wedding day, he reportedly wore cufflinks engraved with Camilla's insignia, a silent symbol of defiance or desperation—depending on who you ask.Royal expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News, Charles felt forced into marriage by Prince Philip and other senior royals who wanted him to fulfil his duty. His godmother, Patricia Mountbatten, reportedly warned him against marrying Diana, knowing he was emotionally entangled with Camilla.Even during the honeymoon, tensions simmered. Diana discovered a bracelet Charles had commissioned for Camilla, further fueling suspicions and anguish. The emotional rift widened due to stark age differences, opposing interests, and Diana's growing mental health struggles, including bulimia.""From the start, the public preferred the princess, though privately she was angst-ridden and bulimic,"" said royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams told Fox News.Despite Charles’ emotional turmoil, Diana reportedly entered the marriage with genuine hope. But as she came to understand Camilla's continuing presence in Charles' heart—and life—her optimism eroded.Her infamous 1995 BBC interview summed up the tragedy in one piercing line: ""Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.""Camilla even attended the wedding, then married to Andrew Parker Bowles and dressed in pale grey, not white as was often rumoured. Her presence was unavoidable, much like her influence on Charles.","King Charles III reportedly wept the night before his 1981 wedding to Princess Diana, not from joy, but because he was still deeply in love with his ex- girlfriend, Camilla.

What's behind UK foreign policy change on Palestinian state?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/whats-behind-uk-foreign-policy-change-on-palestinian-state/articleshow/123041154.cms,"What's behind UK foreign policy change on Palestinian state?

Labour Party supporters favor Palestinian state

Agencies warn of starvation in Gaza

Trump says Starmer 'rewarding Hamas'





The new direction for the UK's foreign policy regarding the Middle East came shortly after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met with US President Donald Trump in Scotland.Just a day later, on July 29, Starmer interrupted his cabinet ministers' summer break for an emergency meeting, after which the policy turnaround was presented in London.In a statement, Starmer, the leader of the center-left labour party, said the UK could recognise Palestine as a state as soon as September unless Israel's government moved toward meeting certain conditions, including a ceasefire, not annexing the occupied West Bank and committing to a long-term peace process.Britain believes ""statehood is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people,"" Starmer said. His government is using the recognition of a Palestinian state as a means of political pressure to push forward the so-called two-state solution.Until now, the UK has delayed its recognition of a Palestinian state in part because of the country's own historical responsibility. Between 1920 and 1948, Britain was the administrative power in Palestine, which had previously been part of the Ottoman Empire.In 1917, the British government issued a statement — the Balfour Declaration, named after then-British Foreign Minister Arthur Balfour — that said it supported the idea of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" in Palestine.The declaration was made without considering the rights of the Arab majority population there and the move went on to spark violence between local Arabs, immigrant Jews and the British administration.Two years after David Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister of Israel, announced the establishment of the State of Israel, Britain recognised the country. But when it came to recognising Palestine as a state, the UK regularly said that this had to be part of a peace deal. This was also strategic: Britain didn't want to jeopardize its relationships with the US or Israel.But this historical position has come under ever more pressure. The ongoing conflict in Gaza — fighting there began in October 2023 after an attack on Israel by the Gaza-based militant group Hamas, that resulted in the deaths of around 1,200 people and the kidnapping of 251 — has sowed serious internal divisions in the UK.In cities like London, Manchester and Glasgow, protesters regularly take to the streets in huge demonstrations calling for an end to the current conflict and Israeli occupation.These popular protests are supported by many local trade unions as well as left-leaning political organizations, such as the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and the Stop the War group (the latter also opposes Europeans fighting in Ukraine).Former labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn has also called for an end to weapons deliveries to Israel. In late July, Corbyn announced he was starting his own political party ""to take on the rich and powerful."" Corbyn was suspended from the Labour Party in 2020 after he said a report into antisemitism inside the party under his leadership had been exaggerated for ""political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media. ""According to a YouGov survey undertaken on 24-25 July, around two-thirds of Labour supporters agree with the UK government's decision to recognise Palestine. Of the general public, the YouGov poll found that 45% think it's a good idea.In the British Parliament, 221 members have signed a letter calling for recognition of Palestine. Among the signatories were many Labour Party members. Ministers in Starmer's cabinet have also pushed in this direction.Starmer appears to have given in to the pressure, at least partially. But he reiterated the UK's support for Israel and demands on Hamas in the government statement on Tuesday. ""We have been unequivocal in our condemnation of those evil attacks, and our support for the right of the State of Israel to self-defence. Hamas must immediately release all the hostages, sign up to an immediate ceasefire [...] and commit to disarmament. ""At the same time though, he was critical of the Israeli government's military offensive and its policies in Gaza. ""Now, in Gaza, because of a catastrophic failure of aid, we see starving babies, children too weak to stand, images that will stay with us for a lifetime. The suffering must end,"" he told journalists.While the United Nations and leading aid agencies have repeatedly warned of the increasing risk of starvation in Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted there is no hunger in the enclave.The most recent figures from the health authorities in Gaza indicate that more than 60,000 people have died in Gaza as a result of the Israeli military offensive. Almost half of the dead were women and children.The Gaza health authorities are controlled by Hamas, which administers the enclave. However, the death toll is considered broadly reliable, including by the Israeli military, which has used the numbers in its own briefings. Israel has denied international journalists entry into Gaza since the beginning of Israel's siege, meaning DW has not been able to independently verify the death toll. A number of recent studies however, suggest it may actually be an undercount.Starmer's decision to recognise Palestine may also be a reaction to the fact that France plans to do the same during the UN General Assembly in early September. As French President Emmanuel Macron explained in Paris late last week, France wants to revitalize a peace process there and put international weight behind a two-state solution.Unlike Macron, though, Starmer is only holding out the threat of recognition if Israel fails to move toward a ceasefire. Observers have argued that it's more of a balancing act for the UK, something between taking a moral stand and taking careful account of foreign relations with the US.Trump said he and Starmer had not, in fact, discussed a Palestinian state while in Scotland. Reacting to Starmer's announcement on Tuesday, Trump said, ""I'm not going to take a position, I don't mind him taking a position."" But later on, during his flight back to the US, Trump told reporters that Starmer was ""rewarding Hamas.""Israel's Netanyahu has described Starmer's plan as ""appeasement towards jihadist terrorists.""Currently, 147 out of 193 UN member states recognise Palestine as a state. However, what counts as a state is still disputed with different methods and prerequisites used to identify countries. Even so, several of the conditions usually accepted as necessary for a functioning state are presently not in place for Palestine. That includes a unified government, control over borders and security and clearly defined territory.In the statement announcing his government's change of course, Starmer emphasized that the Hamas group must ""accept that they will play no part in the government of Gaza"" in the future.","UK could recognise Palestine as a state as soon as September, Prime Minister Keir Starmer says. Starmer's government is using the recognition of a Palestinian state as a means of political pressure to push forward the so-called two-state solution. The ongoing conflict in Gaza has sowed serious internal divisions in the UK.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123041449,imgsize-340503,width-400,resizemode-4/123041449.jpg"

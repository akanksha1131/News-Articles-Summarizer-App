Historical denialism in Japan

Seeking to make Japan a 'victim' of foreign conspiracies

Japan's history seen through the eyes of victims

Japan should 'stop apologising'





August 15th marks the 80th anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender and the end of World War II, putting focus once again on reckoning with the country's past. The domestic debate in Japan on shaping narratives about World War II is so tense that it is often referred to as ""history wars. ""Japan's actions during the war are also a sore spot in international diplomacy. China and both North and South Korea have bitter memories of life under Japanese occupation, and rarely miss an opportunity to remind their neighbour of the past.Inside Japan, what were once far-right fringe voices have grown more prominent in recent years by insisting on a narrative denying or minimising the brutality of Imperial Japan during World War II. Historical revisionist groups want the victims of Imperial Japan's rampage across Asia and the Pacific eight decades ago to leave history in the past.""There are very few people alive today who experienced the war in any of these countries, but I do not think they will ever stop talking about it because it is an effective tool with which to bash Japan,"" said Hiromichi Moteki, chairman of the Tokyo-based Society for the Dissemination of Historical Fact, which promotes a narrative of Japan's actions during World War II that denies the atrocities that Japan committed.""They want to claim the moral high ground over Japan, but all we want to do is have the right to remember and honour our war dead and teach our younger generations the history of the nation,"" he told DW.Moteki's organisation seeks to spreads its message by translating Japanese nationalist works of historical revisionism into English.An article published in the Georgetown University's Journal of International Affairs exploring historical revisionism in Japan describes Moteki's organisation as part of an ""interlocking web of small but vocal lobby groups"" that emerged as part of a ""denialist movement"" in the 1990s.Other groups with similar aims include the ""International Research Institute of Controversial Histories"" or the ""Historical Awareness Research Committee.""Moteki's group, for example, claims World War II was not a war of aggression started by Japan but an act of self-defence against the US and European nations that had colonised Asia. It claims Imperial Japan ""liberated"" the countries it conquered.Similar to other nationalist organisations, the society also falsely insists that euphemistically named ""comfort women,"" most of whom were from Korea, were not abducted and forced into sexual servitude but were in fact well-paid prostitutes. It also contends that Allied prisoners of war were well treated and that labourers from Korea and Taiwan willingly toiled in mines, shipyards or factories during the conflict.At the same time, the group says the US committed war crimes by dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The deniers claim that the hundreds of trials carried out by the allies prosecuting Japanese troops for war crimes were merely ""victor's justice.""""These groups share a distinctive method of historical writing similar to the methods of Holocaust denialism,"" writes Tessa Morris-Suzuki, professor emerita of Japanese history in the College of Asia and Pacific at Australian National University.""They seize on historical documents that are often relatively obscure and cherry-pick them for information that supports their cause. These fragments of information are then strung together without contextualization into writing that overlooks source reliability, ignores contradictory evidence, and fundamentally misrepresents content,"" Morris-Suzuki wrote in the Georgetown Journal of International Affairs.""These issues are embedded in a wider, all-embracing view of twentieth-century Japanese history: one that presents Japan as the victim and attributes negative images of Japan's pre-war and wartime past to international propaganda conspiracies,"" she continues.The Georgetown report, which was published in 2021, said a ""substantial number"" of conservative lawmakers ""belong to lobby groups which disseminate revisionist views.""Historical revisionist lobby groups have also worked with diplomats on propaganda efforts abroad, including opposing monuments to ""comfort women"" in countries like the US and Germany.Yuji Hosaka is a professor of history and politics at Sejong University in South Korea who has long been critical of Japan's failure to honestly address its past, or to teach younger generations of Japanese the truth about the war-time era.""I see many on the right in Japan who just want to forget about all the bad things that happened when Japan occupied Korea and invaded China and Southeast Asia,"" he said. ""These people often say that Japan brought development and modern technology to help these countries, but that just makes the people of Korea angry.""Korean historians largely agree that after annexing the peninsula from 1910, Japan forcefully assimilated the Korean people, forbade them from speaking their own language, suppressed the indigenous culture and exploited the land and its people. The intent was to make Korea a part of the Japanese empire, with thousands of Koreans serving in the Japanese military during the war.Hosaka says that Japanese history school books still gloss over the atrocities carried out by the Japanese military, with often little or no mention of the Nanjing Massacre which killed hundreds of thousands in China, the abuse of civilian labourers and POWs, or other crimes for which Japanese were executed after the war.""Those who forget the past will inevitably find themselves in a similar situation again in the future,"" he said. ""It is imperative that Japan learns from the past.""""In the past, Germany and France worked together to create common history books for their children,"" he added. ""I believe that Japan should reach out to Korea and China and do the same thing.""An editorial in the July 7 edition of the China Daily newspaper declared, ""It's time Japan faced its war crimes and militarist past.""For China, the Nanjing Massacre continues to bear weight in the present day.According to Chinese historians, 300,000 civilians and soldiers were killed in a six-week frenzy of murder, torture, rape, arson and looting after the invading Japanese military entered Nanjing, then the capital city of China, on December 13, 1937. The massacre is recognised internationally as well. The Encyclopaedia Britannica writes that the ""number of Chinese killed in the massacre has been subject to much debate, with most estimates ranging from 100,000 to more than 300,000. ""Those who had ordered the massacre were executed after being found guilty of committing war crimes by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in 1948.Moteki and others on the right say successive Japanese leaders have expressed genuine remorse for what happened nearly a century ago but that other countries always say the apologies are inadequate or are insincere.""It will never change,"" said Moteki, who was born in 1941.""Japan has to defend itself from these criticisms and verbal attacks. But the time has come for Japan to stop apologising because it is meaningless now.""On August 15, the anniversary of the emperor announcing in a radio broadcast that Japan was surrendering, Moteki will go to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine in central Tokyo to pay his respects to war dead.He will be surrounded by thousands more who want to mark the anniversary, including dwindling numbers of old soldiers, the relatives of men who fought, and far-right groups in uniforms.Yasukuni is the last resting place of more than 2.4 million military and civilian victims of war in Japan since 1869. To other nations, however, Yasukuni is a controversial symbol, as it also honours more than 1,000 people convicted of war crimes.","August 15th marks the 80th anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender and the end of World War II.

Can Myanmar’s 2025 quake data predict the next big one?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/can-myanmars-2025-quake-data-predict-the-next-big-one/articleshow/123328636.cms,"Could seismologists have seen it coming?

Why was the

Mandalay earthquake

so destructive?

Earthquake forecasts, not predictions

Earthquake forecasts still have 'large uncertainties'





Scientists say earthquake prediction is impossible, but studying the 2025 Myanmar earthquake may help forecast when and where the next big tremor could strike.During the midday prayers on March 28, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck central Myanmar along the Sagaing Fault.With an epicenter close to Mandalay, the country's second-largest city, it was the most powerful earthquake to strike Myanmar since 1912. It caused widespread destruction of Mandalay's infrastructure while reports have put the death toll between 3,700 and more than 5,000 people.Its seismic impacts reached as far as Bangkok, Thailand's capital, where it collapsed a 30-story skyscraper, claiming at least 92 lives.Scientists had been anticipating a large earthquake along a segment of the fault, which had not ruptured since a similarly destructive earthquake in 1839. But they couldn't predict when the earthquake would hit, its epicenter or how destructive it would be.""Despite decades of effort, scientists still can't reliably predict exactly when and where earthquakes will strike,"" Kit Yates, a mathematician at the University of Bath in the UK, told DW.""The movements and interactions of the Earth's tectonic plates are incredibly complex. Distinguishing meaningful earthquake warning signs from background seismic noise, especially with added human activity, is extremely difficult.""Five months after the Mandalay quake, scientists have been analyzing its destructive effects. Their findings could help predict features of earthquakes in the future.""The hope is that such [findings] might be used to forecast the time, magnitude and extent of future earthquakes,"" said Jean-Philippe Avouac, a seismologist at California Institute of Technology, US, who led a new study published this week in the journal PNAS.Real-time footage of the quake revealed the Sagaing Fault's movement in stunning detail. The Mandalay quake hit like a rapid, pulse-like rupture along the fault line. Beneath people's feet, the ground moved three meters apart in just 1.3 seconds at the epicenter.In total the quake lasted 80 seconds, extending 460km (285 miles) down the fault, causing surface displacement six meters (20 feet) deep.Avouac's team compared this data to past earthquakes with similar features. They then created a computer model that contained several predictions about the Sagaing Fault.The key ingredient of the model was its description of tectonic changes caused by past earthquakes. Avouac described this as a ""memory effect"" in the Sagaing Fault.""This is a nice result to show that our simple model results in a memory effect [and] is consistent with [real world] observations,"" Avouac said.The model confirmed that a ""supershear"" rupture — which has amplified waves in the direction of the split — was anticipated on the fault because of its very straight geometry and its history of similar ruptures.Their model forecasts that large-magnitude earthquakes occur along the Sagaing Fault irregularly and with an interval of around 141 years — meaning the next quake to hit Myanmar could be in 2166, give or take 40 years.The model also identified features of the fault ""slip"" that help refine forecasts about future ruptures.Instead of predicting quakes, seismologists are focused on forecasting seismic activity with better accuracy. Much like weather forecasts, they aim to estimate the likelihood of earthquakes over more extended periods and in specific regions.""There are consistent relationships between the frequency and energy of earthquakes. This allows scientists to estimate how often large quakes might occur based on smaller ones, for which there is more data,"" said Yates.The hope is that models like Avouac's might be used to forecast the time, magnitude and extent of future earthquakes.""Such forecasts are crucial for disaster planning. A city like San Francisco, with a high probability of a major quake in the next 30 years, can justify major investment in preparedness,"" Yates said.Current models ""can only make probabilistic hazard assessments with large uncertainties,"" said Avouac.Avouac said scientists are currently unable to forecast the time, location and magnitude of a future earthquake with enough precision to take action, like order evacuation of a city.Earthquakes are chaotic events, meaning even tiny changes in the initial conditions can lead to unpredictable shifts in seismic activity.""The challenge is that the model needs to be tuned to the state of the fault at present, but we don't know how to measure the distribution of [tectonic] stress, and don't know enough [about] past ruptures to reconstruct them,"" Avouac said.Researchers are currently aiming to better understand how seismic activity can lead to different types of earthquakes in the hope they'll lead to more accurate hazard assessments in the future.","Scientists say earthquake prediction is impossible, but studying the 2025 Myanmar earthquake may help forecast when and where the next big tremor could strike.

‘Reprehensible act’: Indian temple in US vandalised; consulate seeks probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/reprehensible-act-indian-temple-in-us-vandalised-consulate-seeks-probe/articleshow/123275155.cms,"



A Hindu temple in the United States has been vandalised, prompting condemnation from the Indian Consulate in Chicago. In a post on X, the consulate described the desecration of the main signboard of the BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Greenwood, Indiana, as “reprehensible” and confirmed it had raised the matter with law enforcement for prompt action. The Consul General met devotees, local leaders and the Mayor of Greenwood, urging unity, solidarity and vigilance against “miscreants”.The incident comes less than 6 months after a similar act of vandalism at the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Chino Hills, California. At the time, ministry of external affairs condemned the act “in the strongest terms” and urged local authorities to act swiftly and ensure security at places of worship. BAPS Public Affairs said the Hindu community would “stand steadfast against hate” and “never let hate take root”.The Coalition of Hindus of North America also linked such incidents to rising hostility towards Hindus, noting the timing ahead of a planned “Khalistan referendum” in Los Angeles. Previous attacks on BAPS temples were reported in Sacramento and New York last year, fuelling concerns over repeated targeting of Hindu places of worship across the US.","Vandalism at BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Indiana described as'reprehensible' Indian Consul General met devotees, local leaders and the Mayor of Greenwood, urging unity, solidarity and vigilance against'miscreants' Incident comes less than 6 months after a similar act of vandalism at the BAPS Shri Swaminrayan Mandir in California.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123275239,imgsize-985007,width-400,resizemode-4/123275239.jpg"

'Treated like a criminal': New Zealand woman and 6-year-old son detained by ICE at US border; narrates 'terrifying' ordeal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/treated-like-a-criminal-new-zealand-woman-and-6-year-old-son-detained-by-ice-at-us-border-narrates-terrifying-ordeal/articleshow/123274510.cms,"Image: GoFundMe@/VictoriaBesancon





A New Zealand woman held at a US immigration center with her six-year-old son after being detained while crossing the Canada-US border is being “treated like a criminal,” said her friend and advocate, reported the Guardian.Sarah Shaw, 33, a New Zealander who has lived in Washington state for just over three years, dropped her two older children at Vancouver Airport on July 24 for them to take a direct flight to New Zealand to visit their grandparents.When she tried to re-enter US, the immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) detained her and her youngest son in what her friend Victoria Besancon described as a “terrifying” ordeal.“Sarah thought she was being kidnapped,” Besancon said, as quoted by the Guardian. “They didn’t really explain anything to her at first; they just kind of quietly took her and her son and immediately put them in like an unmarked white van.”Her phone was then confiscated, and she was transported to the Dilley immigration processing center in South Texas.Shaw is currently applying for a green card under a provision for domestic violence survivors. According to the GoFundMe page organised by Besancon, Shaw had work authorisation but had not yet received travel permission under what's known as a “combo card,” although her son had such permission.“It wasn’t until she tried to come back across the border that she realised only half of the combination card, because it’s only one physical card, had been fully approved,” Bescanson said.Meanwhile, all three of Shaw’s children have their I-360 visas approved, and Bescanson claimed that Sarah’s youngest son was therefore being held “illegally.”Minda Thorward, Shaw’s attorney, said that under the previous administrations, customs and border protection (CBP) would likely have quickly paroled her back into the country, but that approach has changed under Trump, reported NBC King 5 News.Shaw, who works for the Washington state department of children, youth, and families (DCYF), was preparing to start graduate school soon, as per the GoFundMe page.The fund, which raised over $33,000 by Monday morning, aims to cover legal fees and basic needs after Shaw depleted her savings on legal representation, reported Newsweek.“She gives therapy and counselling to some of our most at-risk youth … and to be treated like a criminal herself has just been absolutely devastating,” Bescanson said as quoted by the Guardian.Several legal US residents have been detained by ICE in the past months. While some detainees reportedly have criminal histories that might justify visa revocation, others argue that errors in paperwork led to their detention and believe they should be released.New Zealand’s foreign affairs ministry has confirmed that they are in contact with Shaw but provided no further details due to privacy concerns, reported The Guardian.","Sarah Shaw, 33, a New Zealander who has lived in Washington state for just over three years, dropped her two older children at Vancouver Airport on July 24 for them to take a direct flight to New Zealand.

Alaska summit: Putin's visit to US his first since 2015,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/alaska-summit-putins-visit-to-us-his-first-since-2015/articleshow/123328511.cms,"Trump said he and Putin agreed that the Ukraine conflict would end with land swaps and US-backed some type of security guarantee.





Russian President Vladimir Putin's closely-watched Friday meeting with President Trump in Alaska on Friday was the former's first visit to the United States in a decade. Putin's last visit was in Sept 2015, for the UN General Assembly in New York. At the gathering, he faced off with President Barack Obama, with dueling speeches in the morning and a tense meeting at night.Putin's address to the assembly was a defiant one in which he defended backing the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and dismissed Western condemnation of Russia's annexation of Crimea.Obama delivered a forceful warning against the perils of leaving Assad in power and allowing Ukraine's sovereignty to be violated.That evening, the two leaders shared a terse handshake before entering a Security Council consultation room for a private meeting.Relations between the two had been so fraught in the preceding days that neither side would even admit to having sought the meeting in the first place, and it appeared to conclude with few resolutions.Before the UN meeting, Putin's last visit to the US was far more relaxed. In the summer of 2007, President George W Bush invited him to the Bush family's coastal compound in Kennebunkport, Maine.The two men took a ""full blast"" speedboat ride with former President George Bush - a journey that Putin ""loved"" and his interpreter appeared to find ""nerve-wracking,"" Bush later recounted.The visit was an attempt to smooth over some of the differences between the Russian and American leaders, including over Iran's nuclear program and American plans for a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic. ""We had a good, casual discussion,"" Bush said. The two former American presidents also took the Russian leader fishing, with Putin reeling in the only catch of the day.

2016 Presidential Campaign

The First Meetings

Trump's Second Term





President Donald Trump's posture toward President Vladimir Putin of Russia over the last two decades or so has veered from admiring to infuriated, cozy to detached. The latest meeting was at least their seventh known face-to-face encounter, and the first of Trump's second term. Here's a look at some of the past meetings, and what the two have said about each other over the years:In 2007, after Time magazine selected Putin as its ""Man of the Year,"" Trump wrote him a congratulatory letter. ""As you probably have heard, I'm a big fan of yours!"" Trump wrote. Six years later, Trump took the Miss Universe contest to Moscow. Months before the pageant, which he owned at the time, he wondered on social media if Putin would attend, and if so, ""will he become my new best friend?"" Putin did not attend.Soon after he formally announced a run for the White House in 2015, Trump told reporters in July that he would ""get along very well with Vladimir Putin."" The exchange of compliments continued that year, when Putin called Trump ""a very bright and talented man,"" and Trump said that praise was a ""great honour.""In July 2016, though, Trump seemed to backtrack after saying repeatedly for years that he had a relationship with Putin.""He said one nice thing about me. He said I'm a genius. I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it. I never met Putin,"" he said. During the final presidential debate in 2016, Hillary Clinton suggested that he would be Putin's ""puppet,"" which Trump dismissed. But questions over Trump's ties to Russia did not go away, and after he took office in Jan 2017, Russia's role in the US election dominated conversation in the US.The first in-person meeting between the two leaders took place at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, where Trump asked Putin about Russian interference in the election. Putin denied any involvement. After the meeting, Trump took his interpreter's notes and instructed him not to brief anyone.They met again in Nov that year, in Vietnam, and in July 2018 in Helsinki, Finland. On both occasions, Putin denied interfering in the 2016 election. In Helsinki, Trump stood beside Putin and challenged the conclusion of his own intelligence agencies about Russian election interference. Later in 2018, the two leaders spoke informally at dinner during a G20 meeting in Argentina.They met once more before the end of the first Trump term, at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, in June 2019. By then, the special counsel Robert Mueller had concluded that Russian had carried out a ""sweeping and systematic"" attack on American democracy. Asked by a reporter whether he would tell Russia not to meddle in US elections, Trump said, ""Yes, of course, I will."" He then turned to Putin, with a half-grin, and said, ""Don't meddle in the election, President,"" as Putin chuckled.As he began his second term, Trump expressed an interest in swiftly bringing an end to the war in Ukraine. But his relationship with President Zelensky of Ukraine took a nosedive in Feb after a fiery confrontation at the White House. Trump began to indicate frustration with Putin as the war proved harder to end than he had expected. ""I'm not happy with Putin,"" Trump said in July. He appeared to soften his comments ahead of the meeting in Alaska, saying he ""got along well"" with Putin.","Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have met at least seven times over the years. Trump has said he has a good relationship with Putin, but has also been critical of him. The latest meeting was the first of Trump's second term, and the first in-person meeting between the two.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123328496,imgsize-26732,width-400,resizemode-4/123328496.jpg"

Buddy Carter (R-Ga) and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his efforts in securing a cease-fire between Israel and Iran.The governments of Pakistan and Cambodia also indicated they have nominated Trump for the prize.Trump’s role in negotiating a peace framework between Azerbaijan and Armenia similarly resulted in the leaders of both nations expressing support for Trump winning the prize.

Alaska summit: No 'war' if Donald Trump was President in 2022?

AP/PTI(AP08_16_2025_000011A)





Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday claimed that he would not have invaded Ukraine if Joe Biden had not been in office, a remark seen as courting Donald Trump, even as US tariff threats persist.“I’d like to remind you that in 2022, during the last contact with the previous administration, I tried to convince my previous American colleague the situation should not be brought to the point of no return when it would come to hostilities,” Putin said after his nearly three-hour summit with Trump in Alaska.“And I said it quite directly back then. That's a big mistake today, when President Trump is saying that if he was the president back then, there will be no war — and I’m quite sure that it would indeed be, so I can confirm that.”“President Trump and I established a very good, businesslike and trusting contact. And I have every reason to believe that by moving along this path, we can reach - and the sooner, the better - the end of the conflict in Ukraine,” he added.Trump has frequently expressed the belief that Putin would not have initiated the invasion had he been president in 2022, but he did not appear to engage with the dictator’s provocation on Friday.Ahead of the meeting in Alaska, Trump, while in his flight, told Fox News that this Ukraine war is Biden's war and he was the one who screwed up.""I'm not doing it based on history, based on anything else — I'm doing it based on a deal. If we make a deal, great. If I see that there's no hope of making a deal, I'm out of there... This isn't my war. This is Biden's war. Biden screwed this up..."" Putin said.Trump subtly reminded Putin that he would not engage in any business dealings with Russia until the Kremlin ceased its three-year war on Ukraine, highlighting the US’ leverage.“We … have some tremendous Russian business representatives here, and I think everybody wants to deal with us. We’ve become the hottest country anywhere in the world in a very short period of time,” he said. “We look forward to dealing — we’re going to try and get this over with. “… We’ll have a good chance when this is over.”Trump said that he and Putin did not reach an agreement to resolve Moscow’s war in Ukraine, though he characterized the meeting as “very productive.”“There were many, many points that we agreed on,” Trump said at a joint press conference with Putin. “I would say a couple of big ones that we haven’t quite got there, but we’ve made some headway. So there’s no deal until there’s a deal.”","Vladimir Putin said he would not have invaded Ukraine if Joe Biden had not been in office.

Fraud probe: New Orleans mayor indicted on multiple charges; accused of hiding romantic relationship with her bodyguard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fraud-probe-new-orleans-mayor-indicted-on-multiple-charges-accused-of-hiding-romantic-relationship-with-her-bodyguard/articleshow/123326552.cms,"New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell (AP image)





A federal grand jury on Friday indicted New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell on charges of conspiracy, fraud and obstruction, stemming from allegations that she tried to hide a romantic relationship with her bodyguard.The indictment marks the conclusion of a multi-year federal investigation into Cantrell, the city’s first female mayor in its 300-year history.Her bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, has pleaded not guilty to charges of wire fraud and making false statements. Prosecutors allege that Vappie hid the relationship with Cantrell while submitting false payroll records claiming he was on duty. Vappie, who retired from the police department last year, is scheduled to stand trial in January.Federal authorities say Cantrell and Vappie exchanged encrypted messages through an app to avoid detection and deleted the conversations afterward. Both have maintained that their relationship was strictly professional.Acting US Attorney Michael Simpson described the case as a “three-year fraud scheme that we allege exploited their public authority and positions.” He said Cantrell arranged for Vappie to attend 14 trips, claiming these were occasions when they were “truly alone.”The indictment states that in 2021, Cantrell and Vappie “developed a personal and intimate relationship” and allegedly used their public positions to hide it and create opportunities to spend time together. Simpson added that Cantrell falsely claimed in a 2021 affidavit that her phone automatically deleted messages, when the function was only activated in December 2022 after media scrutiny.Following photos taken by a private citizen showing Cantrell and Vappie dining together and drinking wine, Cantrell reportedly filed a police report and sought a restraining order.Cantrell will leave the office in January. Her second term has been marked by clashes with City Council members and a failed recall effort in 2022.“This is a sad day for the people of New Orleans,” said Monet Brignac, a spokesperson for City Council President JP Morrell. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the Cantrell family as they navigate through this difficult time.”Cantrell has not posted on her X account since July 15, when she reported that there have been historic declines in crime in the city. Political observers note that her public profile has diminished in recent months due to disputes with the city council and restrictions on her executive powers approved by voters.Cantrell and her supporters argue that she has been unfairly targeted as a Black woman and held to a different standard than male officials. Earlier this year, she described some of the treatment she received as “very disrespectful, insulting, in some cases kind of unimaginable.”","New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell indicted on charges of conspiracy, fraud and obstruction.

Putin's body language far from cold







Body language expert Patty Ann Wood gave her verdict on the historic handshake of President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin and said the handshake had warmth but Trump clearly sees Putin as more powerful as he placed his hand palm up, allowing Putin to place his palm on top.Speaking to Newsweek, Wood said the handshake had a blend of deference, control and familiarity. ""As Trump stands waiting, he's smiling—a sign he's comfortable and looking forward to the event,"" Wood said. ""It's his natural smile, small and slightly downturned at the corners. His shoulders are back more than usual; he might be wearing a form-fitting undergarment because his posture is unusually erect. This all suggests confidence. ""The expert noted that Trump was respectful towards Putin as the Russian president approached -- he was applauding lightly. Then Trump took a step forward.""Trump typically likes to have his hand on top, but here it appears he presented his palm up—a weaker, more subordinate position—indicating he sees Putin as more powerful,"" Wood said.""Still, he uses a signature Trump move: keeping the handshake tight to his mid-body to pull the other person in, a display of power,"" the expert said.Trump and Putin maintained eye contact and smiled showing warmth and also a balance of deference and assertion, as their heads remained close together, Wood said.CNN noted that Putin was seen grinning as he peered out of the window of Donald Trump's limo. The same closeness was maintained when they were sitting down for their meeting as both Trump and Putin offered a few smiles.""The Russian president is known for conveying his mindset through his posture. Former US presidents have commented on his habit of slouching in his chair as they are speaking, in a sign of his disinterest,"" CNN noted""He wasn’t slouching in Alaska. Instead, he sat forward in his chair as the meeting got underway, hands clasped, as cameras clicked and reporters shouted unanswered questions,"" CNN added.","Body language expert Patty Ann Wood gave her verdict on the historic handshake of President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

How tall is Putin?



B-2 bomber steals the show







President Donald Trump greeted Russian president Vladimir Putin with a handshake that was watched closely by the world and decoded instantly by the social media body language experts as the 'alpha-male' power move. As the two leaders shook hands, Trump pulled in Putin's hand in his characteristic way of shaking hands to show dominance, though many said Putin had the ""alpha top dog, knuckles up"" hand, proving dominance over Trump as his hand was over Trump's hand and not the other way round.The height difference between Putin and Trump was another stark feature that caught attention as the two leaders met after 2018. Vladimir Putin is officially 5 feet 7 inches tall, while Trump is 6 feet 3 inches tall. But the visible height difference was not as much as their recorded heights. This triggered theories that Putin uses lifts to increase his actual height which could be as low as 5 feet 2 inches.""Trump is 22 cm taller than putin (190 vs. 168), yet in the photo they appear almost the same height — Putin wearing heels again?"" one wrote.""Putin is supposed to be 5'7 and Trump 6'3. One of them is lying about their height..."" another wrote.Social media pundits noted that the handshake of the two world leaders was overshadowed by the flyover of American military planes including B2 stealth bomber that passed overhead.Putin joined Trump in his presidential limo as they head to their meeting. ""The move is unusual, particularly for an adversary. When Trump wanted North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un to join him in his car during their meeting in Singapore in 2018, aides talked him out of it,"" CNN noted""But this is a different era for Trump, with different advisers and objectives. And while their actual face-to-face meeting has been expanded to include advisers, it’s an indication that Trump and Putin will still have a moment to themselves — even if it’s only for a short car ride,"" CNN added.",Body language experts decoded the 'alpha-male' power move of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.

Pakistan announces Army Rocket Force Command,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-announces-army-rocket-force-command/articleshow/123311070.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: Pakistan turned its Independence Day celebrations on Thursday into a carefully choreographed display of military muscle and political messaging headlined by the announcement of a new Army Rocket Force Command.The event at Islamabad’s Jinnah Stadium, branded Marka-e-Haq (“Battle of Truth”), saw Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif share the stage with army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, ISI chief Lt Gen Asim Malik, and Asifa Bhutto Zardari. Military representatives from Turkey and Azerbaijan added a touch of foreign endorsement.In his address, Shehbaz also unveiled “Misaq-e-Istehkam-e-Pakistan (Charter for Stability)”, pitched as a call for unity beyond partisan divides.The newly announced rocket force marks a first in Pakistan’s military structure, signalling ambitions for precision-strike capability. But with the economy still under strain, the decision is likely to spark debate over balancing strategic aspirations with fiscal realities.On foreign policy, Shehbaz expressed gratitude to China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan, UAE, Iran, and, pointedly, US President Donald Trump, for support during tensions with India. He reiterated Pakistan’s firm positions on Kashmir and Palestine, indicating no softening of regional stances.The Independence Day spectacle underscored an image of civil-military unity in a country where political turbulence often overlaps with military dominance. Whether Marka-e-Haq becomes more than pageantry will depend on Islamabad’s ability to deliver on promises of reform, stability, and economic recovery long after the parades are over.","Pakistan turns its Independence Day celebrations into a carefully choreographed display of military muscle and political messaging.

‘Seed Of Pakistan Will Be Destroyed’: Foreign Affairs Expert Warns Islamabad After Nuke Threat





PESHAWAR/ISLAMABAD: Four people were injured when an improvised explosive device derailed six coaches of the Peshawar-bound Jafar Express in the Mastung district of Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Sunday.There were, however, no casualties, officials said.This is the latest in a series of attacks targeting the Jafar Express.The improvised explosive device (IED) explosion hit the track near Spezand Railway Station, about 25 km from Quetta, shortly after the train with 350 passengers had departed the city at 9 am (local time), a railways official said.""A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train heading from Quetta to Peshawar. Fortunately, there was no loss of life,"" Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Pakistan Railways' Quetta division, told the media.All injured passengers sustained minor wounds, the official said.Rescue teams, including railway staff, were dispatched to the site, and a relief train was sent to transport stranded passengers to Quetta.Security forces and police cordoned off the area, while a bomb disposal squad was deployed to clear the track.Meanwhile, in a separate statement, Kashif said the services of the Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail were suspended till August 14.The Bolan Mail will resume its operations on August 16 (Saturday), when it will depart from Karachi ""in its proper turn"" and will arrive in Quetta the next day, he added.The Jafar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has been repeatedly targeted in recent months.On August 7, the train narrowly escaped a disaster near Balochistan's Sibi railway station, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train had passed.In another incident, on August 4, gunmen fired five bullets at its pilot engine near Kolpur. The separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the latter attack.In June, a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks exploded, causing four bogies of the Jaffar Express to derail in Jacobabad.On March 11, the Jaffar Express was hijacked while traveling from Quetta to Peshawar in the Bolan area, resulting in the deaths of 21 passengers and four security personnel. The security forces in a targeted operation killed 33 terrorists involved in attacking the train.It is believed that ethnic Baloch terrorist groups carry out such attacks.A July 28 derailment of the same train in Sindh province's Sukkur was initially attributed to an explosion but the Ministry of Railways later said it was due to a technical fault.","A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train heading from Quetta to Peshawar.

A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses. More than 700,000 people from the Rohingya minority fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape persecution.

Three Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion on Saturday while patrolling near the Cambodian border, just days after the two countries agreed to extend a fragile ceasefire following their deadliest clashes in decades.The blast took place in Sisaket province at around 10 AM local time (0300 GMT), the Royal Thai Military said in a statement. One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage from the blast’s pressure.Tensions have been high since last month’s five-day conflict over disputed ancient temples along the 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, which left at least 43 people dead and forced more than 300,000 residents from their homes. The fighting, which involved jets, artillery, rockets and infantry, ended on 29 July after mediation by US President Donald Trump.On Thursday, Thai and Cambodian defence officials met in Kuala Lumpur and agreed to extend the truce. However, Saturday’s incident has cast doubt over the ceasefire’s stability.Thailand’s foreign ministry accused Cambodia of laying new landmines in violation of the agreement and said it would file an official protest. However the country’s Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority denied the allegation, insisting no new mines had been planted.Acting PM Phumtham Wechayachai, who was in neighbouring Surin province at the time, has ordered the military to ensure the injured soldiers receive full treatment.","One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage.

An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS). The quake occurred at 2:24 pm IST, at a depth of 155 kilometers. The epicenter was located at latitude 36.51°N and longitude 70.70°E within the Afghan territory.This was the second quake recorded today, as seismic activity continues to affect the region. Earlier, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake struck at 12:19 pm IST. It occurred at a depth of 47 kilometers, with the epicenter located at latitude 36.54°N and longitude 71.52°E.This is the latest in a series of earthquakes to hit the region in recent days. On August 2, a stronger earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale struck Afghanistan at a depth of 87 kilometers. Prior to that, on July 29, a 4.8-magnitude earthquake was recorded at a shallow depth of just 10 kilometers.Shallow earthquakes are more dangerous than deep earthquakes. This is so because the seismic waves from shallow earthquakes have a shorter distance to travel to the surface, resulting in stronger ground shaking causing more damage to structures and greater casualties.According to the Red Cross, Afghanistan lies on several fault lines between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain region, making it one of the most earthquake-prone areas in the world.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), Afghanistan warn that frequent quakes continue to pose a serious threat to communities in the country, which are already vulnerable due to decades of conflict and underdevelopment.The organization also noted that the country is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.","An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday.

Bangladesh Interim Chief Yunus To Stay After Resignation Threat Amid Protests Over Rohingya Corridor

July Declaration unveiled:

Tight security and public celebration:





Bangladesh’s interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus on Tuesday announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026, ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. He made the declaration during his address to the nation via state television, BTV and radio to mark the first anniversary of the mass uprising that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ""On behalf of the interim government, I will write to the Chief Election Commissioner, requesting that the Election Commission organise a national election in February 2026, before the next Ramadan,"" Yunus said.The announcement marks a shift from his earlier indication that polls would be held in April. The revised timeline comes after consultations with major political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia which had called for earlier elections.""We will all begin mental preparation and institutional arrangements from tomorrow to complete all arrangements so that this year's election is memorable in the country's history in terms of joy and celebration, peace and order, voter turnout, and cordiality,"" he added.Yunus urged political parties to ensure that youth and women are not excluded from their manifestos or future governance plans. ""Remember, the youth who have changed Bangladesh have the power to change the world as well,"" he said.Earlier today, the interim government had also formally released the ""July Declaration"", a 26-point document outlining proposed reforms in governance, constitutional and political issues.Top leaders from political groups such as the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, and the newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP) were present during the official unveiling at the Bangladesh Parliament Complex, commemorating the uprising anniversary.The declaration sharply criticized the 1972 Constitution after its independence war against Pakistan in 1971, calling for reforms aligned with the will of the people.""Whereas, the post-independence Awami League government failed to materialise the people's aspirations because of the weaknesses in the procedures of drafting and in the structure of the constitution, along with its inappropriate application,"" the July Declaration said.It also condemned Sheikh Hasina’s administration, accusing it of turning Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state through alleged authoritarian rule and human rights violations.""Whereas, during the rule of Sheikh Hasina, under her very leadership, an extreme force that was anti-people, autocratic and against human rights turned Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state and thereby tarnished Bangladesh's international image,"" it added.The document calls for the 2024 uprising to be given official recognition and proposes that the July Declaration be included in a reformed constitution.Tens of thousands gathered at Manik Mia Avenue in Dhaka to mark the anniversary of Hasina’s ouster. The government declared the day a national holiday. Security was heightened across the capital, with police checkpoints and patrols in sensitive areas.Sheikh Hasina, who had been in power for 15 years, fled to India in August last year following mass protests. Her party, the Awami League, has since been banned by the interim administration, and its registration has been revoked by the Election Commission, effectively barring it from contesting in future polls unless the ban is lifted.Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch (HRW) raised concerns over the interim government's progress on human rights.""The hope of the thousands who braved lethal violence a year ago when they opposed Sheikh Hasina's abusive rule to build a rights-respecting democracy remains unfulfilled,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at HRW.She warned that the interim leadership is struggling to balance security reform with pressures from hardliners and rival political factions.As the nation reflects on the events of the past year, Bangladesh remains on high alert. The month of August also marks the anniversary of the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s founding figure and Hasina’s father.","Bangladesh's interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026.

A newly formed political party led by students who played a key role in the anti-government protests that led to the ouster of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina held a rally in the country's capital Dhaka on Sunday, pledging to build a new Bangladesh amid ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the next national election, reported news agency AP.The National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters. Party leader Nahid Islam announced a 24-point agenda and called for the creation of a new constitution to replace the one adopted in 1972.“Exactly one year ago, at this Shaheed Minar (memorial), we vowed to free this country from the hands of dictatorship. By responding to that call, we together defeated the fascist rule and regained control of our country,” Islam said.“Let us all unite and transform this historic 24-point agenda into reality to build a new Bangladesh, a Bangladesh that fulfills the dreams of all citizens, as we move toward the formation of our second republic,” he added, as quoted by the agency.The party did not provide specific details on the proposed constitution but said its goal was to reflect the aspirations of a new generation of Bangladeshis.Separately, the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) also held a large rally in Dhaka.BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, who has been in exile in London since 2008, addressed the crowd virtually and urged supporters to mobilise young voters ahead of the upcoming polls, according to AP.Rahman said, “We must reclaim our democratic rights and engage the youth in shaping Bangladesh’s future.”The rallies took place two days before the interim government, led by Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is set to mark the first anniversary of Sheikh Hasina’s departure from power.Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, following weeks of mass protests and political unrest that resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. Yunus assumed office on August 8.The demonstrations come amid criticism of the interim government’s handling of law and order, with opposition parties accusing it of failing to contain mob violence and uphold human rights.With Hasina’s Awami League banned and the political future still unclear, the rallies highlighted the growing activity among both new and established political forces ahead of the next election.","National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Electric vehicles account for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal.

LONDON: A multi-million pound conservation programme in England helped save 150 struggling species but ""time is running out"" to halt the decline, the head of Natural England, which led the initiative, said Wednesday.The public body, responsible for protecting and enhancing England's natural environment, invested a £13 million ($17.6 million) grant in efforts to support animal and plant species such as water vole, oystercatcher, lady's slipper orchid, the hazel dormouse and Atlantic salmon.""From the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall to Cumbria and Northumberland, 63 different projects involving 78 partners have transformed landscapes and supported the recovery of 150 species, many of which were on the brink of national extinction, through research, captive breeding, habitat creation, and conservation translocations,"" the body said in a statement released Wednesday.More than 15,000 individual animals and plants were translocated to expand species territories under the projects, which ran from August 2023 to March 2025.Notable successes include the reintroduction of black grouse to the North Yorkshire Moors, northern England, and the return of the large marsh grasshopper to the Norfolk Broads in east England after an 85-year absence.Despite the achievements, the chair of Natural England Tony Juniper warned more needed to be done.""A rising number of nature recovery projects, both large and small, are making a huge difference up and down the country,"" he said in the press release.""We know we can turn round species decline and improve ecosystems with the right targeted actions, the drive and the funding.

LONDON: Court of Appeal judges here have refused to increase the seven-year sentence given to a 15-year-old boy for killing much-loved 80-year-old British Indian grandfather Bhim Kohli, saying the sentence he was handed down was correct.On Wednesday, Lady Justice Macur, Justice Cutts and Justice Murray dismissed the application by the solicitor-general for permission to appeal against the boy’s sentence on the basis it was unduly lenient.The judges also dismissed an application for permission to appeal the sentence by the boy’s lawyer, Balraj Bhatia KC, who claimed it was “manifestly excessive”.Lucy Rigby KC had referred the case to the Court of Appeal in July. The boy was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter in April and sentenced in June.Kohli, an active and fit man who was held in high regard by the local community, was killed on Sept 1, 2024 while walking his dog in a Leicestershire park. The boy, then aged 14, put on a balaclava, knocked him to the ground, then hit him round the head with his slider shoe as he was on his knees trying to get up as a girl he was with, then aged 12, laughed and filmed the attack on her mobile.The boy attacked Kohli a second time near the park exit, punching and kicking him, breaking three ribs. He died later in hospital.The sentencing was enhanced due to aggravating factors which included the boy calling Kohli a “Paki”. Kohli was born in Punjab, India.Bhatia argued that calling Kohli a “Paki” was at the lower end of the scale of racism and the addition to the sentence was excessive. The court heard the boy’s sentence was half what an adult would get.Lady Justice Macur said: “We understand that not only his family but the public too were shocked at the lenient sentence of 7 years. However , the sentencing of children and young people for serious offences is complex. Many are not fully developed and may not understand the pain they cause to victims. The court must bear in mind the principle is to prevent offending and the welfare of the child. We do not find the sentence unduly lenient. ”She rejected the argument that adding six months to the sentence for racial aggravating factors was excessive and praised Kohli’s “sunny disposition” and “enjoyment of life” to his family who were in court.","Court of Appeal judges refuse to increase the seven-year sentence given to a 15-year-old boy for killing much-loved British Indian grandfather Bhim Kohli.

List of UK cities in drought



UK government's 7 tips on how to save water at home



Install a rain butt to collect rainwater to use in the garden Fix a leaking toilet -- leaky loos can water 200-400 litres a day. Use water from the kitchen to water your plants. Avoid water in your lawn-- brown grass will grow back healthy. Turn off the taps when brushing teeth or shaving. Take shorter showers. Delete old emails and pictures as data centers require vast amounts of water to cool their systems.





The UK government has asked its people to delete old emails to play their part in not wasting water as the current drought situation has been defined as a ""nationally significant incident"". Old emails, photos stored in data clouds require vast data centers and they consume large amounts of water to keep cool.The advice was issued as Britain endures its fourth heatwave of the summer. Five areas of England are currently officially in drought, with six more in 'prolonged dry weather'.""The current situation is nationally significant, and we are calling on everyone to play their part and help reduce the pressure on our water environment,"" Helen Wakeham, the Environment Agency's director of water, said.""We are grateful to the public for following the restrictions, where in place, to conserve water in these dry conditions.""Simple, everyday choices – such as turning off a tap or deleting old emails – also really helps the collective effort to reduce demand and help preserve the health of our rivers and wildlife.""Drought has been declared in Yorkshire, Cumbria and Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Cheshire, East Midlands, and the West Midlands. Areas categorised as having had ""prolonged dry weather"" (the phase before drought) are: Northeast, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire, East Anglia, Thames, Wessex, Solent and South Downs.Hosepipe bans are still in place for all Yorkshire Water customers along with some customers of Thames Water, South East Water and Southern Water.","The UK government has asked its people to delete old emails to play their part in not wasting water.

It was a simple family scene at a busy event.The outing fits a long family pattern. Zara is an Olympian who has spent most of her life around eventing. Her mother, Princess Anne, was the first royal to compete at the Olympics. Her late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, was a lifelong horsewoman. Seeing Mia comfortable in that world feels natural, and it hints at a next chapter for the Tindalls’ eldest child.Crowd shots from Hartpury showed Mia following each phase and cheering from the ropes. She watched showjumping from close enough to see take-off strides and leaned forward during cross-country updates.Nothing about it felt forced. It looked like a child enjoying her mum’s sport.The event itself is a regular stop for Zara. It draws strong fields across levels and gives riders a good mid-season test. This year she balanced competition with being present for her daughter, and the cameras picked up that easy rhythm. A rider’s focus can be intense on show days. Zara still made space for quick smiles with Mia before heading back to the horsebox.There was also a small stable-side detail that fans loved. Mia reached up to pat Showtime and grinned as the horse flicked an ear toward her. Little gestures like that say more than any speech about where a child’s interests might lead. No one is mapping out her future, but comfort around horses often starts with moments like this.Zara has said before that all three of her children have been on a pony. That early exposure shows. Mia moved around the yard with confidence, giving the horses space when needed and stepping back when grooms asked. It is the kind of quiet horsemanship children pick up by being around good yards.Mother and daughter also offered a simple picture of support. When Zara finished a round, Mia was there. When the next phase approached, Mia made way so the team could work. For families who live the show circuit, that balance is familiar. It is how many young riders begin, watching first, riding later.The photos from Hartpury will add to Mia’s growing gallery of equestrian days out. For now, it is enough to see interest and joy. If she chooses to ride more in public, she will have a mother who understands the sport at the highest level and a family who know how to blend normal life with busy weekends on the road.Hartpury offered a gentle reminder of what this family values. Horses, routine, and time together. One weekend, two good horses, and a child who could not stop watching. That was the story from the rails, and it was easy to read.","Zara Tindall spent the weekend competing at the NAF Five Star International Hartpury Horse Trials in Gloucestershire. Her 11-year-old daughter Mia watched closely, smiled for photos, and reached up to stroke one of Zara’s horses.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123263140,imgsize-89838,width-400,resizemode-4/123263140.jpg"
Meme revived: Van in UK town displays altered image of JD Vance – watch video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/meme-revived-van-in-uk-town-displays-altered-image-of-jd-vance-watch-video/articleshow/123260848.cms,"(Source: Reuters/X)





Residents of the Oxfordshire town of Charlbury were met with an unusual sight this week when a van bearing an altered image of US vice president JD Vance drove through its streets.The picture showed Vance bald in a style widely used in internet memes and was displayed prominently on the vehicle.The stunt was organised by the British political campaign group ‘Everyone Hates Elon’ and took place near where Vance was reportedly holidaying with his family, reports news agency Reuters.The meme has been circulating online for months, gaining extra attention after Vance’s remarks during a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.While the image is generally treated as humorous online, it has been linked to a recent controversy involving a Norwegian tourist.In June, 21-year-old Mads Mikkelsen claimed he was denied entry to the United States at Newark Liberty International Airport after immigration officers discovered the bald Vance meme on his phone. He said he was detained, questioned about drug trafficking and extremism, and pressured to unlock his phone under threat of fines or imprisonment.US customs and border protection later issued a statement denying that the meme played any role in Mikkelsen’s refusal of entry.They said the real reason was his admitted past drug use, dismissing suggestions of political motives.Mikkelsen alleged the experience was humiliating, involving strip-searches, fingerprinting, and errors in his travel records, including his Norwegian passport being incorrectly marked as Spanish.Vance has acknowledged the memes himself, telling The Blaze that he finds them funny.","A van bearing an altered image of US vice president JD Vance drove through Charlbury, Oxfordshire.

Princess Anne is celebrating her 75th birthday with a fresh look and her signature sparkle. A new portrait released ahead of the milestone shows the Princess Royal standing alongside her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence. The photograph was taken before the French state banquet at Windsor Castle in July.The first thing people will notice is her hair. Anne has worn a similar bouffant style for about five decades. In this portrait she switches to a smooth chignon. It is elegant, neat, and suits the formal setting. The change is rare for her, which is why the photo drew quick attention.Tiara is the second talking point in this portrait. Anne chose the Festoon Tiara, a long-time favorite in her rotation. She received it as a gift in 1973 after christening a ship for the Worldwide Shipping Group. The design sits low and balanced, which works well with the new hair. Together they create a cleaner frame around her face.The portrait also doubles as a quiet nod to partnership. Sir Tim stands with her, as he often does at major state events. The two married in 1992 and keep a low profile. Their presence together in the birthday image sets a warm tone as family plans take shape for the coming weeks.There is context behind the timing. The palace shared the photo one week before her August 15 birthday to start the celebrations. It was shot by royal photographer Chris Jackson. He captured it at Windsor before the banquet held for the French state visit from July 8 to 10. The result is formal but relaxed, a look that fits Anne’s usual style.Fashion notes aside, the image also lands after a busy and challenging year. Anne remains one of the most active working royals by engagement count. Last year she briefly stepped back after a horse-related incident near her home. She returned to duties and later said the experience was a reminder that each day is a bonus. The new portrait, bright and composed, underlines that message without a single word.Reactions so far focus on two themes. Many like seeing a small style reset that still feels like Anne. Others appreciate the continuity of the Festoon Tiara, a piece linked to her early twenties and worn across decades. It is a simple mix of new and old. That balance is what people expect from her.As the birthday week begins, more pictures and appearances are likely. For now, one frame does the job. New hair. A classic tiara. Her husband at her side. It is a quiet portrait that still says a lot about how Anne works, dresses, and shows up for the role she has held for most of her life.","Princess Anne is celebrating her 75th birthday with a fresh look and her signature sparkle.

"‘Deport now, appeal later’ scheme: UK expands policy to 23 countries — Is India on the list?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/deport-now-appeal-later-scheme-uk-expands-policy-to-23-countries-is-india-on-the-list/articleshow/123228379.cms,"'Dumped in Africa': Inside Donald Trump's 3rd Country Deportations I Explained

Is India part of the new countries list?



History of 'deport now, appeal later' policy







The UK government is expanding its deportation policy for criminals as part of its ongoing migration crackdown. The government aims to extradite foreign offenders more swiftly by including additional countries in the existing scheme.On Saturday, the government announced its intention to deport criminals immediately after sentencing under the ""deport now, appeal later"" policy, Independent reported.Earlier only 8 countries were in the list, where offenders were deported. Now this list expanded to 23 countries. And yes, India is also one of them.The current government planned to expand the partnership. Previously, offenders were returned to Finland, Nigeria, Estonia, Albania, Belize, Mauritius, Tanzania, and Kosovo for remote hearings. The additional countries include Angola, Australia, Botswana, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Latvia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Uganda, and Zambia, with further countries expected to be added.he Home Office stated that this measure is ""the government's latest tool in its comprehensive approach to scaling up our ability to remove foreign criminals,"" highlighting that there have been 5,200 removals of foreign offenders since July 2024, marking a 14% increase compared to the previous year.Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated, ""Those who commit crimes in our country cannot be allowed to manipulate the system, which is why we are restoring control and sending a clear message that our laws must be respected and will be enforced."" Foreign Secretary David Lammy added, ""We are leading diplomatic efforts to increase the number of countries where foreign criminals can be swiftly returned, and if they want to appeal, they can do so safely from their home country. Under this scheme, we're investing in international partnerships that uphold our security and make our streets safer.""Both ministers had opposed the hostile environment policy while in opposition. In 2015, Sir Keir Starmer questioned the policy's viability, noting that in-person appeals had been the norm for two centuries and were a ""highly effective way of resolving differences.""He also expressed concerns about the impact on children if parents were deported and subsequently returned following a successful appeal. In today’s announcement, the prime minister's administration emphasized its goal to prevent individuals from ""gaming the system"" and to clamp down on those remaining in the UK for extended periods while their appeals are processed.This approach was first introduced in 2014 when Baroness Theresa May served as home secretary, forming part of the Conservative government's hostile environment policy to reduce migration. Under Section 94B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the policy led to the return of hundreds of individuals to countries such as Kenya and Jamaica.In 2017, the Supreme Court effectively halted the policy after it was challenged on human rights grounds, citing that appeals from abroad did not comply with human rights standards.In 2023, then home secretary Suella Braverman reinstated the policy after establishing more facilities abroad for lodging appeals.","The UK government is expanding its deportation policy for criminals as part of its ongoing migration crackdown.

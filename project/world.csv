However, the new order allows agencies discretion over how much multilingual support they offer.""Nothing in this order... requires or directs any change in the services provided by any agency,"" the document said, adding that department heads will decide what is necessary ""to fulfil their respective agencies' mission and efficiently provide Government services to the American people.""Since he took to office, Trump has issued a series of executive orders during his time in office. However, many of his directives faced legal challenges, particularly those affecting federal funding.The White House acknowledged that over 350 languages are spoken across the United States but argued that English has been the language “from the founding of our Republic,"" The order further noted that key historical documents, including the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution, were written in English.According to government data from 2019, nearly 68 million people in the United States speak a language other than English at home. While English remains dominant, more than 40 million Americans are estimated to speak Spanish domestically.The country’s diverse linguistic landscape also includes Chinese, Vietnamese, and numerous Native American languages.","US President Donald Trump officially designated English as the national language of the United States.

'Revisit possibility of syphilis diagnosis': Carville roasts Donald Trump after Zelenskyy clash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/revisit-possibility-of-syphilis-diagnosis-carville-roasts-donald-trump-after-zelenskyy-clash/articleshow/118657551.cms,"Donald Trump (File photo), Democratic strategist James Carville (Image grab from Politiconvideo)

James Carville: What Just Happened In The Oval Office

Democratic strategist James Carville launched a scathing attack on President Donald Trump, suggesting he should be tested for syphilis following his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House.In a video for Politicon, Carville described the meeting as “stunning” and questioned Trump’s mental state, linking his behavior to what he called “madness.” He further speculated that Trump’s alleged health issues, including red splotches on his hands, could be symptoms of syphilis.“It’s impossible for me to ignore the events in the Oval Office earlier today. It’s stunning,” Carville said. “There’s an expression here in south Louisiana... ‘that boy ain’t right.’ When you look at Trump, the first thing that comes to your mind, that boy ain’t right.”Carville’s tirade extended beyond the meeting with Zelenskyy, taking aim at Trump’s physical appearance, marriage, and overall health. He called Trump a “fat f***ing slob” with a “beached whale body,” claiming his weight could be contributing to sleep and circulation problems.“I pointed out on this very channel where Trump had red splotches on his hand, which I was told by any number of medical professionals that when you see that condition, the first thing that you suspect is syphilis,” Carville said. “We know from any number of videos that his wife doesn’t want to get in the same zip code as him. If you had a spouse that had syphilis — you know, I’m not saying he does. I want to be clear. I’m just asking questions.”Carville likened Trump’s behavior to that of King George III, who was believed to suffer from mental instability. “What you saw is madness. And I don’t mean madness like I’m mad at you. I’m talking about madness like King George III kind of madness,” he said.While Carville did not provide medical evidence to support his claims, he insisted the idea of a syphilis diagnosis should be “revisited.” The Mayo Clinic describes syphilis as a bacterial infection that can lead to severe complications if untreated, affecting the heart, brain, and other organs.Neither Trump nor his representatives have responded to Carville’s remarks.","Democratic strategist James Carville suggested President Donald Trump should be tested for syphilis.

US: Top Black woman Army general retires amid Donald Trump's DEI crackdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-top-black-woman-army-general-retires-amid-donald-trumps-dei-crackdown/articleshow/118657349.cms,"Telita Crosland.

US Army's lieutenant general Telita Crosland , the head of the military’s health agency, retired on Friday, making her the latest senior officer to leave under President Donald Trump’s administration.The retirement comes a week after Trump dismissed six senior military officials, including the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the US Navy’s first female leader.Stephen Ferrara, the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, confirmed Crosland’s retirement. ""I want to thank Crosland for her dedication to the nation, to the military health system, and to Army medicine for the past 32 years,"" he said in a statement.However, Crosland was told she had to retire. The officials said no reason was given for the decision, two former officials were quoted as saying by the news agency Reuters.Crosland, who was the first Black woman to lead the Defense Health Agency (DHA), graduated from West Point and joined the US Army as a Medical Corps officer in 1993. She previously served as the Army’s deputy surgeon general, according to her Defense fepartment biography.The Pentagon, under defense secretary Pete Hegseth, has been moving to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Hegseth has argued that these initiatives harm unit cohesion.""The single dumbest phrase in military history is ‘our diversity is our strength,'"" Hegseth said earlier this month during a Pentagon town hall. ""From our perspective, why do you get rid of something like DEI? Because from our perspective, it’s served a purpose of dividing the force, as opposed to uniting the force.""Trump’s defense officials have also ordered an end to identity month celebrations such as Black History Month and Women’s History Month. They have directed the Pentagon to remove all DEI-related content from its platforms.The administration is also moving forward with a policy to remove all transgender service members from the military.","Crosland was the first Black woman to lead the Defense Health Agency (DHA) She previously served as the Army’s deputy surgeon general.

Anti-DOGE Protests erupted outside Tesla stores across the United States on Saturday, with demonstrators opposing CEO Elon Musk’s efforts to cut government spending under President Donald Trump’s administration. The protests, part of a broader backlash against Musk’s influence in Washington, also targeted Tesla’s reputation, urging boycotts of the electric vehicle company.According to news reports, more than 50 demonstrations took place across US cities, including Tucson, St. Louis, New York City, Dayton, Charlotte, and Palo Alto, with additional protests planned in England, Spain, and Portugal later in March. A website named 'Tesla Takedown' listed multiple events across North America and Europe.Nathan Phillips, a 58-year-old ecologist protesting in Boston, said, “We can get back at Elon. We can impose direct economic damage on Tesla by showing up at showrooms everywhere and boycotting Tesla and telling everyone else to get out, sell your stocks, sell your Teslas.”Critics argue that Musk’s moves, including directing government job cuts and shutting down sections of federal agencies such as the US Agency for International Development, overstep Congress’s budgetary authority and could create conflicts of interest due to his business ties. Musk also leads SpaceX, which handles Nasa and intelligence community contracts, as well as the social media platform X.Demonstrations in some locations turned tense. In New York City, around 300 people gathered at a Tesla dealership, with police taking nine individuals into custody. Federal prosecutors also charged a woman with vandalising a Tesla dealership in Colorado, where Molotov cocktails were thrown at vehicles and the words “Nazi cars” were spray-painted on the building.Some Tesla owners have reported acts of vandalism against their vehicles, with Jewish groups expressing concern over rising antisemitic incidents. News reports mention spray-painted swastikas on Tesla cars amid the growing controversy.Despite the protests, Musk remains one of the world’s richest individuals, with an estimated net worth of USD 359 billion, according to Forbes. Tesla’s stock has fallen nearly a third since Trump took office, though it remains higher than its value a year ago.Carina Campovasso, a retired federal worker, said during the Boston demonstration, “This government led by Trump and Musk, it’s gone completely off the rails and we are here to stop that. And I hope they listen.”","More than 50 demonstrations took place across US cities, including Tucson, St. Louis, New York City, Dayton, Charlotte, and Palo Alto, with additional protests planned in England, Spain, and Portugal later in March.

House Republicans mulls removing Washington’s Black Lives Matter Plaza: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/house-republicans-mulls-removing-washingtons-black-lives-matter-plaza-report/articleshow/118657193.cms,"House Republicans seek to remove Washington’s Black Lives Matter Plaza (New York Post image)

House Republicans are working on a plan to eliminate Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington, DC, arguing that it represents partisan governance and diverts focus from addressing crime in the city, The New York Post reported.The two-block plaza, located near the White House, was established in June 2020 under Mayor Muriel Bowser’s administration and features the phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" painted in large yellow block letters across 16th Street NW. An additional “DEFUND THE POLICE” message, added by activists, was later removed during roadwork.House Oversight Committee Chair Rep. James Comer (R-Ky) confirmed the committee’s intent to address the issue as part of broader efforts to reform governance in the nation’s capital.“The House Oversight Committee and the Trump administration are working on delivering a number of reforms to make our nation’s capital safe and end left-wing pet projects. This includes addressing partisan abuses by the District government such as Black Lives Matter Plaza,” Comer said.The Republican-led initiative aligns with President Donald Trump’s push to eliminate what he calls “woke ideology” from federal governance. The committee did not specify which other projects may be reconsidered.Under the Home Rule Act of 1973, Congress retains the authority to override local decisions in Washington, DC It previously exercised this power in 2023 when it blocked a city law that would have reduced maximum penalties for violent crimes.Republicans, including Trump, have advocated for greater federal control over DC , citing rising crime rates.“Mayor Bowser and Democrat-run Washington, DC are focused on virtue signaling and spending taxpayer money to paint Black Lives Matter instead of the record spike in homicides, carjackings, and other violent crimes,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said.He added: “Washington DC’s failures are a reminder why the city must never become a state.”The debate over Black Lives Matter Plaza remains part of the broader political divide over crime policies and federal oversight in the US capital.","The two-block plaza, located near the White House, was established in June 2020 under Mayor Muriel Bowser’s administration and features the phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" painted in large yellow block letters across 16th Street NW.

JD Vance: 'Pitbull' or 'next President'?

'Pitbull' or 'next President'?



'JD is different than Elon'



'He's not speaking loudly': How Trump backed JD



US Vice President JD Vance stole the show of the shouting match between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday as he triggered the never-seen-before meltdown on television of world leaders when he imparted a lesson of gratitude to Zelenskyy. This is Vance's second major show in international affairs -- as his critics do not call Friday's fallout a win though Zelenskyy softened his stance hours after the ugly spat.A few weeks ago, Vance's unorthodox remarks at the Munich Security Conference signaled a new working style of the US Vice President who did not baulk before accusing European leaders of suppressing free speech and censorship. The White House meeting of Trump, Zelenskyy saw Vance in a new role of a defender of his boss Trump and neither did Trump intervene to diffuse the situation.Accusing Zelenskyy of leading ""propaganda tours"" of the destruction done by Russian invasion, JD Vance said he has been to Ukraine and seen the situation. “I think it’s disrespectful to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media,” Vance said, his voice rising. “You bring people on a propaganda tour, Mr President … Do you think that it’s respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?”“During the war, everyone has problems,” Zelenskyy replied. “But you have nice ocean and don’t feel now. But you will feel it in the future.”It was then that the meeting took an ugly turn and Zelenskyy left the White House without signing the minerals deal.JD Vance is the first choice of the Republicans as the next presidential candidate. Even in the recently concluded CPAC (Conservative Political Action Conference), Vance won 61 per cent support as the presidential candidate for 2028. Vance's strong stance in the Zelenskyy meeting made the call stronger.In fact, Elon Musk called Vance the next president after Vance's interaction with UK Prime Minister Keir Stamer where Vance spoke about free speech.However, Vance was called Donald Trump's 'attack dog', and 'pitbull' as he triggered the face-off.One US official told Reuters that the face-off was the flexing of JD Vance. ""Vance is different than Elon. For him to sit and take on Zelenskyy in front of Trump was a very big moment. He moved to support the president, and Trump loves it when people step out to do the confrontation that he usually does,"" the official said.During the heated argument, Zelenskyy referred to Vance as JD and asked, ""What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?"" Vance called Zelenskyy 'Mr President' and said, ""I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country.""Zelenskyy noted that Vance was speaking loudly but Trump who was enjoying the confrontation stepped in and said, ""He's not speaking loudly."" ""You've done a lot of talking. Your country is in big trouble.""Later in the day, JD Vance did not put any statement on social media after the face-off. He only shared President Trump's statement on the confrontation maintaining a low profile on X.",US Vice President JD Vance stole the show of the shouting match between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday.

Which side triggered the biggest trainwreck in modern diplomatic history and what was the provocation is being bitterly contested in interviews and on social media in the hours following the fiasco, with millions of posts on the biggest geo-political debacle in modern times.According to Trump and his MAGA minions, it was Zelenskyy who was rude and ungrateful as he pushed the Trump-Vance team for security guarantees and unloaded on Putin, saying he had repeatedly violated ceasefire agreements. He was speaking to an US MAGA leadership that has openly reversed course from previous administration and has embraced Russia and Putin at the expense of its European allies.There were several points Zelenskyy made which appeared to trigger Trump, particularly when the Ukrainian leader talked of Russia's depredations against Ukraine going back more than a decade to 2014, suggesting that even Trump was part of the US leadership that little to stop Moscow.Trump was also visibly angered when Zelenskyy said the US is protected by two oceans and despite this could feel the heat some day, a remark that some MAGA folk saw as an insidious threat to America. When Trump told him that he was in a lot of trouble and losing the war against Russia, Zelenskyy responded, “First of all, during the war, everybody has problems, even you. But you have nice ocean and don’t feel now. But you will feel it in the future. God bless –”“You don’t know that. You don’t know that. Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel. We’re trying to solve a problem. Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel.”“I’m not telling you. I am answering on these questions.”“Because you’re in no position to dictate that.”“That’s exactly what you’re doing.”“You are in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel. We’re going to feel very good.”“You will feel influenced.”“We are going to feel very good and very strong.”“I am telling you. You will feel influenced.”“You’re, right now, not in a very good position. You’ve allowed yourself to be in a very bad position –”“From the very beginning of the war —”“You’re not in a good position. You don’t have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards.”“I’m not playing cards. I’m very serious, Mr. President. I’m very serious.”“You’re playing cards. You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people. You’re gambling with World War III.”“What are you speaking about?”“You’re gambling with World War III. And what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that’s backed you far more than a lot of people said they should have.”Secretary of State Marco Rubio, among those who did the prep work for the rare minerals deal, said later, ""There was no need for him to go in there and become antagonistic...He should apologize for wasting our time for a meeting to end the way it did.""""Don't come here and create a scenario where you're going to start lecturing us about how diplomacy isn't going to work,"" Rubio said, revealing that it was the Ukrainians who insisted on coming to Washington DC for a deal that could have been signed in Kyiv five days ago.Trump's vice-president JD Vance too seemed to harbor resentment about Zelenskyy purportedly campaigning for Kamala Harris during the 2024 election campaign.“Have you said thank you once?”“A lot of times. Even today.”“No, in this entire meeting. You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October.”“No.”“Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who’s trying to save your country.”“Please. You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war, you can –”“He’s not speaking loudly. He’s not speaking loudly. Your country is in big trouble.”“Can I answer —”“No, no. You’ve done a lot of talking. Your country is in big trouble.”“I know. I know.”“You’re not winning. You’re not winning this. You have a damn good chance of coming out OK because of us.”“Mr. President, we are staying in our country, staying strong. From the very beginning of the war, we’ve been alone. And we are thankful. I said thanks.”Zelenskyy's assertion that Ukraine has been alone also seemed to offend Trump, who claims the US has given $ 350 billion to Kyiv at the expense of American taxpayers, plowing money into a war that is unwinnable.“If you didn’t have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.”“In three days. I heard it from Putin. In three days.”“Maybe less. It’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this, I tell you.“Just say thank you.”“I said a lot of times, thank you, to American people.”“Accept that there are disagreements, and let’s go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it out in the American media when you’re wrong. We know that you’re wrong.”“But you see, I think it’s good for the American people to see what’s going on. I think it’s very important. That’s why I kept this going so long. You have to be thankful.”“I’m thankful.”“You don’t have the cards. You’re buried there. People are dying. You’re running low on soldiers. It would be a damn good thing, and then you tell us, ‘I don’t want a ceasefire. I don’t want a ceasefire, I want to go, and I want this.’ Look, if you can get a ceasefire right now, I tell you, you take it so the bullets stop flying and your men stop getting killed.”“Of course we want to stop the war. But I said to you, with guarantees.”Trump: “Are you saying you don’t want a ceasefire? I want a ceasefire. Because you’ll get a ceasefire faster than an agreement.”“Ask our people about a ceasefire, what they think.”“That wasn’t with me. That was with a guy named Biden, who is not a smart person.”“This is your president. It was your president.”","According to Trump and his MAGA minions, it was Zelenskyy who was rude and ungrateful as he pushed the Trump-Vance team for security guarantees. He was speaking to an US leadership that has openly reversed course from previous administration and has embraced Russia and Putin at the expense of its European allies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118651843,imgsize-1246700,width-400,resizemode-4/118651843.jpg"

Iowa Gender Identity: Iowa becomes first US state to remove gender identity protections under Donald Trump’s administration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/iowa-becomes-first-us-state-to-remove-gender-identity-protections-under-donald-trumps-administration/articleshow/118642648.cms,"Representative Image

Iowa has become the first US state to remove gender identity protections from its civil rights code after governor Kim Reynolds signed a new law on Friday. The move, which takes effect on July 1, has sparked strong opposition from LGBTQ+ advocates who say it could lead to widespread discrimination.The law eliminates gender identity as a protected category under Iowa’s civil rights code, undoing provisions that were added in 2007. It also establishes legal definitions of male and female based on reproductive organs at birth, rejecting the notion that a person can transition to another gender. Republicans backing the bill argue that gender identity protections cannot coexist with policies restricting transgender individuals from using certain bathrooms, locker rooms, or sports teams.“It’s common sense to acknowledge the obvious biological differences between men and women,” Reynolds said in a video posted on social media, defending her decision to sign the bill. She claimed that the previous civil rights code had “blurred the biological line between the sexes.”The bill moved through the Iowa Legislature after being introduced just last week. While all Democrats voted against it, five House Republicans also opposed the measure.Iowa state Representative Aime Wichtendahl, the first openly transgender lawmaker in the state, spoke before the final vote, saying: “I transitioned to save my life. The purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence.”Hundreds of LGBTQ+ activists gathered at the Iowa Capitol on Thursday, waving signs reading “Trans rights are human rights” and chanting, “No hate in our state!” A heavy police presence was in place. As the final votes were cast, some protesters became visibly emotional.US President Donald Trump , who signed an executive order during his first day in office defining legal sex categories at the federal level, voiced support for the Iowa bill. On Thursday, he posted on Truth Social in favour of the measure after it passed both chambers of the Iowa Legislature.Republican Representative Steven Holt, who backed the bill, justified the removal of gender identity protections by stating that if the Legislature could add them, it could also remove them.Legal experts and advocacy groups, including LGBTQ+ rights organisation One Iowa, have vowed to challenge the law in court. Keenan Crow, the group’s director of policy and advocacy, criticised the bill’s vague language, saying, “We will pursue any legal options available to us.”While not every US state includes gender identity in its civil rights laws, Iowa is now the first to actively strip such protections. The state’s Supreme Court has previously ruled that discrimination based on sex does not automatically include gender identity discrimination.As of July 1, Iowa’s civil rights law will continue to protect individuals from discrimination based on race, colour, creed, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, and disability status—but not gender identity.LGBTQ+ advocacy groups warn that the change could lead to legal battles and increased difficulties for transgender Iowans in employment, housing, and public accommodations.","Iowa has become the first US state to remove gender identity protections from its civil rights code after governor Kim Reynolds signed a new law on Friday.

WASHINGTON: Three civilian aircraft reportedly violated the airspace above US President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, prompting the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) to scramble F-16 fighter jets, according to the Daily Mail.The fighter jets deployed flares and escorted the planes out of the restricted airspace, the report said. It remains unclear why the aircraft entered Palm Beach airspace, though similar incidents have occurred in recent weeks.According to Palm Beach Post, three airspace violations took place during Trump’s visit to Mar-a-Lago in February. Two violations occurred on February 15, while another took place on Presidents Day, February 17. There were also reports of F-16s responding to airspace breaches over Wellington, an inland community, and another civilian aircraft flying into Palm Beach on February 18.NORAD, in its response, stated that the flares used during such incidents are “employed with the highest regard for safety, burn out quickly and completely, and pose no danger to people on the ground.”Meanwhile, Irish Star reported that Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago after the fighter jets had dealt with the airspace violations.In a separate development, Trump claimed that boxes of classified documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago residence during a 2022 FBI investigation had been returned to him. According to AFP, Trump suggested that these documents, which were at the center of an inquiry into his handling of government records, could be displayed in his future presidential library.“The department just returned the boxes that Deranged Jack Smith made such a big deal about,” Trump posted on Truth Social, referring to Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the case.“They are being brought down to Florida and will someday be part of the Trump Presidential Library,” he added.The Justice Department has not confirmed Trump’s claim regarding the return of the documents.","Three civilian aircraft reportedly violated the airspace above US President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

Grammy-nominated R&B singer Angie Stone , known for hits like Wish I Didn’t Miss You and No More Rain (In This Cloud), died in a car crash early Saturday. She was 63.Stone was traveling back to Atlanta from Alabama when the vehicle she was riding in overturned and was struck by a big rig around 4 am, her longtime manager Walter Millsap III told The Associated Press. While others in the van survived, Stone succumbed to her injuries.Her children, Diamond and Michael Archer, expressed their grief in a statement shared by the SRG Group: “Never in a million years did we ever expect to get this horrible news. We are still trying to process and are completely heartbroken.”Millsap described the loss as “an unexpected and unfortunate tragedy,” adding, “there are simply no words to express how we feel.”Stone had been scheduled to perform at the halftime show of the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) men’s championship basketball game on Saturday. CIAA Chaplain Pastor Jerome Barber led a moment of silence in her honour. Commissioner Jacqie McWilliams-Parker said the league was “heartbroken by the loss” and praised Stone for using her talent to “inspire and touch us with strength and hope.”A trailblazer in hip-hop and R&B, Stone first gained recognition as a member of The Sequence, the pioneering all-female rap trio signed to Sugar Hill Records. Their song Funk You Up became a hip-hop classic, later sampled by artists such as Dr. Dre. She later joined the R&B trio Vertical Hold before launching a successful solo career.Stone was a key figure in the neo-soul movement of the early 2000s alongside Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Maxwell, and D’Angelo. Her 2001 album Mahogany Soul reached No. 22 on the Billboard 200, while The Art of Love & War (2007) peaked at No. 11.

Nasa's

private Moon fleet

WASHINGTON: More than fifty years passed between the last Apollo mission and the United States' return to the lunar surface, when the first-ever private lander touched down last February.Now, starting Sunday, two more missions are set to follow within a single week, marking a bold push by Nasa and its industry partners to make Moon landings a routine part of space exploration.First up is Firefly Aerospace 's Blue Ghost Mission 1 , nicknamed ""Ghost Riders in the Sky.""After launching in January on a 45-day journey, it is targeting touchdown near Mons Latreille, a volcanic feature in Mare Crisium on the Moon's northeastern near side, at 3.34 am US Eastern time (0834 GMT). Along the way, it has captured stunning footage of the Moon, coming as close as 60 miles (100 kilometers) above the surface.The golden lander, about the size of a hippopotamus, carries ten instruments, including one to analyze lunar soil, another to test radiation-tolerant computing, and a GPS-based navigation system.Designed to operate for a full lunar day (14 Earth days), Blue Ghost is expected to capture high-definition imagery of a total eclipse on March 14, when Earth blocks the Sun from the Moon's horizon.On March 16, it will record a lunar sunset, offering insights into how dust levitates above the surface under solar influence -- creating the mysterious lunar horizon glow first documented by Apollo astronaut Eugene Cernan.Blue Ghost's arrival will be followed on March 6 by Intuitive Machines ' IM-2 mission, featuring its lander, Athena.Last year, Intuitive Machines made history as the first private company to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, though the moment was tempered by a mishap.Coming down too fast, one of the lander's feet caught on the lunar surface, tipping it over and causing it to rest sideways -- limiting its ability to generate solar power and cutting the mission short.This time, the company says it has made key improvements to the hexagonal-shaped lander, which has a taller, slimmer profile than Blue Ghost, and is around the height of an adult giraffe.Athena launched on Wednesday aboard a SpaceX rocket, taking a more direct route toward Mons Mouton -- the southernmost lunar landing site ever attempted.It carries an ambitious set of payloads, including a unique hopping drone designed to explore the Moon's underground passages carved by ancient lava flows, a drill capable of digging three feet beneath the surface in search of ice, and three rovers.The largest, about the size of a beagle, will connect to the lander and hopper using a Nokia cellular network in a first-of-its-kind demonstration.But ""Grace,"" the hopping drone -- named after computing pioneer Grace Hopper -- could well steal the show if it succeeds in showing it can navigate the Moon's treacherous terrain in ways no rover can.Landing on the Moon presents unique challenges due to the absence of an atmosphere, making parachutes ineffective. Instead, spacecraft must rely on precisely controlled thruster burns to slow their descent while navigating hazardous terrain.Until Intuitive Machines' first successful mission, only five national space agencies had accomplished this feat: the Soviet Union, the United States, China, India and Japan, in that order.Now, the United States is working to make private lunar missions routine through NASA's $2.6 billion Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, a public-private initiative designed to deliver hardware to the surface at a fraction of traditional mission costs.These missions come at a pivotal moment for NASA, amid speculation that it may scale back or even cancel its Artemis lunar program in favor of prioritizing Mars exploration -- a key goal of both President Donald Trump and his close advisor, SpaceX founder Elon Musk.",First private mission to the Moon set to land on the Moon on Sunday. Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost will be the first to touch down. Intuitive Machines' Athena will follow on March 6. Both missions are part of Nasa's $2.6 billion Commercial Lunar Payload Services program.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118657068,imgsize-1354758,width-400,resizemode-4/118657068.jpg"

WASHINGTON: Donald Trump , who at 78 is on course to become the oldest president in American history, will undergo an annual physical exam in coming weeks, a White House statement said Saturday.""President Donald J.

His doctor said there were no signs of ""any cognitive issues,"" and that with a healthier diet, he could ""live to be 200 years old.""A year later, an exam found the 6-foot-3 (1.9 meter) Trump weighed 243 pounds (110 kilograms), up seven pounds since shortly before taking office, making him technically obese. It said he was taking medication to treat high cholesterol.During Trump's presidential campaign in 2015, his doctor, Harold Bornstein, released a letter saying the candidate's blood pressure was ""astonishingly excellent"" and that if elected, ""Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.""Bornstein later told CNN that Trump himself ""dictated that whole letter.

Friday's tense exchange between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy extended behind closed doors, as the two leaders remained at odds following their heated White House clash.Despite an initial display of public camaraderie, tensions persisted as two leaders saw the removal of the foreign delegation from the White House.US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz provided a firsthand account of the tense moment, when he told ""still argumentative"" Zelenskyy that it was time to leave the White House.Mike Waltz, speaking on Saturday’s “Fox and Friends Weekend,” detailed how he and Secretary of State Marco Rubio escorted Zelenskyy out after the meeting concluded.Reflecting on Friday's events, Waltz questioned whether Zelenskyy “truly wants to stop the fighting,” noting that the situation left Trump “frustrated and angry.”When asked if Zelenskyy appeared to grasp the gravity of the situation, Waltz responded: “No, he didn’t. Frankly, his team did. His ambassador and his adviser were practically – I mean, they were practically in tears wanting this to move forward. But Zelenskyy was still argumentative.”“Time is not on your side here. Time is not on your side on the battlefield. Time is not on your side in terms of the world situation, and, most importantly, US aid and the taxpayers’ tolerance is not unlimited,” Waltz recalled telling Zelenskyy.He further explained “We had a meeting after that exchange after the press was asked to leave, and we pretty much unanimously advised the President that after that insult in the Oval Office, we just do not see how that could move forward, that any further engagement would only go backwards from this moment on, and that’s what we walked over and told President Zelenskyy and his team.”Before the negotiations fell apart, Zelenskyy engaged in an exchange with Trump and Vice President JD Vance .During a Friday CNN appearance, US Secretary of State Rubio stated Zelenskyy should apologise to President Trump ""for turning this thing into the fiasco for him that it became.""""There was no need for him to go in there and become antagonistic,"" Rubio told presenter Kaitlan Collins.In the Friday interview, Rubio questioned Zelenskyy's commitment to ending the conflict, stating: “You start to suspect, does he really want an end to this war? Does he just think that we have to do whatever he says and give him anything he wants without any end game?”The Oval Office meeting initially started on a positive note, with friendly exchanges, including Trump remarking, ""I think he's a great guy,"" in reference to Zelenskyy.However, tensions escalated when Zelenskyy attempted to discuss Russian President Vladimir Putin’s diplomatic stance with Vice President Vance in front of the press.Vance criticized Zelenskyy for what he saw as opportunistic photo ops with Democrats during the 2024 campaign and accused him of disrespecting the administration.Trump, raising his voice, reprimanded Zelenskyy for being ungrateful and insisted he should show more appreciation for US support, stating bluntly, ""You don't have the cards.""Following the meeting, Zelenskyy took to X, posting: “Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.”In the aftermath, leaders from France, Germany, Sweden, Canada, Poland, and the Netherlands voiced their support for Zelenskyy on social media.

Is Tesla feeling heat of anti-Elon backlash?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-tesla-feeling-heat-of-anti-elon-backlash/articleshow/118655863.cms,"Tesla

Tesla followed up its worst sales month in years in France with another weak showing in Feb, prolonging its early-year slump in one of Europe's biggest markets for electric vehicles. Its sales across Europe fell 45%, in stark contrast with the 37% jump in overall EV registrations.Tesla registered 2,395 cars last month in France, down 26% from a year ago. Tesla's decline compares with a 0.7% drop in total industry sales. Tesla is off to a slow start to the year in part due to the changeover of its most popular vehicle, the Model Y, to a new design. It requires a weeks-long pause in output to update production lines, which likely is costing the company sales.Investors are concerned that Tesla is bearing the brunt of retaliation against Musk, who's increasingly asserting himself in global politics as one of Trump's top advisers. Consumers have protested the Tesla CEO at dozens of Tesla stores and several showrooms have been vandalised in recent weeks. Registrations plunged 63% to 1,141 cars in Jan, its lowest total in France since Aug 2022, and also declined in key markets including the UK and Germany.","Tesla registered 2,395 cars last month in France, down 26% from a year ago.

"Alarmed by Trump, a renowned German violinist boycotts the US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/alarmed-by-trump-a-renowned-german-violinist-boycotts-the-us/articleshow/118655731.cms,"Christian Tetzlaff (File photo)

When German violinist Christian Tetzlaff returned home to Berlin after a recent performance in Chicago, he was distraught. The concert had gone well, but he was increasingly disturbed by political developments in the United States: President Donald Trump's embrace of Russia, the dizzying cuts to the federal workforce and changes in policies affecting transgender Americans.""I felt like a child watching a horror film,"" he said in an interview.On Friday, Tetzlaff, 58, a renowned violinist who frequently performs in the United States, said that he was canceling an eight-city tour of the country with his quartet this spring -- including a stop at New York City's Carnegie Hall -- and that he was unlikely to perform again in America unless the government reversed course.""There seems to be a quietness or denial about what's going on,"" he said. ""I feel utter anger. I cannot go on with this feeling inside. I cannot just go and play a tour of beautiful concerts.""Harrison W. Fields, a White House spokesperson, offered a two-word response to Tetzlaff's cancellation: ""America first.""Tetzlaff is one of the first major foreign artists to try to use a cultural boycott to influence Trump's policies during his second term.For decades, American artists have canceled tours as a means of protesting war, autocracy, injustice and discrimination abroad. There were cultural boycotts of South Africa in the 1970s and 1980s in protest of its policy of apartheid, and more recently, artists have refused to perform in Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Now, with the Trump administration dramatically remaking both domestic and foreign policy in its first 100 days, some performers are employing the tactic and turning the tables: canceling performances in the United States.It is unclear if the strategy will have much impact on the highly polarized political environment in America. The vast majority of foreign artists have kept their engagements.Tetzlaff said he hoped to start a conversation.""I pay 32% taxes on every concert I play in the United States,"" he said. ""That goes, at the moment, to a state that does partially horrible things with the money. And so to complain and then to say, 'I take my money and go home' -- that's also not good.""Many artists, especially those from Europe, have been alarmed by Trump's embrace of Russia and his criticism of Ukraine in his second term. Just last week, Trump falsely asserted that Ukraine ""started"" the war with Russia and called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a ""dictator without elections."" On Friday, Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelenskyy in an unusually fractious White House meeting, accusing him of not being grateful enough for U.S. support.Tetzlaff said the US government was betraying Ukraine -- and that its new approach to the conflict was a major factor in his decision to cancel his appearances.""Have the American people forgotten the pictures and tales of the scores of slain civilians in every town the Russians invaded?"" he said.Tetzlaff, who was to appear in March with his ensemble, the Tetzlaff Quartet, in New York, Connecticut, Georgia and California, said he was also likely to cancel his engagements planned this summer and fall in the United States. He added that he would be open to performing benefit concerts in the United States for Ukraine or for groups that support women's rights.""Anything that could help mend wounds in society or to help people who are being slighted now,"" he said.Tetzlaff first performed in the United States in 1988 and has about 20 engagements here each year. Calling America a ""big part of my musical life,"" he said he would be saddened to add it to the list of countries where he does not perform. That list includes China and Russia, which he has avoided because of government policies.Tetzlaff said that he had consulted friends and colleagues and that many disagreed with his decision, saying that music could help bring people together. But he said he was inspired partly by the example of composers such as Ludwig van Beethoven, Johannes Brahms and Béla Bartók, whose music touched on themes of freedom and individuality.""I cannot see myself as an entertainer; it's not our aim to please an audience so they go home and say, 'This was a lovely evening,' with a good glass of red wine,"" he said. ""Music sends messages about the human condition, about empathy and the heart. We have to uphold these ideals.""","Violinist Christian Tetzlaff says he is canceling an eight-city tour of the U.S. He is one of the first major foreign artists to try to use a cultural boycott to influence Trump's policies.

Who is Andrew Cuomo? Former New York governor enters crowded NYC mayor’s race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-andrew-cuomo-former-new-york-governor-enters-crowded-nyc-mayors-race/articleshow/118654598.cms,"Andrew Cuomo

Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has officially launched his bid for mayor of New York City, shaking up an already competitive Democratic primary and posing a serious challenge to incumbent Mayor Eric Adams .Cuomo, who resigned in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations , enters the race as the immediate frontrunner, leveraging his name recognition and Adams’ declining popularity. His announcement follows months of speculation, during which he quietly consolidated support among key political figures and donors.“The city just feels threatening, out of control,” Cuomo said in a nearly 18-minute campaign video. “These conditions exist not as an act of God, but rather as an act of our political leaders.”While Cuomo’s comeback has been met with skepticism due to his past scandals—including the nursing home controversy during Covid-19 and the sexual misconduct claims—his moderate stance sets him apart from the progressive candidates in the race.Rival candidates, including City Comptroller Brad Lander and Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, quickly criticized Cuomo, highlighting his past controversies. “He resigned for sexually harassing 13 women and leading thousands of elderly New Yorkers to their deaths during Covid-19,” Lander posted on social media.Polls suggest Cuomo holds a strong lead, with one survey showing him securing 51% of ranked-choice votes. However, when respondents were reminded of his scandals, his support dropped to 19%.With Adams’ approval ratings plummeting and the June 24 primary approaching, Cuomo’s entry signals a high-stakes battle for City Hall. The winner will likely face Republican Curtis Sliwa in the November general election.","Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has officially launched his bid for mayor of New York City.

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is back with another demand for federal employees: Prove your worth or risk consequences. In reportedly a move spearheaded by President Donald Trump and tech mogul Elon Musk, workers across federal agencies received an email this week titled, ""What did you do last week? Part II.""The email, reportedly sent from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), caught many by surprise, as it was originally expected to come from individual agencies. According to multiple reports, the new directive requires workers to submit five bullet points detailing their weekly accomplishments—due every Monday by 11:59 p.m. EST.The mandate, aimed at cutting government waste, has stirred controversy. Addressing concerns during Trump’s first full Cabinet meeting, Musk dismissed criticisms.""I think that email was perhaps interpreted as a performance review, but actually, it was a pulse check,"" Musk quipped. ""And if you have a pulse and two neurons, you could reply to an email.""Unlike the previous email, this one explicitly instructs workers not to disclose classified or sensitive information. Employees whose tasks are entirely classified are reportedly told to respond with: ""All of my activities are sensitive.""Musk reiterated the importance of compliance, responding to a tweet about Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth instructing Department of Defense employees to respond.""The President has made it clear that this is mandatory for the executive branch,"" Musk wrote on X. ""Anyone working on classified or other sensitive matters is still required to respond if they receive the email, but can simply reply that their work is sensitive.""During his Oval Office meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump defended the measure, making it clear that failing to respond could have serious consequences.""If you don’t answer, you don’t need to be here,"" Trump said.As the federal workforce scrambles to comply, critics are questioning whether this is about efficiency—or intimidation.","Federal employees received an email this week titled, ""What did you do last week?

ISLAMABAD: At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque of an Islamic religious school known as the “university of jihad” in Nowshera district of Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province on Friday.Among the dead were Maulana Hamid-ul-Haq Haqqani , head of Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania school, the seminary in Nowshera’s Akora Khattak town where key Afghan Taliban leaders have studied. Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place. They said the casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.Haqqani, the son of slain prominent Pakistani cleric Sami-ul-Haq Haqqani, known as the “father of Taliban, was a vice-chancellor of the sprawling seminary, located 60 km from the provincial capital of Peshawar. Following his father’s assassination in 2018, he also became chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sami (JUI-S) political party. He had also previously served as a member of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007.Haq was also among the few who called on the world and Pakistan to immediately recognise the Taliban govt and establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul in 2021.Last year, he led a delegation of religious scholars to Afghanistan for “religious diplomacy” meetings with Taliban leaders.His seminary had faced controversy in the past as its students were accused of involvement in the assassination of Pakistan’s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. The madrasa, however, denied any connection with the suspects.","At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque.

China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong , marking the first time a foreign national will be aboard the facility.The deal was signed in a ceremony held in Islamabad on Friday, between the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) and Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO). Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was alos present during the ceremony.According to a statement by CMSA, both nations will collaborate on selecting and training Pakistani astronauts, with the chosen candidate expected to join Chinese taikonauts for a short-term mission in the coming years.""This signifies a major step in China’s international space cooperation ,"" reported Global Times, highlighting the growing partnership between Beijing and Islamabad in aerospace advancements.China’s space station, which has been operational for nearly four years, was built after the country was reportedly excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns over the involvement of China’s military in its space programme.The station is also seen as a new frontier of competition between China and the US.As per the news agency PTI, the agreement further solidifies China’s support for Pakistan’s space ambitions, following previous collaborations such as the launch of Pakistani satellites.Pakistan’s first digital communications satellite, Badr-1, was launched aboard a Chinese Long March 2E rocket in 1990, while earlier this year, Pakistan’s CubeSat accompanied China’s Chang’e-6 probe to the Moon.According to Global Times, the selection of the astronaut is expected to take around a year, after which the candidate will undergo intensive training in China. This move, experts say, demonstrates the reliability of China's manned space technology and its willingness to lower barriers for developing countries to participate in space exploration .China has also set ambitious goals for space exploration, with plans to land astronauts on the Moon before 2030.Meanwhile, the US has its sights set on returning to the lunar surface by 2025.","China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong.

Following his father's tragic death, he assumed the roles of vice chancellor at Jamia Darul Uloon Haqqania and chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (Sami).The madressah was established by Islamic scholar Maulana Abdul Haq Haqqani in September 1947, according to the institution's website.Previously, the Madrassa faced scrutiny when its students were alleged to be involved in former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's assassination. However, the madrassa has consistently denied any links to the suspects.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif issued a firm condemnation of the incident and offered prayers for Maulana Haq and other casualties' recovery, as stated by the Prime Minister's Office.He instructed authorities to provide excellent medical care to the wounded individuals and requested a detailed incident report.""Such cowardly and heinous acts of terrorism cannot dampen our resolve against terrorism,"" the PM said.

'We've worked with the Americans for years'



Kabul, Islamabad row amid rising crackdown



Forced to move after decades in Pakistan



UN says Pakistan has a tradition of protecting Afghans

A woman who we will call Fatima fled Afghanistan with her family in December 2021. She had worked for an American non-profit organization in Kabul ­until the US pullout in the summer of 2021, when the Taliban retook control of the country.She is now based in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. And she is in trouble. Her Pakistani visa is days away from expiring, and the authorities are still processing her renewal application.""I am concerned about the renewal of my visa, and if not renewed timely authorities would arrest me and my family for illegally residing in the country,"" Fatima told DW.Police, including female officers, recently conducted a raid on a building where Fatima lives, looking for undocumented Afghan refugees. She was not in the building at the time, but her brother ended up in custody.""Later, we showed them our visa renewal application receipts and proof but police did not cooperate,"" said Fatima, who is now hiding from the authorities.In 2023, Pakistan started a massive initiative to repatriate approximately 4 million Afghans who have entered the country over the past 40 years. And while the authorities granted some leeway last year, Pakistan's government has now set a March 31 deadline to expel foreign nationals residing in the country illegally, with search operations ongoing in January and February.Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi ""have been verbally asked to leave Pakistan till 28th February,"" Umer Gillani, a legal expert and rights activist, told DW.Moniza Kakar, a lawyer working for refugees advocacy in Pakistan, said there was ""uncertainty and fear"" among the Afghani nationals in the area.""Since the start of this year, over 1,000 Afghans have been detained in Islamabad, and more than 18,000 have been forced to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi because of government orders,"" she said.Amin, 28, is from Kabul. He spent years collaborating with the United States in the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan, before he too had to flee across the Pakistani border.Hee said he was just days away from being evacuated to America, but this was put on hold last month with President Donald Trump signing an executive order to suspend a refugee resettlement program.Nearly 20,000 Afghans are presently waiting in Pakistan for approval to resettle in the US through an American government program.""We've worked with the Americans for years, we helped and supported them in Afghanistan, we have given them a part of our lives and they have to support us so that we can live peacefully,"" Amin told DW.Over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with neighboring Afghanistan has deteriorated. Islamabad holds the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan responsible for their inability to control the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions with the Taliban regime escalate, concerns were also raised about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan amid reports of purported intimidation and arrests. The UN special rapporteur has expressed his worries, stating that Afghans in the area deserve more humane treatment.Activist Gilani said millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan are being used as ""hostages to build pressure whenever there is tension between the two countries.""Last week, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry dismissed claims made by the Afghan representation regarding the mistreatment of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, labeling these allegations as ""misplaced"" and urging Kabul to facilitate the smooth repatriation of Afghan citizens.Pakistan has accommodated hundreds of thousands of refugees from its northern neighbor, a situation resulting from decades of regional instability. Afghans who arrived in Pakistan following the Taliban takeover in August 2021 have been relying on visa renewals to stay in the country, a procedure that is costly, uncertain and often subject to significant delays.""The stories of refugees are devastating. Families who have lived in Pakistan for years, even decades, are now being uprooted due to tensions between the two countries. Children, women, and men who have already suffered so much are being treated as if they don't matter.

New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter following a prolonged MAGA meltdown over use of American taxpayer money to facilitate immigration to the US.Under pressure from the federal government and MAGA hardliners, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who gravitated to the Trump orbit after facing corruption charges from the Biden administration, announced closure of the site that is said to have housed tens of thousands of migrants in its 1025 rooms at $ 200 a night.The site opened in May 2023 to serve as both a new arrivals center and shelter for asylum seekers under a three-year $ 220 million deal with government-run Pakistan International Airlines, which owns the hotel, having bought out a Saudi stake in it for $ 36.4million in 2005.At peak traffic in 2023 when around 4000 migrants were arriving in the city each week, the sight of asylum seekers camping outside the hotel waiting to be processed triggered MAGA hardliners and even some New Yorkers, as Trump and his supporters complained about Democrats housing ""illegal immigrants"" in ""luxury hotels"" at the expense of US taxpayers.""A taxpayer-funded hotel for illegal migrants is owned by the Pakistani government, which means NYC taxpayers are effectively paying a foreign government to house illegals in our own country.

IMF to begin discussions on Pakistan's request for climate resilience loan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-to-begin-discussions-on-pakistans-request-for-climate-resilience-loan/articleshow/118528621.cms,"A technical mission from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will begin discussions on Monday on Pakistan's request for a loan on climate resilience, a media report said. This will be followed by a policy review early next week to assess the authorities' performance under the ongoing USD 7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF), Dawn News reported.Pakistan had requested USD 1 billion to address the impact of climate change. The technical team will mainly engage with key ministries, including planning, finance, climate change, petroleum, water resources, the Federal Board of Revenue, disaster management agencies, and provincial governments.Without going into specifics, the IMF resident representative in Islamabad, Mahir Binici, confirmed the engagements spanning over three weeks from now.""An IMF staff team is scheduled to visit Pakistan in early to mid-March for discussions around the first review under Pakistan's Extended Fund Facility-supported programme and the authorities' request for assistance under a Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) arrangement. In this regard, a technical team will be in Pakistan starting in late February to discuss technical issues related to a possible RSF arrangement,"" he said.Official sources said the relevant authorities, particularly the ministries of planning and finance, had prepared documentation for the Climate-Related Public Investment Management Assessment (C-PIMA) for coming budgets in line with policy advice of the IMF and the World Bank.Talking about the first biannual review of the 39-month EFF, the sources said Pakistan had completed all but one structural benchmark as of now. However, Pakistan missed several indicative targets given the changing domestic and international macroeconomic conditions.The only outstanding benchmark pertains to the required amendments to the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) by the end of December. However, other sub-conditions of these entities regarding governance structure and financial safeguards have already been met.The funding under RSF is made available to nations who commit high-quality reforms to build resilience against climate catastrophes through adaptation and is repayable over 30 years, including a 10-year grace period and is normally cheaper than EFF terms.In October last year, Pakistan formally requested the IMF to top up its USD 7 billion EFF with another USD 1.2 billion RSF.The Fund had already advised Pakistan to invest 1 per cent of GDP per year (over Rs 1.24 trillion at the current year's estimate) in climate resilience and adaptation reforms to be ready to fight repeated and increasing cycles of extreme weather conditions, particularly floods and sustain economic growth and reverse inequalities.Such an investment in climate-adaptive infrastructure can reduce the negative growth impact of a natural disaster shock by one-third while ensuring a quicker and more complete recovery, the IMF suggested.The IMF noted that about 1 per cent of GDP investment in adaptation infrastructure would increase Pakistan's climate resilience and buffer climate shocks.These investments would reduce the growth impact of a natural disaster shock by about a third and return Pakistan to its previous GDP level more quickly.According to the IMF, Pakistan's living standards have been declining for decades, and despite a similar starting point in the early 1980s, Pakistanis' incomes had stagnated and fallen behind regional peers.At the same time, poverty rates remained elevated, and social development indicators also lagged behind those of peers.This had been accompanied by weak human capital outcomes, low fiscal capacity, protection for favoured industries, and a large state footprint. Contributions to growth from human capital and efficiency gains were low, and health and education indicators, while improving in recent years, still lag behind regional and lower-middle-income peers. Human capital spending as a share of GDP has steadily declined.The consequences of these structural weaknesses have been exacerbated by increasingly high climate vulnerability.""Pakistan's climate faces a rate of warming significantly higher than the global average. This will bring increasingly greater climate variability and extreme events, including reduced water availability, more severe and longer droughts, accelerated glacial melt, more variable and intense monsoons accompanied by floods and landslides, and sea-level rise encroaching on coastal settlements and infrastructure,"" it said.The negative macroeconomic consequences of such a shift have already been felt. Climate and weather-related disasters, which have increasingly been exacerbated by climate change, resulted in USD 29.3 billion in economic losses over 1992-2021, equivalent to 11.1 per cent of 2020 GDP, which slowed developmental gains.More recently, the floods of 2022 killed 1,700 people, displaced eight million, increased the poverty rate by up to four percentage points, and brought economic losses equivalent to 4.8 per cent of FY22 GDP, with reconstruction needs estimated at 1.6 times the budgeted national development expenditure of FY23.The disaster was exacerbated by Pakistan's weak urban planning, infrastructure and water resource management, according to Dawn.","Pakistan had requested USD 1 billion to address the impact of climate change.

With no passengers and no planes, Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport is a bit of a mystery. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million, it's anyone's guess when New Gwadar International Airport will open for business. Located in the coastal city of Gwadar and completed in Oct 2024, its a stark contrast to the impoverished, restive southwestern Balochistan province around it.For the past decade, China has poured money into Balochistan and Gwadar as part of a multibillion dollar project that connects its western Xinjiang province with Arabian Sea, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC.Authorities have hailed it as transformational but there's scant evidence of change in Gwadar. The city isn't connected to the national grid - electricity comes from Iran or solar panels - and there isn't enough clean water. An airport with a 400,000 passenger capacity isn't a priority for the city's 90,000 people.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" said Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert who specialises in Pakistan-China ties. ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""CPEC has catalysed a decadeslong insurgency in resource-rich and strategically located Balochistan. Separatists, aggrieved by what they say is state exploitation at the expense of locals, are fighting for independence - targeting Pakistani troops and Chinese workers in the province and elsewhere. Members of Pakistan's ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination by govt and are denied opportunities available elsewhere in the country, charges govt denies.Pakistan, keen to protect China's investments, has stepped up its military footprint in Gwadar to combat dissent. The city is a jumble of checkpoints, barbed wire, troops, barricades, and watchtowers. Roads close at any given time, several days a week, to permit the safe passage of Chinese workers and Pakistani VIPs.Intelligence officers monitor journalists visiting Gwadar. Its fish market is deemed too sensitive for coverage.Many locals are frazzled. ""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" said Khuda Bakhsh Hashim, 76. ""We used to enjoy all-night picnics in the mountains or rural areas. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Hashim recalled when Gwadar was part of Oman, not Pakistan, and was a stop for passenger ships heading to Mumbai. People didn't go hungry and found work easily, he said.But Gwadar's water has dried up because of drought and unchecked exploitation. So has the work. Govt says CPEC has created some 2,000 local jobs but it's not clear whom they mean by ""local"" - Baloch residents or Pakistanis from elsewhere in the country. Authorities did not elaborate.There is a perception Gwadar is dangerous or difficult to visit - only one commercial route operates out of its domestic airport, three times a week to Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. There are no direct flights to Balochistan's provincial capital of Quetta, or national capital of Islamabad.Security concerns delayed the inauguration of the international airport. There were fears the area's mountains - and their proximity to the airport - could be the ideal launchpad for an attack. Instead, PM Shehbaz Sharif and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang hosted a virtual ceremony. The inaugural flight was off limits to media and public.","Gwadar is Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million.

ISLAMABAD: A mob enraged by a local’s murder over a trivial parking dispute snatched the suspect, a watchman, from police and lynched him in the mountainous Galiyat region of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday.

Many people have been lynched for alleged blasphemy, while mobs have also murdered suspects in street crimes.In June 2024, a suspected robber was lynched by a mob in the southern port city of Karachi. The suspect, armed with a pistol, had attempted to rob a citizen, who put up resistance and was joined by others standing nearby. The mob got hold of the suspect and hit him with blunt weapons, resulting in his death on the spot.In May 2024, another mob lynched a suspected robber in Karachi's Orangi town while police saved his accomplice from being killed.The same month, police rescued a Christian man from angry people, who wanted to lynch him and attacked the homes of other minority members in Punjab’s Sargodha district on charges of alleged blasphemy.

Airport inauguration delayed due to security concerns



Pakistan’s newest airport in Gwadar, fully funded by China at a cost of $240 million, remains unused months after its completion in October 2024.Spread over 4,300 acres of land. the airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year. Work started on Gwadar airport in 2019.The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) PK 503 aircraft was the first commercial flight to arrive at the new airport after its inauguration carrying commercial passengers and high-ranking officials.However, the airport, designed to handle 400,000 passengers annually, has no scheduled flights.The New Gwadar International Airport is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), a multi-billion dollar project aimed at linking China’s Xinjiang province with the Arabian Sea. While officials have called it a major development, many in Gwadar say they see little benefit.Gwadar, located in Pakistan's Balochistan province , lacks basic infrastructure such as a stable electricity supply and clean water.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" Azeem Khalid, an expert in Pakistan-China relations was quoted as saying by the news agency Associated Press (AP). ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""The airport’s construction comes amid ongoing security challenges in Balochistan. Separatist groups in the province oppose what they call exploitation of local resources, targeting both Pakistani security forces and Chinese workers.Pakistan has increased its military presence in Gwadar to protect Chinese investments, leading to more checkpoints and restrictions on movement.

""We are asked to prove our identity, who we are, where we have come from. We are residents.

There are no direct flights to Quetta, the provincial capital, or Islamabad.Militancy in Balochistan has increased in recent years, with attacks rising after 2021. Groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army have carried out multiple attacks, particularly after the Pakistani Taliban ended a ceasefire in 2022.Earlier, the airport’s opening was postponed due to security risks. Authorities feared that nearby mountains could be used to launch attacks. Instead, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held a virtual inauguration. The first flight landed without media or public presence.Abdul Ghafoor Hoth, a local leader from the Balochistan Awami Party, said no local residents were hired to work at the airport.""Not a single resident of Gwadar was hired to work at the airport, not even as a watchman,"" he was quoted by AP.Hoth had led protests in December demanding better living conditions in Gwadar.

Two police personnel and four militants were killed in an attack on a police check post in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province on Friday.The attack came two days after the separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed the killing of seven passengers, who hailed from Pakistan’s Punjab province, on a highway in the restive province.In the latest incident, police said that armed men stormed a police check post in Shaban area, some 35 km from the provincial capital Quetta, early on Friday morning, “killing two policemen and injuring two others”, local police station in-charge Munir Khan said.“The police force retaliated and killed four attackers,” Khan said, adding, “Search and clearance operations continued in the area as some terrorists fled to the nearby mountains.”Pakistan has been struggling to quell separatist attacks in Balochistan, which shares a porous border with Iran and Afghanistan.According to official figures, around 40 attacks against police in Balochistan in 2024 killed at least 25 police officers and injured 61 others.

Meet minister in the Sheikh Hasina's government with 480+ properties globally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/meet-hasina-minister-with-480-properties-globally/articleshow/118655162.cms,"Saifuzzaman Chowdhury (File photo from Facebook)

Assets scattered all over

Loyal family

Cronies and gifts

Others under scrutiny, too

Months after the ouster of Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina , the interim govt in charge of the country has made her extradition from India a top priority. But her return isn't the only concern; Dhaka is also looking to recover what it says is billions of dollars that the ousted leader's associates siphoned out of the country during the time she was in office.In a report on Feb 28, Financial Times of London focused on acquisitions of one such individual, former Bangladesh land minister Saifuzzaman Chowdhury , saying it amounted to an ""extraordinary real estate empire built up, for the most part, while he served as an MP in the govt of Sheikh Hasina"".FT has identified 482 properties acquired by Chowdury or his close family at a cost of at least $295mn between 1992 and 2024, making him one of the top targets of anti-corruption investigations launched under Nobel Peace laureate Mohd Yunus , the head of the interim govt. The period it is interested in spans the 15 years from 2009 to 2024, when Sheikh Hasina enjoyed an uninterrupted run as Bangladesh PM in her second stint in office.The locations of Chowdhury's properties stretch from Dubai's Burj Khalifa district and the artificial Palm Jumeirah archipelago to flats in London's commuter towns. The surge in Chowdhury's property acquisitions came after he was appointed land minister in 2019, FT said.Before he became Sheikh Hasina's land minister, Chowdhury served as an MP of her party for over five years. In 2023, he declared to Bangladesh parliament assets worth $2.3mn. His last declared income tax return, for 2017, states he had no foreign income at all. FT says other Bangladeshi elites being targeted by the interim govt are estimated to have acquired property worth $578mn in countries ranging from Singapore to Canada.Chowdhury's father Akhtaruzzaman was an Awami League politician and ""close confidant"" of Sheikh Hasina, FT said. He was a member of the founding board of directors of United Commercial Bank, established in 1983. Akhtaruzzaman was accused of being involved in cases of violence related to UCB - including the murder of its founding chairman in 1993 - that FT said the ""interim govt sees as precedent for the forcible takeover of other banks in the final years of Sheikh Hasina's rule"".A report commissioned by Mohd Yunus claimed that Bangladesh lost ""$16bn annually to money laundering under Sheikh Hasina's rule from 2009 to 2024"".FT quoted Yale professor Mushfiq Mobarak as saying that politicians associated with Sheikh Hasina misused the govt to forcibly allow their cronies to take control of large commercial banks and then siphon off ""billions of dollars through 'loans' that would never be repaid"".These cronies obliged the politicians with gifts of real estate abroad.Dhaka has engaged international consultant majors Deloitte, EY and KPMG to perform an asset quality review of Bangladesh's banks and set up joint investigative teams to ""trace the assets of 10 leading families, as well as Sheikh Hasina's"". While the interim govt hasn't specifically named anybody, FT said Bashundhara Group chairman Ahmed Akbar Sobhan and S Alam Group chairman Saiful Alam are among those who have been mentioned by govt officials.FT also quoted Yunus as saying there is ""significant money"" in Canada and that Bangladeshi elites have also bought assets in Dubai, from where it will be tough to make any recovery.","Saifuzzaman Chowdhury is one of the top targets of anti-corruption investigations.

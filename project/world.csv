Professional pathways including training and qualification programs aligned with Saudi scholarship and vocational tracks like Khadem Al-Haramein Scholarship and Wa’ed, supporting future game designers and developers.

What comes next in Saudi Arabia’s gaming curriculum: Implementation and expansion



Saudi Arabia Rewrites School Rules: Electronic Gaming Is Now Officially ‘Educational’ as KSA Taps Into Global Trend





In a bold and unprecedented move, Saudi Arabia ’s Ministry of Education has officially approved the inclusion of electronic gaming, both competitive and educational aspects, in school curricula across all education levels. This landmark initiative aims to bridge traditional education with 21st-century digital skills, creativity and the rapidly growing gaming industry, reflecting a global shift toward recognising video games as valuable tools for learning and future careers.The decision comes after three strategic memorandums of understanding were signed between the Ministry of Education, the National Institute for Educational Development and the Educational Services Development Company with Savvy Games Group, a state-owned gaming enterprise under the Public Investment Fund. These agreements formalise the integration of electronic games into curricula, development of national gaming competitions and training pathways to build local talent within the gaming sector.Coverage from Al-Marsad newspaper reports that the collaboration will include working with the National Curriculum Center to embed game-related skills and knowledge in school content, alongside initiatives to upskill educators, create educational games and support nationwide innovation challenges tied to the gaming industry.This is one of the most significant educational policy shifts in the Middle East in recent years, not just because games are fun but because they can teach transferable and future-oriented skills. According to international research and global education commentary, competitive video gaming and esports programs in schools can nurture collaboration, strategic thinking, problem-solving, communication and leadership, all skills employers increasingly value.For example, schools in Wales and the US that implemented esports suites and gaming programs noted positive impacts on student engagement, teamwork and pathways into tech-related careers. Just as structured arts or sports programs can support growth, gaming education, when well designed, can be both academic and practical.Saudi Arabia’s move aligns with global experimentation around gaming as an educational tool. In Japan, certain schools have incorporated video games into classroom learning to help students build critical thinking and communication skills, with high participation and positive university progression rates among graduates.Likewise, academic discussion including research into game-based learning curricula such as Quest To Learn in the US, has highlighted how games can reinforce systems thinking and engagement, supporting traditional subjects like math, science and language through interactive design and strategic challenges. Saudi officials are positioning the gaming curriculum initiative as part of a larger push toward digital transformation, innovation and job creation in future industries.The Kingdom’s gaming sector already demonstrates strength, with millions of players and billions in annual revenue, signalling robust interest and economic potential. By formalising gaming education, authorities aim to prepare students for careers across game development, design, esports management, digital media, cybersecurity and related tech sectors. These are the fields that are poised for growth alongside Saudi Arabia’s broader economic diversification goals.While official details on the exact curriculum framework are still emerging, the memorandums outline several key components:The initiative is also expected to include the establishment of gaming labs and innovation hubs within technical and vocational institutions, geared toward hands-on experience and industry projects. Global education voices, including contributors to research platforms and the World Economic Forum , have explored how esports and gaming curricula can teach teamwork, leadership, problem solving and communication skills, especially when embedded within supportive academic structures.These programs often serve dual purposes: they enhance student engagement (particularly among learners who struggle with traditional teaching methods) and they create career pathways in technology, digital arts, programming and business.Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Education is now in the roll-out phase, working with curriculum developers, industry partners and training institutions to finalise content, teacher preparation and infrastructure. The early emphasis will likely be on pilot programs, teacher upskilling and integration phases to ensure the curriculum complements, rather than replaces, existing subject goals.Over time, the success of this gaming integration could attract attention from other countries in the region exploring innovative education models that respond to a rapidly evolving labour market and the rise of digital economies globally. With the official inclusion of electronic gaming in Saudi school curricula, the Kingdom is at the forefront of a global shift toward embracing games as tools for learning, creativity and future career readiness.While challenges remain, including ensuring balanced screen time and aligning gaming with core academic standards, the initiative signals a bold rethinking of how education can evolve to reflect the digital aspirations of a new generation of learners.","Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Education has officially approved the inclusion of electronic gaming, both competitive and educational aspects, in school curricula across all education levels.

Candace Drops 'SECRET' TPUSA Tape: Erika Kirk Heard Laughing Days After Charlie Kirk’s Killing





Megyn Kelly is facing heavy backlash after saying she would not condemn Candace Owens, even as Owens shared controversial claims online involving Charlie Kirk . Negyn Kelly made her position clear during a recent appearance on Piers Morgan Uncensored. She said people tried to pressure her into publicly attacking Owens, but she refused. Kelly argued that the demand was political, not moral, and said she would not speak just to satisfy critics.During the interview, Piers Morgan directly asked Megyn Kelly why she would not condemn Candace Owens for the claims she shared online. Megyn Kelly said the pressure started earlier, during the Gaza war, when Owens strongly criticized Israel.Megyn Kelly explained that people began labeling Owens as unacceptable because of her views. According to Kelly, after online claims involving Charlie Kirk appeared, that pressure only grew stronger.She said,“Candace took a lot of criticism because she was very anti-Israel during the Gaza war. Then it became a situation where everyone demanded that I publicly condemn her.”Megyn Kelly added that critics pushed even harder when Candace Owens began questioning Israel’s influence on U.S.politics. She said those were topics she had personally discussed with Charlie Kirk many times in the past.Kelly made her position very clear when she said,“I refused. I would rather die than bend the knee. It will not happen.”She also said she and Candace Owens have disagreed publicly many times over the years. According to Kelly, their relationship has never been simple, and refusing to condemn someone does not mean agreeing with everything they say.Later, Megyn Kelly addressed critics again after backlash grew online. She said people were forgetting that real humans were involved and that public pressure should not control personal speech.According to HuffPost, Kelly was expected to help arrange a meeting between Candace Owens and Erika Kirk, but that meeting did not happen publicly. Candace Owens and Erika Kirk later met privately instead.Megyn Kelly ended by repeating that she will not speak on command and believes that choosing when to speak freely is part of being American.","Megyn Kelly is facing heavy backlash after saying she would not condemn Candace Owens.

Twitch’s new pause-screen ads draw criticism from viewers and streamers





Twitch is introducing a new kind of advertisement that will appear when the stream is paused. Advertising was one of the main ways for streamers to earn money on Twitch, though it sometimes resulted in a loss for the viewers who missed important parts of the stream. Viewers who want to avoid these interruptions can sign up for Twitch Prime or Turbo; however, not all may afford these services. There have already been complaints over the new kind of advertisement from both the viewers and the streamers themselves who claim that this may adversely affect the streaming service.The new ads will show up whenever someone pauses a stream, even if they step away from the screen. Twitch announced this update on February 10, 2026, saying it is part of an experiment calledThe company also noted that skippable ads are still being tested at the same time. While the goal is to make ads less intrusive, many users have expressed frustration, saying ads while paused could cause viewers to fall behind the live stream or disrupt their viewing habits.Many people have expressed their concerns about the new change through various social media posts. There was even criticism that people may become irritated since pausing a video might be used for quick look-up of information, and the ads might interfere with the pause.Hence, people may stop using the site. The prominent Twitch streamers have also expressed their own concerns that the new ads may interfere with the viewing experience and be detrimental to the streamers.Although there is a backlash, the platform asserts that the test is intended to generate additional earnings for the streamer without totally disrupting the stream. It is said that the ads will only be shown while the stream is paused, thus the streaming will still be conducted at the back of the screen.Ultimately, the new ads that will appear while the viewer has their Twitch video paused serve as a prime example of the constantly ongoing issue of finding the right balance in the name of generating more income without making the user experience suffer as a result. While the streamer derives the intended benefits from such a feature, the viewer base nonetheless has legitimate issues with the overall experience.","The new ads will show up whenever someone pauses a stream, even if they step away from the screen.

The National Governors Association cancelled a meeting with US President Donald Trump later this month after the White House excluded Democratic governors, chairman Kevin Stitt told members on Monday, according to Reuters citing a source.Governors from across the US gather every year in Washington for the NGA meeting. It is tradition for the President to host the governors at the White House for a session with Cabinet secretaries, among other officials, and a black-tie dinner for the governors and their spouses.The White House meeting, which was scheduled for February 20, was slated to be part of the association's annual winter gathering. The association's leadership is made up of nine members, including Republican Stitt and Democratic Maryland Governor Wes Moore, who serves as vice chairman.""To disinvite individual governors to the White House sessions undermines an important opportunity for federal-state collaboration,"" Brandon Tatum, CEO of the bipartisan association representing US governors, said in a statement. ""At this moment in our nation’s history, it is critical that institutions continue to stand for unity, dignity and constructive engagement.""The New York Times reported last week that Trump still planned to hold a separate, bipartisan dinner for governors and their spouses at the White House.However, according to the newspaper, Trump personally blocked invites for Moore and Democratic Colorado Governor Jared Polis, who is also a member of the association.""The National Governors Association has a long tradition of bipartisan gatherings to trade best practices and ideas, regardless of party affiliation. It's what Americans expect and deserve and unfortunately, the White House does not seem to feel the same,"" said David Turner, a spokesperson for Moore.","The National Governors Association cancelled a meeting with US President Donald Trump later this month after the White House excluded Democratic governors.

After nearly a month on the picket lines, nurses at two of New York City’s largest hospital systems, Montefiore and Mount Sinai, have reached tentative agreements with management, potentially ending one of the city’s biggest nurse strikes in decades.The walkout, which began on January 12, involved roughly 15,000 nurses demanding safer staffing, better pay, and stronger workplace protections.The three-year agreements now await ratification by nurses at Montefiore, Mount Sinai Hospital, and Mount Sinai Morningside and West. If approved, nurses could return to work as early as Saturday.About 10,500 nurses are covered under the new contracts. NewYork-Presbyterian remains the only major hospital system still in negotiations.According to the New York State Nurses Association, the tentative agreements include:“For four weeks, nearly 15,000 NYSNA members held the line in the cold and snow for safe patient care,” said NYSNA President Nancy Hagans. “Now nurses are heading back to the bedside with their heads held high after winning fair contracts.”Hospital officials said patient care largely continued during the strike, with some elective surgeries postponed and temporary nurses filling in.They also noted that nurses’ average salaries range from $162,000–$165,000, while executives earn multimillion-dollar salaries.The walkout drew attention from New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani and Senator Bernie Sanders, who joined nurses on picket lines. Sanders criticised “greed in the healthcare industry,” while Mamdani emphasised the importance of supporting frontline workers in a city they can live and work in.With contract votes set to begin, the focus now shifts to nurses’ approval. If ratified, the agreements will end a strike that has brought national attention to staffing shortages and workplace safety in American hospitals.","The three-year agreements now await ratification by nurses at Montefiore, Mount Sinai Hospital, and Mount Sinai Morningside and West.

An Iranian man who recorded a video appeal to US President Donald Trump has taken his own life after urging him not to strike any deal with Iran’s current ruling establishment.Iranian media and activists identified the man as Pouria Hamidi, who was from the southern port city of Bushehr. In a video lasting around 10 minutes and recorded in English, Hamidi said he wanted to bring attention to a violent crackdown on protests in Iran.“If you’re watching this, then I’m not around anymore,” he said at the start of the recording. He claimed the video was meant to make people realise the massacre carried out by Iranian authorities during recent unrest.“More than 40,000 people died, killed, massacred. More than Russia and Ukraine war and more than Israel and Palestine,” Hamidi claimed, without providing evidence for the numbers, reports the Iran Insight.Addressing US leaders directly, he warned against negotiations with Tehran, saying any agreement would “betray all those people who died”.“So please,” he said, “I beg you, do whatever you can to stop this deal.”Hamidi also called for foreign intervention, saying diplomacy had failed. “America attacking the Iran is the only hope we have right now,” he said, adding, “We can't fight this regime alone. Our people need foreign intervention.”The video included criticism of Iran’s religious leadership and expressions of support for exiled Prince Reza Pahlavi. Hamidi said his message was an attempt to give meaning to his life and urged Iranians to support one another.At the end of the recording, he switched to Persian, saying: “We people of Iran are lonely people and have nobody, so please support each other. Long live Iran.”His death comes amid heightened tensions over Iran and the possibility of renewed negotiations with Tehran. Israel, in particular, has voiced concern over any deal that would preserve Iran’s ruling system.According to a report by Israel Hayom, Israeli officials fear that an agreement could leave the ayatollah regime in place, unlock frozen funds and fail to dismantle Iran’s nuclear and missile programmes. The report said Israel remains on high alert, viewing such a deal as potentially worse than a military confrontation.Israeli officials are expected to increase diplomatic and intelligence efforts to persuade Trump that there is a “historic window of opportunity” to curb Iran’s threat. These efforts are also expected to shape Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s planned meeting with Trump in Washington later this week.","Iranian media and activists identified the man as Pouria Hamidi, who was from the southern port city of Bushehr.

Residents also pay AED 50 per day after a 30-day grace period, which applies following visa cancellation.

Additional administrative and service fees such as exit and e-service charges may also apply when finalising overstay penalties.

Unlike in years past, most tourist and visit visas no longer include a grace period after expiry and fines begin accruing immediately once the visa period lapses.

no longer include a grace period after expiry and fines begin accruing immediately once the visa period lapses. For residents whose visas have been formally cancelled (e.g., due to job changes), the UAE provides a 30-day grace period before fines begin, during which the holder must either exit the country or adjust their status.

Consequences of unpaid fines in the UAE



Travel bans that prevent departure until fines are paid.

Blocked future visa applications until outstanding penalties are cleared.

Accumulating daily charges that significantly raise the total cost the longer the overstay continues.

Where and how to pay overstay fines



Online via the Immigration Authority Portals – The Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) website lets visitors and residents view and pay fines directly with a credit/debit card.

The Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) website lets visitors and residents view and pay fines directly with a credit/debit card.

Apply for extensions or visa status adjustments before expiry if you plan to stay longer.

If status changes occur (e.g., job shifts for residents), ensure cancellation or renewal processes are initiated timely.





As millions of travellers and expatriates continue to live, work and visit the UAE, authorities have standardised visa overstay penalties and streamlined payment options, making compliance clearer but also more urgent than ever. Under the latest immigration framework, overstaying your visa in the UAE now carries a unified daily fine across most visa types, with simple online and in-person payment options for residents and visitors alike.If you stay in the UAE beyond the validity of your visa, you are likely to face fines. In recent years, UAE immigration authorities have standardised the penalty system and made it easier to check and pay overstay fines online or in person. Here’s what you need to know to stay compliant and avoid extra costs.Recent regulatory updates have consolidated the overstay penalty system where visitors, tourists and residents who remain beyond their permitted stay now face a daily fine of AED 50 ($13.6) per day. This flat rate applies regardless of visa category and replaces older systems that once charged different amounts for different visa types. In other words, this unified rate replaces older systems where resident overstays sometimes carried different charges, making the fines easier to calculate.Under the standardised structure:Extended overstays can lead to more than just daily charges. In some cases authorities may impose exit bans, preventing travellers from leaving the country until penalties are cleared. Failure to settle fines can also complicate future UAE visa applications and travel plans.Failing to settle overstay fines can lead to additional issues, including:Further, immigration law enforcement may escalate legal action against repeat or prolonged violators, including possible deportation or temporary travel restrictions, depending on individual circumstances.UAE authorities have made it relatively easy to check and settle overstay fines through multiple official channels:Authorities advise ensuring all accumulated fines are paid before attempting to exit the UAE, as unresolved penalties may block departure until they are cleared.To sidestep fines altogether:Understanding the current overstay fine system is vital for anyone living in or visiting the UAE. With penalties now uniform and payment methods widely accessible, staying compliant is not just a legal obligation; it can also save visitors and expats significant costs and complications at the airport or immigration checkpoints.Visa overstay fines in the UAE, currently AED 50 per day for most visa types, can add up quickly, especially if there is no grace period for your visa category. The authorities now provide online tools to check and pay fines, making it easier to comply and avoid travel bans or blocks on future visas.

A 2024 study published on arXiv , analysing millions of job listings, found that AI adoption increases demand not just for AI engineers but for AI-literate professionals across non-technical roles as well. The paper noted, “AI exposure is associated with higher demand for complementary skills such as analytical thinking, adaptability and collaboration.”In the GCC, AI skills are increasingly required in finance, healthcare, government services, logistics and media, not just tech firms.Data has become the backbone of decision-making in Gulf organisations. A landmark 2017 Strategy and PwC report on the GCC digital workforce found that while digital adoption is growing, advanced data skills remain scarce, limiting productivity gains.The report stated, “The shortage of advanced analytics and data science skills is one of the biggest barriers preventing GCC organisations from capturing full value from digital investments.” As governments and enterprises push for smart cities, fintech ecosystems and AI-powered public services, professionals skilled in data analysis, business intelligence and statistical modelling are becoming indispensable.With rapid digitisation comes increased cyber risk. While GCC-specific academic studies are limited, global labour research consistently ranks cybersecurity among the fastest-growing skills worldwide, a trend echoed in GCC hiring data.According to hiring outlooks cited by Khaleej Times and regional recruitment firms, cybersecurity specialists remain in high demand as governments and private firms strengthen digital infrastructureThese skills are especially relevant in banking, government, aviation and healthcare sectors across the GCC.Cloud expertise is now a foundational requirement rather than a niche skill. As per global hiring outlook reports AI, cloud and platform engineering roles dominate new job creation in global capability centres expanding operations linked to GCC markets.Cloud architects, DevOps engineers and platform specialists are especially valuable as Gulf companies migrate operations to scalable digital ecosystems.Despite the digital pivot, engineering and project management remain pillars of GCC employment, driven by infrastructure, energy and urban development megaprojects. According to regional hiring analyses cited by Khaleej Times, demand continues for professionals who can manage large-scale, multi-stakeholder projects, particularly those integrating digital and sustainability elementsProject managers with technical literacy, risk management skills and cross-cultural leadership ability are especially prized.Sustainability is no longer optional in the GCC. With the UAE and Saudi Arabia investing heavily in renewable energy, clean technology and climate initiatives, green skills are moving into the mainstream.A recent 2025 workforce analysis by PeopleConnect Global highlights rising demand for professionals skilled in sustainability reporting, renewable energy systems and environmental compliance across GCC markets.Roles linked to net-zero strategies, ESG compliance and sustainable infrastructure are expected to grow steadily through 2026.Multiple studies stress that human skills grow more valuable as automation increases. The same arXiv 2024 study on AI and labour markets found that AI-exposed roles show higher demand for teamwork, communication and resilience, not less.In the GCC, where teams are highly multicultural, employers increasingly value professionals who can lead diverse teams, communicate clearly and adapt to fast-changing environments.The 2027 Strategy& GCC digital workforce report emphasises that long-term employability depends not on one-time qualifications but on continuous upskilling. The report noted that economies that embed lifelong learning frameworks will be better positioned to meet future labour demands.This message is echoed in national workforce strategies across the Gulf.Understanding Emiratisation, Saudisation and national talent development policies is increasingly important. The Hays GCC Salary Guide 2026 highlights that localisation efforts are reshaping hiring strategies, particularly in leadership and specialist roles. Professionals who align their skills with these frameworks gain a competitive edge.Research across academia, recruitment and policy consistently point to one conclusion that GCC jobs in 2026 will reward hybrid professionals or those who combine digital fluency, analytical capability, adaptability and human-centric skills. From AI literacy to sustainability expertise, the most future-proof careers will belong to individuals who learn continuously, adapt quickly and align with the region’s transformation goals.","Hiring priorities across the Gulf are increasingly shaped by technology adoption, sustainability goals and workforce localisation policies.

Buckingham Palace has pledged to “stand ready to support” UK police if approached over allegations concerning King Charles III’s brother, former Prince Andrew.The King has expressed “profound concern” over claims that Andrew shared confidential reports from his role as the UK’s trade envoy with convicted sex offender and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Thames Valley Police confirmed it is assessing suggestions that Andrew disclosed sensitive information to Epstein, according to the Independent.A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “The King has made clear, in words and through unprecedented actions, his profound concern at allegations which continue to come to light in respect of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s conduct. While the specific claims in question are for Mr Mountbatten-Windsor to address, if we are approached by Thames Valley Police we stand ready to support them as you would expect. As was previously stated, Their Majesties’ thoughts and sympathies have been, and remain with, the victims of any and all forms of abuse. ”The Palace has not yet been contacted by police regarding the claims, which relate to Andrew’s time as the UK’s special representative for international trade and investment. The allegations follow a US Department of Justice (DOJ) release of millions of documents linked to Epstein.The Prince and Princess of Wales addressed the scandal publicly for the first time, with Kensington Palace saying they were “deeply concerned” at the “continued revelations” and that their thoughts “remain focused on the victims.”Moreover, Andrew was stripped of his royal titles last year and has denied any wrongdoing. Last week, he moved from Royal Lodge to the King’s private Sandringham estate, with Charles personally funding his new residence through an annual stipend.The new allegations suggest Andrew shared confidential reports with Epstein, including briefings on visits to Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore. Emails show Andrew forwarded one report just five minutes after receiving it from his adviser, and another on Christmas Eve 2010 included details of investment opportunities in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province.The revelations have resulted in public criticism. Former BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said the King should make Andrew testify before the US Congress and back laws to remove him from the line of succession. He warned that if the King does not act, the monarchy could be seen as failing Epstein’s victims.The Epstein scandal has haunted the royal family in recent weeks, despite King Charles’s previous steps to end Andrew’s public life. Anti-monarchy campaigners were the ones who reported the allegations to the police in the first place.","Buckingham Palace has pledged to “stand ready to support” UK police if approached over allegations concerning King Charles III’s brother, former Prince Andrew.

‘Political Signage’: Kash Patel FIRES FBI Employee For Displaying Pride Flag On Office Desk





Donald Trump’s administration has removed a large rainbow Pride flag that had been flying over the Stonewall National Monument in New York City. The landmark is widely recognised as the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement.The flag’s removal came weeks after the Department of the Interior issued federal guidance on displaying “nonagency” flags in the National Park System, which includes a small park in front of the Stonewall Inn, the bar for which the federal monument is named.Some elected officials in New York said the removal of the flag from the Greenwich Village monument in downtown Manhattan was part of efforts by Trump, a Republican, to curb the rights of gay and transgender people.More than 100 people gathered outside the Stonewall Inn late Tuesday afternoon to protest the flag's removal.Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a Democrat, said he was outraged and described the move as an “act of erasure.”""New York is the birthplace of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement, and no act of erasure will ever change, or silence, that history,"" Mamdani said through a post on X.Several officials said they plan to raise another Pride flag on the now bare flagpole before the end of the week, as cited by Reuters.The flagpole and monument stand in Christopher Park, the site where gay, lesbian, and transgender New Yorkers protested after a late-night police raid on the Stonewall Inn in 1969, at a time when raids on gay bars were routine. The Stonewall uprising is widely seen as a turning point in the gay rights movement.""To have somebody take down something that is so meaningful to us and to our community outside a historic site like that is basically a slap in the face,"" Jade Runk, 37, a trans community organiser was quoted as saying by AFP.""It's a message saying 'we don't want you to exist',"" Runk added.Trump and other Republican politicians have sought to curtail LGBT rights, particularly those of transgender people.While criticising transgender people, the US president has used the term ""gender ideology extremism"" during his campaign. Days after returning to the office, he signed an executive order declaring only two official genders in the United States, male and female.A month later, the National Park Service removed references to transgender and queer people from the Stonewall National Monument website, with other government departments implementing similar changes.Trump has directed federal agencies to adopt a policy recognising two immutable sexes, and every mention of “LGBT” on the Stonewall monument’s official website has been replaced with “LGB”.",The flag had been flying over the Stonewall National Monument in New York City.

Did JD Vance hint at 2028 run? VP jokes about Usha as ‘Vice President’ in Azerbaijan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-jd-vance-hint-at-2028-run-vp-jokes-about-usha-as-vice-president-in-azerbaijan/articleshow/128179863.cms,"During his diplomatic visit to Azerbaijan, US Vice President JD Vance captured attention when he praised his wife, Usha Vance, likely taking a cue from the charisma of Azerbaijan's First Lady Mehriban Aliyeva.

JD Vance and Wife Usha Booed on Global Stage as Milan Olympics Turn Hostile





US Vice President JD Vance seemingly hinted at his 2028 Presidency while delivering a press statement with Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev on February 10, 2026. The 41-year-old quipped about Usha Vance ""getting ideas"" to become Vice President during his term, akin to Aliyev's wife, Mehriban Aliyeva.Vance who is married to Indian-origin attorney Usha Vance arrived in Azerbaijan on Tuesday from Armenia. He is travelling with his wife and three kids on a regional trip aimed at formalising a US-brokered peace process between the neighbouring countries.Thanking the Azerbaijan President for his welcoming statement Vance began by appreciating the country's support in the 'global war on terrorism'. ""I think many Americans may not know that, for example, the Azerbaijanis were some of the last to leave Afghanistan.""He announced America's collaboration to help the Eurasian country protect its territorial waters and to ensure that the peace agreement between the two countries ""sticks"". He also commended Aliyev for being the only leader in the world after Trump to have ""good relations"" with both Turks and Israelis.While ending his speech, he shared his and Usha's excitement for the upcoming dinner. Vance also pointed out that the President's wife, Mehriban Aliyeva, was the Vice-President of the country and joked about Usha getting inspiration from the same, hinting at his own presidential dreams which have been known and promoted in the US by people including Trump and Erika Kirk.""And as I understand it, the Vice-President of Azerbaijan is also the President's wife, and hopefully that doesn't give the Second Lady any ideas,"" he said to a crowd that erupted in laughter.In 2017, the Azerbaijani President created the position of Vice President in the country and signed an order appointing his wife as the First Vice-President. While America already has the position, currently occupied by Vance himself, the Republican has hinted at his wife's possible foray into politics alongside him.Ilham Aliyev initiated the event by welcoming Vance to Azerbaijan and thanking the Trump administration for its ""positive attitude"" towards the country. He went on to share that Azerbaijan has now lifted all restrictions on transit cargo to Armenia and has also started to supply oil products to the Caucasus neighbour. ""In other words, today's visit of Vice President Vance can be called historical, from the point of view of hosting our friend and guest, and from the point of view of the substance of negotiations and the Strategic Charter which has been signed. Once again, Mr. Vice President, welcome to Azerbaijan,"" he said.Vance's visit follows US President Donald Trump's mediation in 2025 for a peace agreement between the historical rivals Baku and Yerevan who have fought two wars over the region of Karabakh. Trump brokered an agreement between the countries to commit to renouncing claims on each other's territory and refrain from using force. Azerbaijan seized the region in 2023 and ended three decades of rule by Armenian separatists. Prior to coming to Azerbaijan, Vance met Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan in Yerevan. He also visited the Armenian Genocide memorial with Usha and the couple laid a wreath there. However, a post on the same was deleted later on from Vance's social media account due to online controversy.As for his Presidency, Trump endorsed Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as ""very capable"" candidates for the 2028 Presidential ticket in a recent NBC News interview. Moreover, TPUSA CEO Erika Kirk also promoted Vance's presidential candidacy at an event in December 2025, saying, ""We are going to get my husband's friend JD Vance elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible.""","US Vice President JD Vance is on a diplomatic visit to Azerbaijan with his wife, Usha Vance.

Karoline Leavitt asked about White House's 'social media problem’ after ape and genocide posts were removed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/karoline-leavitt-asked-about-white-houses-social-media-problem-after-ape-and-genocide-posts-were-removed/articleshow/128176920.cms,"Trump Breaks Silence On Obama 'Ape' Video; 'No Regrets' | Refuses Apology Despite GOP Fury | WATCH





White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was pressed on Tuesday on whether the administration is facing a “social media problem” after two controversial posts, one from President Donald Trump’s Truth Social account and another from Vice President JD Vance’s X account, were posted and then deleted within days of each other.The question followed backlash over a Truth Social post shared by Trump last Thursday evening. The video repeated baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and ended with a short clip showing former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama with their faces superimposed onto apes’ bodies. The post drew swift condemnation from lawmakers across party lines, media figures, and political commentators, who criticised it as racist.Leavitt initially defended the video, describing it as an “Internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle,” and dismissed criticism as “fake outrage.” However, shortly before noon ET on Friday, the post was removed. The White House later said the video had been shared by a still-unnamed staffer and described the post as “erroneous.”Days later, another deletion reignited scrutiny. On Tuesday, Vance’s official X account briefly posted a message that included a photo of the vice president and Second Lady Usha Vance at what was described as “a wreath laying ceremony at the Armenian Genocide memorial to honour the victims of the 1915 Armenian genocide.”The tweet was subsequently deleted.An official from Vance’s office said the post was “posted in error” by a staffer who was not travelling with the vice president’s delegation. US under the Trump administration policy, which does not use the word “genocide” for the 1915 event.As per estimates of CNN, Armenian deaths range from 300,000 to 2 million between 1914 and 1923, with most figures falling between 600,000 and 1.5 million. Ottoman authorities themselves estimated that 800,000 Armenians were killed between 1915 and 1918. Whether through mass killings or forced deportations, the Armenian population in Turkey dropped from roughly 2 million in 1914 to fewer than 400,000 by 1922.The Armenian National Committee of America sharply criticised the deletion of Vance’s post, calling it “disgraceful” and labelling it “a denialist action consistent with President Trump’s shameful retreat from honest American remembrance of a crime recognised by all 50 states, the US Congress, the White House, and more than a dozen of our NATO allies.”The issue came to a head during Tuesday’s White House briefing, when Danny Kemp, the White House correspondent for Agence France-Presse, questioned Leavitt directly.“Today, the Vice President’s account posted and then deleted a tweet about the Armenian genocide, and then last week, President Trump’s Truth Social account posted and then deleted a racist video about the Obamas,” Kemp said. “And the White House, again, blamed that on a staffer. I wanted to ask you, does the White House have a social media problem at the moment? Do you have an auto-posting problem that’s leading to these mistakes?”“No,” Leavitt replied. “As for the Armenian tweet that you’re referring to, I would just refer you back to the White House’s message that was issued on Armenian Remembrance Day, and there’s been no change of policy at this time.”","White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was pressed on Tuesday on whether the administration is facing a “social media problem” The question followed backlash over a Truth Social post shared by Trump last Thursday evening.

His new book, 'Mobilize', highlights the need to strengthen America's industrial base and reduce reliance on China, warning of potential global conflict.

Who is Shyam Sankar?

For America's future





If it wasn't for the grace of God and America, his father said he would be dead in a ditch in Lagos. For Shyam Sankar, an Indian-origin Chief Technology Officer at Palantir and Lieutenant Colonel in US Army, it is important to rearm Western democracies. And he is doing just that with the help of AI.The 43-year-old officer working at one of the most successful US data analytics firms is all set to publish his book 'Mobilize: How to Reboot The American Industrial Base and Stop World War III'. As per The Times, he described the book as a celebration of ""crazy duded"" who overcame oppressive defence procurement bureaucracy to rearm the West. “Will we look back at this moment and realise that World War III had already started, and we just didn’t know it?” he writes at the start of the book.Shyam Sankar was the 13th employee to join Palantir in 2006. Co-founded by billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel, the company helped institutions fight terrorism after 9/11. In 2026, it has grown to $4.5 billion in annual revenue and is working with militaries and enterprises to build software that helps AI-driven decision-making.Sankar was the company’s first “forward-deployed engineer”. One of the missions he was involved in had an Islamic State cell in Iraq planning to use a downed US drone to load with explosives and bring to a hospital.With the help of the company's technology, they were able to defeat the Isis cell before the drone was launched.In 2025, he furthered his vision to improve military software and strength by becoming a reservist in the US Army. Why do so much for America?Well, he inherited his love for the red, white and blue flag from his father. He was born in Mumbai and raised in Orlando, Florida. The story of his life is that of every quintessential American immigrant. His father was born in a hut in Tamil Nadu and was the first from the family to go to college.He ran a pharmaceutical factory in Nigeria but moved with his family to America after their home was attacked by armed robbers. In America, the Sankars ran souvenir and dry-cleaning businesses that later went bankrupt.But Sankar went on. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a Master's in Management Science and Engineering from Stanford University. From working as a developer initially to becoming VP of Network Management at Xoom Corporation and Chairman at Ginkgo Bioworks, he gradually succeeded in every venture he stepped into, creating a life for his family and development for his country. His father reminded him growing up that but for the grace of God and America, he would not be alive. Now, he's paying the country back by strengthening one of the most important and futuristic sectors, the military.According to Sankar, in a big conflict, the US would run out of critical munitions in a week. The country's military supply chain is 'hopelessly' dependent on China, making the process of modernisation slower.Citing the example of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and China's militarisation of the Spratly Islands in 2015, he called them similar to conflicts that formed the run-up to the Second World War. “These acts were unthinkable if we went back 15 or 25 years … I think you could say that the adversaries were not afraid of the West collectively,” he said to the outlet.He thinks we can avert a catastrophe if we act. How? Driving America's defence tech in which venture capital funding for US firms tripled to $5 billion a year, as per CB Insights.Rather than planning what weapons are required, it is important to build weapons that are responsive to threats. ""The US military stockpile scared no one,"" when attacking Ukraine, he reminded. A self-described “reindustrialisation maximalist”, he wants every American company to do all it can to reduce supply chain dependence on China and manufacture more in the country.For countries looking to ally with China, he said: “I’d say ask [US-captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás] Maduro how good of an ally China was.”What he loves about America is its ""aspiration for greatness,"" a ""propelling force"" to do more, to do better, to do something bigger. And Shyam Sankar is doing the best he can in aligning with this motto for the country he loves.","Shyam Sankar, an Indian-origin CTO at Palantir and US Army Lieutenant Colonel, is advocating for the rearmament of Western democracies.

Fishback’s controversial policy positions: H‑1B visa opposition





Republican gubernatorial hopeful James Fishback on Monday posted a video showing himself emerging from his Madison County residence holding a Ruger AR‑556 semi‑automatic rifle, after claiming an arsonist tried to burn down his home on Sunday.In the clip shared on X, Fishback, flanked by supporters, walks out of his front door armed with the rifle. “If anyone attacks our staff or volunteers, we will not wait for the police. We will shoot you dead,” the candidate wrote alongside the video.Fishback told local media that he returned to his property on Pinckney Street to discover a fire burning in his side yard, which he believes was intentionally set.“If the Madison County Fire Rescue had not responded quickly, the flames would have reached the sunroom and the entire house might have gone up in flames,” he said.Despite his allegations, Madison County Fire Rescue and the Sheriff’s Office confirmed there is no open investigation into the incident and declined to explain the decision not to pursue one.Fishback acknowledged that no security cameras were installed at the time of the fire, but said he will install them moving forward.Calling the incident “disappointing,” Fishback said the timing — shortly after his return from travel — raised suspicions that the fire was politically motivated.He added that he hosted a supporters’ rally at his home on Monday night following the incident.Campaign officials said the candidate and his staff were safe, and no arrests have been made in connection with the fire.Fishback, a vocal critic of the H‑1B visa programme, has repeatedly called the system a “scam” that harms American workers. He has pledged that if elected Florida Governor, he would immediately fire all H‑1B holders employed by state agencies, declaring that foreign labour supplants domestic talent.He claims his opposition stems in part from personal experience, saying his mother lost her job in 2021 and was replaced by an H‑1B worker.In public appearances, including a Fox panel and debates, Fishback has argued that US companies prefer foreign labour over American applicants, asserting that they “refuse to interview” local candidates and “hide job postings” to justify hiring H‑1B workers.","Republican gubernatorial hopeful James Fishback claims arsonist tried to burn down his home on Sunday.

City moves to restrict ICE footprint





Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass on Tuesday intensified her confrontation with federal immigration authorities, announcing a series of measures aimed at curbing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity across the city.Calling the situation “not normal,” Bass signed an executive directive restricting federal immigration agents from using or staging operations at any city-owned or city-controlled property. “We will never allow our city to be divided,” she said, describing the move as necessary to “protect Los Angeles” from federal overreach.The new directive instructs the Los Angeles Police Department to preserve all evidence related to immigration enforcement operations, ensuring that these activities can be thoroughly documented and reviewed.Bass also directed the city’s Planning Department to prepare an ordinance that would impose fees on private property owners who grant federal agents site control for enforcement actions.In addition, the mayor’s office is looking at whether the Police Commission can implement elements of a California law, recently blocked by a judge, that sought to prohibit federal immigration officers from wearing masks during raids.Bass has repeatedly criticised agents for masking their identities and conducting operations without clear identification, calling the practice “outrageous.”The measures build on earlier steps taken by the mayor, including instructing city departments to develop preparedness plans for federal immigration activity and appoint designated “immigration affairs liaisons.”A vocal critic of the Trump administration’s immigration tactics, Bass has argued that recent raids have instilled fear among residents and hurt local businesses. Federal authorities, including the Department of Homeland Security and ICE, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The latest move signals a deepening policy and legal clash between Los Angeles and Washington over immigration enforcement, with the city positioning itself firmly against expanded federal operations within its limits.",Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has signed an executive directive restricting federal immigration agents from using or staging operations at city-owned or city-controlled property.

Speaking near the end of the press conference, he stressed that his comments reflected both his personal convictions and his professional background as an attorney with nearly three decades of experience.The Minnesota native referenced constitutional principles, including protections for free speech and against unreasonable searches and seizures, as he explained why he believed it was important to speak publicly. He said the situation in Minnesota was clear-cut and did not involve moral ambiguity, describing it as a matter of basic rights and fairness.Ruohonen also praised residents of Minnesota for showing compassion and solidarity during a difficult period.He said those responses reflected values he associates with the Olympic movement, including respect, integrity and unity.While political statements by athletes at the Olympics remain controversial, Ruohonen said acknowledging events affecting people back home was consistent with the freedoms athletes represent when competing for their country.

Teresa Leger Lambasts Trump, Pam Bondi Over Epstein Cover-Up; 'How Dare You?'

Who are the six men named?

DOJ denies cover-up

Political storm widens





A fresh political storm erupted on Capitol Hill after Indian-origin US Democrat Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) named six “wealthy and powerful” men he claims were redacted from the Jeffrey Epstein files, accusing the US Justice Department of hiding their identities without explanation.The six individuals identified were Les Wexner, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Salvatore Nuara, Zurab Mikeladze, Leonic Leonov, and Nicola Caputo.Khanna read out the names during a House speech, a move protected under the US Constitution’s speech and debate clause, shielding lawmakers from defamation lawsuits for remarks made in Congress. A video clip of the moment circulated widely on social media.Khanna and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said they spent two hours at the Justice Department in Washington on Monday reviewing unredacted versions of the Epstein documents. The duo co-sponsored the Jeffrey Epstein Transparency Act, which compelled the Trump administration to release a vast trove of records related to Epstein’s network and activities.“There were six wealthy, powerful men that the DOJ hid for no apparent reason,” Khanna said, claiming he and Massie had “forced” the department to unredact the names. “If we found six men they were hiding in two hours, imagine how many men they are covering up for in those files.”Massie said he was prepared to name the individuals publicly in Congress if the department did not act. “What I saw that bothered me were the names of at least six men that have been redacted that are likely incriminated by their inclusion in these files,” he said.Les Wexner is the billionaire founder of Victoria’s Secret and former head of L Brands. His long and controversial association with Epstein was detailed in a 2019 New York Times investigation, which examined their financial ties and Epstein’s influence over Wexner’s affairs.Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem is a Dubai-based billionaire businessman and real estate developer. He is the brother of Mohammed Ben Sulayem, president of the FIA, the global governing body for motorsport, including Formula One. Email exchanges between Bin Sulayem and Epstein have previously been reported.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche denied any cover-up, maintaining that certain redactions were necessary to protect victims. He argued that Wexner’s name appears thousands of times elsewhere in the files and said the department had been “hiding nothing.”Epstein, a convicted sex offender, pleaded guilty in 2008 to procuring a minor for prostitution and later died by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His death and the breadth of his elite connections have continued to cast a long shadow over US politics.Democrats argue that roughly three million pages remain unreleased, despite the Justice Department declaring its review complete after publishing a large tranche of documents in January.Several lawmakers who reviewed the files this week complained of “mysterious” and “unnecessary” redactions beyond those permitted to protect victims’ identities.House Judiciary ranking member Jamie Raskin said he observed “tons of completely unnecessary redactions,” while also raising concerns that some victims’ names had not been properly shielded.The controversy has also expanded beyond the six names cited by Khanna. US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick is facing bipartisan calls to resign after newly surfaced correspondence showed he had arranged travel to Epstein’s private Caribbean island in 2012.Lutnick admitted before a Senate panel on Tuesday that he had lunch with Epstein there, after previously stating he had spent “zero time” with him.Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, appearing alongside a small group of Epstein survivors, announced legislation aimed at eliminating the statute of limitations for certain sexual offences.The proposed law is named in honour of Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s most prominent accusers, who died by suicide in April 2025. “Justice should not expire,” Schumer said. “For years, survivors were told it was too late.”Meanwhile, Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s convicted associate serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, declined to testify before a House oversight committee, invoking her right against self-incrimination.With lawmakers continuing to review documents through the week, pressure is mounting on the Justice Department amid renewed demands for full disclosure in one of the most explosive scandals involving powerful global figures.","Indian-origin US Democrat Rep.

US commerce secretary rejects Epstein links amid bipartisan calls to step down: 'Met 3 times in 14 years',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-commerce-secretary-rejects-epstein-links-amid-bipartisan-calls-to-step-down-met-3-times-in-14-years/articleshow/128171441.cms,"On Cam: Dem Senator Skewers Lutnick Over 'Epstein Island Lies' | Trump Aide's Big Admission





US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday strongly denied having any substantive relationship with the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during testimony before a Senate committee, even as lawmakers from both parties stepped up calls for his resignation following the release of new justice department files.Appearing before a Senate appropriations panel, Lutnick said he had met Epstein only three times over a span of 14 years and rejected claims of any personal or professional association.“I did not have a relationship with Epstein,” Lutnick told lawmakers, adding, “Over 14 years, I did not have any relationship with him. I barely had anything to do with that person.”The controversy stems from newly released justice department records linked to the Epstein case, which include emails and documents indicating contact between Lutnick and Epstein even after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for sex crimes.Some records suggest social and business interactions in the 2010s, prompting bipartisan scrutiny and allegations that Lutnick’s earlier public statements were incomplete.According to the documents, the material includes emails discussing potential meetings, references to visits to Epstein’s private island in 2012, and indications of shared business interests, including a reported joint investment in a technology firm.Lutnick acknowledged a lunch with Epstein on a boat during a family vacation but maintained that the interactions were limited. “I have done absolutely nothing wrong in any possible regard in relation to Epstein,” he said.The disclosures have triggered calls for accountability from both sides of the aisle. Republican Congressman Thomas Massie said, “He should just resign,” while Democratic senator Adam Schiff wrote on social media, “Secretary Lutnick lied to the country about his ties to Epstein… He has no business being our commerce secretary. He should resign.” Democratic Congressman Robert Garcia also demanded that Lutnick step down or face further questioning.Despite the growing pressure, the White House has stood by Lutnick. A spokesperson said the administration remained focused on its policy agenda, while a commerce department spokesperson reiterated that Lutnick’s interactions with Epstein were limited and involved no wrongdoing.House oversight committee leaders have indicated that further investigations could follow, including possible subpoenas, as more Epstein-related documents are expected to be released under the Epstein files transparency act.", commerce secretary Howard Lutnick denied having any substantive relationship with Jeffrey Epstein during testimony before a Senate committee.

What happens after 214(b) denial?





Executives and CEOs around the world complaining that they are being denied a US visa under 214(b) put the most common ground of visa refusal back in the limelight at a time when the visa officers are extremely cautious over whom to allow entry to the US. Jasveer Singh , an Indian CEO of a matchmaking app Knot Dating, was refused a B1/B2 visa on the same ground and he was told that he could not prove strong ties to his home country India to convince the visa officers that he would not want to settle in the US, but has to come back to India.Singh said he runs a company, pays people, pays taxes to the country but as the outcome suggests, these factors were not enough. US Embassy in London is also denying visas to executives over past offences that did not even involve any arrest or conviction but possibly a police warning.This means the applicant did not sufficiently demonstrate to the consular officer that they qualify for the visa category they applied for.They did not overcome the presumption of immigrant intent, required by law, by sufficiently demonstrating that they have strong ties to their home country that will compel them to leave the United States at the end of their temporary stay.There is no one-size-fits-all answer as consular officers look at each application individually and consider the applicant's circumstances, travel plans, financial resources and ties outside of the US.Job, home, salary, and marital status are all crucial factors in making this decision.Another Indian CEO, Dhananjay Yadav , recently claimed that he was refused a visa after he was asked about his salary, and as a founder, his salary was minimal, he said.Every applicant for a non-immigrant visa (tourist, business, student) is presumed to be an intending immigrant unless they can provide otherwise.Immigration attorney Steven Brown said there is no rhyme or reason behind 214(b) denials. Some are absurd and the consular officers only go for ""vibes"" and not evidence. ""Consulates around the world hand 214(b) denials like candy for B Visas. Many of them are absolutely absurd and based on vibes not evidence,"" Brown said.The decision can not be appealed but this is not a ban.

A driveway ambush

From victim to voice of resilience





Nearly five years after a shocking acid attack left a young college student permanently scarred, police have finally arrested a suspect, with digital footprints and a controversial rap lyric forming key pieces of the puzzle.Terell Campbell, 29, a Brooklyn-based flower delivery driver and aspiring rapper, was arrested Tuesday in connection with the March 2021 assault on Nafiah Ikram in Elmont, Long Island. He has been charged with two counts of assault and criminal possession of a noxious substance. Campbell pleaded not guilty in Nassau County Court.According to prosecutors, Campbell conducted several incriminating internet searches immediately after the attack, including phrases such as “sulfuric acid remover,” “sulfuric acid on car seat,” and “Can you recover from a sulfuric acid attack?” Authorities described the searches as deeply disturbing and central to building the case.Adding to the controversy, prosecutors allege Campbell referenced burning someone’s face with acid in a song he posted online, a detail that stunned the courtroom.Officials called the assault “one of the most vicious and barbaric acts” in Nassau County’s history.On a March afternoon in 2021, Ikram was ambushed in the driveway of her Elmont home by a hooded man who threw a cup of acid at her face before fleeing in a red Nissan Altima.The attack left her with severe facial burns, damage to her throat, and permanent vision loss in her right eye.At the time, she said she did not know her attacker. She described him only as a tall, thin man, about 6-foot-2, who vanished within seconds.For years, the case remained unsolved, leaving Ikram living in fear while undergoing multiple surgeries and painful treatments.“I’m still suffering to this day,” she had said in a 2023 interview, detailing how scar tissue limited her ability to open her mouth and how she remained dependent on others for daily tasks.Despite the trauma, Ikram has refused to let the attack define her future. Through journaling, support from an emotional assistance pet, and numerous skin graft procedures, she has worked toward rebuilding her life.She now speaks publicly about her experience, hoping to inspire other survivors of violence. Her long-term ambition? To complete her college degree and possibly pursue a career in trauma medicine, motivated by her own painful journey through recovery.More details are expected to emerge at a Nassau County Police Department press conference scheduled later Tuesday.The arrest marks a turning point in a case that once appeared to have gone cold, with a digital trail ultimately leading investigators back to the suspect.","Terell Campbell, 29, a Brooklyn-based flower delivery driver and aspiring rapper, was arrested Tuesday.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has delivered a scathing assessment of his country’s past alliances with Washington, telling the National Assembly that Islamabad had been “used like toilet paper and then discarded” after serving American interests in Afghanistan.Speaking during a debate on terrorism following a deadly suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Islamabad, Asif said Pakistan had repeatedly joined “superpower wars” that were never its own.“We took part in two wars that were fought on the soil of Afghanistan,” Asif told lawmakers. Referring to the Soviet intervention in 1979, he claimed it was carried out “at the invitation of the government in Kabul” and that the narrative of an outright invasion was shaped by the United States.Pakistan, he said, entered those conflicts “in the name of Islam and religion”, but in reality two former military dictators sought legitimacy and the backing of a global power.“These were not our wars; they were superpower wars,” he said, adding that Pakistan and its land were used and then discarded ""like toilet paper.""Asif went on to describe terrorism in Pakistan as the “blowback of mistakes committed by dictators in the past”.He added that Pakistan had failed to learn from history, continuing to shift between Washington, Moscow and London in pursuit of short-term interests.""For our own interests, we sometimes turn to Washington, sometimes to Moscow, and sometimes to Britain. We have built strong franchises here, which was not the case 30 or 40 years ago,"" Asif said.Recalling then US President Bill Clinton’s brief stop in Islamabad in 2000, a visit lasting only a few hours at the end of a longer India trip, Asif said it underscored how transactional the relationship had become. Clinton’s engagement with then military ruler Pervez Musharraf was framed by US demands on democracy, non-proliferation and militancy, reinforcing.Asif’s remarks came as parliament passed a resolution condemning the attack on Imambargah Qasr-e-Khadijatul Kubra in Islamabad’s Tarlai area, where a suicide bomber killed 31 people and wounded 169 during Friday prayers. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. Thousands attended funerals across the capital as grieving families demanded accountability. “What happened yesterday has left us extremely angry and deeply hurt,” said Bushra Rahmani, whose brother was among the wounded.The minister urged political unity, lamenting what he called a lack of consensus even in condemning terrorism. “It is very important that we have a national identity on which no one disagrees,” he said, criticising those who, for political reasons, avoided attending the funerals of victims.",Khawaja Asif says Pakistan has been 'used like toilet paper' by the U.S. in Afghanistan.

Backdrop of deadly Islamabad attack





Pakistan’s Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday launched a sharp attack on Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy, questioning how extremist elements continue to cross the border even as trade remains blocked.Speaking at a public gathering in Rawalpindi, Rehman highlighted what he described as a glaring contradiction in Islamabad’s approach towards Afghanistan. “In all these decades, we never paused to ask why our Afghan policy failed so miserably. Not a single pomegranate or melon can enter Pakistan, yet terrorists keep crossing the border,” he said, smiling as he made the remark.Referring to repeated claims by Pakistani authorities that militants were entering from Afghanistan, Rehman added, “Authorities say terrorists are coming from there. If they are coming, stop them. If they are coming, eliminate them. The Afghan government has never objected to your actions.”The JUI-F leader also criticised Pakistan’s broader foreign and economic policies, calling them “complete failures”. He said Islamabad’s diplomatic approach had left the country increasingly isolated.“India is our enemy, Afghanistan is our enemy, and even Iran and China are upset with us,” Rehman said, adding that the public deserved answers.“A nation cannot survive when its policies produce only isolation, mistrust and insecurity.”He argued that Pakistan’s foreign policy was being driven not by elected governments but by the military establishment. “One general comes and says we will negotiate; another comes and says we will wage war,” he said.Rehman also took aim at the government’s handling of the China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC), claiming that the flagship infrastructure project had stalled due to declining Chinese confidence.“CPEC has seen no real progress during this tenure because China no longer trusts us,” he said, questioning whether “even a single brick” had moved under the current government. He claimed Beijing had expected the Pakistan democratic movement (PDM) government to stabilise relations and revive projects, but remained dissatisfied.Rehman’s remarks come amid heightened tensions following a suicide bombing at a mosque in Islamabad on Friday that killed 69 people and injured more than 170, according to local media reports citing hospital officials. The blast occurred during Friday prayers at Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra in the Tarlai area, Dawn reported.After Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif suggested on X that preliminary findings pointed to the attacker having travelled to and from Afghanistan, Kabul rejected the allegation. Afghanistan’s ministry of national defence termed the claim “irresponsible and baseless” and urged Pakistani authorities to take responsibility for internal security lapses, Afghan media outlet Ariana News reported.The Afghan ministry said similar accusations had been made in the past following attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, without conclusive evidence.","Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman criticises Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy.

'Not Vassals Of Trump & Elon Musk': Spain's Deputy PM Makes Blistering Exit From 'Place Of Hate' X





Pakistan’s decision on granting a licence to Starlink to operate in its satellite internet market has been delayed amid data security concerns, geopolitical sensitivities and competition from Chinese firms, local media reported on Sunday.Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk , is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan. However, officials say unresolved security considerations and broader geopolitical factors have slowed the clearance process.According to the Express Tribune, the government has raised concerns that Starlink’s services could allow certain data transmissions to bypass Pakistan’s monitoring, regulatory and safety checks. “We cannot allow a license to Starlink without ensuring a safety check to ensure the safety of the data of consumers in Pakistan,” a senior government official was quoted as saying by Express Tribune.Sources cited by the newspaper said authorities had tested scenarios in which Starlink was expected to pick up sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services. “But the real reason is that the government has tested some cases in which Starlink was supposed to pick up some sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services,” sources said.Officials added that the government is working to address these issues, which have delayed the approval process.The report also cited the fallout between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk as a factor being weighed by the Pakistani establishment. While Trump and Musk had enjoyed a close relationship in the past, they later drifted apart. Officials indicated that Pakistan, which has seen improved ties with the United States since Trump returned to power last year, is cautious about taking steps that could draw scrutiny from Washington.At present, Pakistan maintains control over internet data traffic largely through Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited, which holds a majority stake in the country’s undersea cable infrastructure. Authorities are concerned that similar oversight may not be feasible with satellite-based services, raising fears of potential data breaches or loss of regulatory control.Satellite internet services are expected to focus primarily on remote and underserved regions, including Balochistan, where conventional broadband infrastructure remains limited. Currently, authorities are able to monitor internet traffic and suspend connectivity when required for security reasons. Officials have expressed concern that enforcing similar controls over satellite-based networks could prove more challenging.The Pakistan Space Activities Regulatory Board has confirmed that five companies, including Starlink and China-based Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology Limited, have shown interest in entering the satellite internet market. Chinese firms already have a strong presence in Pakistan’s telecommunications sector and are viewed as direct competitors to US-based companies such as Starlink.While consultations with stakeholders have been completed, the PSARB has yet to finalise the licensing framework. According to officials, additional time is needed to establish safety mechanisms before satellite-based internet services are permitted to begin operations.","Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday. Toll rose to 36 on Saturday after some critically injured people died in hospitals, said a PTI report.In a related development that has attracted the attention of Indian security establishment, the Islamic State in its latest al-Naba issue called on members of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) to defect and join the Islamic State in Khorasan Province.The claim regarding the blast was issued via IS central's mouthpiece, Amaq, stating the attack was a Fidayeen operation carried out by a soldier of the Islamic State in Pakistan Province (ISPP) -- active since 2019 -- inside the mosque compound. Amaq claimed over 200 casualties in contrast to the official Pak govt admission of 36 deaths and injuries to scores.The suicide bomber was identified by Amaq as Saifullah Ansari. His photograph taking the bayah (oath of allegiance) was also posted by the IS mouthpiece. The statement also mentioned that hundreds of Pakistani Shias had joined the pro-Iran 'Zaynabiyoun brigade' militia in Syria.The claim by Amaq followed an official denial by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which strongly rebutted any involvement in the incident.The blast, which occurred during prayers at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque in Tarlai area, was the deadliest in Islamabad since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.The explosion coincided with the visit of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to Pakistan. The attack is being seen as a result of growing sectarian tensions in the country.Earlier in Jan, ISKP had claimed responsibility for a blast in Bajaur district that killed a senior Lashkar commander named Najibullah.","Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday.

'Home-Grown Ills': Islamabad Mosque Blast Triggers Blame Game As India Rejects Pakistan's Blame





The Islamic State on Saturday claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad, which killed at least 36 people and injured many others.In a statement released through its Amaq News Agency, the Islamic State in Pakistan, an offshoot of Daesh, said the bomber opened fire at security guards when they tried to stop him at the entrance and then exploded inside among worshippers.The group also said Shiite Muslims in Pakistan were a target, claiming they provided recruits to militias fighting the Islamic State in Syria.The blast took place on Friday at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque-cum-shrine in the Tarlie area of the capital. The attacker, identified as 32-year-old Yasir from Peshawar, entered the mosque while worshippers were offering weekly prayers and detonated explosives.Authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said they arrested four suspects, including three alleged facilitators and the mastermind, during intelligence-based raids in Peshawar and Nowshera.Investigators said an identity card recovered during the probe confirmed the attacker’s identity. Official records showed his permanent address in Abbas Colony on Charsadda Road in Peshawar.Officials also said the attacker had spent around five months in Afghanistan before the bombing, where he allegedly received training in weapons handling and suicide attacks.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif had earlier claimed that India and Afghanistan were involved in the attack, without presenting any evidence.India had strongly rejected the allegations, saying, ""It is unfortunate that, instead of seriously addressing the problems plaguing its social fabric, Pakistan should choose to delude itself by blaming others for its home-grown ills. India rejects any and every such allegation, which is as baseless as it is pointless.""","The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad.

Signals from Washington and Tehran





Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States aimed at easing tensions between the two countries, slated to take place on Friday in Turkey.“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query, reported Dawn.Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar is expected to take part in the meeting, the daily reported citing a diplomatic source, adding that “Islamabad’s participation was seen as significant.”An Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the meeting is likely to be held in Turkiye on Friday. The format of the talks remains unclear, though the official said the main meeting would take place that day.A regional official told Reuters that the priority of the talks was to avoid conflict and de-escalate tensions between Iran and the US, adding that several regional powers had been invited at the foreign ministers’ level.According to the official, countries invited include Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).US outlet Axios, citing two sources and a US official, reported that Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible agreement related to Iran’s nuclear programme.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had instructed Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” in an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.The talks, he said in posts on X, would be held “within the framework of our national interests”.US President Donald Trump has said he is hopeful Washington would “work something out” with Iran but warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal was reached.In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”“In return, we expect sanctions to be lifted,” he added, while warning that Iran was prepared for war if talks failed, saying any conflict would likely spread beyond Iran.Turkiye has been leading diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and engaging with regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.","Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States.

Imran Khan’s Sisters Allege Illegal Isolation, Stage Protest Outside Adiala Jail





A Pakistani anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan, sister of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan in connection with a protest held in Islamabad in November 2024.According to news agency PTI citing a media report, the warrants were issued by the ATC in Rawalpindi after Aleema Khan failed to appear before the court despite earlier directions.The court also issued non-bailable arrest warrants against her two guarantors and ordered that all three be arrested and produced before it on Wednesday, without fail. Aleema’s application seeking exemption from personal appearance was rejected.The case, registered at Sadiqabad Police Station, relates to a protest at D-Chowk in Islamabad on November 24, 2024 and includes charges of protesting against the government, chanting anti-government slogans, vandalism and stone-pelting. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing.The court also issued a show-cause notice to the Superintendent of Police (SP), Rawal, for failing to execute the arrest warrants.The SP has been directed to appear before the court on Wednesday and explain why Aleema Khan was not arrested and presented despite clear orders, according to Pakistani news website Express Tribune.During Monday’s hearing, Aleema Khan’s defence counsel sought a one-day exemption, citing difficulties in travel and daily affairs after her bank accounts, Computerised National Identity Card and passport were reportedly blocked. The court, however, did not accept the plea.The proceedings have drawn attention as Aleema Khan had earlier skipped multiple hearings in the case and appeared only after the court issued property seizure orders and several arrest warrants. She is among those nominated as accused in protest-related cases filed following the November demonstrations.The protest followed Imran Khan’s “final call” for nationwide demonstrations demanding the restoration of the party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) electoral mandate, the release of party leaders and the reversal of constitutional changes.The D-Chowk protest ended on November 26 after a security operation, with several cases registered across Rawalpindi district. In total, 29 cases linked to the protest have been filed in the district, with Imran Khan named in several and his wife, Bushra Bibi, charged in all 29 cases.","Pakistani anti-terrorism court issues non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan.

Troops ‘physically handicapped’ by vast terrain

Insurgency background and wider fallout





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country’s security forces are “physically handicapped” by the sheer size of Balochistan as they battle a fresh surge in militant violence, after authorities reported killing 177 insurgents in sweeping counter-terror operations across the province.Addressing the national assembly, Asif described the scale of the challenge facing troops deployed in Pakistan’s largest and least populated province, where coordinated attacks triggered one of the deadliest security crises in recent years. His remarks came after militants launched simultaneous assaults in multiple towns, targeting civilians, homes and security installations.“Balochistan constitutes over 40 per cent of Pakistan geographically...To control it is much more difficult than a populated city, and it needs deployment of massive forces. Our troops are deployed there and are in action against them (terrorists), but they are physically handicapped by guarding and patrolling such a big area,” Asif told lawmakers, as quoted by PTI.Security officials said the death toll of militants had risen to 177 in the past two days following large-scale raids and gun battles.The operations were launched after insurgents carried out coordinated attacks at 12 locations, with authorities confirming that at least 17 police and security personnel were killed, along with dozens of civilians.Asif said the weekend violence claimed 33 civilian lives and 17 members of the security forces. He ruled out talks with the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), saying no negotiations would be held with “terrorists” responsible for killing civilians, including women and children.Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, has long faced a separatist insurgency driven by ethnic Baloch groups who accuse the central government of discrimination and exploitation. Authorities say groups such as the BLA have targeted security forces, infrastructure and projects linked to the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor.Train services between Balochistan and the rest of Pakistan remained suspended for a third day, while mobile and internet services were cut in several districts during clean-up operations. Provincial officials said services were expected to resume once the security situation stabilised.Asif dismissed claims that Balochistan had been neglected, saying the province had seen development, including multiple airports. He also rejected the “missing persons” narrative, alleging that names of militants killed in operations had appeared on such lists. “This narrative has been concocted. I also used to support this cause and protest over it. But, terrorists and criminal elements have hijacked all these narratives,” he said.","Khawaja Asif says security forces are 'physically handicapped' by sheer size of Balochistan.

In a bizarre case, police in Pakistan’s Rawalpindi district registered a case on Sunday of abduction against a “jinn” (supernatural spirit) following the disappearance of an 11-year-old boy, news agency ANI reported, citing ARY News.The incident occurred in the garrison city when the boy went missing from his home on January 21. After ten days without any sign of the child, his father approached the Taxila Police Station and filed a First Information Report (FIR).In the FIR, the father alleged that supernatural entities, known locally as jinns, had forced his son to run away.The complainant said that this is not the first time such an incident has occurred. He added that the jinns had “abducted” his son several times before.He highlighted that while the boy had returned home after previous incidents, this time ten days had passed without his return, prompting him to formally accuse the supernatural spirits of kidnapping.According to ARY News, similar claims have been reported in Pakistan’s legal system before. In Lahore, a mother had lodged a case against jinns over the disappearance of her married daughter, a matter that eventually reached the courts.A report by Dawn in September stated that a special investigation team of Lahore police was formed under the directions of the city's high court Chief Justice Aalia Neelam to probe the six-year-old case of the missing woman, believed to have been abducted by a jinn.The team, headed by Lahore Investigation DIG Zeeshan Raza, was tasked with locating and recovering the woman.","11-year-old boy went missing from his home in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, on January 21.

Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January, data released on Monday by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) showed.The fatalities included 242 militants, 73 civilians, and 46 security personnel, according to the Islamabad-based think tank.At least 135 people were injured, among them 71 were civilians, 52 security personnel, and 12 militants.PICSS reported 87 militant attacks across Pakistan in January, a 28% rise from the 68 incidents recorded in December 2025. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bore the brunt, with 58 incidents—38 in the mainland districts and 20 in the tribal areas. The restive Balochistan followed with 27 attacks, while Punjab reported two targeted incidents.Balochistan emerged as the main theatre of militant violence and security operations, recording its highest monthly militant death toll since the current insurgency began in 2001. While the province remained relatively calm for most of January, violence surged dramatically in the final two days. Coordinated attacks by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) across at least 12 locations, followed by intensified security operations, placed the province at the centre of the conflict.At least 172 militants were killed, the majority in the final two days of last month.Security forces arrested at least 60 suspected militants during the previous month, while militant groups kidnapped eight individuals. In Punjab, 53 militants were arrested, 48 of them from Lahore, the state capital and Pakistan's second-largest city.Meanwhile, no militant attacks were reported in January from Sindh, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), Islamabad, or the Gilgit-Baltistan region, according to the data.","Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January.

Bangladesh elections 2026





Zaima Rahman, daughter of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chief Tarique Rahman, took to the streets of the capital on a rickshaw to campaign for her father in the high-profile Dhaka-17 constituency ahead of the February 12 general elections.Videos circulating online show the London-trained barrister riding through busy neighbourhoods with Fatema Khatun, caregiver to former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, as she handed out pamphlets and appealed directly to voters.Beginning her outreach at Gulshan Police Plaza, Zaima moved through streets, shops, cafes and office buildings, distributing leaflets bearing the BNP’s election symbol, the “Sheaf of Paddy.” She was seen speaking with pedestrians, rickshaw pullers, vendors and office staff.“My father, Tarique Rahman, is the ‘Sheaf of Paddy’ candidate in Dhaka-17. I am asking for your votes in his favour,” she told residents during the campaign trail.Rahman, 60, is considered a front-runner in what will be Bangladesh’s first general election since the ouster of long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2024. He faces a key challenge in Dhaka-17 from Jamaat-e-Islami candidate Dr SM Khalekuzzaman.The BNP supremo recently rejected a proposal from Jamaat-e-Islami for a unity government, asserting confidence in his party’s prospects. “How can I form a government with my political opponents, and then who would be in the opposition?” he said in an interview, expressing hope that rivals would play the role of a “good opposition” if elected.Rahman returned to Bangladesh in December after nearly two decades in exile, following the deteriorating health of his mother, Khaleda Zia, who passed away on December 30, 2025. Zia was the country’s first woman prime minister.General elections will be held on February 12, 2026, to elect 300 members to the Jatiya Sangsad (National Parliament). The vote will also be accompanied by a constitutional referendum on the July Charter.More than 127 million voters are eligible to cast their ballots, making it one of the largest democratic exercises of the year. As many as 1,981 candidates are contesting the polls.The election is being conducted under an interim government led by Muhammad Yunus, which has been in place since Sheikh Hasina’s removal following a student-led uprising in 2024.Hasina, now in exile in India, was later convicted by a Bangladesh tribunal for allowing the use of lethal force against protesters during the unrest, which left around 1,400 people — many of them students and teenagers — dead. She has been sentenced to death in absentia.The Awami League, which won the previous four elections under Hasina, has been suspended and is not participating in the upcoming vote. This has turned the contest largely into a bipolar fight between the BNP and the 11-Party Alliance led by Jamaat-e-Islami and the National Citizen Party (NCP).The BNP has nominated 288 candidates and is seeking additional seats through allies and independents. The 11-Party Alliance is contesting 298 seats, while Islami Andolan Bangladesh has fielded candidates in 253 constituencies. The National Democratic Front (NDF), led by the Jatiya Party (Ershad), is contesting 206 seats. Leftist parties under the Democratic United Front are in 149 seats, and the Greater Sunni Alliance is contesting 64 constituencies.Key campaign issues include unemployment, corruption, extortion, proportional representation and outreach to youth and minority voters. Postal voting will be used for the first time, and the “No Vote” option has also been reintroduced.With opinion polls indicating an edge for the BNP but a strong showing expected from Jamaat-e-Islami, the February 12 election is set to reshape Bangladesh’s political landscape.","Zaima Rahman, daughter of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chief Tarique Rahman, took to the streets of the capital on a rickshaw to campaign for her father in the high-profile Dhaka-17 constituency.

Yunus Sparks Fresh Alarm As Greater Bangladesh Map Gifted To US Envoy Includes India’s Northeast

UN human rights office formally approached

Dispute over investigation and wider fallout





Bangladesh’s interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus , has approached the United Nations human rights office seeking assistance for a fair and transparent investigation into the killing of student leader Sharif Osman Hadi Hadi, 32, a prominent figure during the July–August 2024 mass protests that led to the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League government, was shot in the head during an election campaign event in Dhaka on December 12.He later died on December 18 after being flown to Singapore for treatment.According to Bangladesh’s state-run BSS, the country’s Permanent Mission in Geneva sent a formal Note Verbale on Friday to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), requesting cooperation in the investigation.The interim government’s Chief Adviser’s press wing confirmed the development on Saturday.“The government of Bangladesh has reiterated that it is firmly committed to identifying those responsible for the killing of Shaheed Sharif Osman Hadi and bringing them to justice,” the press wing said, as cited by news agency PTI.The request seeks technical and institutional assistance to ensure that the probe meets international standards.Hadi was the spokesperson of Inqilab Moncho and had emerged as a national figure during last year’s youth-led uprising. He was also contesting as a parliamentary candidate in the February 12 elections.In January, Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s Detective Branch filed charges against 17 people, including alleged shooter Faisal Karim Masud. Police said the killing was driven by “political vengeance” and carried out at the behest of the Awami League.Detective branch additional commissioner Md Shafiqul Islam had claimed that Masud was linked to the Awami League’s student wing, Chhatra League, and that the murder was ordered by Awami League-nominated ward councillor Taizul Islam Chowdhury Bappi.Hadi’s party has rejected the police chargesheet, alleging involvement of state agencies in the killing. The interim government had last year banned both the Awami League and Chhatra League.The killing sparked violent protests across the country and further unsettled Bangladesh’s already volatile political situation.The interim administration has pledged to ensure “the highest standards of transparency and accountability” in the case.Hadi’s death also strained relations with India after some groups alleged an Indian connection to the crime. New Delhi has firmly denied the claims, dismissing them as a “false narrative”.Supporters of Hadi have described him as a martyr and a symbol of Bangladesh’s youth-driven anti-establishment movement.","Student leader Sharif Osman Hadi Hadi, 32, was shot in the head during an election campaign event in Dhaka on December 12.

As Bangladesh Elections Near, Hindu Minority Faces Rising Attacks, Islamist Return And State Silence





A veteran Bangladesh politician, Bangladesh Awami League senior leader Ramesh Chandra Sen died on Saturday while in custody at Dinajpur District Jail.Sen, 83, reportedly became unwell inside the jail early Saturday morning and was taken to Dinajpur Medical College Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at around 9:29 am local time, according to prison officials. Jail Superintendent Farhad Sarkar said the body would be handed over to his family once all legal procedures have been completed, as reported by ANI.His death, only days before the country’s general election scheduled for February 12, has heightened concerns over the treatment of incarcerated political leaders and renewed allegations of custodial negligence. Organising Secretary of Bangladesh Awami League Central Committee Shafiul Alam Chowdhury Nadel, alleging negligence and calling out Yunus said on X, ""Ramesh Chandra Sen from a teacher to a politician and a public representative. A five-time MP and former minister—this elderly, ill man was arrested and led away with his hands tied. He has now passed away in Dinajpur jail due to a lack of medical treatment. Yunus, you must answer for this.""President of Bangladesh Students' League Saddam Hussein also claimed medical neglect saying, ""Eighteen months ago, this widely respected, elderly leader was attacked, humiliated by BNP-Jamaat mob and taken into police custody, without any specific charges.One false and fabricated case after another was imposed on him to justify his continued detention. Despite his deteriorating health, he was deliberately denied bail, denied minimum medical treatment, and denied basic human rights. "" ""At 86 years of age, Sri Ramesh Chandra Sen was kept behind bars for one and a half years without trial and without proper medical care. This happened under the illegal, murderous-fascist Yunus regime, which chose cruelty over humanity and repression over the rule of law,"" he added.Further mentioning other Awami League politicians in custody he added, ""According to Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK), at least 107 prisoners died in custody in 2025 alone—the majority of them leaders and activists of the Awami League. In almost every case, the authorities casually cited causes such as “heart attack” or “sudden illness.” Despite clear legal provisions, not a single custodial death has been properly investigated by this illegal government. ""The veteran Hindu leader had been in custody since August 16, 2024, after being arrested by police in Thakurgaon. ""Bangladesh Police have arrested a Hindu leader of Awami League and put him on a farcical trial. Ramesh Chandra Sen, an octogenarian, was arrested from his house in Thakurgaon who was having his dinner. Surprisingly, he hails from Mirza Fakhrul's constituency,"" the Bangladesh Awami League had said, just days after his arrest nearly two years ago.A court subsequently ordered his transfer to Thakurgaon District Jail and later to Dinajpur. There, he was facing three cases, including a murder charge linked to the political turmoil that followed a mass uprising against the government of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Born on April 30, 1940, in Ruhia Union under Thakurgaon Sadar Upazila, Sen was elected multiple times from the Thakurgaon-1 constituency to the Jatiya Sangsad. A presidium member of the Awami League, he secured his most recent parliamentary victory in the 2024 general election, before the party was later barred from political activity by the current interim administration.Meanwhile, the interim government, headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and tasked with overseeing the electoral process for February 12 elections, has faced criticism at home and abroad over its human rights record. Opposition figures contend that deaths of prominent detainees, particularly former Awami League leaders, point to systemic failings and raise concerns about the adequacy of medical care in custody.His death comes at a politically sensitive moment in Bangladesh, with the Awami League excluded from the forthcoming polls and rival parties competing for advantage.","Bangladesh Awami League senior leader Ramesh Chandra Sen died on Saturday while in custody at Dinajpur District Jail.

US Energy Secy Clarifies On Trump's Nuclear Test Bombshell; ‘No Choice Left' | Watch





US President Donald Trump has ordered fresh tests of the American nuclear weapons system, sparking questions on whether the United States is preparing to resume nuclear explosions after more than three decades. The announcement was made on social media last week and followed by remarks ahead of his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.However, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Sunday clarified that the testing would not involve nuclear explosions but would instead focus on “the other parts of a nuclear weapon” to ensure they are working properly.Wright’s comments came four days after Trump declared that he was ordering the US military to resume nuclear testing “on an equal basis” with other countries, raising the spectre of a return to the worst days of the Cold War. “I think the tests we’re talking about right now are systems tests,” Wright said in an interview on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing. “These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions. ”Wright said Americans in places such as Nevada, where the United States has a nuclear test site bigger than the state of Rhode Island, should not expect to see a mushroom cloud. On Wednesday — minutes before he met with President Xi Jinping of China in South Korea — Trump said in a social media post that he was ordering the Pentagon to step up testing of nuclear weapons.“We’ve halted it years — many years — ago,” Trump later told reporters, referring to the last US explosive test of a nuclear weapon in 1992. “But with others doing testing, I think it is appropriate that we do also.”Wright reiterated that testing was underway on the new nuclear systems. “And again, these will be nonnuclear explosions,” he said, adding, “These are just developing sophisticated systems so that our replacement nuclear weapons are even better than the ones they were before.”The confusion over Trump’s intentions began just minutes before his key meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. Posting on his Truth Social platform, Trump appeared to signal that he was preparing to end the decades-long US moratorium on testing nuclear weapons.Later that day, as he returned to Washington, the President remained evasive about whether he was ordering the resumption of full-scale nuclear detonations — a practice seen only in North Korea this century — or referring instead to routine tests of the systems used to deliver such weapons.Detonation tests are no longer common. The only nation that has been regularly conducting nuclear tests in the past quarter-century is North Korea, whose last test was in September 2017.China has rapidly expanded its nuclear stockpile and deployed missiles in new silos but has not tested a nuclear weapon since 1996. Russia has not conducted a confirmed test since 1990, although it recently declared that it had tested two new delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons — a nuclear-powered cruise missile and an undersea torpedo, called Poseidon, capable of crossing the Pacific to the US West Coast. The United States itself routinely tests unarmed missiles.In 1993, the Clinton administration announced plans for a treaty under which nations would forgo nuclear blasts. Although the 1996 test-ban treaty never officially entered into force, it established a global norm of not testing destructive bombs.Washington is currently undertaking a major effort to replace its warheads with updated versions. The overall cost of the sprawling programme over three decades is estimated at $1.7 trillion.",US Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Sunday clarified that the testing would not involve nuclear explosions.

Birthday party turns deadly: Shooting takes place at Ohio Airbnb; juveniles among nine injured,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/birthday-party-turns-deadly-shooting-takes-place-at-ohio-airbnb-juveniles-among-nine-injured/articleshow/125045508.cms,"



Nine people, including teenagers, were injured when an unknown shooter or shooters opened fire during a party at an Airbnb rental at around midnight on the 900 block of Top O Hill Drive in Bath Township, Ohio.Bath Township Police said officers responded after multiple 911 calls reported a shooting at the home. Police believe a large group of juveniles arrived after a social media post promoted the event, which the Associated Press reported was a birthday party.Officials said the shooter or shooters fired multiple rounds inside the home, struck several people and then fled the scene. When emergency personnel arrived, they provided life-saving assistance to the victims, who were then taken to hospital.The victims’ ages range from 15 to 20. Several local agencies assisted with the investigation.Police said the current condition of the victims is unknown. Investigators from the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations and Bath Township Police are processing the crime scene.Police Chief Vito Sinopoli said the large home had been rented out on Airbnb, which is not allowed under local zoning ordinances, and most of the people at the party were under 18.He said the victims may include a mix of juveniles and adults. Social media posts about the party drew a big crowd, he said, as per AP.It was not immediately known what sparked the shooting and how many people fired guns, he said. No arrests were announced.“The Bath Township community experienced a tragic and senseless act of violence early this morning,"" Sinopoli said.Akron Mayor Shammas Malik said, “The City of Akron will do anything needed to assist Bath officials in the investigation that is already underway.Those who perpetrate violence anywhere in our community must be held accountable for their actions. This kind of deadly behavior cannot be normalized.”Anyone with information is asked to call the Bath Township Police Department Detective Bureau at 330-666-3736.Airbnb said, “We are heartbroken by this senseless act of gun violence, and our thoughts are with the injured victims and all those affected by it. Unauthorized and disruptive gatherings are strictly prohibited on Airbnb and our Safety team acted immediately to remove the account of the individual who deliberately broke those rules by booking this stay. Our law enforcement response team is in contact with the chief of Bath Township Police Department to assist their ongoing investigation to ensure those responsible for this terrible incident are brought to justice. ”Airbnb said it is also in contact with the host, and the listing is suspended from the platform as investigations continue. Police are still working to identify who is responsible for the shooting.","Nine people, including teenagers, were injured when an unknown shooter or shooters opened fire during a party at an Airbnb rental at around midnight on the 900 block of Top O Hill Drive in Bath Township, Ohio.

"'No, not really': Trump rules out Tomahawk missiles deal for Ukraine — is Russia behind U-turn?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-not-really-trump-rules-out-tomahawk-missiles-deal-for-ukraine-is-russia-behind-u-turn/articleshow/125044761.cms,"'Yes, We Have Secret Plans': Trump's Fiery Response To Reporter On Strikes On Venezuela | Watch

Is Russia behind this decision?

What is Tomahawk missiles?

Will not giving missiles to Ukraine weaken its fight against Russia?





US President Donald Trump said on Sunday aboard Air Force One that, for now, he was not considering a deal to allow Ukraine to obtain long-range Tomahawk missiles for use against Russia.Trump was cool to a plan for the United States to sell Tomahawks to NATO nations that would transfer them to Ukraine, saying he did not want to escalate the war. His latest comments to reporters indicated he remained reluctant.“No, not really,” Trump told reporters as he flew to Washington from Palm Beach, Florida, when asked whether he was considering a deal to sell the missiles. He added, however, that he could change his mind.He and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte had discussed the Tomahawk idea when they met at the White House on October 22.Rutte said on Friday that the issue was under review and that it was up to the United States to decide.Earlier, Russia had raised the issue of Washington supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine and warned that such military support could harm US–Russia relations and adversely affect any peace process.The US President later told journalists at the White House that he had spoken to Putin about Tomahawk missiles. “I did actually say to him, ‘Would you mind if I gave a couple of thousands of Tomahawks to your opposition?’ I did say that to him,” Trump told reporters, adding that Putin did not appear to like that idea.“What do you think he’s [Putin’s] going to say, ‘Please sell Tomahawks?’ No, he doesn’t want Tomahawks to be supplied to Ukraine,” he added.According to US defence information, Tomahawk missiles were developed in the 1970s. They are long-range cruise missiles launched from ships or submarines and are generally used for long-distance attacks. The Pentagon’s budget documents state that the missile can make “deep-strike” attacks on land and “uses a combination of inertial navigation, GPS, and terrain contour matching (TERCOM) or Digital Scene Matching Area Correlation (DSMAC) for precision guidance”.Tomahawks fly at supersonic speed at low altitudes – about 30 metres off the ground – and have a range of more than 1,250–2,500 km. They usually carry conventional warheads but can also carry nuclear ones.The US, United Kingdom, Netherlands and Australia have all used these missiles in combat.So far, the US has launched more than 2,300 Tomahawks from its ships and submarines during operations in Syria and Libya, among others.Possibly yes. The missiles’ long-range precision would allow Kyiv to strike Russia’s critical energy infrastructure, a key pillar of Moscow’s war economy, according to CSIS.A sustained campaign targeting oil and gas facilities could weaken Russia’s ability to fund and supply its war, potentially forcing it to negotiate.However, analysts caution that a handful of missiles won’t shift the balance — hundreds would be needed for meaningful impact. Even then, success would depend on consistent, focused strikes and the indirect effects trickling through Russia’s economy and public pressure.","US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he was not considering a deal to allow Ukraine to obtain long-range Tomahawk missiles for use against Russia.

Prince Andrew’s Royal Life ENDS: King Charles Forces Brother Out After Epstein Scandal

What happened

What is next for Andrew





King Charles III, on Thursday, has stripped his brother Andrew of his ‘prince’ title and has ordered him to vacate his Windsor residence, Royal Lodge.The move follows weeks of mounting pressure and public scrutiny over his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” the palace said, as cited by AP. “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”The announcement came amid mounting outrage after Virginia Giuffre, a key accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, reiterated her sexual assault allegations against Prince Andrew, claims that he continues to deny.The claims were detailed in her posthumously published memoir, where she recounts how Epstein allegedly trafficked her to have sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions, including twice when she was just 17.Andrew, 65, has consistently denied Giuffre’s allegations but withdrew from royal duties following a widely criticised BBC interview in November 2019, where he sought to defend himself against her claims.Also read: A look at Prince Andrew's former roles and crown perks he’s losing In 2022, he reached a multimillion-pound out-of-court settlement after Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit against him in New York. Though Andrew made no admission of guilt, he expressed regret for Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.In a 2019 BBC interview, Andrew said he had known British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of media tycoon and former MP Robert Maxwell, since her university days.It was Maxwell who introduced him to her then-partner, Jeffrey Epstein, in 1999. The three maintained a close friendship, even after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for procuring a minor for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute.Andrew is also alleged to have personally invited Epstein and Maxwell to Balmoral, the Queen’s Scottish estate, that same year, as cited by The Independent.In June this year, Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison by a New York court for her role in recruiting and grooming teenage girls for Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse.In a separate development, reports this week also revealed that Prince Andrew had hosted Jeffrey Epstein at Royal Lodge during his daughter Beatrice’s birthday celebrations in 2006, just two months after a US arrest warrant was issued for Epstein over the sexual assault of a minor, as cited by the BBC.Andrew is expected to relocate to a property on the King’s private Sandringham estate in Norfolk, with the move to be privately funded by King Charles.His ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, will also vacate Royal Lodge and make her own living arrangements.Formal notice to surrender the lease at Royal Lodge was issued on Thursday, and Andrew’s move to Sandringham is expected to take place “as soon as practicable.” He will receive a private allowance from the King, while any additional income will be his own responsibility, as reported by The Guardian.Also read: King Charles boots Prince Andrew out of Windsor home, strips all titles over Epstein links Andrew’s daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will keep their royal titles, and he remains eighth in line to the throne.It marks the most dramatic royal exit since 1936, when King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to marry twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. The couple were granted the titles Duke and Duchess of Windsor and lived the rest of their lives in exile.In contrast, Prince Harry, despite stepping back from royal duties, moving to California, and his ongoing rift with the family, still retains his title as Prince and Duke of Sussex.","King Charles III has stripped Prince Andrew of his 'prince' title and ordered him to vacate his Windsor residence, Royal Lodge.

What Happens if the Shutdown Continues?

Air traffic controllers:





Nearly a month into the shutdown, food banks across the country were straining to meet rising demand from hundreds of thousands of federal workers who were furloughed or working without pay and were bracing for an even bigger surge as benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program were set to lapse on Nov. 1.More than one in eight Americans depended on food stamps from SNAP, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Recipients received an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card to buy groceries, and many families relied on those benefits as their main source of money for food, CBS news reported.The Community Table Food Bank in Arvada, Colorado, was so inundated with people on Thursday that it had to temporarily close. Before it did, Danielle Brann, a SNAP recipient, obtained essentials including ham and crackers and cans of spaghetti sauce.“The line started at 9 o’clock this morning and I don’t remember ever seeing it this busy. I mean they’re turning people away. So it’s more of a demand for sure,” Brann said.In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, the Loaves and Fishes Food Pantry also had to turn people away on Tuesday because food was leaving the shelves faster than it could be restocked.Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that Americans could face a travel “disaster” as Thanksgiving approaches next month without an end in sight to the govt shutdown.Their comments came after Vance hosted a roundtable of aviation, travel and union leaders at the White House, during which they aired their concerns with the current state of the industry and worked out potential, temporary solutions to ease the strain on Federal Aviation Administration employees who were being forced to work without pay to ensure Americans could fly safely, two White House officials told CNN.“Look it could be a disaster. It really could be, because at that point you’re talking about people have missed three paychecks. They’ve missed four paychecks. How many of them are not going to show up for work?” Vance said.“That’s going to lead to massive delays. We want people to be able to get home for Thanksgiving. We want people to be able to travel for business,” he continued.Air traffic control staffing problems spiked over the weekend, raising concerns about growing disruption Duffy added, “Our traffic will be snarled, but it will be a disaster in aviation.”More than a million active-duty service members in the United States would have missed their pay cheques on Friday if the Trump administration will not intervene, BBC reported.About a quarter of military families were considered food insecure, and 15% relied on Snap or food pantries, according to research firm Rand. Meanwhile, the Military Family Advisory Network estimated that 27% of families had £380 or less in emergency savings.The Pentagon said it had accepted a $130m gift from a wealthy donor to help pay salaries during the shutdown, which worked out to $100 for each of the 1.3 million service members expecting to be paid.The White House planned to pay the troops on 31 October by using money from a military housing fund, a research-and-development account and a defence procurement fund, according to Axios.Earlier this month the administration made payroll by moving $6.5bn from military research. More than 160 families told the National Military Family Association that they had been underpaid during the shutdown, some by hundreds of dollars and others by thousands.If the shutdown continues, then some 4.5 million paycheques would have been withheld from civilian employees, representing about $21bn in missing wages, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.Furloughed employees were typically paid after shutdowns ended, although Trump had threatened to withhold pay and was attempting to fire thousands of workers, a move being challenged in court.Thousands of air traffic controllers missed their first paycheques this week. And if it continues, then the flight delay will also continue.Because they are considered essential workers, the workers must continue to do their jobs without pay during the shutdown. Since 1 October, numerous controllers have called in sick and now many report they are getting second jobs.","More than one in eight Americans depended on food stamps from SNAP, according to the US Department of Agriculture.

What’s Driving the November price Buzz?

Oil prices dropped to around $65 a barrel, raising hopes for a price cut.

Then global supply tensions and sanctions sent prices jumping again up by nearly 5% in one day.

What will become cheaper if prices drop in November?

Daily Commutes Get Cheaper: If you drive to work five days a week, your monthly fuel spend could drop by AED 15–40, depending on distance and car type. It may not feel like a jackpot but over a year, that’s a few brunches saved.

School Runs for Parents: Parents doing multiple school pick-ups and drop-offs will feel this the most. With fewer refills, you save not just dirhams… but also those “Why are we stopping for petrol again?” kid complaints.

Delivery & Ride-Hailing Services: Talabat, Deliveroo, Careem, Uber, RTA taxis, chauffeur services, all rely heavily on petrol costs. If fuel drops, operating costs drop and sometimes customers enjoy lower delivery fees or promo rides.

Business Transport & Logistics: Couriers, small business vans, carpenters, maintenance and AC technicians, all feel the heat when fuel rises. Cheaper petrol can mean:

Lower service charges Fewer fuel surcharges Better deals for customers

Weekends and Road Trips Become More Tempting: Lower fuel prices = guilt-free drives to Abu Dhabi, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah or Hatta. A small drop in fuel cost could shave off AED 5–15 per road trip enough to justify that karak stop.

Explained: Why Saudi Arabia rejected Lionel Messi’s offer to join the Pro League,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/explained-why-saudi-arabia-rejected-lionel-messis-offer-to-join-the-pro-league/articleshow/124983032.cms,"Inter Miami forward Lionel Messi. (AP Photo)

Why Saudi rejected Messi's offer





Socrates

“Messi’s team contacted me and expressed his desire to play in Saudi Arabia during the MLS break to stay active and prepare for the 2026 World Cup,” Hammad said. “I presented the offer to the minister of sports, but he rejected it, confirming that the Saudi league would not serve as a preparation platform for other tournaments.”

Beyond the desert dream





enduring competitiveness

temporary stage

“Messi set certain conditions and wanted to reunite with former Barcelona teammates,”

“while Ronaldo embraced the challenge of adapting to a new culture when he joined Al Nassr in 2022.”

Foot Mercato

“We brought the greatest player in history to our city, and now he’s chosen to stay, this strengthens our dream of building a lasting football legacy,”

A league with growing confidence

Ronaldo’s enduring bond with Saudi Arabia

“My family always supports my decisions, and we're happy here in Saudi Arabia. The people treat us in an incredibly warm way. That's why we want to live here and build our lives here.”

“I will stay two more years as a football player, but also for life because my contribution to this country is not only for football... I want to be part of the country's growth forever.”

“We don't need to prove anything to anyone. I'm here on the Red Sea because I love it. My family and I feel at peace here... I love the culture. I'd just say: come and see it for yourself.”

The message behind the rejection









For a league once defined by its hunger for global validation, the Saudi Pro League seems to have entered a new phase, one of self-assurance. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has spent vast sums luring superstars such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, and Karim Benzema, positioning itself as football’s bold new frontier.So when Lionel Messi ’s team came knocking, proposing a short-term deal for the Argentine icon to play in Saudi Arabia during the Major League Soccer (MLS) off-season, one might have expected the Kingdom to seize the chance with open arms.Instead, the offer was politely but firmly declined.The revelation came from Abdullah Hammad, CEO of the Mahd Sports Academy, who shared the details during thepodcast hosted by Thmanyah. He said Messi’s representatives had approached him during the Club World Cup, suggesting a temporary four-month stint while the MLS paused.The decision marked a subtle but significant statement, a league once reliant on marquee names to attract attention now choosing principle over spectacle.Hammad compared the offer to David Beckham’s brief loan spell at AC Milan during his MLS years but noted that Saudi Arabia’s vision differs. The Roshn Saudi League, he said, is building, not acting as afor global stars between seasons.The episode also revealed contrasting philosophies between Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.Hammad observed,Messi, who left Paris Saint-Germain in 2023, joined Inter Miami instead, where he recently extended his contract until 2028. According to, the deal is worth around €11 million annually, with bonuses pushing it close to €17 million, alongside major partnerships with Apple and Adidas, and a share of MLS streaming revenues.said Inter Miami co-owner David Beckham.The rejection of Messi’s offer underscores how far Saudi football has come. Once seen as a lavish detour for ageing stars, the Pro League is now asserting itself as a serious sporting ecosystem with its own ambitions, not merely a rest stop for players between continents.The country’s vast investment in football, coupled with plans to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup , reflects a long-term commitment to the sport’s growth. As Hammad put it, “The Saudi league would not serve as a preparation platform for other tournaments,” a line that captured both the maturity and the intent of a nation charting its own course.If Messi’s chapter in Saudi football never began, Ronaldo’s story continues to deepen. Earlier this year, after extending his Al Nassr contract until 2027, he declared Saudi Arabia his permanent home.In an interview shared via Al Nassr’s YouTube channel following the contract extension, Ronaldo said:He described the Kingdom as “a land of peace and safety,” adding:Saudi Arabia’s decision to turn down Messi wasn’t just about sport, it was about symbolism. The Kingdom’s football leadership appears determined to shift from buying fame to building legacy.If Messi’s approach had carried a sense of ambition and permanence rather than a brief off-season stint, the outcome might have been different. But as it stood, the offer didn’t align with the Pro League’s current direction, one that now prioritizes consolidation over spectacle.","Lionel Messi was offered a short-term deal to play in Saudi Arabia during the Major League Soccer (MLS) off-season.

According to the website of the temple, the project, conceived in 2018, will have a temple, the world's tallest Murugan statue, a Tamil cultural museum and a Tamil library.Stephen Horn, an independent journalist, reported that while the temple is still to be developed, the organization has been raising funds selling ""blessed"" sarees.""Hindus have acquired over a hundred acres for a massive temple complex in the rural town of Moncure, NC.

What is the Hindu-Christian row?



Dinesh D'Souza stirs controversy with his story of conversion







The Hindu-Christian row triggered by Vice President JD Vance refuses to die down as commentators unravel several aspects of what he said about his religion and his wife's religion, and then what he said in defence. Indian-origin Christian MAGA activist Dinesh D'Souza who supported JD Vance in his hope that Usha Vance one day embraces Christianity said Hindus should have no problem if Usha Vance converts to Christianity if Hinduism is truly inclusive.At a Turning Point USA event, JD Vance said he hopes to see his wife embrace his faith. “As I’ve told her, and as I’ve said publicly, and as I’ll say now in front of 10,000 of my closest friends: do I hope, eventually, that she is somehow moved by the same thing I was moved by in church? Yes. I honestly do wish that, because I believe in the Christian gospel and I hope that eventually my wife comes to see it the same way,"" JD Vance said.""But if she doesn’t, God says that everybody has free will, so that doesn’t cause a problem with me. That’s something that you work out with your friends, your family, the person you most love,"" JD Vance said.Two major criticisms followed: one, as he called his Hindu wife an agnostic and two, overall for undermining his wife's Hindu faith.JD Vance defended what he said and explained that Christians do want to share their faith with others and it is a completely normal thing. ""My Christian faith tells me the Gospel is true and is good for human beings. My wife--as I said at the TPUSA--is the most amazing blessing I have in my life. She herself encouraged me to re-engage with my faith many years ago. She is not a Christian and has no plans to convert, but like many people in an interfaith marriage--or any interfaith relationship--I hope she may one day see things as I do. Regardless, I'll continue to love and support her and talk to her about faith and life and everything else, because she's my wife,"" JD Vance said, repeating that he would love it if Usha Vance converts to Christianity.Mumbai-born MAGA activist Dinesh D'Souza, in his attempt to support JD Vance, created another controversy as he spoke about the conversion of his ancestors to Christianity. He said they must have been so oppressed because of being low cast that they chose to convert to Christianity. However, this account was proved to be false as he himself wrote in his book that his grandfather told him they were Brahmins.","Vice President JD Vance said he hopes to see his wife embrace his faith.

Audience reaction: laughter, shock, and discomfort

SNL’s long history of risky political comedy

Bowen Yang’s comeback as George Santos





It was a typical Saturday Night Live moment until it wasn’t. During this week’s Weekend Update, Colin Jost shocked viewers with a controversial joke about Donald Trump’s Halloween video, turning light political satire into one of the edgiest moments of the season. The segment featured a clip of President Trump and First Lady Melania walking out of the White House to a cover of Michael Jackson’s Thriller. Jost then quipped that it was “the perfect soundtrack to lure kids to a famous mansion,” drawing both laughter and audible groans from the audience.The viral moment began when SNL played a short clip from Trump’s recent Halloween event, where the former president used Thriller as background music while greeting guests outside the White House. What was intended as a playful, seasonal appearance became the setup for Jost’s risqué punchline, which referenced the late pop star’s long-standing child abuse allegations and Trump’s own controversial links to convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.The comment hit a nerve, quickly spreading across social media as viewers debated whether the joke was clever political commentary or an unnecessary low blow.Inside Studio 8H, the crowd’s response was mixed. Some viewers burst into laughter, while others groaned at the bluntness of Jost’s remark. The comedian smirked through the tension, seemingly unfazed by the divided reaction. Co-anchor Michael Che followed with his own attempt to top the joke, targeting Trump again with a line about his newly renovated White House bathroom during the ongoing government shutdown.Che later leaned into the dark humour further, joking about the New York City mayoral race and even invoking the “9/11” meme, a move that drew gasps and laughter in equal measure.For decades, Saturday Night Live has balanced satire and controversy, using Weekend Update as its sharpest political weapon. From Chevy Chase mocking Gerald Ford’s clumsiness in the 1970s to Alec Baldwin’s portrayal of Trump in recent years, SNL’s humour has often walked a fine line between wit and offence.Jost and Che, who have co-anchored Weekend Update since 2014, are known for their contrasting comedic styles: Jost’s sharp political commentary paired with Che’s darker, more provocative humour. Their chemistry often relies on pushing boundaries, and this week’s episode was no exception.The segment also featured SNL star Bowen Yang’s return as former Congressman George Santos, who recently had his prison sentence commuted by Trump. In his first appearance since the news, Yang’s Santos claimed prison had changed him and vowed to “only tell the truth.” The skit quickly spiralled into absurdity when Santos declared he was Black, a callback to his character’s history of outrageous lies.The sketch provided some levity after Jost’s edgy opener, reminding viewers of SNL’s knack for mixing political satire with over-the-top character work.","Saturday Night Live co-anchor Colin Jost shocked viewers with a controversial joke about Donald Trump’s Halloween video.

Trump In SHOCK As China First Praises Xi-Trump Meeting, Then Torches US’ ‘Brutal Blockade’ | Watch





In what appears to be a tectonic shift in American foreign policy and world order, US President Donald Trump has openly embraced China as a functional equal, heralding a new duopoly that jettisons Washington’s decade-plus view of Beijing as an existential threat, while leaving other powers like EU, Russia, India, and Japan as also-rans.Shortly after announcing “THE G2 WILL BE CONVENING SHORTLY!” ahead of his meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping last week, Trump doubled down on the formulation on Saturday, confirming that it is more than a tactical ploy. “My G2 meeting with President Xi of China was a great one for both of our countries. This meeting will lead to everlasting peace and success. God bless both China and the USA!” he posted on X.US defense secretary Pete Hegseth followed Trump’s post, saying he agreed with the President that the relationship between the US and China “has never been better.” After Trump’s meeting with Xi, Hegseth said he had an “equally positive meeting” with his counterpart, China’s minister of national defense Admiral Dong Jun in Malaysia, where incidentally he also signed a ten-year defense framework agreement with India’s defence minister Rajnath Singh.“The (Chinese) Admiral and I agree that peace, stability, and good relations are the best path for our two great and strong countries.As President Trump said, his historic “G2 meeting” set the tone for everlasting peace and success for the US and China. The Department of War will do the same — peace through strength, mutual respect, and positive relations. God bless both China and the USA!” Hegseth said in a post. A China-phobic Fox News host not so long ago, Hegseth said Dong and he agreed to set up military-to-military channels to deconflict and deescalate any problems that arise and they would have more meetings on the subject coming soon.The twin statements constituted an astonishing turnaround by an administration that held the view going back to the first Trump term that China was a hostile adversary that had “ripped off the US, “stolen” its technology, and needed to be challenged and contained if not defeated. As recently as May this year, CIA Deputy Director Michael Ellis explicitly stated, ""China is the existential threat to American security in a way that we really have never confronted before. "" Several MAGA lawmakers, notably Tom Cotton, who heads the Senate intelligence Committee, are anti-China hardliners who have gone to the extent of wanting to expel Chinese students from U.S universities for purported spying.The term “G-2” in relation to China was first coined during the Bush era by the economist C. Fred Bergsten. Also dubbed Chimerica by the historian Niall Ferguson), it proposed a hypothetical U.S.–China condominium to establish a ""systematically cooperative relationship"" aimed at addressing challenges like trade imbalances, climate change, and financial stability. The idea faded during the Obama era when China came to be seen as a belligerent power and Washington decided to support India’s rise as a counterweight to China. After Trump took office in 2017, China was subjected to bitter invective, including being blamed for the pandemic.The immediate reason for the turnaround, according to the Washington punditocracy, is the economic and diplomatic setback Trump faced after he launched a tariff war against China and found that Beijing held the aces. Despite his characteristic bravado and bluster in projecting his meeting with Xi as a win-win, almost across the board, the global commentariat is almost unanimous in concluding that Trump has made more concessions than China after unleashing a tariff war.A Financial Times report on the Trump-Xi summit ran with the headline “China emerges as a peer-rival” to the US. The Associated Press also concluded that Trump gained little in the talks, concluding, the “deal between the US and China is undoing damage from a self-inflicted trade war”.The immediate casualty of this bipolar framing is the rest of the world, including once-influential players such as the European Union, Russia, and India, which now find themselves relegated to secondary status in a US–China duopoly. In fact, Beijing’s official readout from the summit echoed the US sentiment: “China and the United States can jointly shoulder our responsibility as major countries and accomplish great things for the good of our two countries and the world. ”","US President Donald Trump has openly embraced China as a functional equal. The move jettisons Washington’s decade-plus view of Beijing as an existential threat.

Making climate relatable to students and teachers





That Jeff Grant signs off his emails with ""science on!"" says something about his commitment to the subject he teaches to Illinois high schoolers. Lately, that dedication has meant teaching a topic that makes some educators uncomfortable: the science of climate change.As an avid reader of scientific journals and books, and someone who spends time outdoors, he has a clear understanding of how rising temperatures are impacting the planet.""It's been something that for the last decade or so I've personally seen the effects of,"" he said, citing changes to the aquatic, forest and prairie ecosystems he grew up with. As a result, he has started to ""bake"" our changing climate into his classes.Yale University research suggests his approach would be widely welcomed. Three-quarters of adults in the US say they want schools to teach the causes, consequences and potential solutions to global warming.""Today's students are tomorrow's consumers, workers, and voters, and they're going to be faced with a series of challenges due to the disruptions caused by climate change,"" said Glenn Branch, deputy director of the non-profit National Center for Science Education (NCSE).And to deal with the challenges, he adds they'll need ""at least the basic understanding of climate change and its impacts and solutions.""The NCSE is one of several bodies working to ensure students across the country are given accurate climate information. But the decentralized nature of the US education system means curricula decisions are made at the level of the local school district. And with more than 13,000 of them across the nation, that equates to huge variation.Teachers in some states can look to what are known as the Next Generation Science Standards for guidelines on teaching climate change. But they are not obligatory and don't, Grant says, go far enough.""Not every state has that as part of their curriculum,"" he said, adding that even if they do, they don't offer lesson plans. ""It's up to the teachers or the school districts to develop those things or find things to help them with that presentation to kids.""And that is a problem, given that many educators never learned about climate change themselves. They are faced with huge volumes of potential resources to draw from, as well as competing interests from powerful groups trying to take their own agendas into classrooms.Branch says there have been ""systematic attempts to provide teachers with misinformation about climate change in the hopes they will relate it to their students,"" with material coming from ""very strongly ideologically motivated"" climate change denial think tanks, such as the Heartland Institute, as well as from the fossil fuel industry itself.Groups such as the Oklahoma Energy Resources Board (OERB), which is a privatized state agency, are active in a number of states across the US. And always with an educational arm. ""That material is less blatant,"" Branch said. ""But it can still have a distorting influence.""In the case of the OERB, the material includes a series of illustrated books that see protagonist ""Petro Pete"" praise human dependence on fossil fuels. The agency also provides workshops and curricula that give insights into the oil and gas industry. Educators who sign up are rewarded with professional development credits, stipends and class field trips.Melissa Lau, who teaches science in her native Oklahoma, says such offerings strike a chord with teachers who don't know enough about climate change to teach it.""That's very appealing in many ways. If a teacher is like, 'this seems legit…' I mean, there's not anything wrong with the science. It just gives the impression of 'look how good the fossil fuel industry is.' It minimizes the impact.""OERB did not respond to a DW request for further information.Lau says getting climate change into the classroom in Oklahoma is further complicated by the fact that farming — which is responsible for almost 12% of global emissions — and fossil fuels, are among the state's major industries.""A lot of times it is, 'you know, my dad is just trying to make a living, we're trying to feed our family, keep a roof over our heads.' It gets personal."" In Lau's case, having family members in both industries has helped her to address what she calls ""sticky"" topics with her students. ""I think that puts them at ease.""","Three-quarters of adults in the US say they want schools to teach the causes, consequences and potential solutions to global warming.

Pakistan Issues Naval Warning as Its War Games Overlap with India’s Military Drills





Pakistan, heavily dependent on the waters of the Indus basin, faces a acute risk of insufficient water storage after India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) earlier this year, according to the Ecological Threat Report 2025.The report, released by the Institute for Economics and Peace, a Sydney-based independent and non-profit think tank, says the suspension gives India the ability to control the westward flow of the Indus and its tributaries into Pakistan. The move came after India decided to put the treaty in abeyance as a punitive measure following the Pakistan-sponsored Pahalgam terror attack on April 22 this year.This marks a major setback for Pakistan, whose agriculture depends 80 per cent on the Indus River system. The report highlighted that Pakistan’s dams can currently hold only about 30 days of Indus flow, leaving the country highly vulnerable to disruptions.“Pakistan lacks sufficient storage to buffer variations,” the report warned, adding, “If India were truly to cut off or significantly reduce Indus flows, Pakistan’s densely populated plains would face severe water shortages, especially in winter and dry seasons.Indeed, about 80 per cent of Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture depends on Indus basin rivers.”While India’s infrastructure limits its ability to completely stop river flows, even small disruptions could have ""disastrous"" short-term effects on Pakistan’s farm sector.In May, India carried out “reservoir flushing” operations at the Salal and Baglihar dams on the Chenab River without notifying Pakistan. This process, used to remove silt by draining reservoirs, had been restricted under the treaty due to the risk of sudden downstream changes.The impact was immediate: parts of the Chenab River in Pakistan’s Punjab ran dry for several days when India shut the dam gates and later released sediment-filled torrents upon reopening them.The Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960 and mediated by the World Bank, has long acted as a key tool for water-sharing and conflict resolution between the two countries. It governs the use of the Indus River and its six major tributaries -- five on the left bank and one on the right.","India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) earlier this year.

‘Pak Is Infuriated With…’: MEA Slams Pakistan Over Border Tensions With Afghanistan





Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) second-in-command Amjad, a key figure in the banned militant group, was killed along with three other militants when security forces foiled an infiltration attempt from Afghanistan into Pakistan, the army said on Thursday.According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), cited by PTI, the militants tried to cross the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Bajaur district on Wednesday night when their movement was detected.“The troops effectively engaged and thwarted the militants' attempt to infiltrate,” the statement said, adding that four militants, including high-value target Amjad alias Mazahim, were “sent to hell.”Amjad, who served as deputy to TTP chief Noor Wali and headed the group’s Rehbari Shura, was among Pakistan’s most wanted militants, carrying a bounty of Rs five million. The ISPR said he was “actively involved in perpetuating numerous terrorist activities inside Pakistan while residing in Afghanistan.”The army also urged the interim Afghan government to take “concrete measures to ensure that Afghan soil is not used by militants to perpetrate terrorism against Pakistan.”Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded the security forces for eliminating the TTP commander and his aides. Prime Minister Shehbaz said the security forces, through their professional expertise, eliminated the highly wanted TTP commander Amjad and thwarted “the nefarious designs of the enemies of Pakistan's sovereignty.” He added, “We will continue to defeat the elements that harm innocent people. ”The operation in Bajaur came a day after six Pakistani soldiers, including a captain, were martyred during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district, where seven terrorists were also gunned down.Formed in 2007 as an umbrella organisation of several militant outfits, the TTP seeks to impose its strict version of Islam across Pakistan. The group, believed to have close ties with al-Qaeda, has claimed responsibility for numerous deadly attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad and the 2009 assault on army headquarters.","Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) second-in-command Amjad, a key figure in the banned militant group, was killed along with three other militants.

'Pakistan’s patience has run its course'



Growing tensions on the border







Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with the United States that allows the use of drones within its territory, TOLOnews reported, citing Afghan and diplomatic sources. The acknowledgment, made during the latest round of Pakistan-Afghanistan peace talks in Turkey.According to TOLOnews, the Pakistani delegation said it “cannot break” the agreement with Washington that authorises drone operations. Afghan negotiators, in response, demanded written guarantees that Pakistan would not allow US drones to use its airspace or strike Afghan territory. Sources familiar with the talks, cited by TOLOnews said Pakistan’s delegation initially agreed to these conditions but later reversed its position after receiving instructions from Islamabad, saying it had “no control over US drones and could not ensure action against ISIS. ” Qatari and Turkish mediators were reportedly taken aback by the sudden shift in stance.The Afghan side reiterated that the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) issue was Pakistan’s own internal problem. “The Islamic Emirate has repeatedly emphasised, and again reaffirmed, that insecurity in Pakistan is a domestic matter,” TOLOnews quoted its delegation as saying, adding that Afghanistan remains committed to ensuring no group uses its soil to harm other nations.The disclosure came as four days of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement. Pakistan’s information minister Attaullah Tarar said the dialogue “failed to bring about any workable solution,” blaming Kabul for refusing to act against militants responsible for cross-border attacks. “Pakistan’s patience has run its course,” Tarar said, adding that Islamabad “would continue to take all possible measures necessary to protect our people from terrorism. ”Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif issued a strong warning to the Taliban regime, vowing that Islamabad could “strike deep into Afghanistan” if further attacks occurred. “If their territory is used and they violate ours, we will retaliate — we surely will,” Asif told reporters. In a separate post on X, he cautioned Kabul against testing Pakistan’s “resolve and capabilities at its own peril and doom.”The breakdown in talks follows weeks of escalating border clashes that left dozens dead. Pakistan’s military earlier this month struck what it described as TTP hideouts inside Afghanistan, prompting retaliatory attacks that killed Pakistani soldiers. Though a ceasefire brokered by Qatar on 19 October remains technically in effect, all major crossings between the two countries remain closed, with hundreds of trucks stranded.Islamabad insists that the Afghan Taliban continues to shelter militants who launch attacks in Pakistan, a charge Kabul denies. The UN has expressed concern over the failed negotiations, urging both sides to avoid renewed fighting.","Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with the United States that allows the use of drones within its territory, TOLOnews reported.

Escalation Fears Mount As Pakistan-Afghanistan Talks End Without Conclusion In Turkey

Operation Sindoor







Days after Jaish-e-Mohammed announced the formation of its first-ever women's wing, 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat', the JeM's chief Masood Azhar has released a 21-minute audio message from group's Bahawalpur headquarters, Markaz Usman o Ali, outlining a detailed plan for training, indoctrinating, and deploying women under the new unit, as local media reported.According to media reports, in the audio, Azhar explains how women will be recruited, trained, and integrated into his long-term ""global jihad"" mission, mirroring the structure of JeM's long-running male training programme.Azhar declares that just as men undergo the 15-day ""Daura-e-Tarbiat"" course, women joining 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat' will be trained through an induction course named ""Daura-e-Taskiya"", conducted at Markaz Usman o Ali in Bahawalpur.For the past two decades, JeM's ""Daura-e-Tarbiat"" has served as the primary indoctrination stage for male recruits, convincing them that jihad against India guarantees paradise. Azhar now intends to extend the same ideological training to women.In his speech, the wanted terrorist promises that any woman who joins Jamaat-ul-Mominaat “will go straight to paradise from her grave after death.”He added that women completing the first course will advance to a second stage, ""Daura-Ayat-ul-Nisah,"" which will teach how Islamic texts ""instruct women to conduct jihad.""Justifying the formation of a female brigade, most-wanted terrorist Azhar claimed, ""The enemies of Jaish have put Hindu women into the army and set up female journalists against us,"" declaring that he is ""mobilising his women to compete and fight against them.""He asserts that JeM’s male Mujahids will work alongside this new female unit, saying the women’s brigade will ""spread Islam across the world.""Azhar also announces that Jamaat-ul-Mominaat branches will be opened in every district of Pakistan , each headed by a District Muntazima responsible for recruiting local women. He lays down strict communication rules, stating, ""Women joining the brigade must not speak to any unrelated men through phone or messenger, except their husbands or immediate family members.""According to IANS, the women’s wing will be led by Sadiya Azhar, sister of Masood Azhar. Her husband, Yusuf Azhar, was killed during Operation Sindoor on May 7, when Indian forces targeted JeM’s previous base, Markaz Subhanallah.""His other sister Samaira Azhar, and Afeera Farooq, widow of Pulwama attacker Umar Farooq, are also part of the leadership,"" sources confirmed, adding that “they are tasked with conducting daily online sessions to motivate and recruit women.”JeM has since verified these details in a new poster naming Umme Masood (real name Samaira Azhar) as the instructor for online classes, conducted five days a week from October 25.Azhar further reveals that Jamaat-ul-Mominaat includes “4–5 women whose male relatives were killed in encounters with the Indian Army,” who will inspire new recruits under a campaign called “Shoba-e-Dawat.”He urges women cadres to read his book “Ae Musalman Behna” (O Muslim Sister) as part of their indoctrination.It is significant that 14 members of Masood Azhar’s family were killed in India’s Operation Sindoor, including Yousuf Azhar, Jameel Ahmed, Hamza Jameel, and Huzaifa Azhar. Azhar now claims that his elder sister Hawa Bibi also died in the same strike.In the audio, an emotional Azhar recounts that he had conceptualised the idea of a women’s brigade with his sister before her death.In retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians, India launched a major military operation targeting Pakistan-based terror infrastructure. The counterterror action, named Operation Sindoor, struck nine key terror hubs across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The strikes destroyed major bases of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), including their headquarters in Bahawalpur and Muridke, which were reduced to rubble by precision airstrikes carried out by the Indian armed forces.In response, Pakistan attempted retaliation by launching multiple drones and missiles towards Indian territory the following night. However, India’s advanced air defence systems swiftly intercepted and neutralised the incoming threats, preventing any casualties or damage.India then answered this provocation with targeted strikes on crucial Pakistani airbases, including the strategically significant Nur Khan Airbase and Rahim Yar Khan Airbase.The heightened military tensions between the two neighbours were eventually de-escalated following a mutual peace agreement, initiated by Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO).Since then, these outfits have reportedly relocated to Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) region to avoid further strikes. Their leaders have been issuing propaganda messages and appeals for funds to rebuild their networks.Media sources also reveal that Masood Azhar has been aggressively collecting donations. During his September 27 address at Markaz Usman o Ali, he publicly appealed for financial support.JeM is now collecting a donation of 500 PKR from every woman enrolling in the new course and requiring them to fill out online registration forms.Earlier, on October 8, Masood Azhar formally announced the formation of Jamaat-ul-Mominaat, followed by an event titled “Dukhtaran-e-Islam” in Rawalakot, PoK, on October 19, aimed at drawing women into the organisation.While groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, Hamas, and LTTE have long deployed women in combat and suicide missions, organisations such as JeM, LeT, and Hizbul Mujahideen had largely avoided such practices -- until now. Security agencies believe JeM’s latest move signals its intent to train and deploy female suicide bombers in future terror operations.","Jaish-e-Mohammed announces formation of women's wing, 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat' JeM's chief Masood Azhar releases 21-minute audio message from group's Bahawalpur headquarters, Markaz Usman o Ali.

A 48-hour ceasefire collapsed before a new truce was reached on October 19 in Doha, with Qatar and Turkey mediating.

Pakistan repeats old claims





Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday warned Afghanistan that if the attack on Islamabad continues, then they will give a 50 times stronger response, and accused Kabul of acting as a puppet for India.The remarks came after peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul dramatically collapsed.Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, Asif Kabul, using Pakistan’s familiar playbook of deflection, claimed that Kabul was merely a puppet in India’s hands.He said “I would compliment their delegation, but the people in Kabul pulling the strings and staging the puppet show are being controlled by Delhi.""""India is compensating for its defeat on their western border through Kabul. The junta there (in Afghanistan) has elements that have visited India and visited their temples,"" Asif claimed. ""India wants to engage in a low-intensity war with Pakistan. To achieve this, they are using Kabul,"" he added.When asked to comment on threats by Afghanistan that they would “attack Islamabad” in the event of further hostilities, Asif replied: “If Afghanistan even looks at Islamabad, we will gouge their eyes out.“They can employ the use of terrorists and they already are. Over the past four years, they have been using terrorists,” he added.“There should be no doubt that Kabul is responsible for the terrorism in Pakistan. Kabul is a tool for Delhi. If they want to, God forbid, attack Islamabad, we will give a befitting response. A response 50 times stronger,” the defence minister said.Kabul had previously rejected Islamabad’s accusations as unfounded.Still, the Pakistani minister praised the Afghan negotiators for their cooperation — even as he directed sharp criticism at the Kabul leadership.This is not the first time. Earlier also, Pakistan claimed India was behind a recent assault in Afghanistan. Ministry of external affairs dismissed Pakistan’s accusations that India was behind a recent assault in Afghanistan, saying Islamabad’s record of harbouring terrorism was well knownAt the weekly press briefing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “Three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbours for its own internal failures. Three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories.""The remarks followed the collapse of the latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Turkey. According to Afghan and Pakistani sources cited by Reuters, both sides had earlier agreed to a ceasefire on October 19 in Doha but failed to make progress in Istanbul.Each country blamed the other for the stalemate. The discussions, mediated by Turkey and Qatar, concluded on Monday without any breakthrough.","Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif warned Afghanistan that if the attack on Islamabad continues, then they will give a 50 times stronger response.

Afghanistan Stops Border Operations Against Pakistan Following Mediation By Gulf Countries





Negotiations between Afghanistan and Pakistan to secure a lasting truce after their bloodiest clashes in years were deadlocked Tuesday, with a Pakistani security source saying a ""last-ditch effort"" was under way. Dozens were killed on both sides of the border in the worst such violence since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.The one-time allies have had frosty relations since then, with the Taliban govt denying accusations from Islamabad that it harbours militant groups which stage attacks in Pakistan.

Twin Trouble For Pak! After India, Afghanistan May Restrict River Water Supply To Pakistan

Pak, Afghan play the blame game







Pakistan, Afghanistan peace talks in Turkey have hit an impasse with both the nations pointing fingers at each other for failure to reach a deal, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday. Istanbul has been consistent in its efforts to end the deadlock, however, there has been no immediate confirmations whether a fourth day of talks would be held.The Istanbul talks form a key element of a wider diplomatic effort to defuse months of rising friction between Islamabad and Kabul over cross-border militancy and alleged safe havens, long-standing flashpoints that have only intensified since the Taliban reclaimed power in Afghanistan four years ago.There has been no official statement about the status of the talks.Pakistan and Afghanistan have blamed each other for the deadlock, as efforts to build on last month’s ceasefire remain stalled. Both sides accused the other of lacking seriousness in talks aimed at easing cross-border tensions that recently erupted into deadly clashes.Pakistani security officials involved in the negotiations said Kabul was refusing to accept what Islamabad considers “logical and legitimate” demands -- assurances that Afghan soil would not be used for attacks in Pakistan, according to AP.They argued that the Taliban delegation had been reluctant to commit to concrete guarantees and repeatedly sought guidance from Kabul before making decisions.The Afghan side, however, countered those claims. While Kabul did not immediately issue a formal response, state-run broadcaster RTA asserted that Afghanistan has “made every effort to hold constructive talks,” but that “the Pakistani side does not seem to have this intention.” The accusation mirrors Pakistan’s criticism and underscores a widening diplomatic rift.Despite the stalemate, Turkish officials and other international mediators have been working to preserve the ceasefire brokered in Doha on October 19, after fighting along the border left dozens of soldiers, militants and civilians dead on both sides.","Pakistan and Afghanistan have blamed each other for the deadlock, as efforts to build on last month’s ceasefire remain stalled.

Should India Engage With Taliban Amid Pak-Afghan Truce? Ex-Diplomat Explains| India Connect





The latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan has reportedly hit a stalemate, with Islamabad accusing the Afghan Taliban of taking an “illogical and detached” position on key security issues, including cooperation against cross-border militancy, Geo News reported.The second phase of discussions, held in Istanbul on Saturday, came a week after the initial negotiations in Doha following an October 16 ceasefire that ended the deadliest border clashes between the two sides since the Taliban seized power in 2021.Citing official sources, Geo News said Pakistan presented “clear, evidence-based and solution-oriented” demands urging Kabul to act against militant groups operating from Afghan soil. However, the Taliban delegation allegedly remained “unwilling to cooperate or acknowledge ground realities.”The talks in Istanbul, mediated by Turkey’s intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin, focused on creating a joint monitoring mechanism to curb militant movement across the border and facilitate smoother trade. Radio Pakistan reported that both sides also discussed the possibility of a long-term political framework to stabilise relations.According to reports, Turkey is attempting to bridge the gap by helping the Taliban delegation understand the seriousness of Pakistan’s security concerns. Islamabad has reportedly conveyed its final position, warning that any tolerance or shelter for militants targeting its territory “will not be acceptable.”Sources told Geo News that progress in the talks now hinges entirely on the Taliban’s attitude and readiness to cooperate in good faith. Pakistani officials described the Taliban’s responses during the exchanges as “illogical and detached from ground realities,” further deepening doubts about Kabul’s sincerity.During the discussions, Pakistan pressed the Taliban regime to dismantle terrorist networks and prevent militant infiltration. Kabul’s delegation submitted a written response to Islamabad’s proposals late Sunday night.The ongoing negotiations mark the second round of peace efforts, following the Doha talks where both sides agreed to a ceasefire mediated by Qatar and Turkey after intense cross-border clashes.The conflict saw multiple days of heavy clashes across the border of two neighbours. Pakistani forces claimed they killed over 200 Taliban fighters, while 23 soldiers lost their lives, according to media reports. Following the violence, key border crossings were shut, citing security concerns.Meanwhile, Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif has warned of an “all-out war” if the peace efforts fail.","The latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan has reportedly hit a stalemate.

The Maldives began Saturday a generational smoking ban on anyone born after January 2007, becoming the only nation with such a prohibition, the Health Ministry said.The move, initiated by President Mohamed Muizzu earlier this year, came into effect on November 1 and will “protect public health and promote a tobacco-free generation”, the ministry said, as per AP.“Under the new provision, individuals born on or after January 1-2007 are prohibited from purchasing, using, or being sold tobacco products within the Maldives,” it added.“The ban applies to all forms of tobacco, and retailers are required to verify age prior to sale.” It also applies to visitors to the nation of 1,191 tiny coral islets scattered some 800 kilometres (500 miles) across the equator and known for its luxury tourism.The ministry said it also maintains a comprehensive ban on the import, sale, distribution, possession, and use of electronic cigarettes and vaping products, applicable to all individuals regardless of age.Selling tobacco products to an underage person carries a penalty of 50,000 rufiyaa ($3,200), while using vape devices carries a fine of 5,000 rufiyaa ($320).A similar generational ban proposed in Britain is still going through the legislative process, while New Zealand — the first country to enact such a law against smoking — repealed it in November 2023, less than a year after it was introduced.","The Maldives began Saturday a generational smoking ban on anyone born after January 2007.

She claimed that remaining in Bangladesh, which was battling widespread protests against Hasina, would have endangered her life and the ""safety of those around her"".“Staying would not only have put my life in danger, but also the lives of those around me,"" she said, speaking in an exclusive interview with The Independent.Despite fleeing the country and the Awami League being banned in Bangladesh, she maintains that she is still committed to “restoring democracy” in the country.Hasina described the August protests in Bangladesh as a “violent insurrection.”“As a leader, I ultimately take leadership responsibility, but the claim that I ordered or wished for the security forces to open fire on the crowds is simply wrong,"" she said.She added that she blames the high number of casualties on “breakdowns in discipline among security forces on the ground.” Hasina said her government had launched an independent inquiry into the initial killings, which was later shut down by the interim administration that replaced her.She said that she would “neither be surprised nor intimidated” if Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) sentenced her to death, calling the proceedings “a sham trial” motivated by political revenge.“The ICT is a sham court presided over by an unelected government consisting of my political opponents. Many of those opponents will stop at nothing to get rid of me,"" Hasina said, as cited by The Independent.What began last July as a movement by university students demanding the removal of job quotas for relatives of independence war veterans soon grew into a nationwide uprising in Bangladesh, which ultimately led to Hasina fleeing the country.Hasina disputed the widely reported death toll from the student-led protests, saying that “the 1,400 figure is useful to the ICT for propaganda purposes but is probably inflated.”Meanwhile, the interim government's chief prosecutor, Tajul Islam, has called Hasina the “mastermind and principal architect” behind the alleged crimes against humanity during the student-led uprising.","Ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said she fled the country on August 5 last year “out of necessity” She claimed that remaining in Bangladesh, which was battling widespread protests against Hasina, would have endangered her life and the ""safety of those around her"" Hasina described the August protests in Bangladesh as a “violent insurrection”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124988908,imgsize-637906,width-400,resizemode-4/sheikh-hasina-ani.jpg"

Afghanistan’s interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani has issued a stern warning to Pakistan, saying Kabul’s patience should not be mistaken for weakness as both sides agreed to maintain a fragile ceasefire after days of failed negotiations.Haqqani warned that if Afghanistan’s patience was tested again, the country would deliver a “crushing” response. “Defending our territory is among our priorities,” he said. “Yet despite all this, the path of understanding remains open. But if someone commits aggression, we have fought the emperors of the world and it is no difficulty for us to defend our territory,” the interior minister said as quoted by TOLOnews.Haqqani added that Afghanistan may lack long-range missiles or heavy weapons but has “strong resolve and determination in the battle against aggression.” Without naming Pakistan, he accused some nations of violating the sovereignty of others “to preserve their interests.” “Afghans have proved themselves in the battlefield,” he warned. “If our patience is tested again, our response will be very crushing,” he said, as per TOLOnews.His comments came soon after Turkey announced that Pakistan and Afghanistan had agreed to uphold a ceasefire following days of tense talks in Istanbul, mediated by Turkey and Qatar. The ceasefire deal, confirmed on Thursday, aims to prevent further border clashes that have recently left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead.

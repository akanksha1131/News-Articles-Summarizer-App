Elon Musk’s Starship under pressure: Previous failures haunt SpaceX; Sunday launch could decide future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musks-starship-under-pressure-previous-failures-haunt-spacex-sunday-launch-could-decide-future/articleshow/123479545.cms,"Image courtesy: AP





After a series of mishaps that have led some onlookers to doubt its feasibility, Elon Musk 's SpaceX is preparing for the next test of its Starship megarocket on Sunday. The most potent launch vehicle in the world is scheduled to make its tenth flight from the company's Starbase in southern Texas at 6.30 pm local time (5 am IST on Monday), according to an AFP report.Before the upper stage splashes down in the Indian Ocean, it will fly halfway around the world and undergo a series of tests. SpaceX will not attempt to use the enormous ""chopstick"" arms of the launch tower to snag the rocket stage, unlike previous attempts.Musk wants to colonize Mars, and Nasa is hoping that a modified version of the Starship will be used as the Artemis lunar lander to bring Americans back to the moon.However, the upper stage of all three test flights in 2025 has exploded, once after reaching space and twice in fiery cascades over Caribbean islands. During a ""static fire"" test in June, another upper stage detonated on the ground.SpaceX has a strong global lead in launches thanks to its Falcon rocket family, and its impressive track record has long been attributed to its ""fail fast, learn fast"" philosophy.=However, the company's ability to replicate that achievement with the largest and most potent rocket in history has been called into question by the Starship mishaps.""The latest setbacks were starting to erode SpaceX's golden reputation"", Dallas Kasaboski, a space analyst for consulting firm Analysys Mason, told AFP.""I think there is a lot of pressure on this mission,"" he stated. ""We've had so many tests and it hasn't proven itself reliable -- the successes have not exceeded the failures.""On his Substack newsletter, Will Lockett, a former engineer who is now a critic, went further, claiming that the absence of rigorous payload tests demonstrated ""the concept of Starship is fundamentally flawed.""According to him, ""SpaceX is building Starships that are lighter in an attempt to increase payload to usable levels but is therefore making them much weaker than they should be""—which is why recent testing has revealed structural flaws.The scrutiny has increased as a result of headlines like ""Is Elon Musk's Starship doomed?"" in New York Magazine.With plans to eventually abandon the company's current generation of rockets and spacecraft in favor of the new system, Musk has bet the company's future on Starship.Even if the tenth test is successful, there are still significant technological obstacles to overcome, such as demonstrating that the system can refill super-cooled propellant in orbit, which is a requirement for deep-space missions, and making it completely and quickly reusable at a reasonable cost.Nevertheless, SpaceX is moving forward, expanding the number of launches in spite of environmental organizations' concerns about the ecological effects, and constructing additional facilities in Florida, such as launch and landing pads at Kennedy Space Center.","SpaceX is preparing for the next test of its Starship megarocket on Sunday.

Mingus Lucien Reedus, 25, son of actor Norman Reedus and supermodel Helena Christensen , was arrested in Manhattan on Saturday morning over an alleged assault, the New York Post reported.Reedus allegedly punched a 33-year-old woman to wake her up before choking her and slamming her to the ground inside a Chelsea apartment, police sources toldThe incident began when Reedus himself dialed 911 around 8:40 am (local time), reporting that a woman at the West 16th Street apartment was taking pills and threatening suicide. Responding officers were told by the woman that Reedus had attacked her. She was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition, while Reedus was taken into custody.The 25-year-old, wearing green shorts, a black t-shirt and handcuffs, was photographed being led out by officers around 9:25 am. He has been charged with assault in the third degree and criminal obstruction of breathing, NYPD said.Reedus was then escorted out of the 10th Precinct into a police vehicle.Asked by reporters why he had called police, he replied, “I didn’t.” Reedus later called it “a misunderstanding.” A woman identifying herself as his girlfriend also described the episode as “a big misunderstanding.”This is not Reedus’ first brush with the law. In 2022, he accepted a plea deal over a 2021 incident at the San Gennaro Festival in Little Italy, where he allegedly punched a woman in the face.","Mingus Lucien Reedus, 25, son of actor Norman Reedus and supermodel Helena Christensen, was arrested in Manhattan on Saturday morning over an alleged assault.

Maryland deportation case: Wrongfully deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia released from jail; future still uncertain as DHS vows action,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maryland-deportation-case-wrongfully-deported-kilmar-abrego-garcia-released-from-jail-deportation-still-possible-as-dhs-vows-action/articleshow/123463820.cms,"Kilmar Abrego Garcia (center) leaves the Putnam County Jail in Cookeville, Tennessee.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national whose wrongful deportation earlier this year became a flashpoint in US President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, was released Friday from a Tennessee jail to rejoin his family in Maryland while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges.Abrego Garcia, 30, was mistakenly deported in March despite a 2019 immigration court ruling that barred his return to El Salvador because of a “well-founded fear” of gang violence.He was sent to a notorious maximum-security prison before being flown back to the US in June under a court order. Within days of his return, he was arrested and charged with transporting undocumented migrants.On Friday, Abrego Garcia walked out of the Putnam County jail dressed in jeans and a white button-down short-sleeved shirt alongside his lawyer, Rascoe Dean. He did not speak to reporters and departed swiftly in a waiting SUV, as per news agency AP.His release order requires him to travel directly to Maryland, where he will live under home detention with his brother designated as custodian, and submit to electronic monitoring. He’ll be able to leave home only for approved activities.Defense attorney Sean Hecker said his client had been “unlawfully arrested and deported, and then imprisoned, all because of the government’s vindictive attack on a man who had the courage to fight back”, according to news agency AFP.Another attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, noted that Abrego Garcia had been reunited with his family for the first time since March but warned he was “far from safe,” citing the risk of deportation to a third country.The department of homeland security has signalled plans to remove him to an unnamed nation, with options such as Uganda, Mexico, or South Sudan under discussion, news agency Reuters reported. A Maryland judge has ordered that his lawyers be given 72 hours’ notice before any such deportation so they can challenge it.Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges linked to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop where officers found nine passengers in his car but released him with only a warning. His trial is set for January 2027.Trump administration officials have strongly condemned his release. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem branded him a “monster” and vowed, “We will not stop fighting till this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country”.Deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson also described him as a “criminal illegal alien” and MS-13 member, calling his release an “insult to his victims”.Despite the political firestorm, Abrego Garcia remains under court protection. Maryland Governor Wes Moore said the case underscored the principle that “every person is afforded their right to due process” in the US.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 30, was mistakenly deported in March despite a 2019 immigration court ruling that barred his return to El Salvador.

(Picture credit: AP)





Lyle Menendez, one of the two brothers convicted of murdering their wealthy parents in Beverly Hills more than three decades ago, has been denied parole by a California state panel.The 57-year-old, who uses his middle name Joseph, appeared by video from a San Diego prison on Friday for his first parole hearing since being resentenced earlier this year.After an 11-hour closed-door session, commissioners decided he must remain behind bars for at least three more years, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.“Joseph (Lyle) Menendez was denied parole for three years at his initial suitability hearing today,” the department said in a statement, as cited by news agency AFP.The ruling follows Thursday’s decision in the case of his younger brother, Erik, 54, whose parole was also rejected.The siblings, convicted in 1996 of killing Jose and Kitty Menendez with shotguns in 1989, were originally sentenced to life without parole. A Los Angeles judge reduced those terms in May to 50 years to life, making them eligible for release as they were under 26 at the time of the crime, as per news agency AP.The Menendez case first shocked America in 1989, when Lyle, then 21, and Erik, 18, killed their parents inside their Beverly Hills mansion. They initially told investigators it was linked to their father’s business or the Mafia, but two months later Erik confessed to a psychologist that he and his brother were responsible.The brothers were arrested in 1990 and later charged with first-degree murder. Prosecutors said the motive was greed, while the defence argued they acted after years of sexual and emotional abuse, as per AP.Their first trials in the early 1990s ended with hung juries, but in 1995 they were convicted of murder, along with lying in wait and special circumstances allegations. They were sentenced the following year to life without parole. For decades, appeals were denied by state and federal courts.While in prison, the brothers engaged in education, led self-help classes, and even launched a prison beautification project inspired by Norway’s rehabilitation model, according to AP. Their case has also drawn renewed public attention through true-crime shows, including Netflix’s nine-episode series Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story.As per The New York Times, Friday’s hearing was Lyle’s first chance at release, though parole boards rarely grant freedom at an initial review. Both brothers will be eligible for new hearings in three years but could also pursue clemency from California Governor Gavin Newsom or continue legal challenges.According to AP, the parole board weighs whether inmates pose an “unreasonable risk of danger to society” if freed, considering their criminal history, motivation, remorse, behaviour in prison and reentry plans.Nearly all of the Menendez family members have backed their release; their uncle Milton Andersen, one of the few who opposed it, died earlier this year.Though formally denied parole for three years, the brothers may be reviewed sooner, with administrative reconsideration possible within a year and another hearing in as little as 18 months.They also still have a pending habeas corpus petition, filed in May 2023, that seeks to reopen their convictions based on new evidence supporting their claims of sexual abuse by their father.","Lyle Menendez, 57, and his brother Erik, 54, were convicted of murdering their parents in Beverly Hills in 1989.

No client list but Epstein might not have committed suicide







In a major curtain-down moment for the ongoing Epstein case, the Justice Department released the full transcripts of the audio of Ghislaine Maxwell 's interview in which Maxwell said Epstein never had any client list ever and President Donald Trump did not do anything inappropriate with anybody when he was friends with pedophile Epstein.Maxwell is the only key person in the Epstein case and Maxwell was the disgraced financer's aide, girlfriend and was a party in many cases of sexual exploitation. After the DOJ and the FBI closed the Epstein case and said there was no foul play in Epstein's death, Maxwell who is serving her sentence claimed that her side of the story was never heard.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche sat down with Maxwell in a federal prison in Tallahassee, where she was being held until recently. The terms of the interview granted her limited immunity from further prosecution – unless she told lies.Authorities published hundreds of pages of transcripts as well as audio recordings of the interview on the DOJ website.Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in 2019. Conspiracy theorists love to believe that he was murdered in his cell because he was blackmailing people that he would disclose their names and their association with his child sex racket. With his death, the two issues remained mysteries: how he died and who are named on Epstein's list. After DOJ and FBI, Maxwell also claimed that Epstein did not maintain a client list. But Maxwell reiterated her past statements that she does not believe Epstein killed himself. She also said Epstein told her he had a heart condition that prevented him from having normal sexual intercourse.","Ghislaine Maxwell was the disgraced financer's aide, girlfriend and was a party in many cases of sexual exploitation.

Watch Colombia Leader Shot During Public Address; Shock Assassination Bid On Presidential Hopeful





Colombia endured one of its bloodiest days in recent months on Thursday after a police helicopter was shot down in Antioquia and a car bomb ripped through the city of Cali, killing at least 13 people and injuring dozens more.President Gustavo Petro said on X that eight police officers died when their helicopter came under attack during an operation to eradicate coca crops, the raw material used to produce cocaine.According to news agency AP, the aircraft was hit by a drone and caught fire before crashing, as per defence minister Pedro Sánchez. Antioquia Governor Andrés Julián confirmed the strike occurred as the helicopter flew over coca fields.Authorities said several others were injured in the incident, though their conditions were not immediately released.Videos circulating on social media showed the helicopter engulfed in black smoke as it crashed to the ground.Just hours later, a vehicle packed with explosives detonated outside a military aviation school in Cali, Colombia’s third-largest city. Officials confirmed five people were killed and more than 30 were wounded.Cali’s mayor, Alejandro Eder, said 36 were injured and announced a temporary ban on large trucks entering the city, along with a $10,000 reward for information.“There were fatalities among people passing by on the avenue,” eyewitness Alexis Atizabal was quoted as saying by AFP, describing widespread destruction across nearby homes and schools.Petro initially suggested the powerful Gulf Clan drug cartel was behind the helicopter attack, saying it could have been retaliation for a cocaine seizure. However, he later blamed dissident factions of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), particularly the Central General Staff (EMC) led by warlord Iván Mordisco.He vowed to designate EMC, Segunda Marquetalia and the Clan del Golfo as terrorist organisations.Bloomberg reported Petro warning that EMC fighters carried out both the helicopter strike and the Cali bombing. The president, who came to power in 2022 promising “total peace” through dialogue with armed groups, has faced criticism that his softer approach has emboldened guerrillas and cartels.According to the United Nations, coca cultivation in Colombia hit a record 253,000 hectares in 2023. Experts say the rise in production, along with escalating violence, signals that armed groups are regaining power despite the 2016 peace deal with FARC.Neighbouring communities fear a return to the dark days of the 1980s and 1990s, when cartel bombings and political killings were common.“Our country is going through the darkest, saddest, and most painful days,” said María Claudia Tarazona, widow of assassinated presidential candidate Miguel Uribe, during his funeral earlier this month, reported AFP.","Eight police officers killed when helicopter came under attack during operation to eradicate coca crops.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired Lt General Jeffrey Kruse as head of the US defense intelligence agency (DIA), following President Donald Trump’s dissatisfaction with the agency’s preliminary assessment of US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, according to AP and other media reports.Kruse’s firing, first reported by The Washington Post, comes weeks after the agency’s initial intelligence estimate - which suggested Iran’s nuclear program had only been delayed by a few months - was leaked to the media. This contradicted President Trump’s public claim that the Iranian programme had been “completely and fully obliterated.”“You want to call it destroyed, you want to call it defeated, you want to call it obliterated - choose your word. This was an historically successful attack,” Hegseth said in a June press conference, defending the operation but without providing evidence.According to officials familiar with the matter, the decision was not publicly explained and comes amid a broader shake-up in the US military and intelligence leadership. Trump has previously removed officials whose reports or data contradict his public stance, including those in charge of jobs data and public health information.Kruse’s dismissal follows other senior-level exits, including air force general CQ Brown Jr, general Tim Haugh (NSA chief), and several senior legal officials across military branches. The office of the director of national intelligence has also announced staff and budget cuts this week.Pentagon officials have not released a formal statement on the rationale behind Kruse’s removal.

President Donald Trump handed over a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Alaska meeting, which was seen as soft power at the play at its best. It was a peace letter in which Melani told Putin ""it is time"" to protect children and future generations around the globe.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy came to Washington with a letter from Ukraine's First Lady for Melania -- in a similar move.“I have faith that the important sensitivity you have shown for the 648 Ukrainian children... will be extended to Gaza as well,” Emine Erdogan wrote in the letter dated Aug 22 that was published by the Turkish presidency.“These days, when the world is experiencing a collective awakening and the recognition of Palestine has become a global will. I believe that your call on behalf of Gaza would fulfil a historic responsibility toward the Palestinian people,” Erdogan wrote, thanking Melania for taking up the cause of the children.The letter called on Melania to ""show the same sensitivity to Gaza that you have shown to Ukrainian children who have lost their lives in the war"". Erdogan urged Melania to appeal directly to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ""end to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza"".The Turkish First Lady does not usually involve herself in politics, more often choosing to be active in environmental issues - which has earned her praise from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. But Erdogan has written letters to the partners of world leaders in the past, in 2016 on behalf of Syrians caught up in civil war and condemning Israel's actions in Gaza in March.","Turkish First Lady Emine Erdogan has written to US First Lady Melania Trump.

How Roshan Shah was caught







A 21-year-old India has been charged in Wisconsin for fooling people into believing that they need to part with their gold so that the gold can be kept in a safe box in Washington DC, otherwise they will become targets of a scam and all their money will be gone. According to the Justice Department, Shah was in Canada on a student visa before entering the US on a visitor's visa.The court document said Shah traveled to different states and picked up cash and gold from various fraud victims. He was not alone in this, he had a racket of conspirators who used to get the proceeds from this elaborate scam.Police arrested Shah after he attempted to pick up gold from his fraud victims in New Berlin, Wisconsin. Details of his co-conspirators are not yet known, but they played key roles in the scam as they posed as law enforcement officials and convinced gullible victims that they needed to transfer their assets to gold and then a courier would pick that and put it in a safety box in DC. Shah said he was just a middleman.The victims had previously given over $500,000 worth of gold to couriers the victims believed to be working with the federal government, the court document said.If convicted, Shah will face up to 20 years in prison and forfeit property in an amount equal to the value of the property involved in the offense.A New Berlin couple went to police July 30 to report that they were probably being scammed out of over $526,000 between June 11 and the end of July through a series if transactions involving gold coins. They said they had seen a TV news report about a scam involving gold coins and realized they likely were victims of itThe couple said they responded to a pop-up ad on their computer and called a number. A person told them he was a special agent with the US Treasury. He told them they were the victims of a massive fraud scheme across the US also being investigated by the CIA and Federal Trade Commission.The man requested identifying information from the couple, and sent them images of a badge and credentials to show them that they were indeed from the government. Police later determined all those were fake. Another associate of that man, identified as a “Scott Bessent,” said he was a chief investigator for the Office of the Inspector General, and the couple was advised to keep in contact with both men, whom they said had Middle Eastern accents and sounded as though they were calling from a call center, the complaint said.The couple was asked to forward gold coins to a safety deposit box opene din their name in the George W. Bush Federal Building in Washington, D.C., which does not actually exist. The couple engaged in a series of password-protected courier transactions but in the middle of the entire process, they suspected that something was amiss.Shah told police he arrived in the US on June 17 from Canada, only to be a courier for this scam. He arrived in the US in June and has done 10 or 11 jobs, including in Florida, Texas, Colorado, Arizona, Virginia, Illinois, Indiana and Milwaukee.","Roshan Shah was in Canada on a student visa before entering the US on a visitor's visa.

The Florida court where Indian-origin truck driver Harjinder Singh was presented ruled that Singh would not be released pre-trial as he is a substantial flight risk, and he was also not eligible for bond, the court said. During the court proceeding Saturday, Singh did not understand any question about a court-appointed attorney despite the aid of a translator, a local report said. Singh wanted to wait until the next hearing to have a public defender to represent him.Singh, who caused a crash on the Florida Turnpike by taking a wrong U-turn with his semi-truck, killing three people, faces three counts of vehicular homicide and three counts of manslaughter.Florida Lt Gov Jay Collins, who took a charter flight from Florida to California to extradite Singh from California, said Harjinder Singh demonstrated ""no remorse"" and was uncaring and not conversational.“We’re going to throw the book at him,” Collins said. “So he’s going to do some time. And when he’s done with that, then he’ll get deported back to wherever he came from,"" Collins said, explaining that after he serves his punishment here, he will be deported to India.Collins earlier said Singh should not have been behind the wheel for the simple reason as he did not understand English. The Trump administration, in fact, claimed that Singh failed the English Language Proficiency assessment and identified only one of four highway traffic signs.A major row began as Singh had a full-term commercial driver's licese though he did not know the road rules and also had a work permit, though he is in the US illegally. His brother who is also in the US illegally, has been arrested in the aftermath of the Florida crash. He was sitting inside the semi when the accident took place.Harjinder Singh entered the US in 2018 illegally and was arrested within days. He said he was scared to go back to India and his immigration case remained pending. He sought a work permit which was rejected during the Trump administration but was given during the Biden administration, DHS said.","Indian-origin truck driver who caused three deaths in Florida was denied bond by the court.

Company funds used for personal investments: Indian-origin man charged with tax violation in Texas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/company-funds-used-for-personal-investments-indian-origin-man-charged-with-tax-violation-in-texas/articleshow/123472449.cms,"Indian-origin man, with permanent resident status in the US, charged with tax evasion in Texas.





A 43-year-old Indian-origin man, Anil Surabhi, has been charged with a federal tax violation in Texas, the Justice Department said. Anil Surabhi, 43, an Indian citizen with permanent resident status in the United States, was named in an indictment returned by a federal grand jury this week in the Eastern District of Texas, charging him with attempting to evade taxes, the document said.According to the indictment, Surabhi controls an IT services company headquartered in Georgia. He used funds from the company to fund his private personal investments, pay personal expenses and make investments in real estate.Surabhi did not report those funds as income on his individual income tax returns.In the United States, tax evasion is treated as a serious federal crime, and the punishment can include both criminal and civil penalties. If someone is found guilty of willfully attempting to evade or defeat taxes, they can face up to 5 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000 for individuals (or $500,000 for corporations), or both, along with the cost of prosecution.If convicted, Surabhi faces up to 5 years in federal prison.In addition, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) can impose civil penalties such as a fraud penalty of 75% of the underpaid taxes and interest on the unpaid amounts.The exact punishment depends on the severity of the offense, the amount of money involved, and whether it was a deliberate act or negligence.In a recent case, Indian-origin Illinois doctor Krishnaswami Sriram was sentenced to 34 months in prison for hiding assets and lying to the IRS, apart from medical fraud. Sriram, of Lake Forest, Illinois, evaded payment of approximately $1.6 million he owed to the IRS. Among other evasive steps, Sriram transferred ownership, in name only, of two rental properties to his children without their knowledge while he continued to receive income from the properties. He also transferred approximately $700,000 from bank accounts he controlled in the United States to accounts in India. To fraudulently reduce the money he owed, Sriram submitted documents to the IRS as part of an offer-in-compromise that omitted an investment account in the United States, bank and investment accounts in India, and ownership of the rental properties. In total, Sriram caused a tax loss to the IRS of approximately $1.6 million.","Indian-origin man, with permanent resident status in the US, charged with tax evasion in Texas.

The transcript of Ghislain Maxwell's interview with the Department of Justice has a bombshell claim that Jeffrey Epstein was set up on a date with Princess Diana.

This was one of the sensational claims that Wolff made and the White House dismissed, calling him a 'disgraced' writer who spins lies. Wolff also claimed Trump met First Lady Melania Trump through Epstein.Melania refuted the claim and took legal action.If indeed Epstein went on a date with Princess Diana, this would add to the rotal scandal involving Epstein as Prince Andrew had already been mired in the Epstein scandal and lost his royal status after Virginia Giuffre accused Prince Andrew of sexually assaulting her when she was below 18.Maxwell said the Giuffre incident did not take place and even the photo of Giuffre with Andrew was false.","Ghislaine Maxwell, former girlfriend and aide of Maxwell, jailed for her involvement in sex trafficking, did not ascertain whether Epstein indeed went on a date with Diana.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Big Op Sindoor Lie Claims India Begged For Ceasefire, Trump Stepped In





ISLAMABAD: Nearly 100 days after Indian fighter jets pounded “terror bases” in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque that was among those hit.The May 6 raids had left the Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad badly damaged, with three fatalities reported. Now, PoK police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot “sold out” by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.Obaid has been booked under the draconian Official Secrets Act, 1923, with police claiming they had recovered “hard evidence” of espionage. “He passed on sensitive images and the mosque’s coordinates in exchange for hefty payments,” claimed SSP Riaz Mughal of PoK police’s counter-terrorism department (CTD).But the case is already mired in conflicting narratives. Another senior CTD officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, went further, alleging Jahangir had a past with a banned outfit before joining a so-called relief organisation. Investigators, he added, had traced communications with Indian handlers on his phone.The family, however, insists Obaid is no militant. His uncle admitted the 30-something may have “fallen into a money trap” but stressed he was only associated with the Jammu Kashmir United Movement, a relief body.“If he is guilty, he should face the law, but he has never been part of any militant outfit,” the uncle maintained.His lawyer, Abdul Samad, pointed out that the sections invoked against him cover trespassing into restricted areas and passing on information “prejudicial to national security”. Conviction under these clauses carries punishments ranging from 14 years in prison to life.Earlier this year, too, PoK police had arrested a police constable on charges of selling sensitive information across the border.","Indian fighter jets pounded ‘terror bases’ in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) Nearly 100 days later, local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque.

Pakistan blaze: Fireworks warehouse explosion injures at least 25; fire triggers road closures in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-blaze-fireworks-warehouse-explosion-injures-at-least-25-fire-triggers-road-closures-in-karachi/articleshow/123434002.cms,"



At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, were injured after an explosion took place at a fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.Thick smoke could be seen billowing into the sky from the building where firecrackers were stored, according to television footage.Witnesses cited by AP said that broken glass from nearby shops covered the road and panicked residents fled the scene.Firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze while ambulances ferried the injured, including passers-by, to hospitals.Senior police official Asad Raza said several shops and vehicles on Jinnah Road were damaged in the blast. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.The fire was reported in a warehouse near Taj Complex on MA Jinnah Road, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding,“as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the Fire and Rescue team reached the scene along with an ambulance and two fire brigade trucks.”Police surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “Sixteen injured at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [with] two critical. Fourteen at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre,” adding that the warehouse had been storing firecrackers.Karachi traffic police said MA Jinnah Road had been closed due to the fire, with traffic from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.Citizens were advised to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate routes “to avoid inconvenience,” the Dawn reported.Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed officials to control the blaze and ensure no lives were lost. According to a statement, he also ordered the Karachi Commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report. “There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.The Sindh home ministry later issued a statement saying 20 people had been injured in the blaze.Home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to the scene, saying, “Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital. An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”Lanjar also instructed investigators to include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene, Dawn furthed added.Explosions at fireworks facilities are not uncommon in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab province. Fires in commercial and residential buildings are also frequent, largely blamed on poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety rules, and negligence.","At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, injured after explosion at fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.

Targeting Ahmadiyya community



Blasphemy accusations







The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.HRCP on Thursday released its latest report, Streets of Fear: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2024/25, documenting violations of freedom of religion or belief (FORB) between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025.The report painted a picture as grim as in previous years, recording targeted killings, forced conversions, mob lynchings, hate speech, desecration of places of worship and extrajudicial killings. It also warned that religious freedom in Pakistan is facing an unprecedented threat.The HRCP highlighted several cases where individuals were killed over blasphemy accusations, describing the trend as deeply troubling in a country that has already witnessed the assassination of a provincial governor by his own security guard.The HRCP report noted that the pattern of minor non-Muslim girls disappearing and later resurfacing after allegedly converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men persisted in 2024/25.Hindus in Sindh, who form 8.8% of the population, and Christians in Punjab (1.9%), have raised repeated concerns. A fact-finding study found that forced conversions and coerced marriages remain most prevalent among Scheduled Caste Hindus due to poverty and limited social mobility.The report highlighted the role of cleric-politician Mian Abdul Haq, or Mian Mithu, accused of using his influence to facilitate conversions at his seminary in Ghotki. He was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.The report also cited cases where police were seen siding with abductors, often claiming it would be “haram” to return a girl after conversion.In July 2024, Faisalabad police recovered Christian minor Laiba Suhail, abducted in February and forcibly converted before being married off illegally. Another girl, Alina, is still missing. In January 2025, a Mirpurkhas court heard a plea from a couple accused of forcing an underage Hindu girl to convert and marry.Other cases were reported across provinces: in April 2025, 14-year-old a Hindu girl, Chahat disappeared in Quetta and later claimed in a video to have converted, though her parents produced documents proving she was underage.In May, Hindu Panchayats in Ghotki and Rohri protested the disappearance of a Meghwar teenager in Rohri, fearing abduction for forced conversion. In June, civil society groups and Hindu Panchayats in Larkana expressed concern over three minor girls and a teenage boy from Shahdadpur allegedly being forced to convert.The HRCP stressed that such cases continue to deepen insecurity among religious minorities and called for protective measures to safeguard vulnerable children and their families.The report listed multiple killings of Ahmadis: dentist Zakaur Rahman in Lalamusa (July 2024), Tayyab Ahmad in Rawalpindi (December 2024), Amir Hasan in Naukot (December 2024), Laeeq Cheema lynched in Karachi (April 2025), Muhammad Asif in Kasur (April 2025), and senior doctor Mahmood Sheikh in Sargodha (May 2025).The UN warned, “We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan.”“According to the data provided by the Ahmadiyya community, 29 Ahmadi places of worship were attacked and damaged during the review period,” the report said.It further added that in 26 cases, the demolition was carried out by law enforcement agencies.“These incidents occurred in Okara, Khanewal, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, and Sargodha, among other locations Back in January, a historic Sialkot site linked to Pakistan’s first foreign minister Zafarullah Khan was “reduced to rubble”.The report said that the blasphemy law has been often misused to settle personal scores or seek financial gain in Pakistan, where, a ‘mere accusation of blasphemy can be a death sentence.’In September, last year, two men accused of blasphemy were killed while in police custody less than a week apart. One was inexplicably shot and killed in Mirpurkhas during an alleged police encounter, and the other was killed by a police constable inside a police station in Quetta.On 12 September 2024, constable Saad Khan Sarhadi shot dead Abdul Ali, a blasphemy suspect, inside Quetta’s Cantonment Police Station after mobs from religious parties gathered outside demanding his custody. It marked the first such incident in the city where a serving officer killed a suspect in custody. Days later, Ali’s family pardoned Sarhadi, while lawyers and a JUI-F senator pledged legal support for him.Later, on 17 September 2024, Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a civil hospital employee from Umerkot, fled to Karachi after a cleric accused him of posting blasphemous content. He denied the charge in a video message before being arrested by police, who assured his family of protection. Two days later, police claimed he was killed in an encounter, with officers celebrated as heroes.His family was prevented from burying him by armed mobs, and the body was desecrated. Following outrage from rights groups, a Sindh police inquiry declared the encounter “fake.”The report also showed that the mainstream media largely ignored issues of religious freedom under the period covered. Even the Islamabad High Court’s hearings into the “blasphemy business group,” affecting nearly 400 households and livestreamed for four months, drew little coverage. Likewise, cases of coerced marriages, forced conversions and violence against minorities rarely made headlines.A worrying trend has emerged in Pakistan, where ultra-right-wing groups are exerting growing pressure on the judiciary and elected officials through propaganda and intimidation, it added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.

’14 Pakistani Soldiers Killed’: Baloch Rebels Attack Day After India’s Strike On Terror Hubs | Watch





The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan 's army personnel dead. According to BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch, fighters launched a raid in the Surdu area of Panjgur on Tuesday night, eliminating a key operative of the Pakistan army.The statement revealed that Ghulam Sarwar had earlier established and commanded a so-called death squad under the protection of the Pakistani military. This squad, which had been active for years in Gichek and other parts of Panjgur, was later led by his son, Islam Sarwar. The group allegedly supported the army's operations, carrying out targeted killings, enforced disappearances, and other violent acts. In return, the army reportedly allowed them to freely engage in drug trafficking, kidnappings for ransom and extortion through road checkpoints.During the operation, BLA fighters seized three Kalashnikov rifles, an M-4, additional weapons, two vehicles, and three motorcycles from Islam Sarwar's hideout. The site, according to the BLA, also served as a torture chamber, where electric shock devices and other tools of abuse were found. Islam Sarwar was accused of abducting and killing a young man in Panjgur just two months earlier. Jeeyand Baloch warned that the Pakistani army and its allies would be held accountable for crimes against the Baloch people.The BLA's latest offensive is part of the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan , where separatist groups are demanding greater autonomy and recognition of Baloch rights. In recent years, attacks on military and paramilitary forces, along with government facilities, have intensified.Separatist factions argue that the Baloch people face systemic marginalisation and exploitation, despite the province's wealth in natural resources. In response, Pakistan's military has pursued counterinsurgency campaigns to suppress the rebellion. However, human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns over reports of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and excessive force during these operations.Numerous accounts point to the widespread issue of disappearances, with civilians and activists allegedly detained without due legal process. Rights organisations argue that such tactics fuel fear and deepen mistrust, further straining relations between the Pakistani state and the Baloch population.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan's army personnel dead.

Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan ’s wife Bushra Bibi, has alleged that Bushra was forced to go on a hunger strike in prison before she was allowed to meet her family, ARY News reported.Both Bushra and Imran are behind bars facing multiple cases of corruption. Since his arrest in 2023, Khan has consistently maintained his innocence, asserting that the charges were fabricated by his opponents to prevent his political comeback.Maryam further claimed that Bushra was being kept in “difficult and unlawful” conditions. She said the ceiling of her cell leaked, the electric board had live current, rats moved around inside, and electricity was cut for up to two days.Speaking on ARY News, Maryam said Bushra was allowed to meet her family only after more than a month of repeated appeals. She said the family was also made to wait outside the jail for hours.Maryam alleged that Bushra’s health has worsened. “She has lost around 15 kilograms and has become very weak,” she said, adding that her sister’s morale remained strong.She also said that Bushra has not been given bail in several cases and has not been allowed to meet her husband, PTI founder Imran Khan.Meanwhile, Dawn reported that Imran Khan has nominated Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PMAP) chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai as opposition Leader in the national assembly, and Azam Khan Swati as opposition leader in the senate.","Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan ’s wife Bushra Bibi, has alleged that Bushra was forced to go on a hunger strike in prison.

(AP





CHEMMANI: A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region, along with 141 human skeletons including some that appear to be of children of different ages.The findings were made at a cremation ground in the Chemmani area near Jaffna town, the cultural heartland of the country's ethnic Tamil minority. But hardly any burials take place here, as Hindus mostly cremate their dead according to religious customs.Excavations have been underway since June, after workers found human remains while digging to build an electric crematorium.A pit test over nine days discovered 19 sets of human remains. Shallow burials of about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in a scattered and disorganized manner, and the absence of clothing, indicated the site was a mass grave, according to a report provided to a court in June.Since the area was secured and declared a crime scene that month, a total of 141 skeletons have been discovered within a 165-square-meter (1,776-square-foot) area. About 135 of the bodies had no clothing, and only one set of adult clothing was identified.Tests confirmed that a skeleton found with a schoolbag was that of a girl between 4 and 6 years old. Toddlers' dresses, socks and footwear, tiny bead bangles and a baby powder tray were also recovered.The identities of the dead and the cause and timing of their deaths are all unclear. But many think the victims could be civilians who disappeared during Sri Lanka's civil war, which broke out in 1983 between government forces and ethnic Tamil rebels, who fought to create an independent homeland for the minority group. The war ended in 2009.Several Tamil armed groups and an Indian peacekeeping mission were active in the region over the decades. But attention has focused on the Sri Lankan military, which had a heavy presence for over a decade in Chemmani, as the gateway to Jaffna town.Decades-old confession heightens suspicions A confession made by an army soldier before he was sentenced to death for rape and murder 27 years ago has strengthened suspicions about the site.In 1998, Somaratne Rajapakse along with four alleged accomplices from the military and police were sentenced to death for the gang rape and murder of a schoolgirl and the killing of her mother, brother and a neighbor.The five, who weren't hanged and remain in prison due to a moratorium on executions, have maintained that they were not involved in the rape and murder, but only disposed of the bodies under orders.Rajapakse told the court that he knew where up to 400 bodies were buried in Chammani.""We cannot say exactly who the perpetrators are yet, but the finger points to the (state) army,"" said Brito Fernando, an activist working with the families of people who disappeared during various armed conflicts in Sri Lanka.The area, including the cremation ground, were under Sri Lankan military control from 1996, when it captured Jaffna from the rebels, until after the war ended in 2009. The military operated checkpoints, and anyone who entered or left the area was searched.In 1999, Rajapakse led police to a spot where the schoolgirl, her family and the neighbor were buried and later showed police other places where more remains were found. But the investigations were abruptly stopped.Families want closure Items found at the site were publicly displayed earlier this month in the hope that their owners would be identified, and many people from surrounding villages and beyond visited the site.Amalanathan Mary Calista, whose husband has been missing since 1996 when the military arrested him in their village, said she hoped seeing proof that her husband was dead would bring a sense of closure.""I went there hoping to see at least his clothes. There was a sarong (clothing that wraps around the waist) but it wasn't my husband's. He was wearing a blue sarong at the time. It was disappointing,"" she said.""I only saw the clothing of little children,"" she added, as she wept.She said her husband is among 24 people who never returned home after the military searched their village. Families had tried to block the army vehicles from taking away the detained people, but the authorities pushed them aside with guns and the vehicles sped away, she said.""My wish is that he should be alive and return, but we can do nothing if it is not so,"" she said.""The state army arrested him. They must say that they arrested him and that he died at their hands. They also must pay us compensation,"" she said.Woman recalls military taking her brother and husband away Sivanathan Selvamalar said she watched her younger brother being loaded into a military truck blindfolded during that same raid. Years later, in 2009, her husband was also detained at a checkpoint. He called her to tell her of his arrest and was not heard from again.""We went to see the things, thinking they may have buried people who were arrested around this area, but we saw only the things of little children,"" she said.""We have checked all the prisons but have not found them. When we are told that more than 100 skeletons have been dug out, we fear the worst,"" she added.No children listed in missing person reports A 2003 report by Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission said it investigated 281 complaints of missing persons from 1990 to 1998. Of these, three were found in prisons and later released, while the rest are still unaccounted for. The report said the military was responsible for 243 cases, while the Tamil Tiger rebels were responsible for 25. The responsibility for 10 others is unknown.No children were listed as missing.Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, the editor of the only newspaper in the region at the time, said several families returned to Jaffna after fleeing into rebel-held territory as the military moved in. Some reportedly went missing after being stopped at checkpoints set up to look for infiltrating rebels, he said.Calls for DNA analysis Although previous investigations stalled, there is hope now that victims will be identified, Fernando said. But he said the government must do more to conduct a credible investigation.""We don't have proper guidelines to investigate the mass graves and have no DNA bank to help with identification,"" said Fernando, adding that the government should fund a DNA bank and enlist international support in the identification of victims.""Only a proper investigation by the government can free its military from suspicion,"" he said.Any direct probe into the military would likely anger Sri Lankan nationalists. Many of the majority ethnic Sinhalese admire the military for winning the civil war.Excavations will continue for 8 more weeks Ground-penetrating radar in other parts of the cremation ground has shown ""soil anomalies ... that are indicative of comparable density of buried skeletal remains,"" according to a report submitted in the Jaffna court last week.The scanned area is three times larger than the site that has been excavated, said Ranitha Gnanarajah, a lawyer monitoring the process. Investigators have requested court approval to continue excavations for eight more weeks, she said.Army spokesman Brig. Waruna Gamage said no one has formally accused the army of responsibility for the mass grave, and if they did they would need to show proof, he said.""The excavations are still ongoing and it is a civil matter belonging to the police and courts,"" Gamage said. ""We will respect the law of the country.""Government forces and the rebels are both accused of committing atrocities amounting to war crimes in the months leading to the end of the civil war in 2009.","A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region.

China’s Wang Yi Lands In Pakistan After India Visit As Beijing Refreshes Af-Pak Ties With CPEC Push





ISLAMABAD: The foreign ministers of Afghanistan, China and Pakistan on Wednesday agreed to expand their cooperation in multiple fields, including extension of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) to Kabul.Pakistan Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Afghanistan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi took part in the 6th Trilateral Foreign Ministers Dialogue in Kabul which focused on political, economic and security cooperation.The agreement on extension of the multi-billion dollars CPEC comes as Islamabad and Beijing are expected to launch the second phase of the project later this month during Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's visit to China to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.Pakistan's Foreign Office in a brief statement on X said that the three sides ""committed to strengthen joint efforts against terrorism"".""They also reaffirmed their commitment to deepening collaboration in trade, transit, regional development, health, education, culture, and combating drug trafficking, as well as, extension of CPEC to Afghanistan,"" it said.This is the first visit by the Chinese foreign minister to Afghanistan since the Taliban stormed to power in 2021 while the third by Dar to the Afghan capital since April.According to sources, China has played a role in easing tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.In a bilateral meeting with his Afghanistan counterpart, Pakistan's foreign minister claimed there was an ""increase in terrorist attacks"" in his country by terrorist outfits operating from Afghanistan, the Foreign Office said.In the last trilateral meeting in May in Beijing, the foreign ministers of the three countries had first agreed to expand the CPEC to Afghanistan to boost ""trilateral"" cooperation.India has been severely critical of the CPEC as it passes through Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir.

At least 76 people were killed, including 17 children, in western Afghanistan after a bus carrying refugees collided with a truck and motorcycle and caught fire, according to provincial government spokesman Ahmadullah Muttaqi and local police.According to a news report from Al Jazeera, police said that the accident occurred due to the excessive speed and negligence of the bus. The bus route to Kabul was carrying refugees who were recently deported from Iran, according to provincial official Mohammad Yousuf Saeedi.They were part of a massive wave of Afghans who were deported from Iran recently.Earlier, Iranian minister of interior Eskandar Momeni announced that around 800,000 people would be deported by March.Saeedi said that all the passengers boarded the bus at a border crossing point, Islam Qala.Three passengers survived the accident after the bus collided with a motorcycle first and then hit the truck, which was carrying fuel. The collision was so strong that it led to the eruption of fire.Two people in the truck and another two on the motorcycle were among the deceased.","At least 76 people were killed, including 17 children, in western Afghanistan.

Climate crisis drives displacement





After decades of war, Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.Since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including dams and canals, to harness river flows that spill into Iran, Pakistan, and Central Asia.But as per news agency AFP, these efforts are fuelling disputes, with climate change worsening water shortages across the region.The most contentious initiative is the Qosh Tepa canal, a mega-project designed to irrigate 560,000 hectares of farmland in northern Afghanistan. Experts say it could divert up to 21 per cent of the Amu Darya’s flow, a river already vital for water-stressed Central Asian states. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, backed by Kazakhstan, have raised alarms that the project could further shrink the Aral Sea and destabilise the region’s water-sharing arrangements, which date back to the Soviet era.Water governance specialist Mohd Faizee cautioned and was quoted by AFP as saying, “No matter how friendly the tone is now, at some point there will be consequences for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan when the canal starts operating.”Taliban officials, however, insist the canal will not cause significant harm. Project manager Sayed Zabihullah Miri was cited by AFP as saying that the Amu Darya has “an abundance of water, especially when it floods and glacial meltwater flows into it”.They argue the project is critical to boosting food security in a country where climate-driven crop failures and humanitarian crises remain widespread.Iran, Afghanistan’s western neighbour, is the only country with a formal water-sharing treaty, signed in 1973 over the Helmand river. But the accord has never been fully honoured. Tehran frequently accuses Kabul of restricting flows through upstream dams, especially during droughts.The Taliban maintain that water scarcity, worsened by climate change, leaves them unable to release more.A report by the Afghanistan Analysts Network noted that Afghan authorities also believe they have long been denied their fair share of Helmand waters due to poor management and political neglect.Meanwhile, disputes also simmer over the Harirud basin, which flows into Iran and Turkmenistan, where Afghanistan recently inaugurated the Pashdan dam. Analysts say reduced security risks after the war could accelerate such projects, reshaping regional water dynamics.To the east, Afghanistan shares the Kabul river basin with Pakistan, which eventually feeds into the Indus. Unlike Iran, no treaty exists between the two neighbours. While water disputes have not dominated their rocky bilateral relations, Kabul’s attempts to revive old river projects and build new ones could trigger friction.Yet, Afghanistan’s financial struggles and lack of technical expertise mean most large-scale projects will take years to complete. This delay may ease immediate diplomatic concerns, but for Afghans grappling with severe water shortages in the capital and beyond, the wait could deepen suffering.Afghanistan’s water disputes cannot be separated from the worsening climate emergency. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), nearly five million people were affected by floods, droughts, and other climate shocks in early 2025, with almost 400,000 displaced.“Crop failure, dry pastures and vanishing water sources are pushing rural communities to the edge,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in July.Villagers in the north were quoted by AFP as saying that they were pinning hopes on the Qosh Tepa canal to revive farming, though its completion is still more than a year away. In contrast, communities in western Herat have watched the Harirud river run dry, forcing families who were deported from Iran to return to barren land with little to farm.Meanwhile, extreme rainfall has added another layer of crisis. Warmer temperatures mean heavier downpours, often triggering devastating flash floods. In Maidan Wardak, a community leader said, “I’m around 54 years old, and we have never experienced problems like this before.”Taliban officials admit their efforts fall short. Energy and water minister Abdul Latif Mansoor recently conceded that while canal and dam projects are underway, “the measures we have taken so far are not enough”.Limited funding, international isolation and restrictive governance have left Afghanistan struggling to cope with climate shocks, even as it faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.For millions of Afghans, everything now comes down to water, too little in times of drought, too much during floods, as the Taliban’s push for control over rivers becomes a defining issue for the country and its neighbours alike.","Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.

A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses. More than 700,000 people from the Rohingya minority fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape persecution. About 70,000 more crossed the border last year after the Arakan Army effectively seized control of the territory.The Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar has been operating since 2018 under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council to document human rights abuses and violations in the country.It has already shared evidence with authorities pursuing cases involving the Rohingya at the International Criminal Court and the UN’s International Court of Justice.","U.N.-backed team releases annual report covering the 12 months to 30 June.

Three Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion on Saturday while patrolling near the Cambodian border, just days after the two countries agreed to extend a fragile ceasefire following their deadliest clashes in decades.The blast took place in Sisaket province at around 10 AM local time (0300 GMT), the Royal Thai Military said in a statement. One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage from the blast’s pressure.Tensions have been high since last month’s five-day conflict over disputed ancient temples along the 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, which left at least 43 people dead and forced more than 300,000 residents from their homes. The fighting, which involved jets, artillery, rockets and infantry, ended on 29 July after mediation by US President Donald Trump.On Thursday, Thai and Cambodian defence officials met in Kuala Lumpur and agreed to extend the truce. However, Saturday’s incident has cast doubt over the ceasefire’s stability.Thailand’s foreign ministry accused Cambodia of laying new landmines in violation of the agreement and said it would file an official protest. However the country’s Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority denied the allegation, insisting no new mines had been planted.Acting PM Phumtham Wechayachai, who was in neighbouring Surin province at the time, has ordered the military to ensure the injured soldiers receive full treatment.","One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage.

An on-duty officer who was caught on camera stealing a woman’s underwear during a home search in September last year has been jailed.The officer, identified as Marcin Zielinski, 47, serving with Hertfordshire Police, conducted the Section 32 search.CCTV footage from the woman’s home from last year shows Zielinski slipping a pair of underwear into his back pocket before walking out of the room. The woman released the footage on Monday after the officer was sentenced to four months in prison for the corrupt and improper use of police power and privileges.""Zielinski has let down the public of Hertfordshire, the police service as a whole, and his former colleagues, who act with professionalism and integrity,” Genna Telfer, the assistant chief constable of Hertfordshire Constabulary, was quoted as saying by the BBC.""His criminal behaviour damages the reputation of policing and represents a fundamental betrayal of the public and the values for which the police service stands,"" she said.The woman said she felt so “violated” by the incident that she discarded all her underwear and the chest of drawers, which had become a constant reminder of the distressing footage.“I'm constantly thinking, what did he want them for? Why did he take them? What's he going to do with them? How many more people has he done it to?” the woman was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail.On the night of the incident, the woman was arrested over an unrelated matter but later released without charges. While she was in custody, her partner came across the ring doorbell footage and was shocked by what he witnessed.""On the footage he signals to the other guy, 'I've searched this room, go and search the other room’. So he sent the other officer out and that's when he proceeded to open the drawer and stick them in his back pocket,"" the woman’s partner was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail.The woman feels that Zielinski’s sentence was too lenient and that he should serve a longer term in jail.""Originally I thought it was just going to get a suspended sentence, because I really did not think they were going to take it seriously. But I do think he does deserve to see the law from the other side. He can't just have the power trip to get away with it,"" she said.","Hertfordshire Police officer Marcin Zielinski, 47, was caught on camera stealing a woman's underwear during a home search in September last year.

Key points at a glance

Move to Forest Lodge planned for later this year (property not officially confirmed).

Eight bedrooms, Georgian era, private setting in Windsor Great Park (tennis court, period interiors).

Long-term base: reports suggest they intend to remain there even when William is king.

Funding: rent and renovations to be covered privately.

Other homes: Kensington Palace (work) and Anmer Hall (weekends) remain in use.

Note: There has been no formal public announcement naming Forest Lodge as the future royal residence once William is king. The picture above reflects consistent reporting across multiple outlets and the confirmed plan to move house this year.





Prince William and Kate Middleton plan to move into Forest Lodge in Windsor Great Park later this year. Reports suggest the family intend to keep it as their main home even when William becomes king. There’s no official confirmation of the specific property; Palace aides have only said the Wales family will move house later this year.Forest Lodge is an eight-bedroom Georgian house with the privacy and space the family has not had at Adelaide Cottage. Photos and records show period details inside and a tennis court on the grounds, with a quiet, wooded setting inside the park. People’s interiors coverage has highlighted archived images—fireplaces, Venetian windows and detailed ceilings—from an early-2000s shoot that give a sense of the house’s character.A move before Christmas remains the working assumption if refurbishment keeps pace. Reporting points to a handover before year’s end, but the timing will depend on the house being ready.The choice fits how they live now. The children attend school near Windsor, and Eton College is close for Prince George when the time comes. Staying based in the park keeps school runs simple and daily life steady.There is also a clean-slate feel. The past stretch has been difficult for the wider family.A move to a larger home in the same area offers routine without fresh upheaval.Forest Lodge would mark a shift from old habits. The monarch has long been linked to Buckingham Palace as a primary base. The plan here is different: Prince William and Kate Middleton are expected to keep using London and other palaces for work, while home life stays in Windsor. Ongoing renovation work at Buckingham Palace adds a practical reason to keep the family settled where they are.Money matters appear straightforward. Coverage says the couple will fund rent and current renovations privately, drawing on William’s income from the Duchy of Cornwall. The goal is a family home first, with formal spaces available when needed.They will still hold on to other places. Kensington Palace remains their London base for duties. Anmer Hall in Norfolk stays as a country retreat. Forest Lodge would sit at the center of that small triangle.Practical details are still emerging. Reports describe a preference for limited live-in staff and separate quarters for their longtime nanny—consistent with the low-key way they have run the household in recent years. The property is large enough to place security and help at a distance from family rooms.The move is not yet complete. Work on the house continues, and any relocation would also require arrangements typical for residences on Crown land. The family will make the switch when it is ready. If the plan holds, Forest Lodge becomes the anchor now and in the future, while official palaces remain the stage for state work. The idea is simple: keep the children’s routines intact and handle the Crown’s business where it belongs.","Prince William and Kate Middleton plan to move into Forest Lodge in Windsor Great Park later this year.

Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain dropped a request for Apple to create a tool to give law enforcement access to customers' cloud data.

Royal Navy gets its first Hindu chaplain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/royal-navy-gets-its-first-hindu-chaplain/articleshow/123394957.cms,"The UK's Royal Navy has appointed Bhanu Attri as its first-ever Hindu chaplain. (PTI Photo)





LONDON: A pandit raised in India has become the Royal Navy’s first ever Hindu chaplain.Bhanu Attri (39), who grew up in Himachal Pradesh but now lives in Essex, formally passed out of Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth last week and is also the Royal Navy’s first non-Christian chaplain.He was one of two chaplains and 148 new Royal Navy officers to pass out.Chaplains offer religious, pastoral, welfare and moral support to any member of the naval service, regardless of faith, who need it either at a base, or on ships and submarines. Attri, a Hindu priest with decades of experience running a Hindu temple in London, will also offer Hindu prayer ceremonies for Hindus.There are around 40 Hindu personnel serving full-time in the Royal Navy, plus another 30 in the Maritime Reserves. In the UK military, as a whole, there are more than 1,550 Hindus serving full-time, mostly in the army.Whilst most cadets underwent 29 weeks of training, he underwent a slightly different 13-week course: six weeks of officer instruction, which included learning about the Royal Navy’s worldwide role, its present-day mission, and how to survive a sinking ship; four weeks at sea, and three weeks focused on the role of a military chaplain.Bhanu will now join the chaplaincy at HMS Drake, serving the thousands of personnel working in and around Devonport Naval Base, ashore and at sea.“Passing out from Britannia Royal Naval College to become the first ever Hindu chaplain in the fleet is a profound honour,” Attri said. “The chance to represent individuals from other diverse religions brings meaningful representation for the Hindu community and reflects the Navy’s commitment to diversity, inclusion, and spiritual care for all. My family feels immense pride.”Anil Bhanot, Hindu adviser to the ministry of defence (MoD), said: “In 2023 the Royal Navy created a position for a Hindu chaplain and I endorsed Pandit Bhanu Prakash Attri for best fitting the criteria. He has qualifications from India equivalent to a Sanskrit scriptural postgraduate degree.” Bhanot said he wanted to encourage more Hindu youth to join the British armed forces.“Although our spiritual Bhoomi is India, our Karma-Bhoomi is the UK and MoD represents our protective arm,” he said.","Bhanu Attri (39), who grew up in Himachal Pradesh but now lives in Essex, formally passed out of Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth last week.

LONDON: A man has been convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent for his role in the shooting of a nine-year-old Keralite girl when she was eating ice-cream with her family in a restaurant in Dalston.The girl was hit in the head by the first of six bullets fired from a passing stolen motorcycle at a Turkish restaurant at 9.20 pm on May 29, 2024. She was caught up in a gangland shooting.Javon Riley (33) of Tottenham, London, was also found guilty by a jury at the Old Bailey of attempting to murder three men — Mustafa Kiziltan (35) Kenan Aydogdu (45) and Nasser Ali (44) — who were sitting outside Evin Restaurant. The three men were the intended targets. All four were taken to hospital for emergency surgery.The men had affiliations with Hackney Turks and the shooting was ordered by the Tottenham Turks, a rival gang, the court heard. Both gangs are responsible for importing most of the UK’s heroin.The girl has been left permanently injured with a titanium plate in her skull and a bullet still in her brain. She was in hospital for three months and will continue to have physical and cognitive difficulties throughout her life.Her parents hail from Kerala’s Ernakulam district and moved to Birmingham three years ago for work. Following the verdict her mother said: “This was not just an accident — even if our daughter was not the intended target, those responsible were still attempting to take lives, it is brutal and inhumane. We live with this pain every day, knowing nothing will ever be the same for our family.”Riley denied the charges but was convicted on Monday following a three-week trial. He did not pull the trigger but scoped out the area over several days, which included drinking pina coladas at the bar opposite. On the night of the attack, he travelled past the scene several times in a stolen car to ensure the targets were present and helped the gunman evade capture. The gunman and firearm have never been found. Detectives are offering up to £15,000 (Rs 17 lakh) for information that leads to the gunman. Riley, who is not a member of Tottenham Turks, refused to name the gunman or the person who ordered the shooting fearing for his safety.He will be sentenced on Sep 12.","Javon Riley (33) of Tottenham, London, was also found guilty by a jury at the Old Bailey of attempting to murder three men.

"‘Crushing cost’: UK parents skip meals, forego heating to afford school uniforms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/crushing-cost-uk-parents-skip-meals-forego-heating-to-afford-school-uniforms-survey/articleshow/123384048.cms,"Representative AI image





A survey has found that parents in England are skipping meals and relying on buy-now-pay-later services like Klarna to cover the cost of school uniforms ahead of the autumn term.The survey, conducted by parenting charity Parentkind, found that many parents were being pushed into debt to afford school uniforms. Nearly half (45 percent) of respondents said they planned to use credit cards, while a third (34 percent) expected to rely on services such as Klarna.Of the 2,000 parents surveyed, nearly half (47 percent) expressed concern over the high cost of school uniforms, often running into hundreds of pounds for branded items. More than a quarter (29 percent) reported skipping food or heating to meet the cost.Education secretary Bridget Phillipson has called on schools to urgently ease the burden on struggling parents by cutting back on mandatory branded uniform items, ahead of an upcoming change in the law.“School uniform matters, but it shouldn’t break the bank. No family should have to choose between putting food on the table and buying a new blazer,” said Bridget Phillipson as quoted by the Guardian.“Parents have told us they want fewer costly branded items, and that’s exactly what we’re delivering. Schools can help ease the pressure on families right now by reducing the number of branded items they require.” Philllipson added.From September 2026, schools in the UK will be limited to three branded items, plus a branded tie for secondary and middle schools, under the government’s Children and Schools Bill. However, Phillipson has urged parents to adopt the changes earlier on a voluntary basis.The new legislation will allow parents to purchase basic uniform items, such as shirts and trousers, from general retailers like Aldi and Marks and Spencer.At present, schools can require parents to purchase multiple logo-branded items from specialist suppliers, with some demanding more than five, and in certain cases up to 10, pushing total uniform costs to as much as £400 when PE kits are included.“Parents have faced the crushing cost of sending their children to school for far too long. For many families the bills soar into the thousands every year, covering uniforms, books, stationery, trips, laptops and travel. These reforms are the first real step towards ending that injustice,” Parentkind’s chief executive Jason Elsom was quoted as saying by the Guardian.“Limiting branded school uniform items will make a difference straight away. Our research shows 85% of parents believe this will cut costs, 71% prefer to buy plain items and add the logo later, and 83% say unbranded uniform is just as good quality. This is about keeping money in parents’ pockets without sacrificing school pride,” Elsom said.Almost 9 in 10 parents (86 percent) of children aged between 4 to 15 in state schools in England said branded uniforms made no difference to a student’s behavior, as per the survey conducted.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)",Parents in England are skipping meals and relying on buy-now-pay-later services like Klarna to cover the cost of school uniforms.

Prince William & Kate Middleton's ‘Forever Home’ Dream Leaves Neighbours Homeless





Princess Anne turned 75 on August 15. To mark the day, the Prince and Princess of Wales posted a short birthday wish and shared her newly released portrait of the Princess Royal. Their message read, “Wishing Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal a very Happy 75th Birthday!”The image is part of a set released for the milestone. Shot at Gatcombe Park by John Swannell, the portrait keeps the tone formal and restrained—very Anne. Swannell has photographed her across multiple milestone birthdays, a continuity that suits the Princess Royal’s preference for understatement.There was also an earlier portrait released the week before: a two-shot of Anne with Sir Tim Laurence , taken at Windsor Castle by Chris Jackson ahead of July’s French state banquet. That image drew attention to a sleeker, pulled-back hairstyle, a look Anne also wore at the banquet with her longtime Festoon Tiara.The post from William and Kate landed during the family’s summer break, but the message stayed classic: a clear portrait, a brief line, and no long caption. It matches Anne’s public style and allows the picture to do the talking.As ever, the focus around her birthday was service. Anne is widely cited as one of the monarchy’s hardest-working royals, and official birthday coverage emphasized her decades of engagements and patronages.Family figured in the week’s imagery, too. The Windsor channels highlighted Anne and Sir Tim’s quiet partnership, as well as archival moments from her life—reminders of a career defined by duty, sport and charity more than spectacle.Why does a single post matter? It shows how the Wales household and the Princess Royal present milestones now: warm but minimal, with the visuals carrying the sentiment. For Anne, the emphasis stays on the work rather than the social-media flourish.As the summer break continues, the family is expected to spend time together in Scotland, with no indication of a large public event for the occasion. For the Princess Royal, a steady calendar and a modest celebration remain the norm—and the Waleses’ short message matched that mood.The takeaway: a milestone birthday, a clean portrait, and a brief wish from nephew and niece-in-law—small gestures that say plenty about how Princess Anne works, and how the royal family marks personal events today.","Princess Anne turned 75 on August 15.

America's 250th birthday: Is US getting a $1 Trump coin? Here's what Treasury said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/americas-250th-birthday-is-us-getting-a-1-trump-coin-heres-what-treasury-said/articleshow/124300716.cms,"



The US Treasury is considering a $1 coin featuring President Donald Trump to mark the country’s 250th anniversary, a Treasury spokesperson said on Friday.In a post on X, Treasurer Brandon Beach shared a coin draft and said that the first drafts, photos shared by a user on X, honor America’s 250th Birthday.""No fake news here. These first drafts honoring America’s 250th Birthday and @POTUS are real. Looking forward to sharing more soon, once the obstructionist shutdown of the United States government is over,"" Beach said.The draft design of the coin, which was overseen by the Office of the US Treasurer Brandon Beach, features Trump’s profile on one side of the coin. The opposite side depicts Trump with a clenched fist in front of an American flag alongside the words “FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT.”“Despite the radical left’s forced shutdown of our government, the facts are clear: Under the historic leadership of President Donald J. Trump, our nation is entering its 250th anniversary stronger, more prosperous, and better than ever before,” a Treasury Department spokesperson said in a statement.“While a final $1 dollar coin design has not yet been selected to commemorate the United States’ semiquincentennial, this first draft reflects well the enduring spirit of our country and democracy, even in the face of immense obstacles.”In 2020, Congress passed bipartisan legislation, signed by Trump during his first term, that authorises the Treasury Secretary to issue one-dollar coins during the 2026 calendar year.The design of those coins must be “emblematic of the United States semiquincentennial.” Beach, who supervises the US Mint, said in a post on X Friday that the administration would share “more soon, once the obstructionist shutdown of the United States govt is over.”Living people are rarely featured on US money. Congress has imposed various restrictions on the ability of Treasury to feature living people and living presidents on currency. It’s not clear whether the latest Trump coin envisioned by the Treasury Department would run afoul of those laws.","The US Treasury is considering a $1 coin featuring President Donald Trump to mark the country's 250th anniversary.

Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Saar condemned the deadly terrorist attack that targeted a Manchester synagogue on Thursday, criticising UK authorities for what he described as their “failure to address this toxic wave of antisemitism.”“I am appalled by the murderous attack near Heaton Park Synagogue on the morning of Yom Kippur, the holiest day for the Jewish people. My deepest condolences go to the families who have lost loved ones, and I wish a swift recovery to the injured,” Saar said on X.He called for the “truth” to be told, adding: “Blatant and rampant antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement, as well as support for terror, have recently become widespread in London, other UK cities, and on campuses.”Saar further said Israel expects “more than words” from the Keir Starmer-led government, demanding “effective action and enforcement against antisemitic and anti-Israeli sentiment in Britain.”The attack, carried out with a car and a knife, left two people dead and four injured. Police neutralised the suspect and arrested two others.The incident comes ahead of the second anniversary of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel, after which Israel - a Jewish state - launched a military offensive in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. Tensions between Israel and the UK have also grown following Britain’s recent recognition of a Palestinian state, along with several other Western nations.","Gideon Saar criticises UK authorities for what he described as their “failure to address this toxic wave of antisemitism’ The attack, carried out with a car and a knife, left two people dead and four injured.

Paramount to buy Free Press: Who is Bari Weiss? Rebel journalist set to become editor-in chief of CBS News,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/paramount-to-buy-free-press-who-is-bari-weiss-rebel-journalist-set-to-become-editor-in-chief-of-cbs-news/articleshow/124284561.cms,"Who is Weiss?







Paramount Skydance is set to appoint Bari Weiss as editor in chief of CBS News in the coming days, providing the journalist with significant authority to overhaul the network as it acquires her independent news site, the Free Press, The Post has learned.Weiss, a 41-year-old former New York Times opinion writer who developed the Free Press into a prominent platform with a contrarian perspective, is expected to be named to the top position in a Monday announcement. However, negotiations remain uncertain, and the timeline may change, a source close to the matter stated.In a notable restructuring of CBS News’ longstanding management framework, Weiss will report directly to Paramount Skydance Chief Executive David Ellison as she assists in defining the editorial direction of the Tiffany Network’s third-largest news division, a source indicated.Weiss’s direct reporting line to Ellison means she will not answer to CBS News President Tom Cibrowski, who currently reports to George Cheeks, Chair of TV Media at Paramount Skydance.Insiders mentioned that Weiss’s hiring raises doubts about the potential return of former CBS President David Rhodes to the network, with one source describing their job prospects as an “either/or” scenario.Sources informed The Post that Weiss could serve as a strong counterpart to Cibrowski, a former “Good Morning America” executive who is viewed more as a production expert than a journalist.Others anticipate that it will soon be clear whether Weiss—who has become a leading voice against antisemitism and the “woke” elites in mainstream media—will challenge Cibrowski’s position.Weiss, 40, made her name as a sharp-tongued opinion columnist at The New York Times. Her pieces took aim at the MeToo movement, campus activism, and what she described as “illiberalism on the left.”In 2020, she quit in spectacular fashion, publishing a viral resignation letter accusing the paper of silencing ideological diversity.She then launched The Free Press in 2022, billing it as “fiercely independent.”The outlet quickly drew attention, and controversy, with stories that platformed conservative voices, a friendly sit-down with venture capitalist Peter Thiel, and essays that critics said downplayed the famine in Gaza.","Bari Weiss, a former New York Times opinion writer, is expected to be named to the top position in a Monday announcement.

First in 500 years: Ex-nurse Sarah Mullally named Church of England's first female Archbishop of Canterbury; who is she,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/first-in-500-years-ex-nurse-sarah-mullally-named-church-of-englands-first-female-archbishop-of-canterbury-who-is-she/articleshow/124288159.cms,"Sarah Mullally

Who is Sarah Mullally?



Why the role matters







The Church of England, founded in 1554, will be led by a woman for the first time, as Sarah Mullally, the Bishop of London, was announced on Friday as the next Archbishop of Canterbury, the highest-ranking bishop in the Church.Mullally, 63, succeeds 105 men to become the first woman to lead the Anglican Communion, which comprises 85 million (8.5 crore) members worldwide.She will succeed former Archbishop Justin Welby, who announced his resignation in November last year following an independent investigation. The probe found that he had failed to report to the police instances of serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps, despite being aware of them.According to the BBC, Mullally is a former National Health Service (NHS) nurse who became a priest in 2006. In 2018, she was appointed as the first female Bishop of London, making her the third most senior member of clergy in the Church of England.She spent over 35 years in the NHS, and in 1999, became the youngest-ever Chief Nursing Officer for England. A few years later, she decided to pursue the priesthood.In 2012, Mullally became canon treasurer at Salisbury Cathedral, and three years later, she was appointed Bishop of Crediton in the Diocese of Exeter.Mullally will not formally assume her new role until a confirmation of election in January, followed by an enthronement service after paying homage to King Charles III, the head of state.Women were first ordained as priests in the Church of England in 1994, with the first female bishops appointed two decades later, in 2014.Although the monarch—King Charles III in this case—is the formal head of the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury is its most senior bishop and serves as the spiritual leader of both the Church and the worldwide Anglican Communion, which includes numerous national churches.The Archbishop carries the title “Primate of All England,” reflecting their seniority as the “first bishop” in England.","Sarah Mullally, the Bishop of London, was announced on Friday as the next Archbishop of Canterbury.

US government shutdown: Education dept employees' out-of-office emails altered to blame Democrats; claim 'none of us contested',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-government-shutdown-education-dept-employees-out-of-office-emails-altered-to-blame-democrats-claim-none-of-us-contested/articleshow/124280514.cms,"



While the US government has already been shut down, some of the employees of the education department discovered their email accounts had been manipulated during their furlough this week.Five employees of the education department discovered that while they were out of the office, they had included partisan talking points that blamed the government shutdown on Democrats.The employees, who spoke with NBC News and provided copies of their out-of-office messages, reported that the wording had been altered from their original compositions. All are civil servants, not political appointees, and requested anonymity out of fear of professional repercussions.Initially, Education officials sent employees templates of nonpartisan out-of-office messages to use in their emails. Several employees stated they used this language earlier in the week, only to find that while they were furloughed, someone had changed it.“We’re looking to hear from federal government workers. If you’re willing to talk with us, please email us at tips@nbcuni.com or contact us through one of these methods,” one employee said.And now the altered email messages included statements such as: “Thank you for contacting me. On September 10-2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations. Due to the lapse of appropriations, I am currently in furlough status. I will respond to emails once government functions resume.”One individual reported changing the out-of-office message back to the nonpartisan version, only to have it revert to the partisan wording later.“None of us consented to this. And it’s written in the first person, as if I’m the one conveying this message, and I’m not. I don’t agree with it. I don’t think it’s ethical or legal. I think it violates the Hatch Act,” the employee stated, referring to the law that limits federal employees’ political activity.Another employee explained, “I took the statement that they sent us earlier in the week to use. And I pasted it on top of that — basically has a standard out-of-office. They went in and manipulated my out-of-office reply. I guess they’re now making us all guilty of violating the Hatch Act.”On Wednesday, NBC News reported that some employees at federal agencies were being offered partisan language blaming Democrats for the shutdown to use as their out-of-office messages. Additionally, several federal websites now display language targeting Democrats or the “radical left.” The Education Department’s actions have been criticised for involving individual civil servants in political messaging regardless of their personal views.Madi Biedermann, the deputy assistant secretary for communications, responded: “The email reminds those who reach out to Department of Education employees that we cannot respond because Senate Democrats are refusing to vote for a clean CR and fund the government. Where’s the lie?”One employee expressed frustration over the lack of accountability, stating, “Nobody follows the law anymore, so why does it matter? It seems like laws are dotted lines now, not solid lines. It seems there’s no one to hold this administration accountable to laws.” Regarding potential repercussions, the employee added, “Clearly, this wasn’t done by me; it was done while I was in a furlough status. I think I’d be able to argue that point. ”","Five employees of the education department discovered that while they were out of the office, they had included partisan talking points that blamed the government shutdown on Democrats.

Another Gen Z revolt: Youth-led anti-corruption protests in Morocco turn deadly; 3 killed so far,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/another-gen-z-revolt-youth-led-anti-corruption-protests-in-morocco-turn-deadly-3-killed-so-far/articleshow/124276515.cms,"Youth-led anti-corruption protests in Morocco (Pic credit: PTI)

Nepal Burns: Gen Z Protest Turns Deadly, 9 Killed as Police Open Fire in Kathmandu, Curfew Impsosed

Why is Moroccan youth protesting?





Moroccan protests driven by teenagers and internet-savvy youth has turned deadly as authorities on Thursday raised the death toll to 3 as violent youth-led demonstrations over corruption and public spending continue to rock the country.Morocco’s Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch praised the response of security forces and said the government was ready for talks, as organisers called for a sixth night of protests. “The death toll in the protests has risen to three,” Akhannouch said in a statement. ""We have unfortunately recorded the deaths of three people"" during the protests, Akhannouch said, describing the events as ""regrettable"", AFP reported.Local authorities reported that security forces had to resort to firearms after teargas failed to stop demonstrators from storming a police facility in Leqliaa, a small town outside Agadir. The group, armed with knives, set fire to part of the facility and to a vehicle.According to Morocco’s Interior Ministry, the three were shot and killed during an attempt to seize police weapons, although no witnesses could corroborate the report.The ministry added that 354 people, mostly law enforcement personnel, were injured, while hundreds of cars, banks, shops, and public buildings were damaged across 23 provinces.The protests dominated by Gen Z participants have taken Morocco by surprise. Demonstrators have voiced frustration over widespread corruption, contrasting the billions invested in preparations for the 2030 World Cup with underfunded schools and hospitals. Chants have included slogans such as, “Stadiums are here, but where are the hospitals?”The unrest has been further fueled by the recent deaths of eight women in a public hospital in Agadir, which has become a rallying cry against the decline of Morocco’s healthcare system.While the country prepares to host soccer's Africa Cup of Nations later this year and gears up for parliamentary elections in 2026, the protests highlight enduring regional disparities and dissatisfaction with public services, particularly among youth.Officials, however, denied that World Cup-related spending has taken precedence over public infrastructure, noting that many challenges facing the health sector were inherited from previous governments.","Morocco's Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch praised the response of security forces and said the government was ready for talks.

Hamas has not accepted the requirement that it have no role in Gaza’s future governance, indicating it may seek to retain influence through a national framework. Negotiation before implementation: The group wants to negotiate the details of the hostage exchange and other elements of the plan before committing to the timeline outlined by Washington.





Hamas on Saturday partially agreed to Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan and came to a consensus to release all remaining Israeli hostages. Hamas however made it clear that several provisions in the US-brokered 20-point peace plan will need further negotiation. While the group has welcomed parts of the proposal, it has pushed back on crucial clauses related to Gaza’s future governance and its own role in the territory.In a statement, Hamas said it agreed “to release all Israeli prisoners, both living and dead, according to the exchange formula contained in President Trump's proposal” if proper conditions are met.However, it added that several issues “regarding the future of Gaza and the rights of Palestinians” remain under discussion.The announcement came hours after US President Donald Trump gave Hamas a Sunday deadline to accept the peace plan or face “all hell.” After receiving Hamas’s response, Trump posted on Truth Social, “I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE.” He urged Israel to “immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly!” and added that discussions on details were already underway.Also read: Hamas agrees to free Israeli hostages; Trump asks Israel to stop bombing Gaza — Key things to know Tahir al-Nounou, media adviser to the head of Hamas’s political bureau, told the BBC: “President Trump's statements are encouraging, and the movement is ready to begin negotiations immediately to achieve a prisoner exchange, end the war, and secure the withdrawal of the occupation.”Although Hamas has not accepted the overall 20-point plan, it has accepted the proposal partially and signalled a willingness to engage.The US plan calls for an immediate ceasefire and the release within 72 hours of 20 living Israeli hostages and the remains of others believed to be dead, in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans. Once both sides agree, full humanitarian aid would be sent into Gaza. Around 48 hostages are still held by Hamas, with 20 believed to be alive.Under the proposal, Hamas would have no governing role in Gaza, and it leaves the door open for an eventual Palestinian state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected this, reiterating his opposition to a Palestinian state. “It's not written in the agreement. We said we would strongly oppose a Palestinian state,” he said.Hamas stated on Friday that parts of the proposal relating to Gaza’s governance and Palestinian rights are still being discussed “within a national framework,” in which Hamas intends to participate.Earlier, Trump warned that failure to accept the deal would lead to severe consequences. “If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas. THERE WILL BE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER,” he wrote on Truth Social.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the repercussions of rejecting the plan would be “very grave” for Hamas. “Hamas has an opportunity to accept this plan and move forward in a peaceful and prosperous manner in the region. If they don't, the consequences, unfortunately, are going to be very tragic,” she said.The plan has been welcomed by European and Middle Eastern leaders, and the Palestinian Authority has called Trump’s efforts “sincere and determined.” Trump has also said that if Hamas refuses to agree, Israel will have US backing to “finish the job of destroying the threat of Hamas.” Netanyahu has echoed this stance.Israel’s offensive in Gaza began after the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023, which killed around 1,200 people and led to the taking of 251 hostages. Since then, more than 66,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israeli forces continue operations in Gaza City, with Defence Minister Yoav Gallant saying they are “tightening the siege” around the area.James Elder, spokesperson for Unicef, criticised the concept of designated safe zones in Gaza, calling it “farcical”. “Bombs are dropped from the sky with chilling predictability. Schools, which have been designated as temporary shelters, are regularly reduced to rubble,” he said.","Hamas insists on a full and complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, not the staged or partial withdrawal proposed in the plan.

A California resident who admitted attempting to assassinate US Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2022 was sentenced on Friday to eight years and one month in federal prison.Sophie Roske, (birth name Nicholas Roske) appeared before US district judge Deborah Boardman in Greenbelt, Maryland.Judge Boardman described Roske’s crime as “absolutely reprehensible” but noted that she had shown sincere remorse, has no prior criminal history, and is unlikely to reoffend. Roske, 26 at the time of her arrest, pleaded guilty in April to attempted assassination and had faced the possibility of life imprisonment.Prosecutors revealed that Roske had travelled from California carrying a handgun, ammunition, a crowbar, pepper spray, and other items with the intent to commit murder “for terroristic purposes.” At Kavanaugh’s residence, she called the police after seeing US Marshals outside, telling the dispatcher she was suicidal and intended to kill the justice, according to court filings.Authorities said Roske’s actions were driven by frustration over expected Supreme Court rulings that would overturn the national right to abortion and roll back gun regulations.At the sentencing hearing, Roske apologised to Kavanaugh and his family for “the considerable distress” she caused, adding, “I have been portrayed as a monster, and this tragic mistake I made will follow me for the rest of my life.”Prosecutors had sought a prison term of at least 30 years, emphasising that Roske had meticulously planned her attack for months and was determined to find the addresses of four unidentified sitting Supreme Court justices. “The defendant posed a very real threat to our system of government, our constitution,” Assistant US attorney Coreen Mao said. “No public official should live in fear of being killed at any moment for doing their job. ”Roske’s lawyers had requested a sentence not exceeding 96 months, highlighting her cooperation with authorities and her decision to call 911 to surrender. They argued, “Roske should be sentenced for what she did, not for what she thought about.”","Sophie Roske, (birth name Nicholas Roske) appeared before US district judge Deborah Boardman in Greenbelt, Maryland.

""Congress must act to protect scientific research from those who would serve political interests first.""Marrazzo was earlier demoted from her position as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in March. Marrazzo had been in her role since August 2023, succeeding D. Anthony Fauci, who had served as NIAID director for nearly four decades.Last month, she filed a complaint claiming her removal was in retaliation for protesting moves by the Trump administration that undermined vaccine research. She also alleged that officials had been flouting court orders and politicizing decisions over grant allocations.In a letter dated September 26, Kennedy informed Marrazzo of her dismissal.“In my capacity as secretary, I have decided to terminate your appointment as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease,” he wrote, without providing any explanation, as reported by New York Times.Marrazzo’s firing was a part of a long list of dismissals under Kennedy, who has indicated plans to cut at least 10,000 positions as part of a restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In June, Kennedy removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Vaccine Practices, which makes vaccine recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control.Kennedy, long known for spreading doubts about vaccine safety and efficacy, has continued controversial policies since taking office. He has scrapped $500 million in research grants for mRNA vaccines, which are credited with saving millions of lives during the Covid-19 pandemic.Over the past nine months, the Trump administration has slashed budgets, fired thousands of scientists, and significantly reduced federal health research funding.

A video from CoolKicks’ live stream on Whatnot abruptly cut off during a raid.According to the Los Angeles County Inmate Information Center, Shams, 33, was booked on Thursday, Oct. 2, by the LAPD’s BUNCO/Forgery Division on felony charges related to alleged fraud. The arrest took place around 4:45 p.m. local time, with booking logged at 6:32 p.m. the same evening. Jail records indicate no bail was set, and he was released early on Friday, Oct. 3 on own recognizance (OR) pending trial.The LAPD has not yet issued an official statement regarding the details of the case, though the involvement of the BUNCO/Forgery Division suggests the investigation centers on allegations of fraudulent activity tied to CoolKicks’ operations. Reports also suggest that LAPD raided a CoolKicks warehouse, though more information on seized items or evidence has yet to surface.Some unverified videos surfaced claiming that cops had Adeel Shams and his employees at gunpoint before taking them into custody.CoolKicks is a popular sneaker resale brand founded by entrepreneur Adeel Shams. He graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), attending both the School of Business and the VCU Brandcenter. His early interest in sneakers led him to buy used pairs (e.g. Jordans), clean them up, and resell them — that eventually grew into a full business.CoolKicks was founded by Adeel Shams and friends in 2014 in Richmond, Virginia, where Shams was attending Virginia Commonwealth University. The business grew and CoolKicks moved out to Los Angeles, opening their famous storefront on Melrose in 2016.","Adeel Shams, 33, was arrested by the LAPD's BUNCO/Forgery Division on felony charges related to alleged fraud.

NY anti-terror funds: Trump reverses counterterrorism cuts; $187 mn to be restored after GOP outcry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ny-anti-terror-funds-trump-reverses-counterterrorism-cuts-187-mn-to-be-restored-after-gop-outcry/articleshow/124297630.cms,"Donald Trump (Pic: AP)





The Trump administration has reversed cuts to counterterrorism funding for New York, US President Donald Trump announced in a post on Friday.“I am pleased to advise that I reversed the cuts made to Homeland Security and Counterterrorism for New York City and State. It was my Honor to do so,” Trump said in a Truth Social.According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), “While FEMA’s initial allocation fully met program requirements, after consultation with federal partners and in recognition of our critical security partnership with New York, FEMA is providing access to $136 million, bringing the State Homeland Security funding to $187 million to ensure it has the resources needed to counter and combat evolving threats”, reported CNN.New York Governor Kathy Hochul welcomed the reversal and credited Trump for restoring the funds. Writing on X, the Democratic leader said, “ I’m glad that @POTUS heard our call to reverse these cuts. That means $187 million for the NYPD, FDNY & first responders across the state that keep New Yorkers safe.”Hochul had earlier warned DHS Secretary Kristi Noem that slashing 86% of the state’s homeland security funding “serves only to make not just New York but all of America more vulnerable to terrorist attacks.”A federal judge also raised similar concerns on Wednesday, citing the 9/11 attacks and other threats, and blocked the diversion or withdrawal of $34 million in funding meant to protect New York’s transportation system, the Associated Press reported.The funding reversal comes amid broader tensions between the Trump administration and Democratic-led states over federal spending. While the counterterrorism cuts predated the ongoing government shutdown, the administration has threatened New York and other blue states with consequences if the shutdown persists.White House budget chief Russell Vought confirmed on Wednesday that funding for two major New York City construction projects—the Hudson Tunnel Project and the Second Avenue Subway—has been paused due to the shutdown.",US President Donald Trump reversed cuts to counterterrorism funding for New York.

What is SPLC ?



Charlie Kirk's old post on SPLC







FBI director Kash Patel announced that FBI is severing all ties to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights watchdog, accusing them of turning partisan and spreading hate. ""The Southern Poverty Law Center long ago abandoned civil rights work and turned into a partisan smear machine,"" Patel wrote in a post on X. ""Their so-called 'hate map' has been used to defame mainstream Americans and even inspired violence. That disgraceful record makes them unfit for any FBI partnership,"" he said.The SPLC's Hate Map is a non-exhaustive compilation of hate groups, tracking ideologies that are anti-immigrant, anti-LGBTQ, sexist, racist or bigoted against religions. The map lists Kirk's Turning Point USA as ""Antigovernmental General"".The move follows the FBI's decision to end its partnership with the Anti-Defamation League.Elon Musk called SPLC an evil organization and accused it of incitement to murder Charlie Kirk. “For decades, we have shared data and analysis with the public to protect civil rights and hold extremists accountable,” the SPLC said in a statement. “We remain committed to exposing hate and extremism as we work to equip communities with knowledge and defend the rights and safety of marginalized people.”Per their website, the SPLC is a catalyst for racial justice in the South and beyond, working in partnership with communities to dismantle white supremacy, strengthen intersectional movements, and advance the human rights of all people. Civil rights lawyers Morris Dees and Joseph Levin Jr. founded the SPLC in 1971 to ensure that the promise of the civil rights movement became a reality for all.On May 26, Charlie Kirk wrote a scathing post on SPLC for listing his organization as a hate group. ""The SPLC has added Turning Point to their ridiculous “hate group” list, right next to the KKK and neo-Nazis, a cheap smear from a washed-up org that’s been fleecing scared grandmas for decades.

PoJK protests at the core







Protests in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) continued for a sixth consecutive day on Friday, spilling into the country’s capital, triggering a shocking police raid on the Islamabad National Press Club (NPC) that left several journalists injured and equipment vandalised.The assault has sparked nationwide outrage, with journalist unions announcing a “Black Day” in protest against what they called an attack on press freedom, ANI reported.Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday, where members of the Lawyers’ Community of PoK were holding a peaceful demonstration in solidarity with ongoing protests in the region.Visuals widely shared on social media showed baton-wielding policemen dragging journalists, smashing cameras, and assaulting media staff inside the club premises. In one video, a photojournalist could be seen with a torn shirt and a broken camera.The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) strongly condemned the attack, calling it one of the “darkest days” in Pakistan’s history.PFUJ President Afzal Butt said black flags would be hoisted at press clubs across the country in solidarity. “This is not only the Islamabad press club's issue,” Butt said at a press conference.“Press clubs across Pakistan believe that if they ignore this worst incident, tomorrow it could be Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar or Quetta,” he added.Videos circulating on social media show Pakistani Rangers using tear gas shells and live ammunition to disperse crowds. Internet, mobile, and landline services have been shut down, cutting off residents from their families and worsening the crisis.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and ordered an inquiry into the raid. “Violence against the journalist community cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” Naqvi said, promising disciplinary action against those responsible.However, journalist unions rejected what they termed “mere promises.” They warned that if the government continued to use police action to suppress dissent, the protests would intensify.The Islamabad incident comes amid massive protests in PoK, which have entered their sixth consecutive day.The protests, which began two years ago, were initially sparked by demands for political reforms, subsidised wheat flour, reduced electricity tariffs, free education and healthcare, and an end to privileges for government officials.The unrest intensified after at least three civilians were killed during police firing in Muzaffarabad, ANI reported.Their funeral processions drew thousands, fuelling more anger. Reports suggest that over 10 people have died in the clashes so far, with many critically injured.","Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday.

Pak Parliamentarian Mocks Army Chief Munir As ‘Salesman’, PM Sharif As ‘Manager’ Over Trump Meeting





The Commonwealth Observer Group (COG) has officially released its report on Pakistan’s 2024 general elections, noting “conditions that appeared to impact one party’s ability to fairly contest the election” — namely the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), led by incarcerated former Prime Minister Imran Khan The report, which included a ""Letter of Transmittal"" by COG chairperson and former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, cited the denial to PTI of its election symbol, Khan’s consecutive convictions ahead of polling, and restrictions on freedom of association and assembly.Jonathan wrote: “When looked at in isolation, some – though not all – of the arguments advanced by key institutions in support of their actions appear somewhat justifiable. Yet, collectively, it could not go unnoticed that these decisions consistently limited one party's ability to contest the election on a level playing field.”The observers expressed particular concern over the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s revocation of PTI’s iconic “bat” symbol — linked to Khan’s cricketing past — on grounds that the party failed to hold intra-party elections. With the decision coming just weeks before polling, PTI candidates were forced to run as independents, depriving them of a unifying symbol.The group also flagged Khan’s multiple convictions shortly before polling day, along with restrictions on PTI’s rallies and gatherings. “There were also limitations on fundamental political rights, including freedom of association and assembly. These limitations were felt most acutely by PTI and its supporters,” the report said.The COG called for reforms to strengthen transparency and ensure a level playing field for all parties in future Pakistani elections.The report found that mainstream English-language media “broadly followed the principles of fair and accurate election reporting,” though PTI-affiliated independent candidates received ""less positive"" coverage.By contrast, state-owned PTV News lacked balance, focusing mainly on the ruling PML-N and PPP, and reportedly barred references to Khan by name. The group concluded that these factors may have “impinged on the credibility, transparency and inclusiveness of the electoral process.”The report had been controversial after media reports suggested the Commonwealth had “buried” it following widespread problems in the February 8 polls. Submitted to the Commonwealth secretary-general on November 20, 2024, the publication was delayed without explanation.The PTI had repeatedly demanded its release, arguing it confirmed “systemic rigging, institutional bias, and deliberate targeting” of the party and its founder.","Commonwealth Observer Group releases report on Pakistan's 2024 general elections.

Trump's 20-point peace plan







Pakistan’s top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations’ peacekeeping force under a comprehensive peace deal announced by US President Donald Trump.The decision was announced by Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday.At a press conference in Islamabad, Dar was asked directly about Pakistan’s role in the initiative, which aims to end the bloodshed in Gaza. “The force [here] is a peacekeeping force. On the ground, there will be Palestinian law-enforcement agencies... there will be [separate] forces supporting them. Indonesia has offered 20,000 troops for that. I am sure Pakistan's leadership will also be making a decision on this,” he said.Dar explained that the idea was to set up an independent Palestinian government of technocrats overseen by an international body. He said Pakistan had asked for the arrangements to be documented at the UN Security Council.He shared that a preparatory meeting of leaders from eight Muslim countries with US President Trump was held in New York last week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. “The objectives were to try for a ceasefire in Gaza, make arrangements for sending humanitarian aid, stop the forced displacement of Palestinians and make arrangements for the return of the displaced Gazans,” he said.Dar added that the plan also included Gaza’s reconstruction and halting Israel’s efforts to annex the West Bank. According to him, Trump proposed that his team work with the foreign ministers of the Muslim nations to create a “workable solution.”The foreign minister said Saudi Arabia had reached out to Pakistan with a draft joint statement on the plan, which was later revised after his input. He noted that the Palestinian Authority welcomed the statement.On Monday, Donald Trump unveiled a 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the Gaza war by demanding Hamas’s disarmament, the immediate release of all hostages within 72 hours, and a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces. Under the proposal, Hamas would be excluded from any future governance; militants willing to abandon arms would receive amnesty, while those wishing to leave Gaza would be allowed safe passage. The plan also involves a temporary technocratic Palestinian committee ruling Gaza under oversight by an international “Board of Peace” led by Trump and including Tony Blair, until the Palestinian Authority is reformed.The initiative calls for humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza without interference from either Israel or Hamas, managed by UN agencies and the Red Crescent, with reconstruction under a “New Gaza” framework. Trump gave Hamas three to four days to accept the plan or face what he called “a very sad end.”","Pakistan's top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations' peacekeeping force.

At least nine people, including four militants, were killed in two separate bomb-related incidents on Tuesday in South Waziristan district of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, reported news agency PTI.The first explosion occurred in Ashangi Lagad village, where five villagers were killed instantly after coming into contact with a bomb-like object lying on the road.The powerful blast sparked panic in the area, with residents demanding that authorities step up efforts to clear unexploded devices and protect civilians. Security forces and local administration officials later reached the site and launched an investigation.Hours later, in the Wacha Khawora area of Wana, four militants were killed when an improvised explosive device (IED) they were attempting to plant went off prematurely. Among those killed were a local militant commander, Yar Muhammad Muslim, Zameed Alam of the Ashangi tribe, and two unidentified associates.Earlier, at least ten people were killed and several others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside the paramilitary headquarters in Quetta on Tuesday.The blast was reportedly heard miles away, and ambulances quickly arrived to transport the wounded to nearby hospitals.“The blast occurred as an explosive-laden vehicle took a turn from Model Town towards Hali Road, near the Frontier Constabulary (FC) headquarters,” said Muhammad Baloch, SSP special operations Quetta.This follows heightened tensions in the region.

Amid Trump-Sharif Meeting, Political Expert Explains Why US is Eyeing Pakistan As Military Launchpad





: In an effort to worm its way back into Washington’s good books, Pakistan ’s hybrid military-civilian leadership flashed glimpses of its purported rare earths bearing mineral wealth during a meeting with US President Donald Trump last week, going by a photo released by the White House.Among a dozen photos featured in the White House picture gallery relating to the Shahbaz Sharif- Asim Munir meeting with Trump is one where the duo is showing Trump an open 18x18 inch wooden box with colorful stones presumably bearing some mineral deposits. Two of the larger rocks appear to be bastanzite and monazite clumps that typically bear rare earths elements (REE) such as cerium, lanthanum, and neodymium. Some of the smaller candy-colored pebbles look like gemstones.Pakistan has long spoken of its vast untapped oil, gas, and mineral ores, some bearing rare earths, mostly in the troubled Balochistan region wracked with insurgency, and also in Khyber-Pakhtoonwa. While none of the mineral deposits are commercially proven or quantified, Pakistan’s leadership showcased the baubles to the US President to highlight collaboration and exploration bids it has signed with a private US firm earlier this month.The charm offensive also included PM Sharif wearing a lapel pin the had both the US and Pakistani flags, a gesture some Pakistani trolls on social media termed as “embarrassing.”While there is no direct government-to-government agreement to explore or exploit the mineral wealth, Pakistan's Frontier Works Organization (FWO)—a military-linked engineering and mining entity—signed an MoU on September 8 with the Missouri-based US Strategic Metals (USSM), a private US firm specializing in critical minerals.The agreement, with an initial funding of $ 500 million from USSM, envisages three phases: Phase 1 (Immediate, 2025–2026) involving export of readily available minerals (e.g., antimony and copper concentrates) to US markets, generating quick revenue. Phase 2 (Medium-term, 2026–2028) involving construction of processing plants and refineries in Pakistan, with technology transfer for REE separation and purification. Phase 3 (Long-term, 2028+), involving large-scale exploration and exploitation, including drilling in high-potential REE belts; and developing 5–10 mining projects.Islamabad's rare earths gambit with the US — which could cause Pakistan's patron China to burst a blood vessel since it has a stranglehold on rare earths supply to the US — comes on the heels of the its crypto caper, where it used a British-Pakistani entrepreneur to position itself as crypto capital where American businesses with ties to the Trump family could make a fortune.","Pakistan has long spoken of its vast untapped oil, gas, and mineral ores, some bearing rare earths.

Israel Says Yes, Hamas Says No? Decoding Why Trump’s 20-Point Gaza Peace Is A Dud





Pakistan has formally distanced itself from the 20-point Gaza peace plan unveiled by US President Donald Trump, with country’s foreign minister and deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar telling the national assembly that the final proposal presented by the US was not endorsed by Pakistan or fully representative of the original draft prepared by a group of Muslim and Arab countries.“I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record,” Dar said, emphasising that “there is no room for politicking” on the issue.Dar explained that the plan took shape during a meeting between Trump and foreign ministers of eight countries - Pakistan, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt - on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session.

Taliban FM to visit India next week? Muttaqi gets travel exemption; first high-level trip since 2021 takeover,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-fm-to-visit-india-next-week-muttaqi-gets-travel-exemption-first-high-level-trip-since-2021-takeover/articleshow/124275380.cms,"Amir Khan Muttaqi (File photo)





Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi has been granted a temporary travel exemption to visit India next week. This marks the first high-level visit by a Taliban leader to New Delhi since the group took power in Afghanistan in 2021.According to officials, the UN Security Council sanctions committee has authorised Muttaqi to travel to New Delhi between October 9 and 16.The visit is expected to revive earlier plans that were delayed after sanctions restrictions prevented him from travelling, according to news agency Afghanistan International.Before arriving in India, Muttaqi will attend the seventh round of the “Moscow Format” talks in Russia on October 6 at the invitation of Russian officials. This will be the first time the Taliban participates as a member, rather than a guest in the multilateral forum.Describing the development as an “important step,” Muttaqi said he hoped such platforms would help strengthen trust and improve ties with neighbouring countries.The planned trip to India comes after months of speculation. In August, reports suggested that New Delhi was considering inviting Muttaqi, but government sources had clarified that India would approach the UN for a waiver only once the visit was finalised.Afghan media had then reported that the absence of approval had delayed the plan.India’s engagement with the Taliban has steadily increased in recent years, largely built around humanitarian assistance and developmental aid.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has twice spoken with Muttaqi, including last week when he conveyed condolences over the recent earthquake in Afghanistan and announced India’s relief assistance.Earlier this year, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri also met Muttaqi in Dubai to discuss Afghanistan’s urgent developmental needs.India has consistently maintained that while it is aligned with the international community on the question of formal recognition of the Taliban regime, it will continue to provide humanitarian aid and support to the Afghan people.New Delhi has delivered large quantities of food, medicines and relief material and has over 500 development projects running across Afghanistan.Taliban officials have also called for stronger ties with India. Suhail Shaheen, head of the Taliban’s political office in Qatar, recently said high-level visits such as Muttaqi’s were essential to explore cooperation in trade and other areas, adding that the Taliban valued India’s assistance and historical friendship with the Afghan people.If the visit goes ahead, it will mark a landmark moment in India-Afghanistan relations, signalling New Delhi’s intention to cautiously deepen engagement with the Taliban regime while balancing global concerns about recognition and sanctions.",Amir Khan Muttaqi has been granted a temporary travel exemption to visit India next week.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban’s first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that “eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place “until further notice.”Just last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan’s fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide “to prevent immoral activities.” They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

Indonesia: 65 students trapped as school building collapses; 1 dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/indonesia-65-students-trapped-as-school-building-collapses-1-dead/articleshow/124224122.cms,"Poll Do you believe building regulations should be stricter to prevent similar incidents? Yes No





At least one student was killed, dozens were injured, and 65 were feared buried in the debris after Al Khoziny Islamic boarding school building collapsed in Indonesia.Rescue workers, police, and soldiers, who had been digging through the night, pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java. Additional bodies were spotted, suggesting the death toll could rise, AP reported.Families of the students gathered at hospitals and near the collapsed building, anxiously awaiting news of their children. Relatives wailed as they watched rescuers pull a dusty, injured student from the buried prayer hall.A notice board at the command post established in the boarding school complex listed 65 students as missing as of Tuesday morning. They were mostly boys in Class 7 to Class 11, aged between twelve and seventeen.“Oh my God... my son is still buried, oh my God please help!” a mother cried hysterically upon seeing her child's name on the board, followed by the cries of other parents facing similar losses.“Please, sir, please find my child immediately,” pleaded a father, holding the hand of one of the rescue team members. Heavy slabs of concrete, rubble, and unstable parts of the building hampered search and rescue efforts, said Nanang Sigit, a search and rescue officer leading the operation.Heavy equipment was available but not being used due to concerns it could cause further collapse. “We have been running oxygen and water to those still trapped under the debris and keeping them alive while we work hard to get them out,” Sigit said.He added that rescuers had seen several bodies under the rubble but were focused on saving those still alive. Several hundred rescuers participated in the effort, equipped with breathing apparatus, extrication tools, medical evacuation equipment, and other support devices.The students had been performing afternoon prayers in a building undergoing an unauthorised expansion when it suddenly collapsed on top of them, provincial police spokesperson Jules Abraham Abast said. Residents, teachers, and administrators assisted injured students, many with head injuries and broken bones.Female students were praying in another part of the building and managed to escape, survivors said. One male student, a thirteen-year-old boy, was killed, and ninety-nine other students were injured and taken to hospitals, some in critical condition, officials said. Authorities were investigating the cause of the collapse. Abast said the old prayer hall was two stories, but two additional floors were being added without a permit.“The old building's foundation was apparently unable to support two floors of concrete and collapsed during the pouring process,” Abast said.","Rescue workers, police, and soldiers pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java.

Nepal PM Oli ‘Planning To Flee To Dubai’, Gen Z Bring ‘Corrupt’ Govt To Its Knees | Watch





Nepal's former Prime Minister and CPN-UML chairman KP Sharma Oli has publicly dismissed speculation that he plans to leave the country, accusing the Sushila Karki-led government of attempting to strip him of his security and official entitlements amid ongoing political tension, reported news agency ANI.Addressing a gathering of Yuwa Sangh Nepal, the youth wing of his party, in Gundu, Bhaktapur, Oli declared, ""Do you think we will flee by handing over the nation to this groundless government?"" He said he remained committed to restoring “peace, good governance and constitutional order”, as quoted by the agency.Oli’s remarks come weeks after the fall of his government on September 9, which followed large-scale Gen Z-led protests. Since vacating the Prime Minister’s official residence in Baluwatar, Oli has relocated to a rented house in Gundu, following an arson attack on his private residence in Balkot by protestors.The CPN-UML chief alleged that the current administration lacked democratic legitimacy and was formed through “vandalism and arson”, not the people’s mandate.Challenging the government to disclose any communication he had with state authorities during the protests, Oli said, “Publish them with courage.Make public the instructions I gave.” He denied any wrongdoing and questioned the basis of efforts to link him to the violent unrest.He also raised concerns over reported threats to his safety and criticised the government for inaction. “On social media, there are open calls to attack my residence. What is the government doing? Just watching?” he asked.The former PM expressed strong objection to reports that the government was planning to withhold passports of several political leaders, including himself, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Arzu Rana Deuba, Ramesh Lekhak, and Deepak Khadka.Oli accused the ruling dispensation of creating a climate of insecurity and targeting opposition leaders. “This government is throwing the country into insecurity,” he alleged.Meanwhile, a recent monitoring report by Nepal’s national human rights commission (NHRC) blamed the previous government, led by Oli and then-home minister Ramesh Lekhak, for failing to anticipate the scale of the Gen Z protests. The NHRC said that while the initial demonstrations on September 8 were peaceful, the use of excessive force by security personnel on September 9 led to dozens of deaths and widespread violence.Rights groups have held Oli and Lekhak accountable for the crackdown, which played a key role in the fall of their administration. The NHRC report highlighted poor coordination, declining morale among security forces, and inadequate preparation as contributing factors to the high casualties.","KP Sharma Oli accuses Sushila Karki-led government of attempting to strip him of his security and official entitlements.

At least two Jewish were killed and three others critically injured in a car-ramming and stabbing attack outside Manchester’s Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue on Yom Kippur.Police identified the victims as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. Authorities confirmed that one victim was fatally hit by police gunfire during their response to the assailant, calling it a “tragic and unforeseen consequence.”The suspect, 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, a British national of Syrian descent, was shot dead on site. Investigators are treating the assault as a suspected terror attack.The suspect, a British citizen of Syrian descent who was living in Prestwitch, Manchester, entered the UK as a very young child and was granted British citizenship in 2006 as a minor.Greater Manchester Police said late on Friday that at this stage in its investigation it believes Al-Shamie ""may have been influenced by extreme Islamist ideology."" However, it said establishing the full circumstances of the attack will likely take some time.The suspect's name has not appeared in initial searches of police and security service counter-terrorism records. But Greater Manchester Police said he had a non-counter-terror criminal history, including ""a recent arrest for rape, which resulted in him being bailed.""His family said in a statement: ""We fully distance ourselves from this attack and express our deep shock and sorrow over what has happened. Our hearts and thoughts are with the victims and their families, and we pray for their strength and comfort.""In a statement, the UK police revealed that they have arrested six people in the Manchester synagogue attack. All the six were arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism.“We have now arrested three further people, one man and two women, aged between 18 and mid-40s. This brings the number of people in custody arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism to six,"" the police said in a statement.“We will be seeking warrants of further detention for all six individuals and will seek to issue an update on this later,"" it added.Police responded to reports of a car driving towards members of the public and a man stabbing at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue at 09.31 BST on Thursday.Officers declared a major incident and arrived at the scene in north Manchester within seven minutes, shooting dead the suspect at 09.38 BST, who police said had a bomb.A large number of people were worshipping at the synagogue at the time and were held inside while the surrounding area was made safe. Greater Manchester Police said worshippers and security staff demonstrated ""immediate bravery"" and helped stop the attacker from entering the building.In an update on Friday evening, police said witnesses had described seeing a man ""acting suspiciously"" outside the synagogue before the attack, who then walked away after being confronted by security. The police said they do not believe that incident was reported to them, but about 15 minutes later ""the individual returned in a vehicle and began his horrific attack"".""We have been told from witness accounts that a man was seen acting suspiciously outside the synagogue before he was confronted by security and walked away.

She then saw a man ""jump out"" and start running towards the people ""with a knife and he just started going on a bit of a rampage"", she said, calling the scene ""traumatising"".Inside the synagogue, Rabbi Daniel Walker described running into the foyer and seeing ""a terrorist trying to batter his way into the synagogue"".

LONDON: For the first time in the Church of England’s 491-year history, a woman has been appointed to lead it.On Friday Downing Street announced that Bishop of London Dame Sarah Mullally, 63, who became a Christian aged 16, would be the successor to Justin Welby who resigned in Jan over his handling of a child sex abuse scandal.Currently known as the Archbishop of Canterbury-designate, she will legally become the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury at her confirmation of election at St Paul’s Cathedral in Jan 2026, with a service of installation taking place at Canterbury Cathedral in March 2026.Mullally has been Bishop of London since 2018, the first woman appointed to that role too. Prior to her ordination in 2001, she was chief nursing officer for England — the youngest person ever to be appointed to that role at the age of 37 — having previously specialised as a cancer nurse.The Crown Nominations Commission (CNC) for Canterbury nominated Mullaly following a process of public consultation and prayerful discernment that began in Feb. The CNC was made up of representatives from the Church of England, global Anglican Communion and the Diocese of Canterbury.The most senior bishop in the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury’s ministry combines many roles, including serving as primus inter pares — or first among equals — of the Primates of the global Anglican Communion, which consists of around 85 million people, across 165 countries, including India.The Archbishop of Canterbury also sits in the House of Lords.Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, commended the appointment and called on the Roman Catholic Church to follow suit. Quoting Hindu scriptures, he said: “ Where women are honoured, there the Gods are pleased.”But Gafcon, a movement of Conservative global Anglicans, which is opposed to the ordination of women to holy orders, said it did not accept Mullaly as leader. “Since the newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury has failed to guard the faith and is complicit in introducing practices and beliefs that violate both the plain and canonical sense of Scripture and the Church’s historic and consensual interpretation of it, she cannot provide leadership to the Anglican Communion,” said Dr Laurent Mbanda, chairman, Gafcon Primates Council. “The majority of the Anglican Communion still believes that the Bible requires a male-only episcopacy.”","Dame Sarah Mullally, 63, became a Christian aged 16.

2 Killed in Yom Kippur Stabbing Near Manchester Synagogue, Suspect Shot by Police





One of the victims of the synagogue attack in Manchester may have been fatally shot by officers during their attempt to stop the assailant, police said on Friday.In a statement, police confirmed that the suspect, identified as Jihad Al Shamie, was not carrying a firearm. “The only shots fired were from GMP’s Authorised Firearms Officer,"" the Greater Manchester Police statement said.“It follows therefore, that subject to further forensic examination, this injury may sadly have been sustained as a tragic and unforeseen consequence of the urgently required action taken by my officers to bring this vicious attack to an end,” the statement added.The incident unfolded on Thursday outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue, where worshippers had gathered for Yom Kippur. Two people were killed and three others seriously wounded after a car was driven at a crowd, followed by a stabbing.Police had initially said the suspect was ""believed dead"" after being shot. A bomb squad was later deployed amid fears the attacker was carrying explosives.The two victims were identified as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. Three others remain in hospital in serious condition.The assault took place Thursday morning in Crumpsall, a Manchester suburb, as worshippers gathered for Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.Police said a suspect rammed a car into pedestrians outside the Orthodox synagogue before attacking them with a knife. He was shot dead by armed officers seven minutes later. The attacker was wearing what appeared to be an explosives belt, later confirmed to be fake.Police identified the suspect as Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, a British citizen of Syrian origin who moved to the UK as a child and obtained citizenship in 2006. Authorities are still verifying whether “Al-Shamie” is his birth name. The case is being investigated as a terrorist incident, though the motive remains unclear.Three people – two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s – have been arrested on suspicion of preparing or assisting acts of terrorism. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the attacker had not previously been known to police or to Prevent, the UK’s counter-radicalisation programme. “It’s too early to say whether he acted alone or as part of a wider network,” she said.Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis condemned the attack as the product of “an unrelenting wave of Jew hatred.” Writing on social media, he said: “This is the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come.”Political and religious leaders have pledged reassurance to Britain’s 300,000-strong Jewish community following the attack.","One of the victims of the synagogue attack in Manchester may have been fatally shot by officers.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed that the attack outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Manchester was a targeted terrorist act against Jews. Speaking after chairing an emergency meeting in London, cutting short his trip to a European summit in Denmark. Starmer described the incident as “a vile terrorist attack” motivated by antisemitism.Two Jewish men were killed and three others seriously injured in the Thursday attack. Police confirmed the victims were targeted specifically because of their faith.Starmer also addressed the public on X (formerly Twitter), writing: “This was a vile terrorist attack that attacked Jews, because they are Jews. Antisemitism is a hatred that is rising, once again. Britain must defeat it, once again. To every Jewish person in this country: I promise that I will do everything in my power to guarantee you the security you deserve.”The attack is being treated as a suspected antisemitic terror attack , with authorities alleging that the assailant deliberately targeted and killed Jewish people.Police identified the attacker as a UK citizen of Syrian origin, who was shot dead by armed officers within minutes of the first emergency call.Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the man was wearing a vest resembling an explosive device, which was later confirmed to be fake. He has been named by the police as Jihad Al-Shamie.Within hours of the attack, three other people, two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s, were arrested on suspicion of terror-related offenses, as reported by AFP.The incident unfolded on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, and was declared a terrorist incident by counter-terror officers. Many Orthodox Jewish worshippers, observing Yom Kippur without phones or computers, only learned of the attack after sundown.The attacker reportedly drove into a crowd gathered outside the Synagogue before launching a stabbing spree, leaving multiple victims seriously wounded, according to AFP. A woman who also identified as a Jew and lives next door to the synagogue said that as soon as the suspect got out of the car, he ""started stabbing anyone near him,"" reported BBC.Chief Constable Stephen Watson said the attacker first rammed a car into people gathered outside the synagogue before stabbing victims with a knife. Officers opened fire after issuing warnings, preventing the suspect from entering the building. “They gave him a couple of warnings, he didn't listen until they opened fire,"" the witness told AFP.GMP said they received an alert shortly after 9:30 AM (0830 GMT) that a car had driven into people outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue and that a security guard had been attacked with a knife. They praised the residents for alerting them swiftly, saying the response prevented an even greater tragedy.Two prominent Jewish organizations in the UK told CNN that the attack at the synagogue was sadly something they feared was coming. “As we emerge from the fast of Yom Kippur, the holiest day in our calendar, many in our community will only now be learning of the horrific attack on Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation in Manchester,” a joint statement from the Jewish Leadership Council and Board of Deputies of British Jews said. They called on those in positions of power and influence to take strong action to combat hatred against the Jewish community and reiterated their support for the authorities in protecting their people.The attack has drawn global condemnation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it a “barbaric attack,” while Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar accused British authorities of failing to curb antisemitic and anti-Israel incitement. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the targeting of a synagogue on Yom Kippur as “particularly heinous,” and King Charles III and Queen Camilla said they were “deeply shocked and saddened”, reported AFP.The incident comes just days before the second anniversary of Hamas’s October 7 assault on Israel, which triggered the ongoing Gaza war. Analysts noted it was among the worst antisemitic attacks in Europe since then.Manchester, home to more than 28,000 Jews according to 2021 data, has faced grievously deadly terror attacks before, strikingly the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing that killed 22 people.",UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the attack was a targeted terrorist act against Jews. Starmer described the incident as “a vile terrorist attack” motivated by antisemitism. Two Jewish men were killed and three others seriously injured in the Thursday attack. Police confirmed the victims were targeted specifically because of their faith.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124287186,imgsize-685820,width-400,resizemode-4/image-90.jpg"
UK horror: British Pakistani jailed 35 years for assaulting minor girls; victims had 'deeply troubled home lives',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-horror-british-pakistani-jailed-35-years-for-assaulting-minor-girls-victims-had-deeply-troubled-home-lives/articleshow/124271448.cms,"



A 65-year-old British Pakistani man, known as Boss Man, a grooming gang ringleader, was sentenced to 35 years in prison for raping two schoolgirls in Rochdale.Mohammed Zahid, father of three children, who showed a ""chilling disregard"" for the girls, was one of seven men convicted in June of committing a range of sexual offences between 2001 and 2006. He gave the girls free underwear from his market stall, expecting regular sex for him and his friends in return, BBC reported.Mushtaq Ahmed, 67, Kasir Bashir, 50, Mohammed Shahzad, 44, Naheem Akram, 49, Nisar Hussain, 41, and Roheez Khan, 39, also received lengthy prison sentences at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court.The court heard how the girls were sexually exploited from the age of 13 in filthy flats, car parks, alleyways, and disused warehouses in the Greater Manchester town.Referred to as Girl A and Girl B, they were treated as ""sex slaves"" and expected to ""have sex with the men whenever and wherever they wanted."" Both girls, who were not acquainted with each other, had ""deeply troubled home lives"" and were provided with drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, and places to stay by the men, the court was told.During the sentencing, Judge Jonathan Seely described the treatment of the girls by the ""predatory"" men as ""appalling.""He said, ""They were abused, degraded and then discarded. It would have been obvious to these men that they craved the attention that their home lives didn't provide. They felt they had little or no choice but to submit to the almost incessant sexual abuse meted out to them.""All the paedophiles worked either at the market or as taxi drivers, the court heard.Girl A informed the jury that she may have been preyed on by hundreds of men as her phone number was circulated, adding, ""there was that many it was hard to keep count."" She told local children's services in 2004 that she was ""hanging around"" with groups of older men, drinking and smoking cannabis, the court was told.Girl B, who was residing in a children's home when she encountered the men at the market, claimed that police and social workers were aware of the situation but ""weren't concerned enough to do anything about it.""She said, ""It was in my file, when I looked it up. I read it. I was picked up by the police for loitering and prostituting from the age of 10."" Social services and police have previously apologised for their past failings regarding the girls.The convictions and sentences in full were as follows: - Pakistan-born Mohammed Zahid of Station Road, Crumpsall, was convicted of raping Girl A and Girl B, indecency with a child, and procuring a child to have sex and was jailed for 35 years.Mushtaq Ahmed, 67, of Corona Avenue, Oldham, and Kasir Bashir, 50, of Napier Street East, Oldham, both born in Pakistan, were convicted of repeated counts of rape and indecency with a child in relation to Girl B and were jailed for 27 and 29 years respectively.Mohammed Shahzad, 44, of Beswicke Royds Street, Rochdale; Naheem Akram, 49, of Manley Road, Rochdale; and Nisar Hussain, 41, of New Field Close, Rochdale, were convicted of repeated counts of rape against Girl A and were jailed for 26, 26, and 19 years respectively.Pakistan-born Roheez Khan, 39, of Athole Street, Rochdale, was found guilty of a single count of rape against Girl A and jailed for 12 years. In 2016, Zahid was jailed for five years after being convicted of engaging in sexual activity in 2005 and 2006 with a 14-year-old girl whom he met when she visited his stall to buy tights for school. Bashir was sentenced in his absence after he absconded while on bail before the trial commenced.Detective Chief Inspector Guy Laycock from Greater Manchester Police stated that the men ""preyed on the girls' vulnerability for their own depraved sexual gain."" He added, ""This horrific abuse knew no limits, despite their denials throughout this lengthy investigation and court case.They had a callous disregard for these women when they were girls and continue to show no remorse for their unforgivable actions all these years later.""Liz Fell, specialist prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, commended the men for exploiting the teenagers' ""difficult circumstances"" and praised the victims for coming forward. She said, ""Both victims have shown an enormous amount of strength and dignity throughout what has been a lengthy and challenging legal process.""","Mohammed Zahid, 65, jailed for 35 years for raping two schoolgirls in Rochdale. He was one of seven men convicted in June of committing a range of sexual offences. The girls were sexually exploited from the age of 13 in filthy flats, car parks, alleyways, and disused warehouses in the Greater Manchester town.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124271827,imgsize-14080,width-400,resizemode-4/mohammed-zahid.jpg"
How Indian nationals are snapping up British buy-to-lets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/how-indian-nationals-are-snapping-up-british-buy-to-lets/articleshow/124261789.cms,"TOI Correspondent from London:





Indian nationals are the largest non-UK shareholders of buy-to-let companies in Britain this year, according to analysis by estate agency Hamptons.Analysis of data by Hamptons shows that Indian investors are followed by Nigerians, Poles and Irish. Indians have made up the largest group since 2023; in 2022, they were the second-largest.In the first half of this year, Indian nationals founded 684 new buy-to-let companies, with more registered in Hillingdon than in any other area. Nigerian investors follow closely with 647 new incorporations. This shift reflects wider post-Brexit migration patterns.Buy-to-let companies are special-purpose companies set up to buy and manage residential rental properties.EU nationals now account for 49% of non-UK shareholders, down from 65% in 2016. There has been a general fall in shareholders from the Anglosphere, too. In 2016, Irish, Americans, South Africans and Australians all featured in the top 10. By 2025, only Irish nationals remained, ranking fourth. Instead, Indian and Nigerian investors are stepping into the spotlight, despite rents falling this year for the first time in five years.There were approximately 127,000 more Nigerian nationals and 178,000 more Indian nationals immigrating to the UK in 2023 compared with 2019, according to the Office of National Statistics.Twenty per cent of buy-to-let companies set up in the UK so far this year are owned by non-UK national shareholders, up from 13% in 2016. The remaining 80% are owned by UK shareholders. Seven per cent of Indian nationals who own UK buy-to-let companies set up over the past decade live in India.At current rates, around 67,000 new companies will be set up by the end of 2025, with around 13,500 owned, at least in part, by non-UK nationals. Companies are a more tax-efficient way of managing rental properties in Britain.Whilst London has always been an attractive investment choice for foreign landlords, between 2016 and 2025 the share of new non-UK national landlords has more than doubled in the East Midlands, West Midlands and Scotland.Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons, said: “While overseas-based investors are part of the picture, the majority of purchases by non-UK nationals reflect domestic demand. Up until 2021, this demand was most likely to come from EU nationals based in the UK, but since then it has shifted to reflect changes in broader migration patterns. Indian and Nigerian nationals are increasingly likely to buy UK buy-to-let property in a limited company structure. ”","Analysis of data by Hamptons shows that Indian investors are followed by Nigerians, Poles and Irish.

Why is PoK witnessing protests?





Ongoing protests in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) have raised “serious concern” among a UK parliamentary group, which has written to the British government over the unrest in the region.Imran Hussain, chair of the Kashmir All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), shared a letter on social media on Tuesday highlighting the issue to Hamish Falconer, the UK minister responsible for Pakistan at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO).Hussain, a member of the ruling Labour Party, wrote, ""Reports from the ground indicate a complete communications blackout, with mobile, internet, and landline services suspended across the region.”The Bradford East MP added, ""These actions have caused deep anxiety among many of our constituents, who are unable to contact loved ones. The atmosphere has been further strained by reports of heavy deployment of police and paramilitary forces, raising serious concerns about the safety and well-being of residents.""In its statement, the Kashmir APPG condemned both the communications shutdown and the use of force, calling them a “significant” human rights issue.It urged the UK government to engage diplomatically with Islamabad and press for a “peaceful and negotiated settlement” in the region.“We respectfully request that the FCDO urgently raise this matter with the Pakistani government and push for the immediate restoration of communications, de-escalation of tensions, and meaningful dialogue with stakeholders. We urge the government to act with urgency and moral clarity to prevent further deterioration of the situation,” the letter read.The FCDO has not yet issued a response. However, Falconer has previously reaffirmed the UK’s commitment to working with international partners to promote “longer-term stability” in the region.The protests initially began with demands for a regular and subsidised supply of flour and electricity in PoK.Over time, the movement has grown to encompass a wider array of issues, including reducing the privileges of the Kashmiri elite, abolishing reserved assembly seats, and securing access to free education and healthcare. Activists say the renewed demonstrations stem from the government’s failure to fully implement earlier agreements with protesters, fuelling widespread frustration across local communities.The protesters have now submitted a 38-point charter of demands, calling for measures such as ending the 12 reserved seats for refugees, rolling back elite privileges, completing pending road construction projects, providing tax relief, maintaining subsidies on flour and electricity, and reforming the judiciary.",Kashmir All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) writes to UK government over protests.

How Germany plans to fix its drone problem,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/how-germany-plans-to-fix-its-drone-problem/articleshow/124291088.cms,"A police man demonstrates the new police drone defence unit (Image credits: AP)

Closer cooperation between German army and police needed



First combat drones to be purchased



Learning from Ukraine



Rapid innovation and arms procurement







""We're really behind when it comes to defending against drones,"" defense minister Boris Pistorius recently admitted. Uncertainty is high after Russian drones invaded the airspace of several Nato countries in recent weeks. Suspected Russian drones have even been supposedly spotted over Germany. On the German television channel ZDF, Pistorius assured viewers that everything was being done ""to make up for this shortcoming.""Why is Germany so poorly equipped to defend itself against drones? One of the reasons for is has to do with the equipment needed to defend against drones. Shooting down incoming drones with fighter jets, as Poland recently did, is possible but also expensive and dangerous over populated areas.More suitable for this tast is Rheinmetall's Skyranger anti-aircraft tank, which can be deployed quickly and can also combat swarms of drones. The Bundeswehr, Germany's armed forces, has ordered 19 of these, which will not be delivered until 2027. However, military experts estimate that the demand is significantly higher.Its predecessor, the Gepard anti-aircraft tank, was decommissioned by the Bundeswehr years ago and later given to the Ukrainian armed forces.It has proved extremely effective in repelling Russian drone attacks.In addition to jammers, drones are also an effective means of defense against drones. The Bundeswehr has recently acquired German-made interceptor drones that capture enemy drones with nets.""We need to develop a multi-layered defense system that provides various options for shooting down or disabling drones — electronic countermeasures, kinetic devices, and then low-tech solutions such as net launchers,"" drone expert Ulrike Franke from the European Council on Foreign Relations told DW.Another challenge that Germany faces in defending against drones has to do with the distribution of responsibilities. At the moment, responsibility for countering drone threats is divided between the Bundeswehr and the police forces of Germany's 16 federal states.Defending against external attacks, such as those from fighter jets or large drones, falls within the remit of the military. The Bundeswehr is also authorised to take action if drones appear over military sites.In all other cases, drone defense is the responsibility of the police, who are responsible for internal security. If a drone is spying on a German airport or industrial facility, for example, the Bundeswehr cannot be called in.Although the police do have means of defending against drones, the challenge they face is getting them to the location where the drone has been spotted quickly enough. Security experts think that setting up a comprehensive ""drone defense shield"" over Germany is unrealistic.The separation of military and police duties has developed over time and is enshrined in the constitution. Given the current threats, the Bundeswehr will now be granted more powers to defend against drones. Interior minister Alexander Dobrindt plans to allow the military to assist the police, for example, by shooting down drones. The Air Security Act is to be amended accordingly. Dobrindt is also proposing the creation of a new drone defense center to coordinate the work of the federal and state governments.The Bundeswehr is not only stepping up its efforts in drone defense but also arming itself with drones. Recently, inspector general Carsten Breuer, the highest-ranking German soldier, announced that they would conduct their first live-fire exercises with armed drones at the end of the year.In March, Germany decided to procure so-called kamikaze drones for the troops. These are aircraft equipped with warheads that explode upon hitting their target. This is something quite new for Germany.It is no longer possible to wage war without drones, this became quickly apparent in Ukraine shortly after the Russian invasion in February 2022. Hundreds of thousands of drones are being deployed there. On the front lines, small kamikaze drones loaded with explosives are destroying expensive military equipment. The widespread use of reconnaissance drones means that no enemy movement goes unnoticed. This ""transparent battlefield"" has radically changed the nature of warfare.Drone expert Ulrike Franke recommends following Ukraine's example: ""It is absolutely clear that Nato countries need to look to Ukraine and learn from Ukraine when it comes to the ability to deploy, manufacture and modify drones quickly,"" she told DW.The Bundeswehr must now keep pace with these developments. Due to political concerns, it has long refrained from procuring attack drones. Critics feared that unmanned, remotely controlled aircraft could lower the threshold for the use of military force. There has also been much suspicion about the autonomous functions that many drones have.It was not until the war in Ukraine that this changed. In 2022, the German government decided to arm Bundeswehr drones for the first time. It ordered guided missiles for five Heron TP drones, aircraft-sized drones manufactured in Israel. Until then, the Bundeswehr had used only unarmed reconnaissance drones.It took until the beginning of this year for the decision to purchase kamikaze drones. According to the Ministry of Defense, this marked ""the beginning of a new era for the German Armed Forces."" The small disposable drones are known as ""loitering munitions."" This refers to the drone circling above the target before diving down and exploding.The categorisation of kamikaze drones as ""ammunition"" has very practical reasons: ammunition is fired and, therefore, consumed. A larger drone, on the other hand, is considered an unmanned aerial vehicle. With regard to flight safety and personnel certification, aircraft are subject to significantly higher technical requirements, thereby circumventing them.The German armed forces have already begun conducting training exercises on the deployment and defense against drones. This is now considered an ""everyman-skill"" that every soldier must master. A specific number of drones are being procured for this purpose and for immediate needs.What's more, the Bundeswehr is keen to avoid having to keep thousands of drones in storage. Technology in this field is advancing so rapidly that the usual approach to arms procurement, long lead times, long periods of use, would be counterproductive. So new contractual agreements are being made with manufacturers to ensure they can quickly deliver large quantities of the latest standard models when needed.German AI start-ups are the first choice now. Among them is Helsing, a Munich-based company founded in 2021, which has already produced several thousand combat drones for Ukraine.","Germany's armed forces have ordered 19 combat drones, which will not be delivered until 2027.

Babis pledges to run Czechia like a company



The billionaire rebel underdog?



Success in the 1990s



The move into politics



The Stork's Nest case



Babis in the headlines



Agent 'Bures'



The opportunistic populist







Andrej Babis has been dressing down for this election campaign trail, opting for jeans and sneakers instead of tailored suits and handmade shoes.He sometimes appears at these events wearing a wool sweater, sometimes in a black hoodie featuring his initials, AB, and sometimes in a T-shirt emblazoned with the words ""Czechia, everything for you"" or ""Czechia — against the green madness. ""Babis has rarely been seen on big stages during this election campaign, preferring to address small groups or speak from the platform of his election vehicle.He signs autographs, shakes hands, poses and smiles for selfies and seems to get chirpier the longer the events go on.This is 71-year-old Andrej Babis, billionaire, populist and controversial former prime minister of the Czech Republic.Andrej Babis has often been compared with US President Donald Trump , former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi or Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban. In reality, however, he stands for his very own, Czech brand of populism.Czechia goes to the polls on Friday and Saturday to elect a new parliament, and opinion polls suggest that Babis will be Czechia's next prime minister with his ANO party.When Babis appears on the campaign trail, he generally speaks out against ""the system"" and ""corrupt politicians,"" saying that the political establishment is incapable, bureaucratic and inefficient, that it disregards the people, divides up posts among its own, lies, cheats and wastes money.He claims that as a successful entrepreneur, he would do things very differently, running the state like a company. He also pledges to listen to the people, clean up the country in their name and help them to lead good and dignified lives.But although the billionaire likes to portray himself as the rebellious underdog in a hoodie and as the spokesperson of the poor and downtrodden, he has been part of the country's establishment all his life.Born in what is now Slovakia, he grew up in a family that belonged to the powerful elite of the communist dictatorship of Czechoslovakia.Due to his father's work as a trade representative, Babis lived for a time both in Switzerland and in France.After finishing high school in Geneva, he studied economics in Bratislava and later worked in foreign trade himself in a number of places, including Morocco.His mysterious rise to the ranks of the super-rich in the Czech Republic began in the ""wild 1990s,"" the period after the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.In 1995, he assumed ownership of the agricultural and chemical holding Agrofert, which he had previously run as director.Babis tells a number of different versions of the story of how he came to own Agrofert, though many critics see them as vague and sometimes implausible. Today, Agrofert encompasses about 250 companies worldwide, and Babis is currently estimated to be worth about $3.5 billion (€3 billion).He says that it was what he calls the intolerable state of the country: corruption, bureaucracy and lack of reforms, that motivated him to enter politics.In 2011, he founded the ANO movement, which stands for Action of Dissatisfied Citizens and is, at the same time, the Czech word for ""yes.""Ever since, ANO's most important slogan has been ""Yes, things will get better!"" and its promise that Babis will set things to rights in the country.The voters gave him the opportunity to do just that: Babis was first finance minister from 2014 to 2017 and then prime minister from 2017 to 2021.But his tenure became mired in endless debates about his alleged involvement in cases of fraud and corruption. The Stork's Nest was one such case.The Stork's Nest is a wellness resort near Prague for which Babis was granted EU subsidies. It is alleged that he formally took a company out of the Agrofert Holding for a time to make it eligible for subsidies.Investigations into the Stork's Nest have been ongoing for almost a decade now. There have already been a number of rulings in the case, and in June of this year, a court in Prague ruled that the entire case had to be reopened.But the Stork's Nest is just one among many stories about Babis' alleged financial irregularities. For years, he has been in the headlines because of allegations of conflicts of interest, tax evasion, corruption, influencing the media and his past in the secret service of communist Czechoslovakia.He put his Agrofert Holding into trust funds in 2017. A court later determined that in doing so, he had obscured his role as owner. Babis was forced to sell his media companies in 2023 because of a law governing conflicts of interest.Like many populist leaders elsewhere, he has long been agitating against migrants and, more recently, against Ukrainian refugees. Nevertheless, it has been reported that his business empire employs numerous workers from non-EU countries such as Vietnam or Ukraine, sometimes under inhuman conditions.A court in Slovakia found that Babis once worked as an agent for the Czechoslovak secret service, the StB, under the code name ""Bures,"" though Babis denies this, and the issue has been the subject of numerous lawsuits between him and the Slovakian government.Whenever such a controversy pops up, Babis either says that he has ""done nothing illegal"" or that ""the system"" wants to take revenge and destroy him.While he was prime minister, there were mass protests in response to the scandals involving Babis and demonstrations for a ""clean country."" According to Babis, these were all propaganda activities organised by his enemies.Unlike his friend Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Babis does not view the European Union as the enemy.Although he is not the mouthpiece of Russian President Vladimir Putin , whenever there is talk of military support for Ukraine, he like to deflect the conversation, saying that he is ""a diplomat, not a soldier.""He has not so far had the political opportunity to reorganise Czechia, but it is not clear whether he actually wants to. It is possible that he is seeking the immunity that would come with being prime minister and would mean he no longer has to be questioned or appear in court.Babis is a smooth, some observers would even say opportunistic, version of a populist, a restless man with a huge ego.Babis once told the author of this article that he rarely sleeps, that he ""always has to be doing something"" and that he actually regrets having entered politics. At the same time, he said, the people in Czechia need him and he cannot let them down.","Andrej Babis is a 71-year-old billionaire, populist and controversial former prime minister of the Czech Republic.

Sean ""Diddy"" Combs and his former influencer partner hired two male porn stars, who were flown across the country for “Freak Off” referring to sex parties, according to testimony in a Manhattan court on Friday.In the federal sex-trafficking and racketeering trial, an anonymous witness, identified as ""Jane,"" informed the jury that she contacted the performers separately to join the couple’s “freak offs,” what she termed ""hotel nights"" during late 2021 and early 2022. She explained that the Bad Boys Records founder, whom she dated for three years until his arrest in September 2024, was attracted to the performers after viewing their content, New York Post reported.She described reaching out to ""Cabral"" and ""Antoine"" via Instagram, once whilst under the influence of ecstasy. She detailed their viewing of Cabral's content and subsequent discussions about his physical attributes.“We watched a few of Cabral’s videos back-to-back and we just started talking about Cabral and his size and everything” Jane said during Combs’ federal sex-trafficking and racketeering trial.The encounters involved intimate activities, with Jane performing whilst Combs observed.Subsequently, she engaged ""Antoine"" multiple times for similar arrangements, though the compensation details weren't disclosed.These activities were performed to gain Combs' approval, later evolving into virtual interactions. She stated that Combs requested explicit imagery from the performers.These encounters are crucial to the prosecution's case against the 55-year-old Combs, who faces potential life imprisonment if found guilty of the charges he denies.Jane's previous testimony detailed alleged abuse and coerced intimate encounters. She stated these sessions lasted between 24 to 30 hours from May 2021 to October 2023.The anonymous social media personality is expected to continue testifying for approximately five more days as the trial continues into its fifth week.","An anonymous witness, identified as ""Jane,"" told the jury that she contacted the performers separately to join the couple’s “freak offs,” what she termed ""hotel nights"" during late 2021 and early 2022.

"'The America Party': Amid spat with Donald Trump, is Elon Musk eyeing third front?

What began as a strong alliance between US President Donald Trump and world's richest man Elon Musk has now spiralled into a sharp public fallout. Taking the rift further, the Tesla CEO and former insider in Trump’s administration triggered talk of a political shake-up by asking his followers: “Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?”Based on the poll results, Musk floated the name “The America Party” on X, the platform he owns.The overwhelming response to the poll, led him to say: “The people have spoken. A new political party is needed in America to represent the 80% in the middle!” and added, “And exactly 80% of people agree. This is fate.”Later in the day, he also reposted a message outlining his ""vision to dismantle the establishment,"" while spotlighting arguments against the entrenched ""establishment duopoly.""The political rift became public earlier this week when Musk slammed one of Trump’s most touted legislative efforts, referred to by the president as his “big, beautiful bill”, calling it a “disgusting abomination.”The remark surprised Republican leaders and got a rare serious reaction from President Trump.“Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore,” Trump said from the Oval Office. He didn’t stop there. Taking direct aim at Musk’s businesses, the president said: “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.”Musk, in return, accused Trump of “ingratitude” and escalated the standoff by reposting claims, without evidence, suggesting Trump’s name appeared in government documents linked to Jeffrey Epstein While South Africa born businessman Musk’s talk of a new party has sparked a wave of enthusiasm online, he cannot run for president himself due to the constitutional requirement that the office be held only by natural-born US citizens.","Tesla CEO and former insider in Trump’s administration triggered talk of a political shake-up by asking his followers: “Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?” Musk floated the name “The America Party” on X, the platform he owns.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121687393,imgsize-921203,width-400,resizemode-4/121687393.jpg"

A contingent of men deported from the US to Djibouti, East Africa, are stranded in a converted shipping container alongside US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers who were tasked with their supervision after a court halted their deportation flight to South Sudan.According to US government reports, both the eight deportees and 13 Ice staff have started experiencing health issues.Since late May, eight individuals from Latin America, Asia and South Sudan, along with Ice staff, have remained confined at a US naval facility. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported that Ice officers began experiencing symptoms ""within 72 hours of landing"" in Djibouti, with ongoing suspected bacterial upper respiratory infections, the Guardian reported.The administration's plan to deport eight detainees with alleged criminal convictions to South Sudan was blocked by judicial intervention in May, upholding their right to contest the deportation through legal channels.DHS and Ice senior official Mellissa Harper stated in court documents that the detainees occupy a shipping container previously used as a conference space. The Ice officers are experiencing accommodation constraints, with only six beds available for 13 personnel.Harper's declaration noted that local burn pits have caused respiratory issues among Ice officials. She highlighted the challenging conditions, including daytime temperatures exceeding 100F (38C), and malaria risks due to lack of preventive medication before arrival.""Within 72 hours of landing in Djibouti, the officers and detainees began to feel ill,"" Harper stated, noting inadequate diagnostic facilities.Harper further reported: ""Upon arrival in Djibouti, officers were warned by US Department of Defense officials of imminent danger of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen. The Ice officers lack body armor or other gear that would be appropriate in the case of an attack.""The declaration outlined restrictive conditions for detainees, including single daily showers and security checks during bathroom visits, located 40 yards from their container. Harper noted insufficient lighting creates security concerns for both officers and detainees.The administration had initially attempted to return the eight men to Myanmar, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, Mexico and South Sudan. After these countries refused acceptance, authorities arranged their transfer to South Sudan in late May.Boston's US district judge Brian Murphy blocked this action, stating the administration had ""unquestionably"" violated his April ruling that guaranteed legal challenge rights for individuals facing third-country deportation.","Eight men deported from the US to Djibouti, East Africa, are stranded in a converted shipping container.

'It is exhausting': Trans military personnel decides whether to stay or leave







Transgender troops, who were serving the US military for many years, are now facing a difficult question: whether to stay or leave as the 30-day deadline ended on Friday.Last month, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a 30-day deadline for the trans troops, and according to that, June 6 is the final day for active-duty transgender service members to request voluntary separation under the Pentagon's policy.Following this deadline, the Defense Department will begin compulsory dismissal of remaining personnel with gender dysphoria, a condition where one experiences psychological distress due to a mismatch between gender identity and birth-assigned sex.For many, it is a wrenching decision to end a career they love, and leave units they have led or worked with for years. And they are angry they are being forced out by the Trump administration’s renewed ban on transgender troops.Benjamin Kibler, a sailor, felt honoured upon being chosen for the prestigious Limited Duty Officer position, a role the US Navy reserves for their most qualified personnel.The February 24 news brought joy to Kibler and his spouse. They began preparations for their move to Japan, which included his wife's resignation, selling their vehicle, moving to a smaller flat and disposing of their possessions.Their plans unravelled within 48 hours.Kibler is one of many transgender and nonbinary service personnel impacted by the Defense Department's February 26 directive, stating that service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria would be removed from duty.""The contrast between Monday's commission offer and Wednesday's declaration of unfitness is perplexing,"" Kibler told CNN. He continued, ""My performance isn't the issue. That's particularly difficult to accept.""By early May, approximately 1,000 personnel had volunteered for separation, representing roughly a quarter of the 4,240 individuals identified with gender dysphoria as of December 2024, according to a senior defence official. The Army alone recorded about 700 voluntary separation requests this week, a Pentagon official informed CNN. Other branches' figures remain undisclosed.Another transgender service member, who plans to retire said, “They’re tired of the rollercoaster. They just want to go."" and added, ""it’s exhausting.”“I’m choosing to stay in and fight,” a noncommissioned officer in the Air Force said. “My service is based on merit, and I’ve earned that merit.”Military branches have begun identifying personnel with gender dysphoria diagnoses. An Army memo, obtained by CNN and initially reported by CBS, outlines additional identification criteria, including previous grooming standard exemption requests and visible conduct within units or on social media.","June 6 is the final day for active-duty transgender service members to request voluntary separation under the Pentagon's policy.

Win for Trump administration: US Supreme Court allows DOGE to access social security data; transparency obligations limited,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/win-for-trump-administration-us-supreme-court-allows-doge-to-access-social-security-data-transparency-obligations-limited/articleshow/121684707.cms,"The US Supreme Court in Washington (File photo)





The US Supreme Court delivered two rulings in favour of the Trump administration on Friday regarding Department of Government Efficiency cases, including permitting access to Social Security databases with personal details of millions of US citizens. The court also limited transparency requirements for DOGE, formerly headed by Elon Musk The court's conservative majority supported the administration in these first Supreme Court appeals concerning DOGE, while the three liberal justices opposed both decisions, reported the Associated Press.These DOGE rulings emerge during a contentious falling out between the president and Musk following his White House departure, involving threats to terminate government contracts and impeachment demands. Despite both individuals confirming DOGE's continuation, its future direction remains uncertain without Musk's leadership.In one ruling, the court suspended a Maryland judge's order limiting the team's Social Security Administration access under federal privacy regulations. ""We conclude that, under the present circumstances, SSA may proceed to afford members of the SSA DOGE Team access to the agency records in question in order for those members to do their work,"" stated the court's unsigned order.Conservative lower-court judges noted no current evidence of DOGE mishandling personal data.The agency maintains sensitive information about most Americans, including educational, financial and medical records.Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson warned that the ruling creates ""grave privacy risks"" for millions by granting ""unfettered data access to DOGE regardless- despite its failure to show any need or any interest in complying with existing privacy safeguards, and all before we know for sure whether federal law countenances such access."" Justice Sotomayor supported Jackson's position; Justice Kagan also opposed the administration's stance.The administration maintains DOGE requires access to fulfil its government waste reduction mission. Musk had prioritised Social Security, which he labelled a ""Ponzi scheme"", emphasising waste reduction as crucial for decreasing government expenditure.Maryland District Judge Ellen Hollander deemed DOGE's Social Security investigations a ""fishing expedition"" based on minimal fraud evidence, noting unrestricted access endangers Americans' privacy.Her decision permitted trained, vetted staff to access anonymous data, with broader access granted upon demonstrating specific requirements. The administration contends these limitations impede DOGE's effectiveness.Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued the ruling exemplifies judicial overreach into executive agency management. The plaintiffs maintain the order's narrow scope is essential for protecting personal information.An appeals court previously maintained the DOGE access restriction, though ideologically divided. Conservative minority judges noted no evidence of ""targeted snooping"" or personal data exposure.Labour unions and retirees, represented by Democracy Forward, initiated the lawsuit. It joins numerous legal challenges to DOGE's activities, including agency cuts and staff redundancies.The judicial system has become central to challenging President Trump's conservative agenda, facing approximately 200 lawsuits on policies ranging from immigration to federal worker dismissals.In Friday's other DOGE ruling, the justices extended a stay on orders requiring operational transparency, stemming from a government watchdog group's lawsuit.Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington argues DOGE's federal agency status requires Freedom of Information Act compliance.The administration maintains DOGE's advisory status exempts it from FOIA requirements.While not resolving this issue, the conservative majority determined District Judge Christopher Cooper's document disclosure order was overly broad.","The US Supreme Court delivered two rulings in favour of the Trump administration on Friday regarding Department of Government Efficiency cases.

Did you never think Epstein was killed, Rogan asks Kash Patel





FBI director Kash Patel came clean about the Epstein Files on a surprise Joe Rogan Experience episode that dropped a day after Elon Musk claimed that President Donald Trump is named in the Epstein Files and that's why they are not releasing it. The timing of the episode caught JRE fans by surprise as it was shot when Elon Musk and Donald trump were nuking each other. Kash Patel was seen smoking and talking in details about FBI and Epstein Files.Steering clear of Elon-Trump drama, Kash Patel said people are pissed at him for the delay in releasing the Epstein files. He said he was not there when Jeffrey Epstein did the abominable act with the protection of a section of media who chose to protect Epstein because of the connections he had.Claiming that Epstein killed himself, Patel asked if anyone thinks that he and Dan Bongino would protect any information regarding the pedophile. Patel said it was the decision of the Donald Trump administration that all files would be released and they will be released ""as much as possible"", Patel said.The FBI director added that he knows that he would not be able to convince anyone that Epstein did kill himself in the prison cell, no matter how many files the FBI releases, because there have been 15 years of people coming in and creating fiction.Joe Rogan asked Kash Patel what he used to think about Epstein's death before he became the FBI director. Patel said he never had a suspicion that Epstein was killed in his cell and said that he had a different background that made him acquainted with jails as a public defender. He said he knew people who committed suicides in cell and based on the information publicly available to him at that time, he always believed that it was not possible for anyone to enter Epstein's cell and kill him.Patel said the FBi would release the video of the cell and everybody would be able to see whether Epstein killed himself or not.When Joe Rogan presented several opinions of doctors who claimed that Epstein's death and his injuries looked more like a murder and not suicide, Kash Patel called it a 'war of experts'. He said this war of experts where there will always be someone to say something in contrary will go on for years, but his current job as the FBI director is to present the public with absolutely everything.","Kash Patel said he was not there when Jeffrey Epstein did the abominable act with the protection of a section of media who chose to protect Epstein.

Trump vs Musk: DOGE staff fear fallout; public feud sparks anxiety over political targeting- report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-vs-musk-doge-staff-fear-fallout-public-feud-sparks-anxiety-over-political-targeting-report/articleshow/121684666.cms,"



Following the public spat between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk , staff members at the Musk-established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are reportedly experiencing increasing concerns about their professional future and potential targeting by the administrationCurrent DOGE personnel embedded within federal agencies are concerned that the public dispute between Trump and Musk might expose them to political consequences and affect their career opportunities, multiple sources with knowledge of internal discussions told ABC News.Personnel fear their DOGE connection could make them vulnerable if tensions escalate and Trump initiates an investigation into the government-reduction programme that Musk headed until his recent departure, the sources indicated. There are additional concerns that Trump's potential distancing from DOGE could negatively impact their professional standing.Musk, who leads Tesla and SpaceX, developed a close relationship with Trump during the past year while supporting his re-election campaign before establishing DOGE to support Trump's federal government reduction objectives. DOGE, as a quasi-governmental body, has sparked debates due to its agency closures and access to sensitive information.The relationship between the president and the world's wealthiest individual deteriorated into social media confrontation on Thursday, with Musk criticising Trump for ""ingratitude"" regarding the 2024 election, whilst Trump threatened to ""terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts.""The public clash between Trump andMusk has intensified, following Musk's disapproval of a significant domestic policy initiative by Trump. The conflict between the two wealthy individuals heightened on Thursday as they traded harsh words on their respective social media platforms, indicating the end of their previous alliance.Trump initiated the exchange by expressing disappointment over Musk's criticism of his administration's primary tax and spending legislation, what he labelled as his 'one big, beautiful bill'.In response, Musk claimed credit for Trump's electoral success, stating: ""Without me, Trump would have lost the election"".The deterioration in their relationship occurred after Musk's sustained opposition to Trump's significant spending legislation, which received approval from the US House and awaits Senate consideration.Following his departure from the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) after 129 days of service, Musk utilised X to denounce the bill as a ""disgusting abomination"", adding: ""Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong.""Musk expressed concerns about the legislation's impact on US national debt levels and urged his followers to contact their representatives to voice opposition to the spending proposal.During this disagreement, War Room presenter and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who has historically criticised Musk, urged the president to investigate the billionaire following Thursday's incident. ""This is a national security issue,"" Bannon stated on his programme Thursday. ""We're dealing with a very unstable individual out saying dangerous things about the president of the United States. He must be investigated . .. and all government contracts should be suspended.""Several key Musk associates who served as special government employees, including Steve Davis, the DOGE operational lead, left with Musk . However, numerous DOGE staff remain integrated across federal agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management, Veterans Affairs, Treasury, IRS, and Social Security Administration, the ABC News sources confirmed.Musk's exit represented a significant shift for DOGE's daily operations, as officials like Davis had managed DOGE activities across federal government for months.Following Musk's departure, DOGE staff will maintain their reporting structure to respective agency leadership, the sources indicated. The White House recently stated that ""DOGE leaders are each and every member of the president's cabinet and the president himself.""Sources further informed ABC News that some current DOGE federal government staff have begun seeking alternative employment. Despite concerns about future career prospects, several technology companies have shown interest in recruiting DOGE alumni, with Coinbase creating a specific hiring portal for former DOGE staff.Meanwhile, regarding potential DOGE investigations, a White House adviser indicated the president's focus remains on his signature spending legislation, the ""Big Beautiful Bill.""Despite the public disagreement, Trump has not publicly criticised DOGE and previously praised the initiative. During a recent Oval Office press event, Trump commended Musk's transformation of Washington's operational methods and described DOGE as a significant government reform programme.Upon leaving the Trump administration, Musk minimised DOGE's dependence on his leadership, stating, ""DOGE is a way of life, like Buddhism. You wouldn't ask the question, 'Who would lead Buddhism?'""",Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staff are experiencing increasing concerns about their professional future and potential targeting by the administration.

She further expressed gratitude to El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele for facilitating Abrego Garcia's return to US soil.

One federal judge cautioned this situation could create an ""incipient crisis"" between the governmental branches.In the Middle District of Tennessee, Abrego Garcia faces two criminal charges: conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and the actual transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.According to the indictment revealed on Friday afternoon, Abrego Garcia and his associates are accused of facilitating the entry of thousands of undocumented immigrants from various Central American nations into the US in recent years, ""many of whom were MS-13 members and associates.""The administration's approach and legal positions have consistently troubled judges across the political spectrum, who expressed concern about officials' apparent disregard for due process rights, particularly given their casual response to the deportation, which various administration solicitors termed an ""administrative error"" they could not address.Whilst Abrego Garcia's is confirmed by US media outlets, his long-term residence in the US remains uncertain. His deportation to a high-security prison in El Salvador violated a 2019 judicial order prohibiting his removal to his native country due to potential gang violence risks. However, this ruling did not prevent his removal to another nation.Abrego Garcia, who hails from El Salvador, entered the United States without documentation sometime around 2011. Immigration authorities apprehended him in Maryland in 2019. Subsequently, a judicial ruling permitted his continued stay in the country, citing safety concerns if he were to return to his homeland; still he was deported.His spouse, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, who holds US citizenship, has criticised both the Trump and Bukele governments, stating they are engaging in ""political games"" at the expense of her husband's wellbeing. Neither in the United States nor in El Salvador does García have any criminal history, and he has never faced accusations of gang-affiliated activities.The administration has previously indicated that upon his return to the US, they might consider deportation to a different country or attempt to nullify the 2019 order.US District Judge Paula Xinis has permitted an investigative process to determine the government's compliance with her instruction to return Abrego Garcia to the US. Recently, the case has received less public attention as this discovery process continues largely away from public scrutiny.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, has returned to the U.S. to face federal criminal charges.

NEW DELHI: US Congressman Brad Sherman on Thursday made a pointed advise to a Pakistani delegation, led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, that the country should ""do all it can"" to eliminate terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad from the region and ensure protection of religious minorities in the country.In a social media post on X, Sherman said that he emphasised to the Pakistani delegation the importance of combatting terrorism and, in particular, the group Jaish-e-Mohammed, who murdered Daniel Pearl in 2002.""I emphasized to the Pakistani delegation the importance of combatting terrorism, and in particular, the group Jaish-e-Mohammed, who murdered my constituent Daniel Pearl in 2002,"" the Congressman said.""Pearl’s family continues to live in my district, and Pakistan should do all it can to eliminate this vile group and combat terrorism in the region,"" he added.Daniel was kidnapped by jihadi terrorists in January 2002 while he was on his way to what he had expected would be an interview with Pakistani religious cleric Mubarak Ali Gilani in Karachi.The US lawmaker also told the Pakistani delegation that the protection of religious minorities in Pakistan remains an important issue.""Christians, Hindus and Ahmadiyya Muslims living in Pakistan must be allowed to practice their faith and participate in the democratic system without fear of violence, persecution, discrimination, or an unequal justice system.”Sherman further urged the Pakistani delegation to relay to their government the need to free Dr Shakil Afridi, who continues to languish in prison for helping the United States kill Osama bin Laden.“Freeing Dr Afridi represents an important step in bringing closure for victims of 9/11,” he said.Afridi is a Pakistani physician who helped the CIA run a polio vaccination programme in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to collect DNA samples of bin Laden’s family.Afridi was arrested by Pakistani authorities shortly after the American raid on bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad in May 2011.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif has urged the US to broker a ""comprehensive dialogue"" between India and Pakistan. Addressing an event at the US embassy in Islamabad on Wednesday, Sharif lauded US President Donald Trump for what he said was his role in defusing a four-day military clash last month that was triggered by the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 lives. India has rejected all claims of a US role in bringing about a cessation of hostilities.Sharif's praise for Trump as a leader ""against escalation and war"" was mirrored by Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in Washington. Bilawal credited Trump's diplomacy for the ceasefire and suggested that US mediation could facilitate broader talks. ""If America can help sustain this ceasefire, its role in arranging a comprehensive dialogue would benefit both nations,"" he said.

More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since April as Islamabad ramped up its deportation campaign targeting undocumented migrants, with Iran also increasing expulsions, raising concerns over Afghanistan’s capacity to manage the influx.According to Pakistan’s ministry of interior, over 135,000 Afghans left the country in April, followed by 67,000 in May, and more than 3,000 in just the first two days of June. The repatriation drive, which began in November 2023, has now seen over one million Afghans return from Pakistan, reported news agency ANI, citing ARY News.The deportation campaign is aimed at more than 800,000 Afghans whose residency documents have been revoked. Among them are individuals born or raised in Pakistan. Islamabad has accused Afghan nationals of links to terrorism and blamed Kabul for harbouring militants, a charge the Taliban authorities have repeatedly denied.Farmer Mohammad Wali, who crossed into Afghanistan via the southern Spin Boldak border, was quoted by AFP as saying, “We left behind our orchards... but we said to ourselves, ‘If we stay, maybe one day we’ll lose our dignity.’”With Eid al-Adha approaching, the pace of returns has slightly slowed, though crossings continue daily.Iran, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with similar measures. The UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) recorded 15,675 Afghan deportations from Iran in May, more than double the figure in April.The IOM expressed alarm at the increasing number of families, rather than single men, being sent back, calling this “a new and concerning trend.”In late May, Iranian authorities ordered undocumented Afghans to leave by July 6—a move that could impact as many as four million people, according to AFP. Already, more than 450,000 Afghans have returned from Iran since January.Both nations host millions of Afghan refugees who fled decades of conflict.But as economic conditions worsen and political tensions rise, public support for Afghan migrants has diminished. Pakistan, which still hosts around three million Afghans, has also warned it may revoke the UNHCR-issued refugee cards of 1.3 million cardholders by the end of June.The IOM has repeatedly urged countries to “immediately suspend the forced return of Afghans... until safe, voluntary, and dignified return conditions are in place.”The Taliban authorities, who remain internationally unrecognised, have echoed the call, asking for returns to occur in a “dignified” manner.Analysts view the deportation moves, particularly by Pakistan, as politically driven. Islamabad is under pressure to address domestic security threats, especially in border regions plagued by insurgencies.However, rights groups and humanitarian agencies warn that Afghanistan’s already fragile infrastructure is ill-equipped to absorb such a massive and sudden return of people.","More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since April as Islamabad ramped up its deportation campaign targeting undocumented migrants.

Baloch human rights group Paank strongly condemned the killing of two Baloch men whose bodies were found in Kalat, calling it another disturbing sign of growing violence and repression in the region.Samiullah, son of Muhammad Hanif, and Bismillah, son of Ghulam Sarwar, both residents of Padang Abad in Mastung district, were found dead on 3 June in the Ganda Gain neighbourhood of Sheikhri, Kalat. According to Levies officials, both men had been brutally shot, their bodies discarded and later transported to RHC Mangochar for formalities.Paank, in a post on X said, “Forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces on May 29, 2025, their executions are a glaring testament to the ongoing horrors of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings in Balochistan, a despicable violation of humanity that must be stopped.”The rights organisation said 2025 has already seen a surge in such cases. In February alone, Paank documented five extrajudicial executions and 33 enforced disappearances. Among the victims were Bashir Ahmad Marri and Arman Marri, who were reportedly executed in a staged encounter after being abducted in 2023.The group also referred to the tragic case of Rehana, who was shot dead in Awaran while trying to prevent her husband’s kidnapping.In April, Mehrab and Khan Mohammad were tortured to death in Kech after disappearing earlier in the month, while the tortured body of Sher Khan Nazar was discovered in Turbat two days after he went missing.Most recently, Zabid Ali, a resident of Chaghi, was abducted from his home on 11 May.In a separate post on X, Paank demanded the safety and recovery of three members of the family who “were forcibly disappeared in Pidarak area in Kech district.”On June 3, 2025, Pakistani security forces allegedly carried out a series of enforced disappearances in the Pidarak area of Kech district, Balochistan. Among those abducted from their homes were Sinkandar Baloch, son of Muhammad Anwar; Siddique Sabzal, son of Sabzal Baloch; and Ibrahim Yaqoob, son of Yaqoob Baloch. All three men were reportedly detained without any legal process, and their whereabouts remain unknown.Enforced disappearances remain one of Balochistan’s most alarming human rights crises. International watchdogs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have repeatedly urged the Pakistani state to investigate these abuses and take meaningful steps to end the practice, which leaves families traumatised and communities in fear.","Samiullah and Bismillah were found dead on 3 June in the Ganda Gain neighbourhood of Sheikhri, Kalat.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has accused army chief general Asim Munir of waging a personal vendetta against his wife, Bushra Bibi.In a social media post on Monday, Khan claimed the alleged animosity dates back to his decision to remove Munir from his position as Director General of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) during Khan's tenure.In a social media post on Monday, Khan claimed that following Munir's dismissal, the general attempted to contact Bushra Bibi through intermediaries, but she refused, stating she ""had no involvement with such affairs."" Khan attributed his wife's 14-month imprisonment and alleged mistreatment to ""General Asim Munir's vindictive nature.""Khan further asserted that Bushra Bibi, a private citizen with no political role, has been falsely accused and arrested repeatedly without evidence. “The way my wife has been targeted for personal vengeance is unprecedented. Even during Pakistan’s darkest periods of dictatorship, such a thing never happened,” he said, noting he had not been allowed to meet her in four weeks, despite a scheduled June 1 meeting.Turning his criticism toward the military-backed government and judiciary, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief accused authorities of suppressing democratic dissent and rigging the political system.He blamed the events of May 9, 2023—when military installations were attacked—on a so-called “London Plan” aimed at dismantling PTI. “Our democratic mandate was brazenly stolen, and corrupt individuals — Sharifs and Zardaris — were imposed upon the nation,” he said.Khan alleged that anti-terrorism courts and judges are complicit in the crackdown on his party and deliberately ignoring key evidence. “Despite repeated demands, they refuse to summon or examine the stolen CCTV footage from May 9, 2023… We are innocent. Our people are being sentenced without evidence and without the right to a fair trial.”Calling for a judicial commission, Khan demanded investigations into the deaths of unarmed pro-democracy protesters on May 9 and November 26, 2024. He also lashed out at the judiciary, comparing current Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa to the widely criticised Justice Munir, saying the institution is “driven not by justice but by a desire to protect their own jobs and privileges.”Khan’s remarks come days after a court sentenced 11 PTI supporters, including a lawmaker, for violence and vandalism on May 9 last year—an incident triggered by his arrest.The 72-year-old PTI founder has been in Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi since mid-2023, facing multiple legal cases.","Imran Khan has accused army chief general Asim Munir of waging a personal vendetta against his wife, Bushra Bibi.

A routine safety measure after earthquake tremors turned into a major security breach in Karachi, as over 100 inmates escaped from prison on Tuesday.Officials said the prisoners had been evacuated from their cells as a precaution following a series of mild earthquakes in the area, but chaos erupted when a group of inmates attacked guards, seized their weapons, and managed to flee.According to senior police official Kashif Abbasi, 216 inmates escaped from Malir prison before dawn. He confirmed that 78 of them had already been caught.Police teams were carrying out raids to find the rest. “No one convicted or facing trial as a militant is among those who fled,” Abbasi said.The escape led to a shootout in which one inmate was killed and three security personnel were injured. “The situation has been brought under control,” Abbasi added.Sindh’s home minister, Ziaul Hassan, explained how the jailbreak unfolded. The inmates had been moved out of their cells due to tremors. While they were still outside, some prisoners attacked the guards and fled the premises after opening fire.Prison Superintendent Arshad Shah said the escapees headed towards nearby residential areas. Residents reported that police later used mosque loudspeakers to warn them about the escaped inmates and requested help in identifying and reporting them.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah made a televised appeal, urging the escapees to turn themselves in. “They had only been involved in minor crimes until that point,” he said. “But they could face terror charges if they are arrested by police on the jailbreak charge.”Although prison escapes have happened during court transfers in Pakistan, such mass breakouts from within prison walls remain rare.Karachi has experienced multiple earthquakes in the past 24 hours, with magnitudes ranging from 2.6 to 3.4, according to the National Seismic Monitoring Center.", 216 inmates escaped from Malir prison in Karachi on Tuesday morning.

'Water is Our New Red Line': Pakistan Army Chief Warns India Over Indus Waters Treaty Suspension

NEW DELHI: Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season with a major dip in live storage at its two key dams - Mangla on river Jhelum and Tarbela on Indus - and the ""sudden decrease"" in Chenab river inflows due to regulation of water flow by India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack.The situation may further aggravate this month during early kharif sowing and this is possibly what prompted Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif to raise concerns at a conference on glacier preservation in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, last week to draw global attention to India's decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty Latest estimates by Pakistan's Indus River System Authority (IRSA) show the country is already facing an overall shortage of 21% in water flow and around 50% in live storage of the two key dams which play a crucial role in providing water for irrigation in Punjab and Sindh provinces of Pakistan and generating hydropower.Referring to its latest assessment of availability of water for summer sowing operations during May-Sept, the IRSA in its statement ""noted with concern"" that the ""sudden decrease in river Chenab inflows at Marala due to short supply by India would result in more shortage in early kharif season"".It declared an overall shortage of 21% and advised dam authorities and irrigation supply monitoring agencies to use water from reservoirs judiciously, ""keeping in view the crisis created by Indian short supplies in Chenab river"".Though the situation may improve with monsoon rainfall in the catchment area, possibly by next month, Pakistan's farming operations will depend more on how India regulates the flow through limited infrastructure of its own reservoirs - Baglihar and Salal - on the Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir.India has, so far, only flushed these reservoirs and made additional water storage available by clearing sediments. Besides, it also stopped sharing water flow data with Pakistan after putting the 1960 treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam massacre.Publicly available information on live storage of Pakistan's critical reservoirs shows that Mangla dam is currently left with less than 50% of its fill level (2.7 million acre feet out of the total capacity of 5.9 MAF) whereas Tarbela dam's live storage is slightly over 50% (6 MFA) of its total capacity of 11.6 MFA.Officials here believe that since India is under no obligation to share water flow data with Pakistan after suspending the IWT, it would be difficult for the neighbouring country to even manage floods during the peak flow season once monsoon hits the catchment areas of the Indus river system as a large part of it falls within India.Farming operations in two provinces of Pakistan, Punjab and Sindh, fully depend on irrigation canals linked to the Indus river system, which gets almost its entire waters from the western rivers — Indus, Jhelum and Chenab. Though India has full rights on the waters of eastern rivers (Ravi, Sutlej and Beas) under the IWT, inadequate infrastructure to use the waters by the Indian side benefits Pakistan.India is permitted to construct water storage facilities on western rivers up to 3.6 MAF but has not been able to fully utilise this, making Pakistan a beneficiary by default.","Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season.

Here's how the escape took place:





In a meticulously orchestrated operation, former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina departed Dhaka on August 5, 2024, under a veil of secrecy, amid escalating political unrest. She landed at Hindon Airport in India.Hasina's aircraft remained the most tracked plane that day. As per real-time data from the flightradar24 website, Bangladesh Air Force aircraft AJAX1431 become the most tracked plane globally, with over 29,000 people following its route at one point of time.The Bangladesh Air Force's Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft, designated AJAX1431, took off from Bangabandhu Airbase at 3.09pm, officially listed as a training flight. To obscure its trajectory, the aircraft's transponders and automatic geolocator systems were deactivated until it neared Indian airspace over West Bengal, The Daily Star reported citing sources.Upon approaching Indian airspace, AJAX1431 reactivated its transponders at waypoint ""BEMAK"" and altered its course from Kolkata to Hindon Air Force Base in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh.This clandestine departure occurred just 30 minutes before protesters seized the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's official residence.Army Chief General Waker-uz-Zaman, unaware of Hasina's departure, was preparing to announce her resignation. In a later interview, he acknowledged the volatile situation and the potential risks to Hasina's life had she remained in the country.""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said.","Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, 2024, amid escalating political unrest. She landed at Hindon Airport in India.

India's First Reaction After Bangladesh Bans Sheikh Hasina's Awami League Party

Proceedings aired live, a first for Bangladesh





DHAKA: Prosecutors at Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) on Sunday formally charged former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and two others with crimes against humanity and other charges, including mass murder, for their alleged role in a violent crackdown last year in which hundreds of people were killed.The other two charged for the crimes with Hasina are former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal and former inspector general of police (IGP) Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun.""We do hereby take into cognisance the charges,"" the three-judge ICT bench led by Justice Golam Mortuza Majumdar said after a prosecution team accused them of attempting to tame the student-led protests using brutal force. The tribunal ordered investigators to present all three accused before the court on June 16. Mamun is in police custody. Hasina and Kamal are residing abroad.Sunday's proceedings marked the start of Hasina's trial in absentia nearly 10 months after the ouster of her government following protests. Under ICT law, if convicted, Hasina and the co-accused could face the death penalty.The proceedings were broadcast live on television for the first time in Bangladesh’s history.The complaint, submitted by chief prosecutor Tajul Islam, outlined five counts of alleged crimes, including murder, attempted murder, torture and other inhumane acts.The accused are also charged with abetting, inciting, facilitating and being complicit in, as well as failing to prevent, a series of crimes reportedly committed against civilians by law enforcement agencies and armed affiliates of the Awami League. One count specifically refers to a violent crackdown on unarmed student demonstrators, which allegedly followed a press briefing by Hasina on July 14. Prosecutors claim that in the aftermath, Kamal, IGP Mamun and other senior government officials were directly involved in enabling and overseeing the assault.“Upon reviewing the evidence, we concluded that it was a coordinated, widespread and systematic attack,” Islam told the court. “The accused unleashed all law enforcement agencies and her (Hasina’s) armed party members to crush the uprising.”The ICT was set up by Hasina in 2009 to investigate crimes committed by the Pakistani army during Bangladesh’s war for independence in 1971. Six top leaders of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and one leader of former PM Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party were hanged to death after being convicted by the court. According to a UN rights office report, some 1,400 people were killed between July 15 and Aug 15 last year as violence continued even after the fall of Hasina’s Awami League regime.","Proceedings aired live, a first for Bangladesh.

Bangladesh unveiled new currency designs, marking a significant change on Sunday.The notes no longer feature the image of its first president, who was also the father of exiled former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, ousted from power last year.The nation is home to around 170 million people and is presently under caretaker administration following Hasina's departure, coinciding with the commencement of her trial on Sunday for allegedly suppressing the August 2024 uprising against her leadership.Previously, all currency notes displayed the image of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who governed Bangladesh from its independence from Pakistan in 1971 until his assassination, along with most family members, during a military takeover in 1975.""Under the new series and design, the notes will not feature any human portraits, but will instead showcase natural landscapes and traditional landmarks,"" Bangladesh Bank spokesman Arif Hossain Khan told AFP.The revised designs in this predominantly Muslim country incorporate imagery of Hindu and Buddhist religious structures, alongside historical buildings.The artwork includes pieces by the renowned artist Zainul Abedin, illustrating the Bengal famine during British rule.One design features the national memorial honouring those who sacrificed their lives in the independence conflict with Pakistan.The central bank released three of nine denominations on Sunday.""The new notes will be issued from the central bank's headquarters, and later from its other offices across the country,"" he added.""The other denominations of the notes with new designs will be released in phases"".The current notes and coins will continue to be valid alongside the new currency. This alteration reflects previous changes influenced by political shifts.The initial currency from 1972, after the country's renaming from East Pakistan, featured a geographical representation.Subsequent notes displayed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, leader of the Awami League, which Hasina later headed during her 15-year administration. During periods of alternative leadership, particularly under the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the notes featured cultural and archaeological sites.The Awami League received a ban last month pending legal proceedings against Hasina and other party officials. Hasina, aged 77, currently resides in India by choice, refusing to comply with an extradition request for her trial attendance.","Bangladesh unveils new currency designs, marking a significant change.

The relationship between King Charles and Prince Harry has reportedly deteriorated beyond repair, leaving little hope for a royal reconciliation.The 76-year-old monarch has maintained a reserved stance whilst being physically separated by 5,459 miles from his younger son, following Harry and Meghan Markle 's withdrawal from royal duties in 2020.The father-son relationship has deteriorated to such an extent that palace sources believe reconciliation is now improbable between the royal family members, according to the New York Post.""There is no turning back,"" royal expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News. ""King Charles remains tender towards his son but can't risk communication. Prince William now has absolutely no interest in mending fences.""According to Fordwich, the king's confidants advise against reconciliation with his son as it could potentially impact Prince William's future sovereignty. ""The animosity is so deep that William has shut the door on Harry. Charles is not willing to go against his heir's wishes,"" she added.The fundamental issue remains one of trust between the parties. A palace source informed The NY Post about the king's distrust of Harry, specifically referencing the Duke of Sussex's revealing BBC interview, which reportedly destroyed their remaining trust.Recent reports suggest the king, who is battling cancer, remains reluctant to repair relations with the 40-year-old son.""The king and William don't trust Harry and Meghan with any kind of confidential conversation,"" royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith told People, adding that ""the underlying issue is trust.""NY Post sources also indicate Prince William, Harry's estranged brother and heir to the throne, shows no inclination towards reconciliation. Meanwhile, the palace sources further claim that Camilla is attempting to remain uninvolved in the situation.A royal commentator recently suggested that the duke's only chance at family reconciliation would require maintaining a ""dignified silence"".This report comes just days after revelations that during delays in obtaining UK passports for their children Archie and Lilibet, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle considered adopting the Spencer surname, being Harry's mother's Diana's maiden name.The Duke of Sussex initiated discussions with his uncle Earl Spencer regarding a potential family surname modification, an action that potentially strained relations further with the royal establishment.The family currently utilises Sussex as their surname, and reports indicate they submitted UK passport applications for Archie and Lilibet, aged six and four respectively, using Sussex alongside HRH (His/Her Royal Highness) titles.According to sources speaking to The Guardian, prolonged delays in passport approval led Harry and Meghan to suspect resistance towards their children's HRH titles, prompting the duke to seek counsel from his uncle.Contrasting accounts have emerged regarding Earl Spencer's stance. Whilst the Mail on Sunday suggested Princess Diana's brother cautioned against the change, citing significant legal obstacles, sources close to Harry and Meghan refute this. The Guardian's reporting indicates Earl Spencer displayed enthusiasm and support for the proposed surname modification.","King Charles and Prince Harry's relationship has reportedly deteriorated beyond repair.

Painting believed to be only one Mahatma Gandhi sat for going under hammer at Bonhams,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/painting-believed-to-be-only-one-mahatma-gandhi-sat-for-going-under-hammer-at-bonhams/articleshow/121630792.cms,"TOI correspondent from London





: An oil portrait believed to be the only painting Mahatma Gandhi ever sat for is going under the hammer at Bonhams in July with an estimate of £50,000-£70,000 (Rs 58 lakh to Rs 81 lakh. )It is the first time this portrait has ever been sold at auction as it remained in British artist Clare Leighton’s collection until her death in 1989, after which it was passed down through her family.Leighton, reputed for her wooden engravings, was introduced to Gandhi when he visited London in 1931 to attend the Second Round Table Conference.At the time, she was in a relationship with political journalist Henry Noel Brailsford, who was a passionate supporter of Indian Independence. He had travelled to India in 1930 where he met key Independence figures. Afterwards he published the book “Rebel India”, met Gandhi in London in 1931 and introduced Leighton to him. She became one of very few artists admitted to his office and was given the opportunity to sit with him to sketch and paint him in 1931.In Nov 1931 Leighton showcased her portraits at the Albany Galleries in London.The following month, Gandhi's personal secretary, Mahadev Desai, wrote a letter to Leighton, a copy of which is attached to the backing board, which reads: “It was such a pleasure to have had you here for many mornings doing Mr Gandhi’s portrait.”According to the artist’s family, the portrait was on public display in 1974 when it was allegedly attacked with a knife by a Hindu right-wing activist. The catalogue entry states: “We have found no documentation to corroborate this, but the painting shows signs of restoration to what appears to be repaired tears in several places. A label attached to the backing board confirms the painting was restored in 1974 by the Lyman Allyn Museum Conservation Laboratory. ”“There is nothing comparable to this painting in existence as it was painted in his lifetime and was a painting that he sat for on multiple occasions,” Rhyanon Demery, head of sale, told TOI.The auction takes place from 7 to 15 July.","Oil portrait believed to be the only painting Mahatma Gandhi ever sat for is going under the hammer at Bonhams in July with an estimate of £50,000-£70,000.

Adivasis say Project Tiger and tourism are displacing them from their ancestral land,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/adivasis-say-project-tiger-and-tourism-are-displacing-them-from-their-ancestral-land/articleshow/121578694.cms,"Picture credit: ©Sartaz Ali Barkat/Survival





TOI correspondent from London: Indigenous communities across India are being pushed out of their ancestral lands in the name of tourism and expansion of tiger projects whilst the laws to protect them are being diluted and not implemented properly, Adivasis told a global press briefing on Monday.“They say India has got freedom. But I think Adivasi people have not yet got freedom,” J C Shivamma, from the Jenu Kuruba tribe, said at the online event organised by Community Network Against Protected Areas.She is among the 52 households who reoccupied their ancestral land within Nagarhole tiger reserve on May 5, 35 years after their families were forcibly evicted.“Some of our family members died when in the plantations, but our sacred deities, our graveyard, everything that concerns us, is still in the village, so we used to go back to bury our people in our ancestral land, but it was always a fight with the forest department toconduct rituals. We consider our ancestors to be on the lands, they become deities and this way we were tortured. If we have to die, we will die on our ancestral land,” she said.Shivu JA recalled how their houses were burnt and elephants brought to destroy their fields when they were evicted from Karadikallu. “This land is ours. It's not any tiger project or scheme of the govt for tiger conservation,” he said.“Our elders are very happy now.We are having our food, we are going for honey collection. We have our own water resource. We sit together in the evening, and they are teaching us songs. All these songs and lessons were silenced for 40 years.""“The forest department keeps saying that only after your rights are recognised, you can live on this land. We already have these rights,” he said.The Jenu Kurubas are filing a case against the Forest Department under the SC/ST Atrocities Act for withholding their rights and filing an appeal against 39 rejected forest rights claims.“Why are their rights not being recognised despite the notification of central legislation such as the Forest Rights Act 2006,” asked scholar Nitin Rai.“People across the country in different states are fighting the same battles. It is important to find a way to raise a collective voice for what is happening all over,” said lawyer Lara Jesani.","Indigenous communities across India are being pushed out of their ancestral lands in the name of tourism and expansion of tiger projects. 52 households reoccupied their ancestral land within Nagarhole tiger reserve on May 5, 35 years after their families were forcibly evicted.

Summer drought risk







LONDON: The UK experienced its warmest spring on record, and its driest in more than 50 years, the country's official weather service said on Monday.Temperatures for the season have been frequently elevated this century, according to the data from the Met Office, which said: ""Eight of the 10 warmest UK springs have occurred since the year 2000. ""The data ""clearly shows that recent decades have been warmer, sunnier, and often drier than the 20th century average,"" said Met Office scientist Emily Carlisle.The Met Office said provisional temperatures registered between March and May this year averaged 9.51 degrees Celsius (49.1 degrees Fahrenheit).That beat the last record, set in last year's spring, when the average was 9.37 degrees.The next warmest springs were in 2011, 2014 and 2007, according to the Met Office which has been recording temperature data since 1884.This year, the 128.2 millimetres (five inches) of rainfall recorded across the UK during the season was ""approximately 40 percent below the long-term average and still the driest spring in more than 50 years"", it said.""England was particularly dry, experiencing its driest spring in more than 100 years, beaten only by 1893,"" it added.The Met Office's Carlisle said: ""The UK's climate continues to change. What's particularly notable about spring 2025 is the combination of record warmth and sunshine, alongside very low rainfall.""""This spring shows some of the changes we're seeing in our weather patterns, with more extreme conditions, including prolonged dry, sunny weather, becoming more frequent,"" she said.The recent weather's dominant feature had been the persistent high-pressure systems, often coming from the Azores or mainland Europe.These had lingered over the UK since late February and blocked the usual flow of Atlantic weather fronts, allowing high pressure to dominate, the Met Office said.Last month, the Environment Agency (EA) called a meeting of its national drought group after it said levels in reservoirs were ""exceptionally low"".In the meeting, the EA's deputy water director, Richard Thompson warned that ""changing climate means we will see more summer droughts in the coming decades"".The agency added that, while there was no official drought yet, there was a ""medium risk"" of a summer drought without sustained rainfall.The UK government has said it would step in to fast-track the building of two new reservoirs.According to the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, no new water reservoirs have been built since 1992.Scientists warn that extreme and fluctuating weather events are becoming increasingly common as planet-heating fossil fuel emissions keep rising.","The UK experienced its warmest spring on record, and its driest in more than 50 years.

L ONDON: A Turkish-born man who burned a Quran in London was on Monday found guilty of a religiously aggravated public order offence, in a case taken up by free-speech campaigners.Hamit Coskun, 50, shouted ""Islam is religion of terrorism"" and ""Quran is burning"" as he set the book alight outside the Turkish consulate in London last February 13.District Judge John McGarva at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court found Coskun guilty of using disorderly behaviour ""within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress"".He was motivated by ""hostility towards members of a religious group, namely followers of Islam"", said McGarva, who issued Coskun a £240 ($325) fine, with a statutory surcharge of £96.""Your actions in burning the Quran where you did were highly provocative, and your actions were accompanied by bad language in some cases directed toward the religion and were motivated at least in part by hatred of followers of the religion,"" said the judge.State prosecutors insisted Coskun was not being prosecuted for burning the book.""He is being prosecuted for his disorderly behaviour in public,"" said Philip McGhee, for the Crown Prosecution Service.A passerby filmed the incident, which also showed a man, allegedly holding a knife or bladed item, approaching Coskun and appearing to slash out at him, the court heard.Coskun, an atheist who is currently claiming asylum in the UK, posted on social media that he was protesting against the ""Islamist government"" of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.His legal fees are being paid by the Free Speech Union (FSU) and the National Secular Society, which argued he was essentially being prosecuted for blasphemy, despite Britain's free-speech guarantees.The FSU called the verdict ""deeply disappointing"" on its X account.""Everyone should be able to exercise their rights to protest peacefully and to freedom of expression, regardless of how offensive or upsetting it may be to some people,"" it said.","Hamit Coskun, 50, shouted ""Islam is religion of terrorism"" and ""Quran is burning"" as he set the book alight outside the Turkish consulate in London last February 13.

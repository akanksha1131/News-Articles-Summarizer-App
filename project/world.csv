‘We will knock them down’: Trump draws red line on Iran’s missile programme; Tehran fires back with warning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-will-knock-them-down-trump-draws-red-line-on-irans-missile-programme-tehran-fires-back-with-warning/articleshow/126243009.cms,"Trump Threatens To Bomb Iran Again If It Dares To Rebuild Nuclear Programme | ‘Full-Scale War…’

‘Any aggression will face an immediate harsh response’





US President Donald Trump on Monday said that Iran will have to face “very powerful” consequences if it tries to rebuild its missile programme.This comes after reports that Tehran may be attempting to rebuild its ballistic missile programme at sites different from those targeted by US strikes earlier this year. However, this development is yet to be confirmed.Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said, “Now I hear that Iran is trying to build up again. And if they are, we're going to have to knock them down. We'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening.”“I don't want to say it, but Iran may have been behaving badly. It hasn't been confirmed yet, but if it is, they know the consequences. The consequences will be powerful, maybe more powerful than last time. Iran should have made a deal last time. I had given them an option,” he added.The US President also said that he has been reading reports suggesting Iran could be rebuilding weapons infrastructure, but not at the locations previously hit by US forces.“I hope Iran is not trying to build up, as I've been reading, that they're building up weapons and other things,” he said.“If they are, they're not using the sites that we obliterated, but they're using possibly different sites.”Meanwhile, a top political adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader said that any aggression against the country would be met with an “immediate harsh response”, after Trump threatened to “eradicate” any attempt by Tehran to rebuild its nuclear programme.“Iran’s missile capability and defence are not containable or permission-based. Any aggression will face an immediate harsh response beyond its planners' imagination,” Ali Shamkhani wrote on X.Earlier this year, the US bombed three nuclear facilities in Iran in an operation Trump has repeatedly described as a major success that “obliterated” Iran's nuclear programme.The strike on Fordow, a heavily fortified underground facility, reportedly involved the use of six 30,000-pound “bunker buster” bombs — weapons deployable only by the US Air Force’s B-2 stealth bombers.However, Netanyahu has recently warned that Iran is again expanding its ballistic missile activities and is expected to press for tougher action during talks with Trump.","US President Donald Trump said that Iran will have to face “very powerful” consequences if it tries to rebuild its missile programme.

'Limited military operation': Saudi Arabia bombs Yemeni port; targets alleged weapon shipment that arrived from UAE,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/limited-military-operation-saudi-arabia-bombs-yemeni-port-targets-alleged-weapon-shipment-that-arrived-from-uae/articleshow/126242885.cms,"(Picture from X)

Saudi Fighter Jets 'Bombard' UAE-Backed Separatist Fighters In Yemen In Huge Escalation Over South





Saudi Arabia early Tuesday bombed the Yemeni port city of Mukalla, saying it was targeting a shipment of weapons that had arrived from the United Arab Emirates for a separatist group. The strike marked a sharp rise in tensions between Saudi Arabia and the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC).It also added strain to the already uneasy relationship between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, who have supported different sides in Yemen’s long war against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels.Saudi Arabia’s state news agency said the airstrikes were launched after two ships from Fujairah, a port in the UAE, arrived in Mukalla. The statement said the weapons unloaded from the ships posed a threat to security and stability, prompting a “limited military operation” to destroy them.The UAE has not yet commented on the strike.Mukalla lies in Yemen’s Hadramout region, which the STC recently captured. The city is about 480 kilometers northeast of Aden, the base of anti-Houthi forces since the rebels took over the capital, Sanaa, in 2014.Tuesday’s attack follows Saudi airstrikes last Friday that analysts saw as a warning to the STC to stop its advances and withdraw from Hadramout and Mahra.The STC had earlier pushed out the Saudi-backed National Shield Forces from those areas.STC supporters have been increasingly raising the old South Yemen flag. South Yemen existed as a separate country between 1967 and 1990, and recent demonstrations have called for restoring that independence.These moves by the separatists have increased friction between Saudi Arabia and the UAE. While both countries maintain close ties and work together in OPEC, they have been competing for influence and business in the region.At the same time, violence has also escalated in Sudan, another Red Sea country, where the two Gulf powers back rival sides in the ongoing conflict.","Saudi Arabia bombed the Yemeni port city of Mukalla, saying it was targeting a shipment of weapons that had arrived from the United Arab Emirates.

HIGH ALERT In US: 58,000,000 Under Winter Storm Warnings, 4000 More Flights 'Grounded' | Watch

Travellers faced flight disruptions

What is a bomb cyclone?

Blizzard conditions and power outages

Warnings remain as storm shifts east





A powerful winter storm rapidly intensified into a “bomb cyclone” across large parts of the United States on Monday, triggering widespread travel disruptions as the holiday season nears. The system grounded thousands of flights and brought blizzard conditions, strong winds and power outages from the Midwest to the East Coast.The storm, named Winter Storm Ezra, struck during one of the busiest travel periods of the year, leaving passengers stranded on Monday as airlines struggled to recover amid worsening weather conditions ahead of the New Year holiday. Visuals of the massive storm went viral across social media.Air travel faced severe disruption across the country. Nearly 6,000 flights were delayed and more than 750 cancelled by Monday afternoon, according to FlightAware. Since Friday, weather-related disruptions have led to over 3,600 cancellations and more than 30,000 delays nationwide, news agency AP reported.Major airports including Washington Dulles, Boston, Newark and Detroit imposed ground stops or delays due to high winds and poor visibility.Detroit Metropolitan Airport temporarily halted Delta Air Lines flights, adding to operational challenges. Airlines including American, United, Delta and JetBlue waived change fees for affected passengers.Road travel was also impacted as icy surfaces, blowing snow and near-zero visibility caused multi-vehicle pileups in several states. Authorities in parts of the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes urged residents to avoid non-essential travel, while the Federal Emergency Management Agency warned of dangerous driving conditions.A bomb cyclone is a rapidly intensifying storm that forms when atmospheric pressure drops sharply within 24 hours. This rapid strengthening fuels hurricane-force winds, heavy snow, ice and flooding rain.Meteorologists said the storm intensified as frigid Arctic air clashed with lingering warmth across southern parts of the US. The sharp cold front caused dramatic temperature swings, with parts of the central US experiencing drops of nearly 50 degrees Fahrenheit overnight. In Philadelphia, temperatures fell from near 60°F on Monday to the low 20s at night.The storm brought blizzard conditions to parts of the Plains, Midwest and Great Lakes, with dangerous wind chills plunging to minus 30°F in North Dakota and Minnesota. Snowfall reached up to two feet in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, while strong winds created whiteout conditions in several regions, Reuters reported.More than 350,000 customers were without power nationwide by Monday afternoon, with Michigan accounting for a significant share. In upstate New York, over 57,000 power outages were reported as freezing rain and high winds strained trees and power lines.Severe conditions extended to the Great Lakes, where waves on Lake Superior rose to nearly 20 feet, forcing most cargo ships to seek shelter. Along Lake Erie, strong winds caused water levels to surge on the eastern shoreline near Buffalo, raising concerns of lakeshore flooding.Forecasters warned that hazardous conditions, including snow, ice, flooding rain and strong winds, could persist into early Tuesday as the storm moves eastward. Parts of the Northeast faced freezing rain, while additional lake-effect snow and possible whiteouts were forecast in New York.Authorities urged travellers to stay updated on weather alerts and flight advisories as the powerful storm continues to impact large parts of the country.","Winter Storm Ezra brought blizzard conditions, strong winds and power outages from the Midwest to the East Coast.

From First Woman PM To Fierce Rivalry: Khaleda Zia’s Three Terms That Redefined Bangladesh Politics

Who was Khaleda Zia?

.

Leaders worldwide offers condolences after the death of former PM





Former Bangladesh prime minister and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson Khaleda Zia died early Tuesday at the age of 80, party officials confirmed. She had been undergoing treatment at Evercare Hospital in Dhaka. According to her party, Zia died around 6.00 am, shortly after Fajr prayers, after remaining in critical condition for months.A dominant figure in Bangladesh’s politics for decades, Khaleda Zia was the country’s first woman prime minister and the long-time political rival of Sheikh Hasina. She had been suffering from multiple serious health complications, including heart, lung, liver and kidney ailments, diabetes and pneumonia. Zia had been under intensive medical care since November.Her death comes just days after her elder son and BNP’s acting chairperson Tarique Rahman returned to Bangladesh from London, ending 17 years of self-imposed exile as the country moves toward crucial national elections.Khaleda Zia was born in 1945 in Jalpaiguri and grew up in Dinajpur. She married Ziaur Rahman in 1960, who later became Bangladesh’s president after seizing power as a military chief in 1977.Following his assassination in a military coup in 1981, Khaleda, who had never been involved in politics, entered public life and took charge of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in 1984.She emerged as a key leader in the mass movement against military ruler HM Ershad, earning a reputation as an uncompromising figure in the struggle to restore democracy. In 1991, she led the BNP to victory and became Bangladesh’s first elected woman prime minister, introducing the parliamentary system of government and later playing a role in establishing the caretaker government system for elections.Khaleda Zia served as prime minister two times from 1991 to 1996 and again from 2001 to 2006. Her political career was defined by a fierce rivalry with Sheikh Hasina, a contestant who shaped Bangladesh’s politics for more than three decades.In later years, Zia faced multiple corruption cases, which her party described as politically motivated. She was jailed in 2018 and remained largely confined due to illness after being granted temporary release in 2020. In January 2025, the Supreme Court acquitted her in the final corruption case against her, effectively clearing her name.Following Hasina’s ouster in a mass uprising in 2024, an interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus allowed Zia to travel abroad for advanced treatment. She returned from London in May but remained seriously ill and withdrew from active politics, though she continued as BNP chairperson until her death.Khaleda Zia is survived by her elder son Tarique Rahman, while her younger son, Arafat Rahman Koko died in 2015. Despite years of illness and imprisonment, she remains one of the most influential and polarising figures in Bangladesh’s political history.Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his 'sincere condolences' after the death of Khaleda Zia and recalled his meeting with former PM in Dhaka in 2015.In a post on X, he wrote: ""Deeply saddened to learn about the passing away of former Prime Minister and BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia in Dhaka. Our sincerest condolences to her family and all the people of Bangladesh. May the Almighty grant her family the fortitude to bear this tragic loss. """"As the first woman Prime Minister of Bangladesh, her important contributions towards the development of Bangladesh, as well as India-Bangladesh relations, will always be remembered. I recall my warm meeting with her in Dhaka in 2015. We hope that her vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership. May her soul rest in peace,"" PM Modi further wrote.Muhammad Yunus also expressed his profound grief over the death of former BNP chief and described her as a ""great guardian"" of the nation and a towering figure in Bangladesh's democratic history.""Begum Khaleda Zia was not merely the leader of a political party; she represented an important chapter in the history of Bangladesh,"" Yunus wrote in his message. The BNP has declared seven days of official mourning following her death.","Former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia has died at the age of 80. Zia was the country's first woman prime minister and long-time political rival of Sheikh Hasina. She had been suffering from multiple serious health complications, including heart, lung, liver and kidney ailments, diabetes and pneumonia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126242736,imgsize-347459,width-400,resizemode-4/khaleda-zia.jpg"

British journalist Mehdi Hasan condemned “brazenly racist and anti-Indian abuse” directed at Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy and his family, saying such attacks should be rejected across all party lines, irrespective of ideology.In a post on X, Hasan said he disagrees with Ramaswamy on politics and policy but called the treatment of him and his family, including his children, “outrageous” and “disgusting”. He said the abuse coming from parts of the MAGA Christian nationalist base crossed a serious line and deserved universal condemnation.Ramaswamy, who is campaigning for governor of Ohio, has faced a wave of racial attacks in recent weeks, particularly from far-right GOP figures. White nationalist commentator Nick Fuentes has repeatedly targeted Ramaswamy using xenophobic language and questioning his background and place in American politics. Fuentes has also said he plans to actively campaign against Ramaswamy in the 2026 Ohio race, urging followers to oppose him because of his Indian heritage.Even after being endorsed by Trump himself, Ramaswamy still faces comments calling for him to ""self-deport.""The attacks have drawn criticism from both sides of the political aisle. Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna described the rhetoric as “chilling” and warned that such race- and religion-based attacks are part of a dangerous strain of extremism in US politics. Some Republican commentators have also rejected Fuentes’s remarks.The row deepened after social media users began targeting Ramaswamy’s children, sharing images and posting abusive comments.Vice President JD Vance also weighed in after similar racist remarks like ""jeet"" were aimed at his Brown Hindu wife, Usha Vance.

Saudi Arabia is taking a firmer stance against banned and counterfeit pesticides, with a draft regulation proposing jail terms, hefty fines, and strict enforcement measures. The new rules aim to protect public health, the environment, and agriculture, while giving authorities clear powers to penalize repeat offenders.The proposed regulation introduces strict consequences for anyone involved in manufacturing or importing banned or counterfeit pesticides. Under the draft, violators may face up to five years in prison, fines reaching SR10 million, or one of these two penalties. The Public Prosecution will investigate all violations and bring the cases before the competent court to enforce the penalties outlined in the regulation. In situations where the offender repeats the violation, the prosecution is authorized to double the penalties to ensure stronger compliance and deterrence.Not all violations will lead to immediate jail time or fines. The draft clarifies that if a violation is minor and does not cause significant harm to humans, animals, plants, the environment, or public health, the violator will first receive a warning. Authorities may then provide a grace period for the issue to be corrected before applying penalties.The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) will play a central role in reviewing violations related to public health pesticides. Responsibilities of the SFDA under the draft include:Additionally, the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture can require violators to remove the cause of the violation. Repeating the offense within three years of a previous violation is considered a repeat offense, which can lead to doubling of fines.The draft also outlines strict measures for dealing with the materials involved in violations. These include:Beyond fines, the draft also allows authorities to temporarily close the facility for up to six months or even permanently shut it down in severe cases. Those penalized have the right to appeal the decision in the Administrative Court in accordance with its regulations.","Saudi Arabia proposes up to five years jail and SR10 million fine for banned pesticides.

Where Bahrain fits in the Gulf landscape





For years, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have dominated conversations around long-term residency in the Gulf. But Bahrain has been moving steadily in the same direction, aligning itself with a wider regional push to attract capital, skills and long-term residents as Gulf economies look beyond oil dependence.Across the region, governments are reworking visa systems that were once built around short-term labour. The aim now is retention, of investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, families and retirees who can contribute over decades, not just contracts. Residency has become an economic tool, not just an immigration one.Bahrain’s Golden Residency Visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Linked to Bahrain Vision 2030, the programme is designed to strengthen the kingdom’s competitiveness and widen its appeal beyond energy, positioning Bahrain as an affordable, stable and expat-friendly Gulf hub for investors, professionals and families looking to base themselves in the region long term.At its core, Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.Unlike traditional Gulf visas, it is not tied to a single employer and does not impose rigid stay requirements.Key features include:This framework is designed to support long-term settlement rather than short-term labour rotation, aligning with Bahrain’s broader economic strategy.Bahrain’s Golden Residency is deliberately multi-track. Eligibility is assessed through investment, income, or contribution, rather than a single capital test.The property pathway remains the most clearly defined route.The lowered threshold places Bahrain among the more accessible long-term residency options in the GCC, particularly for investors priced out of higher-cost markets.Beyond capital, Bahrain’s model reflects the GCC-wide move toward recognising non-financial contribution.This route applies to:Approval under this route is contribution-based rather than investment-based, but carries the same 10-year renewable residency and work freedoms.Bahrain is one of the few Gulf states with clearly defined residency options for retirees.This clarity has made Bahrain particularly attractive to retirees seeking long-term Gulf residence without employment dependency.All applicants must meet standard Golden Residency conditions:Golden Residency holders may sponsor spouses, parents, and dependent family members. Importantly, there is no minimum stay requirement to preserve residency.Bahrain does not operate a citizenship-by-investment programme. Citizenship remains subject to strict naturalisation rules, requiring prolonged residence, language proficiency, cultural integration, and government approval.While long-term residency offers stability and permanence, investors seeking passport mobility typically look to alternative citizenship programmes elsewhere.The Bahraini passport itself provides visa-free access to 95 destinations, including all GCC states, but remains more limited globally than European or Caribbean passports.Also read: UAE Golden Visa or Saudi Premium Residency; which Gulf nation offers the best long-term future? Bahrain’s appeal as a long-term base rests on a combination of practical advantages. The Golden Residency offers work freedom, family sponsorship and long-term security within a country that remains affordable by Gulf standards. Living costs, particularly housing, are lower than in neighbouring markets, while tax policy favours individuals through zero personal income tax. A large expatriate population, strong international schooling options, high safety rankings and a diversified, business-friendly economy make Bahrain a realistic option for professionals, investors and families seeking stability in the region.Bahrain’s tax environment remains one of its strongest attractions for long-term residents. The kingdom imposes zero personal income tax, meaning individuals do not pay tax on salaries, wages, capital gains or inheritance, a structure that significantly improves net earnings for professionals and retirees alike.That said, Bahrain is not entirely tax-free. A standard 10 per cent value-added tax applies to most goods and services, alongside excise taxes on specific items, including a 100 per cent levy on tobacco and energy drinks and 50 per cent on carbonated beverages. For most residents, however, the absence of income-based taxation remains the defining advantage.Affordability is where Bahrain quietly outperforms many of its neighbours. According to Numbeo’s 2025 Cost of Living Index, Bahrain ranks as the second most affordable country in the GCC after Oman.Monthly living costs for a family of four are estimated at BHD 1,076.1 (approximately USD 2,855), while a single person’s monthly expenses average BHD 304.3 (around USD 808). Bahrain is 25.3% cheaper than the UAE, with rental costs nearly 65% lower, and remains marginally cheaper than Saudi Arabia for both families and individuals. This affordability, particularly in housing, is a key reason Bahrain appeals to long-term residents rather than short-term workers.Bahrain is a majority-expatriate country by population. Official figures for 2024 place the total population at 1,588,670, of which 739,736 are Bahraini nationals, accounting for 46.6 per cent, while 848,934 residents, or 53.4 per cent, are non-Bahrainis. Large expatriate communities include Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Egyptians and Europeans, shaping a distinctly international social fabric.For families, Bahrain offers a strong education ecosystem. The country hosts over 70 private international schools, offering British, American, IB and Indian curricula. Costs vary widely, allowing families to choose between affordable and premium options within a relatively compact geography.Bahrain performs strongly across global development, safety and livability benchmarks. It ranks 38th worldwide on the UN Human Development Index 2025, with an HDI score of 0.899, placing it in the “very high” category and third in the Arab region. Safety indicators are similarly robust: Numbeo’s 2025 data ranks Bahrain as the 16th safest country globally, citing low crime levels and a strong perception of personal safety, including when walking at night. In expatriate sentiment surveys, Bahrain has also retained the top global ranking in InterNations’ Expat Insider report for the second consecutive year, reflecting high satisfaction with ease of settling in, social life and overall quality of living.Bahrain continues to market itself as a practical and cost-effective business base within the Gulf, particularly for companies that value regulatory clarity and regional access over scale alone. The country’s business framework offers several structural advantages:Taken together, these factors make the Golden Residency especially attractive for founders, consultants and small-to-medium enterprises seeking a Gulf presence without the high overheads associated with larger regional hubs.Also read: Saudi Arabia Premium Residency (Green Card); benefits, eligibility, fees, all you need to know Bahrain does not match the scale, capital depth or global profile of the UAE or Saudi Arabia, and it does not attempt to. Instead, it is deliberately moving in the same strategic direction, opening long-term residency beyond investment alone while lowering barriers to entry and focusing on affordability, work freedom and livability. With expatriates making up more than half its population, including large South Asian communities, Bahrain has long functioned as a migrant and expat society. Tax-free income, reasonable living costs, employment across finance, construction and technology, and a comparatively relaxed, family-friendly culture explain why its residency model works in practice rather than just on paper.",Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.

At least two ""male narco-terrorists"" were killed in a strike on an alleged drug-smuggling boat in the Eastern Pacific, bringing the total killed in Washington's campaign in the region to at least 107.In a post to X, US Southern Command said ""intelligence confirmed the vessel was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations,"" adding two men were killed.The post included a black-and-white video of the ""lethal kinetic strike"" on a small boat, with what appeared to be two explosive flashes and flaming debris visible.The US military's post did not specify where exactly the strike took place.Since September, the US military carried out at least 30 strikes on what it said were boats used to smuggle drugs to the United States, with the majority of the attacks occurring in the Eastern Pacific. Some also occurred in the Caribbean Sea.The administration provided no evidence that the targeted boats were involved in drug trafficking, prompting debate about the legality of these operations.International law experts and rights groups said the strikes likely amounted to extrajudicial killings, a charge that Washington denied.News of the latest attack came after US President Donald Trump confirmed Monday that Washington hit and destroyed a docking area for alleged drug boats in Venezuela, in what could amount to the first land strike of the military campaign said to target drug trafficking.In recent months, Trump waged a pressure campaign against Venezuela's leftist President Nicolas Maduro, who accused Washington of seeking regime change to gain access to the Latin American country's massive oil reserves.The US also imposed a partial naval blockade on Venezuela and recently intercepted oil tankers.Trump said he did not need lawmakers' approval to strike suspected drug cartels at sea or on land in Venezuela, citing concerns over information leaks.","At least two ""male narco-terrorists"" were killed in a strike on an alleged drug- smuggling boat in the Eastern Pacific.

Eyeing 2028: JD Vance’s secret role in saving Trump from a Musk revolt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/eyeing-2028-jd-vances-secret-role-in-saving-trump-from-a-musk-revolt/articleshow/126241680.cms,"JD Vance acted as a bridge between MAGA and Musk

'Eat S**t!': Trump's V-P Vance Loses Cool At Personal Attacks On Wife Usha, Says 'Enough Is Enough'

When the feud turned toxic



The intervention behind closed doors



A revolt quietly averted



Why 2028 looms large





Vice President JD Vance spent much of President Donald Trump ’s return to the White House quietly trying to prevent an explosive political rupture with billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk . As Musk’s public criticism of the administration intensified and talk of a breakaway political movement grew louder, Vance emerged as a behind-the-scenes mediator, working to keep the alliance intact. According to reporting by The Washington Post, the effort was as much about stabilising Trump’s coalition as it was about protecting Vance’s own long-term political future.Vance’s role was shaped by a relationship with Musk that predated his time in office. A former venture capitalist, the vice president had cultivated ties with Silicon Valley figures and positioned himself as a rare Republican fluent in both MAGA politics and tech-world priorities. That made him a natural conduit when Musk’s influence inside the administration grew and his frustrations with Trump’s agenda began spilling onto social media.Tensions escalated sharply after Musk publicly criticised Trump’s spending plans and suggested the president was blocking the release of sensitive files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The conflict deepened when Trump withdrew the nomination of Jared Isaacman, a Musk ally, for NASA administrator.For Musk, the move symbolised a broader sidelining, fuelling talk of launching a new political party that could fracture Republican support.As the fallout grew, Vance reportedly worked privately to contain the damage. He maintained frequent direct contact with Musk and lobbied Republican lawmakers to reconsider Isaacman’s nomination, presenting it as a goodwill gesture that could ease tensions. Allies describe the effort as delicate and largely invisible, aimed at stopping a public feud from hardening into an outright political divorce.By late summer, Musk had quietly abandoned plans for a new party, easing fears of a split within the MAGA base. Since then, he has signalled renewed willingness to back Republican candidates ahead of the 2026 midterms, suggesting a fragile détente with Trump. The truce, however, remains uneasy, with both sides aware of how quickly relations previously collapsed.Vance’s actions are strategic as well as loyal. Widely seen as a potential contender for the presidency in 2028, Vance is acutely aware of Musk’s financial clout and online reach. Musk, for his part, has reportedly indicated he views Vance as a serious future candidate. Keeping that relationship alive, the article suggests, may be as important for Vance’s ambitions as it is for Trump’s political survival today.","JD Vance acted as a bridge between MAGA and Musk.

"‘This isn't just about ending H-1Bs...’: Steve Bannon calls for 10-year immigration freeze, claims asylum system is 'too corrupt'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/this-isnt-just-about-ending-h-1bs-steve-bannon-calls-for-10-year-immigration-freeze-claims-asylum-system-is-too-corrupt/articleshow/126241473.cms,"



Former Trump advisor and MAGA bigwig Steve Bannon has called for a complete halt to immigration into the United States for a decade, arguing that the system is too corrupt to be fixed through limited reforms.Speaking on his War Room show, Bannon said the proposal goes far beyond ending the H-1B visa programme. “So this is why we're calling for a 10-year moratorium, no immigration,” he said.The Republican added: “These immigration and refugee programs and amnesty programs and asylum programs are so corrupt. Now it's in your face. You can't go through onesies twosies… Not just getting rid of H1B visas, but moratoriums across the board. [A] decade, until we get this mess sorted out.”Bannon claimed that there was too much fraud and abuse across immigration and refugee systems. He pointed to high-profile welfare and aid fraud cases, including those uncovered in Minnesota, as proof that the system is being exploited by organised networks at the expense of taxpayers. According to Bannon, these cases show that partial fixes will not work and that a full shutdown is needed to rebuild the system from scratch.A major focus of his criticism was legal immigration, particularly the H-1B visa programme used by technology and engineering firms. Bannon has repeatedly described the programme as a tool used by large corporations to suppress wages and replace American workers with cheaper foreign labour. In earlier podcasts, he called it “a total and complete scam to destroy the American worker” and accused Silicon Valley companies of importing “indentured servants”.He has also taken aim at foreign students who remain in the US after graduation. “I don’t think you should have any foreign students in the country right now. No H-1B visas,” Bannon said in an earlier episode this year. “Instead of stapling a green card to their diploma, staple an exit visa. You get 30 days… then leave.”Bannon claims that keeping foreign graduates in the US harms their home countries. “The countries of the world won’t get better if you’re sucking up every piece of talent,” he said.His views align closely with the hardline wing of the Republican Party. Vice President JD Vance has also criticised tech companies for laying off US workers while continuing to apply for foreign visas.","Former Trump advisor and MAGA bigwig Steve Bannon has called for a complete halt to immigration into the United States for a decade.

""""They’re going to be given a very short period of time to disarm.

'Foreign-born migrants' account for two-thirds of rental demand increase in US: 'Deportations must continue...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/foreign-born-migrants-account-for-two-thirds-of-rental-demand-increase-in-us-deportations-must-continue-/articleshow/126239823.cms,"



A recent report from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has revealed that foreign-born migrants accounted for two-thirds of the growth in rental demand across the United States. In states such as California and New York, migrant-driven rental demand grew by 100 per cent, the report said.The findings come amid President Donald Trump’s continued efforts to tighten border security and reform housing policies. Speaking on the issue, Trump said, “Eleven months ago, I inherited a mess. And I’m fixing it.”HUD officials say the surge in rental demand has put pressure on American families by increasing housing costs, particularly in major cities. Some migrants reportedly received HUD housing assistance. The main concern that arose was that taxpayer funds were going to individuals ineligible for support. To address this, the Trump administration has cut off access to Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured mortgages for ineligible residents and introduced a hotline to report illegal occupants in HUD housing.Beyond immigration, the administration has also focused on other housing reforms.The Biden-era Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) rule, which added regulatory burdens to suburban communities, was scrapped to ease restrictions and promote homeownership.“While working families were being ripped off by a massive welfare scam, Omar’s campaign took money from convicted fraudsters, her husband launched a firm that suddenly ballooned in value, and [Minnesota Gov.] Tim Walz looked the other way,” Kiersten Pels, spokesperson for the Republican National Committee told Fox News.The administration has also shed light on Opportunity Zones as a tool to boost homeownership and economic development. Trump said these zones have helped lift more than one million Americans out of poverty, with investments expected to exceed $100 billion, creating over one million jobs and supporting the construction of hundreds of thousands of new homes.HUD’s work extends to disaster relief, supporting more than 350,000 faith-based organisations, and delivering $12 billion in recovery funds to communities affected by floods, storms, and other catastrophes.Officials argue that resources must focus on helping Americans achieve self-sufficiency and the dream of homeownership, rather than being diverted by “radical political ideology.” To that end, HUD has cancelled wasteful contracts and restored safety to shelters for vulnerable women.","In states such as California and New York, migrant-driven rental demand grew by 100 per cent.

Did Trump back Russia’s claims? What he said about the reported attack on Putin’s residence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-trump-back-russias-claims-what-he-said-about-the-reported-attack-on-putins-residence/articleshow/126239632.cms,"‘I’M VERY ANGRY!’: Trump ‘Publicly Yells’ At Zelensky After Kyiv Tries To Burn Putin’s Residence





Russia on Monday accused Ukraine of trying to attack President Vladimir Putin’s residence in northern Russia, an allegation Kyiv denied, but President Trump, who just listened from Vladimir Putin about it, said he was “very angry” about the claimed strike.The Kremlin’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow’s negotiating position to end its war in Ukraine was under review after Russia claimed Kyiv tried to attack the presidential residence in the Novgorod region overnight with 91 long-range drones. Lavrov said all drones were destroyed by Russian air defences, with no injuries or damage.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia’s claims were “a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine” and undermine peace talks, according to a post to the social platform X.Trump later on Monday appeared to take Russia’s side. Speaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., he said: “I don’t like it, it’s not good. I heard about it this morning. You know who told me about it? President Putin told me about it. Early in the morning he said he was attacked. That’s no good, it’s no good,” Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, of the claimed strike.“It’s a delicate period of time. This is not the right time,” Trump added, likely referring to ongoing peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. “It’s one thing to be offensive, because [Russia is] offensive, it’s another thing to attack [Putin’s] house. It’s not the right time to do any of that. … I was very angry about it.”Asked if there was evidence of the attack, Trump replied: “Well, we’ll find out. You’re saying maybe the attack didn’t take place? That’s possible, I guess, but President Putin told me this morning.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Trump’s call with Putin, saying in a post on X that the president had “concluded a positive call with President Putin concerning Ukraine.”Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) later criticised Trump for appearing to side with Russia, accusing Putin of frequently lying. “President Trump and his team should get the facts first before assuming blame. Putin is a well known boldface liar,” Bacon wrote on X.Russia promised to retaliate against Ukraine and said targets were already selected for such strikes. “Such reckless actions will not go unanswered. The targets for retaliatory strikes and the timing of their implementation by the Russian armed forces have been determined,” Lavrov said, as per The Hill.Zelensky warned in his post that Russia would use the alleged attack to justify strikes against Ukraine, including govt buildings in Kyiv. “Russia is at it again, using dangerous statements to undermine all achievements of our shared diplomatic efforts with President Trump’s team. We keep working together to bring peace closer,” he wrote.Russia’s claims came after Trump and Zelensky met at the president’s Mar-a-Lago property in Florida for three hours Sunday. The two leaders later said they were “very close” to a deal and “90 percent” of the way there.“One or two very thorny issues” remain in negotiations, Trump said, with Zelensky confirming that key territorial issues remain unresolved.","Russia claims Ukraine tried to attack Putin's residence with 91 long-range drones.

Ilhan Omar is worth $30 million? Husband Tim Mynett’s ventures reveal shocking financial rise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ilhan-omar-is-worth-30-million-husband-tim-mynetts-ventures-reveal-shocking-financial-rise/articleshow/126239569.cms,"



Congresswoman Ilhan Omar insists she is “not a millionaire” even as reports suggest her net worth, along with her husband Tim Mynett’s, could be as high as $30 million.The disclosure says their combined assets range from $6 million to $30 million, according to the Washington Free Beacon.“Since getting elected, there has been a coordinated right-wing disinformation campaign claiming all sorts of wild things, including the ridiculous claim I am worth millions of dollars, which is categorically false,” Omar told Business Insider earlier this year.Omar and Mynett’s rise in wealth comes amid controversy over their ventures. Mynett’s firm, Rose Lake Capital (Launched in 2022) is a venture capital management company that reportedly increased in value from nearly zero in 2023 to between $5 million and $25 million in 2024. The company removed key officer names from its website, including former Obama officials, as federal prosecutors charged dozens in a $9 billion Minnesota welfare fraud case connected to the Somali community in Omar’s district.Omar’s political career intersects with the case, as she introduced the MEALS Act in 2020, which critics say relaxed oversight of government-sponsored children’s meal programs during the Covid-19 pandemic.This allegedly allowed fraudsters to claim millions of meals without verification while receiving government subsidies. Omar defended her actions, stating, “Absolutely not, it did help feed kids.”Mynett also runs a California winery, eStCru, which faced fraud allegations and a lawsuit over a $900,000 investor dispute in 2023. Despite previously being declared a failed venture, the winery’s value reportedly rose to between $1 million and $5 million in 2024.Omar’s net worth has skyrocketed since she first took office in 2019, when she declared assets between negative $25,000 and negative $65,000. Her campaign reportedly received $7,400 from at least three now-convicted fraudsters, though she said the donations were returned after the scandal emerged.The Republican National Committee said that Omar’s wealth surge raises questions about her financial transparency and the connections between her family’s ventures and Minnesota’s ongoing fraud investigation into Daycare centres.","Congresswoman Ilhan Omar insists she is “not a millionaire’ even as reports suggest her net worth, along with her husband Tim Mynett’s, could be as high as $30 million.

Israel would not exist today if Benjamin Netanyahu were not the country’s prime minister, US President Donald Trump said during a meeting with the Israeli leader outside his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.Netanyahu met Trump to discuss the next phase of the fragile Gaza truce, as well as broader regional issues, including Iran. Trump warned that if Tehran were to rebuild its nuclear facilities, the United States would “knock them down. ”Speaking alongside Trump, Netanyahu praised the US president, saying, “We have never had a friend like President Trump in the White House — it’s not even close. You can judge that not by the frequency of our meetings, but by their content and intensity.”“I think Israel is very blessed to have President Trump leading the United States — and I would say leading the free world — at this time,” Netanyahu added. “It’s not only Israel’s great fortune; I think it’s the world’s great fortune.”Trump, in turn, described his relationship with Netanyahu as “extraordinary” and recalled addressing Israel’s parliament. “We have a great relationship. It was a great honour to speak before your leaders at the Knesset in October,” he said.Praising Netanyahu’s leadership, Trump said, “Bibi’s a strong man. He can be very difficult on occasion, but you need a strong man. If you had a weak man, you wouldn’t have Israel right now.

‘My friends will get hurt’: Marjorie Taylor Greene says Trump warned her against naming Epstein clients,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/my-friends-will-get-hurt-marjorie-taylor-greene-says-trump-warned-her-against-naming-epstein-clients/articleshow/126239425.cms,"



Former Trump loyalist and MAGA Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has made a shocking claim that the US President Donald told her not to identify Jeffrey Epstein ’s client list because his “friends” would get hurt.“My friends will get hurt,” Greene said Trump told her, according to a New York Times Magazine interview. The call came after Greene promised to name alleged abusers during a September congressional hearing. One of her staffers added that Trump yelled so loudly that everyone in her office could hear him.Greene said Trump also attacked the victims she was advocating for. She eventually turned to fellow Representatives Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie, who managed to push through the release of some heavily redacted files under the Epstein Files Transparency Act.Speaking on the infamous Epstein files, MGT said: “How did all of this end up to a point where it was about releasing files about women who were raped, and not the serious things that I think truly matter about helping to get our economy stabilized again?”The 'America First' loudmouth said the main focus should be the economy and that the administration must not get entangled in more complex issues: “Help reduce the cost of living, fix the housing market, fix health insurance—for the love of God, what the [expletive] is the matter with these people?”Greene's claims come as she is set to resign from Congress on January 5, 2026.Her tenure was full of controversies. She announced her decision in November.Greene’s push for the Epstein files was seen as a key reason for her split with Trump. She had demanded more transparency long before Trump allowed the release, participating in press conferences and championing the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Meanwhile, differences on policy issues such as H-1B visas, healthcare, and foreign aid created further tension, with Greene accusing Trump of betraying his “America First” stance.The feud turned bitter when Trump withdrew his endorsement and signaled support for MGT's rival. Greene called this a betrayal and said she was one of the main reasons Trump is even serving a second term in the White House.Adding to the pressure, Greene faced threats in recent months, including swatting incidents, hoax pizza deliveries, and a bomb-squad response triggered by a threatening email. She said the harassment worsened after her rift with Trump, which took a toll on her family.However, MGT still remains one of the most influential political figures even beyond party lines.Regarding the Epstein files, they have already shown names and images of powerful figures such as Bill Clinton, Donald Trump , Prince Andrew, Michael Jackson, Mick Jagger, Kevin Spacey, Sarah Ferguson, Larry Summers, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates. These appearances in the documents do not imply criminal conduct, as many are social or professional connections, and some sections remain heavily redacted.","Marjorie Taylor Greene is set to resign from Congress on January 5, 2026.

Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes





Pakistan has once again found itself on the defensive after a senior government official publicly acknowledged the impact of India’s precision strikes on a key military installation during the escalation in May, following Operation Sindoor The admission came from Pakistan’s foreign minister and deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who, during a year-end press briefing on Saturday, confirmed that India had targeted the Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi’s Chaklala area. Dar acknowledged that the strike caused damage to the military installation and injured personnel stationed there.Addressing reporters, Dar said India had launched multiple drone incursions into Pakistani territory within a short span, underlining the scale of the operation. “They (India) send drones towards Pakistan. In 36 hours, at least 80 drones were sent... We were able to intercept 79 drones out of 80, and only one drone damaged a military installation and personnel were also injured in the attack,” he claimed, according to news agency ANI.Also Read: 'Was advised to take shelter in bunker': Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's big Op Sindoor admission - watch The foreign minister went on to describe the sequence of events following the strikes, saying that Pakistan’s civil and military leadership, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, held an emergency meeting on the night of May 9 to respond to the evolving situation.He added that India “made the mistake” of attacking the Nur Khan Air Base in the early hours of May 10, a remark that further acknowledged the strike and its impact.Dar’s comments amount to a rare public admission by a top Pakistani official of India’s military action on Pakistani air bases in May. The strikes came after Operation Sindoor, launched by the Indian Armed Forces to target nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians.The Pakistan Air Force’s Nur Khan Air Base in Chaklala suffered significant damage during the Indian precision strikes. India had launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7 as a direct response to the Pahalgam attack.The escalation that followed saw increased cross-border shelling by Pakistan and retaliatory action by Indian forces. The situation later took an unexpected turn when Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart to propose a ceasefire, which India accepted. The outreach from the Pakistani side was later confirmed by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, who said both sides agreed to halt all military operations on land, at sea and in the air.Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies on May 13 showed significant damage to multiple Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan Air Base. The images revealed damage at four installations: Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi, PAF Base Mushaf in Sargodha, Bholari Air Base and PAF Base Shahbaz in Jacobabad. A comparison of satellite images taken on April 25 and May 10 showed clear damage to air base facilities, corroborating the strikes.This is not the first time a senior Pakistani leader has acknowledged the attack on Nur Khan Air Base. In May, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif admitted that Indian ballistic missiles had hit the base and other locations, breaking from Pakistan’s usual practice of denying Indian military action.Addressing a ceremony at the Pakistan Monument on May 16, Sharif said, “At around 2:30 am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on a secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles had hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas.

‘Advised Me To Hide In Bunker’: Pak President Zardari On Op Sindoor, Responds To PM Modi's Warning

Operation Sindoor

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May, a remark that underscored India’s prowess to strike deep into mainland Pakistan.According to Zardari, the advice came from his military secretary, though he claimed he refused to take shelter.“I had actually told him (secretary) four days earlier that a war was going to happen. But he came to me and said, ‘Sir, let’s go to the bunkers.’ I replied, ‘If martyrdom is to come, it will come here. Leaders don’t die in bunkers; they die on the battlefield. They don’t die sitting in bunkers,’” Zardari said on Saturday at a rally marking the death anniversary of his wife and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in 2007.He added that every worker of his Pakistan Peoples Party was ready to sacrifice his life for the nation.Zardari also responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “roti khao, varna meri goli toh hai hi” (eat your food peacefully, or else my bullet is waiting for you) warning to Pakistan, saying that it would be Pakistan that would fire the bullets.He further remarked that India may have an economy 10 times larger than Pakistan’s, but questioned where it would find the “courage” to fight a war.Indian armed forces launched Operation Sindoor on the intervening night of May 6–7 in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians. The strikes targeted nine terror facilities in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Pakistan responded to the operation, triggering further retaliation by Indian forces, which subsequently struck around a dozen Pakistani air force bases.On May 10, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart seeking a ceasefire, which was accepted.India has consistently maintained that Operation Sindoor has only been “halted” and would be resumed in the future if required.","Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

Former Imran Khan aide Shahzad Akbar attacked in UK





Pakistan on Friday summoned Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell after a video circulated online showing a woman at a rally in the UK referring to a possible attack on Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir The ministry of foreign affairs called in Cannell to lodge a formal protest and demanded an investigation after the woman, speaking at a rally in Bradford in northern England, mentioned the possibility of the army chief being killed in a car bombing. Pakistani officials said the remarks went beyond political expression and raised serious security concerns.The rally was held in support of Pakistan’s jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan and was attended by his supporters living in the UK. Khan was removed from office through a no-confidence vote in April 2022 and has been in prison for nearly two years.The Bradford protest came days after a special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency sentenced Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to 17 years in prison each in the Toshakhana-II corruption case.According to Dawn, the court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million on each of them, with additional jail time possible in case of non-payment. The case relates to the alleged illegal retention and sale of state gifts received while Khan was in office.The video from the Bradford rally was initially shared on X by the UK chapter of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party before being deleted.Explaining the decision, PTI UK said in a post on X: “We have removed a video from the recent Bradford protest featuring a citizen’s metaphorical remarks regarding General Asim Munir. Although we do not believe the individual incited violence, the post was deleted in an abundance of caution to prevent potential misunderstanding and legal safeguarding of the individual and her rights.”Pakistan’s deputy interior minister Talal Chaudhry said the remarks crossed a red line. Speaking to Geo Television, he said: “While Imran Khan’s party has been inciting supporters against the military, the car bomb threat at the Bradford rally crossed all limits. It does not fall into the category of freedom of speech.”He urged the UK government to investigate the incident and take legal action if laws were violated.Responding to Pakistan’s concerns, the UK High Commission in Islamabad said in a brief statement: “Where a foreign Government believes a crime has been committed, they should provide all relevant material to their UK police liaison. Any material that appears to break UK law will be reviewed by the police and may lead to a criminal investigation.”The diplomatic move comes amid escalating tensions between Khan’s supporters and Pakistan’s powerful military. Earlier this month, army spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry described Khan as “mentally ill” during a press conference, after posts on Khan’s official X account referred to General Munir as “mentally unstable,” according to the Associated Press.Separately, tensions escalated further after PTI said Shahzad Akbar, a former adviser to Imran Khan was attacked in the United Kingdom on Thursday.In a post on X, Akbar said he was assaulted outside his home in Cambridge by an unidentified man.“Yesterday at approximately 8:08 a.m., I was attacked at my home by an unknown assailant dressed in what appeared to be construction or waste-collection attire,” Akbar wrote. “The individual asked, ‘Are you Shahzad Akbar?’ and immediately began assaulting me. The incident occurred in the presence of my family.”Akbar said he sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose, and was taken to a local hospital before being discharged.“The police have taken cognizance of the matter and have assured me and my family that they are actively investigating this targeted attack and will work to apprehend both the perpetrator and those behind it,” he said.He added that he could not share further details at this stage, including CCTV footage, on the advice of authorities.“I have full faith in the rule of law and in British law enforcement to carry out their duties,” Akbar said, urging the UK government to ensure the safety of dissidents.In a follow-up statement, Akbar said the attack would not silence him.“I want to make one thing absolutely clear: If my views, political comments, or even my ‘face’ is not liked by anyone, such cowardly acts will only strengthen my resolve rather than silence me,” he wrote. “Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out.”The Pakistan government has previously submitted extradition documents to British authorities seeking Akbar’s return. Akbar, a PTI member, has been accused by the state of anti-government activities.",Pakistan summons Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell.

'Just a junta with nuclear weapons': When Bush and Putin discussed Pakistan in 2005; what declassified NSA documents show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/just-a-junta-with-nuclear-weapons-when-bush-and-putin-discussed-pakistan-in-2005-what-declassified-nsa-documents-show/articleshow/126187276.cms,"Putin Called Pakistan A Junta With Nukes As Bush Feared Nuclear Leaks To Iran, Reveal Transcripts





NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s nuclear proliferation programme triggered deep concern at the highest levels of the United States and Russia, with both countries expressing that Islamabad’s nuclear activities made them “nervous”, according to newly declassified documents released by the US National Security Archive.The documents, made public this week following a Freedom of Information lawsuit, include verbatim transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin between 2001 and 2008. They reveal repeated discussions on Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal, links to Iran’s nuclear programme, and the role of the AQ Khan proliferation network.In a key Oval Office meeting in 2005, Putin raised concerns over evidence suggesting Pakistani-origin uranium had been found in Iranian centrifuges, questioning Western tolerance of Islamabad despite its proliferation record.“But it's not clear what the labs (Iran) have, where they are. Cooperation with Pakistan still exists,” Putin said during the meeting.Bush responded by referring to his discussions with then Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf, saying, “I talked to Musharraf about that. I told him we're worried about transfers to Iran and North Korea. They put AQ Khan in jail, and some of his buddies under house arrest. We want to know what they said.I keep reminding Musharraf of that. Either he's getting nothing, or he's not being forthcoming.”Putin reiterated his concerns, stating, “As far as I understand, they found uranium of Pakistani origin in the centrifuges.”Bush acknowledged the issue, saying, “Yes, the stuff the Iranians forgot to tell the IAEA about. That's a violation.”“It was of Pakistani origin. That makes me nervous,” Putin said, to which Bush replied, “It makes us nervous, too.”Also read: 'I want Pak': Rajnath recalls Vajpayee's unmatched wit; all about iconic moment The documents also highlight Putin’s blunt assessment of Pakistan during an earlier meeting with Bush in Slovenia in 2001. “I am concerned about Pakistan. It is just a junta with nuclear weapons. It is no democracy, yet the West makes no criticism of it. Should talk about it,” Putin said.According to the transcripts, both leaders expressed anxiety about Pakistan’s internal political instability, its military-led governance under Musharraf, and the risk that sensitive nuclear technology could fall into the wrong hands. The discussions repeatedly returned to the AQ Khan network, which was later confirmed to have supplied nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea, and Libya.The declassified records underscore longstanding international concerns about Pakistan’s nuclear command and control systems and the broader implications of its proliferation activities.The revelations come amid renewed scrutiny of Pakistan’s nuclear conduct. Last month, India criticised Islamabad following remarks by US President Donald Trump alleging that Pakistan had been secretly testing nuclear weapons.Reacting to Trump’s comments, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said such actions were consistent with Pakistan’s history. “Clandestine and illegal nuclear activities are in keeping with Pakistan's history, which is centred around decades of smuggling, export control violations, secret partnerships, AQ Khan network and further proliferation,” he said.“India has always drawn the attention of the international community to these aspects of Pakistan's record,” Jaiswal added."," transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin released by US National Security Archive.

Pak PM Sharif's Party Leader Threatens India, Warns Missiles Will Respond If Bangladesh Is Targeted





In a sharp attack on Pakistan’s security establishment, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations. Speaking at a recent gathering in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the influential Deobandi cleric questioned the logical consistency of Pakistan’s defence policy, specifically contrasting Islamabad’s recent strikes in Afghanistan with its diplomatic outrage over Indian activities within Pakistani borders.He asked Pakistan’s military brass why India’s actions inside Pakistan should be condemned when Islamabad justifies strikes in Afghanistan by calling them attacks on its enemies. Rehman argued that if Pakistan claimed a sovereign right to launch pre-emptive or retaliatory strikes against perceived enemies on Afghan soil, it weakened its moral and legal standing when protesting similar actions by India. “We sent militants to Afghanistan for 20 years. .. from giving them Kalashnikovs to Cruise missiles... we empowered them in every way. When you bombed Kabul, it was as if someone had bombed your Islamabad.This is the limit, isn’t it? If you had bombed the remote areas, you might have been able to tolerate it. So, you took some action there as well...”“...If you say, and I have questions, that we have attacked the enemy’s headquarters and you call this a legitimate statement, India says to you that it has attacked Bahawalpur, it has attacked Muridke, it has attacked the headquarters of those who are operating against us in Kashmir. Why are you objecting to this? And if you object to this, and if you have the same claims against Afghanistan, how will you justify it..?”Rehman’s criticism comes at a time when Pakistan’s Field Marshal Asim Munir continues his anti-India rhetoric and claims that Pakistan received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May which was felt during the days of intense fighting that followed Indian strikes on terror targets.Rehman’s comments touch upon a sensitive nerve in geopolitics, specifically referring to locations like Bahawalpur and Muridke — areas long identified as hubs for terrorist groups like JeM and LeT — which were decimated during Operation Sindoor. By asking, “Why different rules for India?” Rehman highlighted the strategic hypocrisy: justification of “counterterrorism strikes” in the west, while demanding absolute territorial sanctity in the east.",Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations.

The strikes led to intense clashes between the two countries for four days and ended with an understanding to halt military actions on May 10.Meanwhile, Munir warned the Afghan Taliban to choose between Pakistan and the TTP, saying Afghan nationals form the majority of militants infiltrating across the border. “In the TTP formations coming [into Pakistan], 70 per cent are Afghans,” he said. “Is Afghanistan not spilling the blood of our Pakistani children?” He reiterated that Kabul must decide between Pakistan and the TTP.The Field Marshal also said that no one could declare jihad in an Islamic state except the state itself. “No one can issue a fatwa for jihad without the order and permission and will of those vested with the authority,” he said.Munir also drew parallels between Pakistan and the state established by the Prophet 1,400 years ago in the Arab region, now Saudi Arabia.He said that among the world’s 57 Islamic countries, “God gave us the honour of being the protectors of Haramain Sharifain,” referring to Makkah and Madina.Official details of the December 10 address were limited, with selected clips aired later by Pakistani media.","Pakistan’s chief of defence forces field marshal Asim Munir has claimed that Islamabad received ‘divine help’ during the military confrontation with India in May.

PAK Citizens Criticize ""Weak Judiciary"" As Imran Khan’s Prison Term Is Increased

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently incarcerated for now over two years, on Saturday called on his supporters to prepare for nationwide protests and announced his intention to challenge the recent Toshakhana-II verdict, which he alleged was delivered in “haste” by the Islamabad high court. Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.He also alleged that Pakistan is being governed by solely under ""Asim law.""With no access to his social media accounts, Khan conveyed his message through his legal team. According to a post on X summarising a conversation between the PTI founder and his lawyer, Khan instructed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi to begin preparations for a mass street movement.In the detailed message shared by his team, Khan said: “To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. At this moment, Pakistan is being governed solely under ‘Asim Law’. Here, verdicts are pre-written and merely announced aloud. Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the past three years, the Toshakhana 2 verdict is nothing new for me. This ruling, too, was delivered in haste, without any evidence and without fulfilling legal requirements.Neither we nor our lawyers were even given opportunity to present our case.”He alleged that both he and Bushra Bibi were being subjected to harsh solitary confinement. “The sustained solitary confinement imposed on me and my wife constitutes severe mental torture. We are barred from books, television, and meetings… The books sent by my family are confiscated by jail authorities, and we are kept in solitary confinement for weeks at a time. This treatment is inhumane, yet all this oppression and brutality cannot weaken my resolve. ”Khan also accused the authorities of persecuting women linked to PTI. “It is not our tradition to target women and children… I am deeply saddened and distressed by the mistreatment and brutality faced by my sisters and other women outside Adiala Jail. The treatment meted out to Bushra Bibi, Dr. Yasmin, Mahrang Baloch, and other women stands in clear violation of Islamic traditions and moral values.”The former prime minister again directed his criticism at army chief Asim Munir . “The army is mine and belongs to the people of Pakistan. When I criticise Asim Munir, it is criticism of an individual… Whatever is happening to me in jail is being carried out on the instructions of a colonel acting under Asim Munir’s orders.”Urging the legal fraternity to mobilise, Khan said: “For the struggle to restore the rule of law and uphold the Constitution, it is essential for the Insaf Lawyers Forum and legal fraternity to step forward decisively.”He added that he had instructed his legal team to appeal the verdict: “I have full confidence in Salman Safdar and his team and have instructed them to file an appeal against these bogus decisions in the Islamabad high court.” Concluding his message, he said: “My message for Sohail Afridi is to prepare for a street movement. The entire nation must rise for their rights!! To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. ”The message was signed off as: “Illegally Incarcerated Former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, speaking to his lawyers after the verdict of a military-style trial in Adiala Jail.”In an official statement, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) described the verdict as “blatantly unconstitutional, illegal, malicious and the worst form of political revenge and a textbook case of victimisation.”The party-led by Imran Khan alleged that the conviction aimed to prolong Khan’s imprisonment and ease pressure on what it called a “petrified ruling clique,” claiming political vendetta was being executed through a “subservient” judiciary.Addressing a press conference alongside senior party leader Asad Qaiser, PTI secretary general Salman Akram Raja said Khan had met his lead counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, in the courtroom and shared a message for the nation. He quoted Khan as saying, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.”Raja added that the case lacked substantive evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said.Heavy police deployment was enforced across Rawalpindi, with more than 1,300 police officers and security personnel stationed at key locations to maintain law and order, after former Imran Khan called for the nationwide protests.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.

PAK Citizens Criticize ""Weak Judiciary"" As Imran Khan’s Prison Term Is Increased

Water crisis deepens public health risks





At least two women were killed and several others injured in Balochistan’s Noshki district after a passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck, Dawn reported. The vehicle was travelling from Quetta to Chagai when the crash occurred near the Sher Jan Agha area.Five passengers sustained injuries, with two shifted to Quetta for critical care. Hospital officials said at least eight people hurt in rain-related incidents were brought to the Civil Hospital.The rainfall, which began on Saturday, ended a prolonged dry spell in the Quetta valley, offering brief relief to drought-hit farmers. However, it also caused widespread disruption. Despite forecasts ruling out significant rainfall, showers intensified by noon, flooding roads, halting traffic and plunging large parts of Quetta into darkness after electricity supplies were suspended. Mobile networks were also disrupted, leaving residents without communication for hours.Low-lying neighbourhoods, particularly areas with mud houses and weak construction, were badly affected as rainwater entered homes.Heavy rainfall was reported across several districts, including Ziarat, Pishin, Kalat, Zhob, Mastung and Sibi, with power outages lasting for hours in many areas.Meanwhile, experts warned that Pakistan’s water-quality crisis is worsening. Speaking at a seminar organised by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) in Islamabad, specialists said only 47 per cent of the population has access to safe drinking water, according to The Express Tribune.Dr Hifza Rasheed of the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources said per capita freshwater availability has dropped from 5,260 cubic metres in 1951 to below 1,000 cubic metres in 2024, placing Pakistan among water-scarce nations. Unsafe water, experts said, accounts for nearly 40 per cent of illnesses nationwide and contributes to tens of thousands of child deaths each year.","A passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck in Balochistan.

Ex-PM Imran Khan And Bushra Bibi Jailed For 17 Years In Toshakhana Gift Jewellery Case





Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan has asked his supporters to prepare for nationwide protests and said he will challenge his conviction in the Islamabad High Court after he and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the Toshakhana-II corruption case on Saturday.Khan, who does not currently have access to his social media accounts, conveyed his message through his legal team.According to a post on X cited by Dawn, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder said he had instructed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi to begin preparations for a mass street movement. “I have sent a message to [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM] Sohail Afridi to prepare for the street movement. The entire nation will have to rise for its rights,” Khan said.Reacting to the verdict, Khan said the decision did not come as a surprise and accused the court of acting in haste. “Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the last three years, the Toshakhana-II decision is also nothing new to me,” he said, adding that the ruling was delivered “without any evidence” and that his legal team was “not even heard”, as reported by ANI.He confirmed that his lawyers had already been directed to move the high court against the sentence.PTI, in an official statement, described the verdict as “blatantly unconstitutional, illegal” and an act of political victimisation, alleging that the conviction was meant to prolong Khan’s imprisonment.Addressing a press conference, PTI secretary general Salman Akram Raja quoted Khan as saying, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.”The case relates to allegations that a Bulgari jewellery set, worth over PKR 71 million and received from the Saudi Crown Prince, was undervalued.Khan and Bushra Bibi were convicted under sections linked to criminal breach of trust and corruption, as per ANI.The sentencing has sparked public debate across Pakistan. Quoted by ANI, residents and journalists in Lahore and Peshawar questioned the credibility of the ruling, with some alleging political motives and a lack of evidence, saying the verdict had further weakened public trust in the justice system and democratic institutions.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the Toshakhana-II corruption case on Saturday.

‘Might Never See Him Again’: Imran Khan’s Sons Claim 'Psychological Torture' In Pak's Adiala Jail





NEW DELHI: The Pakistan government on Saturday clarified that there is ""no embargo"" on former prime minister Imran Khan 's sons meeting their incarcerated father if they travel to the country. The government official also said the brothers would be granted Pakistani visas should they wish to come and visit him.The statement came after reports suggested that authorities had imposed unannounced restrictions on visits to Imran Khan, claiming that some visitors were using the meetings to advance political agendas. Following these reports, members of his family and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) expressed concern about the conditions in which he is being held.""There has been no embargo on Suleman Khan and Kasim Khan to meet their father, Imran Khan, at Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi,"" Interior state minister Talal Chaudhry told reporters.Suleman and Kasim, who currently live in London, are Khan’s sons from his first marriage to British TV personality Jemima Goldsmith.Chaudhry’s clarification comes days after the brothers told Sky News they fear they may never see their jailed father again.The brothers said they have not seen or spoken to the PTI founder, imprisoned since August 2023, for months, and voiced concerns about his safety and well-being.“If Suleman and Kasim apply for a Pakistani visa, we will give them. We will not stop them from meeting their father; therefore, the propaganda that the Pakistani government is creating hurdles in the meeting between father and sons should be stopped,” Chaudhry said.He also rejected reports that Khan is being kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day.In their interview, the brothers alleged that their father is being held in isolation, calling the conditions “clear torture tactics.”Khan, who has been in jail since August 2023, faces multiple cases filed against him since his ouster from power in April 2022.A United Nations special rapporteur has also warned that Khan is being held in conditions that may amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.In the interview, Kasim claimed Khan is confined to a cell measuring “six feet by eight inches,” barely large enough to stand.“They are not even allowing guards to speak to him because they want total isolation from any other person, just to try and break him. So it’s all very clear torture tactics,” he said.","Suleman and Kasim Khan are Imran Khan's sons from his first marriage.

NEW DELHI: A special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency on Saturday sentenced former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 17 years of imprisonment each in the Toshakhana 2 corruption case, Dawn reported.The court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million (INR 52,39,524) on each of them. Failure to pay the fine will result in additional jail time, according to the law.Citing the court order copy, Dawn reported that the sentences took into account Imran Khan’s age and the fact that Bushra Bibi is a woman, resulting in what the court described as a “lenient” punishment. “This court, while passing sentences has considered the old age of Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, as well as the fact that Bushra Imran Khan is a female. It is in consideration of both said factors that a lenient view has been taken in awarding lesser punishment,” the order said.The verdict was delivered by special judge central Shahrukh Arjumand during a hearing held at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Imran Khan is currently imprisoned.According to Dawn, the case relates to the alleged purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set that was gifted to Imran Khan by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021 and later acquired at a throwaway price.Imran Khan was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison, including 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment under sections 34 and 409 of the Pakistan Penal Code and seven years under Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Bushra Bibi was awarded the same sentence under identical provisions.The court also granted the benefit of Section 382 B of the Criminal Procedure Code, which allows the period of detention already undergone to be considered while awarding the sentence.Following the verdict, lawyers representing Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi said they would challenge the decision before the high court.The two were indicted in the case in December last year. Dawn noted that earlier this year in October, both had denied the allegations, calling the case fabricated and politically motivated.As per Dawn, while recording his statement under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Imran Khan rejected the prosecution’s narrative and said the case was “malicious, fabricated, and politically engineered”. He argued that he did not qualify as a public servant under the Pakistan Penal Code and claimed he was unaware of the specific details of the gift, which he said was presented to his wife.Dawn further reported that the PTI founder maintained that due process was followed under the Toshakhana Policy 2018 and that the gift was declared, assessed and legally retained after payment to the national exchequer. “We complied with the Toshakhana Policy in letter and spirit,” he said.","Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi sentenced to 17 years of imprisonment each in corruption case.

'Zero chance of restoration of monarchy in Nepal': Ex-PM Bhattarai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/zero-chance-of-restoration-of-monarchy-in-nepal/articleshow/126242051.cms,"Following the Sept Gen-Z protests in Nepal, do you think the anger of the protesters has been addressed now?

Why Nepal Is Fed Up With Its Democracy | I Witness

Do you think some external elements pushed the protests in Sept?

Notwithstanding elections being slated for next March, many in Nepal say this is unconstitutional and parliament should be reconvened. What’s your take?

So, should there be a constitutional amendment with regard to Article 76(5) that allows any member of Nepal’s parliament to stake claim to form govt with adequate support of any other members?

How do you see calls from certain sections for the restoration of the monarchy?

How is the current situation impacting

India-Nepal relations

?

What about updating the 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship?

There is concern in some quarters in New Delhi about China’s growing footprint in Nepal. Do you see this as an issue?

So how does Nepal plan to balance between India and China?

Following the introduction of the Agnipath scheme, recruitment of Nepalese citizens in the Indian army has halted. Has this impacted our bilateral relations?

Do you think Agnipath has forced Nepali citizens to other theatres like joining the Russian army and fighting in Ukraine?

How do we insulate India-Nepal relations from political changes in either country?

India seems to have grown out of Saarc. What is the way forward then for regional cooperation?





Former prime minister of Nepal and one of the architects of Nepal’s constitution, Baburam Bhattarai, sat down for an exclusive one-on-one interview with TOI’s Rudroneel Ghosh, discussing the recent Gen-Z protests that rocked Nepal, New Delhi-Kathmandu ties, the Agnipath scheme, and the China factor:The situation is still in a flux in Nepal. My analysis is that Nepal is still going through a transitional phase. Because we democratised our society very late compared to the rest of the world. The monarchy was only abolished in 2008. Then after the institutions were not very strong until the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. That’s when institutions started developing but were not fully developed. So Nepali govts haven’t been able to deliver. Meanwhile, the aspirations of the youth have skyrocketed, especially after the advent of digital technology. So, frustrations were mounting and exploded in Sept. But things are still in a flux as of today.The crisis should be seen as a manifestation of internal contradictions in Nepali society – political, social and cultural. That was the principal factor. The triggering factor was the banning of social media by the then govt. There was also tremendous antagonism against the leadership of the traditional parties, namely the Nepali Congress and the two Maoist factions.These three parties and their leaders simply reshuffled their chairs and couldn’t deliver anything. Plus, corruption was mounting and there was utter failure on the economic front. So, these factors together gave rise to the revolt on the first day. Then there was heavy repression by govt which triggered things further. On the second day there was natural resistance by the youth, and then different vested interests, both internal and external, naturally tried to fish in troubled waters. That’s the reality.I think the question doesn’t arise. In constitutional law you already have the doctrine of necessity. When people’s aspirations are not fulfilled by govt, people have the right to express their views through the street. That is also a part of democracy. So, when govt is forced to resign and the parliament dominated by outdated parties and leaders was not accepted by the people, it was dissolved. So, the natural corollary is to hold elections on time and bring constitutional democracy back on track. If you keep postponing elections under various pretexts, the danger is collapse of constitutional democracy. That won’t be in the interest of anybody, including international players.I was one of the makers of the constitution. We had certain reservations then also. Given Nepal’s specific case and tremendous diversity, we needed to have a directly elected executive and a fully professional parliament. Only then we could ensure stability. That was our point of view at that time, but our view could not prevail. So, we made a hotch-potch-type electoral system and form of governance that led to not any party mustering enough seats, and therefore they were forced to enter into coalitions, giving rise to horse-trading and instability. To minimise this, certain provisions were kept in the constitution but even these didn’t work. One of the demands of the Gen-Z movement is to make a progressive amendment to the constitution so that these anomalies can be addressed. That can be done after the election – it could be one of the issues of the election.This is not true at all. In every society there are some fringe elements, 1-2% of the population, who are very conservative with retrograde mindset and nostalgia about the past. This happens even in Europe and America. In Nepal’s case the monarchy was overthrown by the mandate of the people. It was abolished through the duly elected constituent assembly. Monarchy had totally failed. Monarchical institutions had staged coups against democracy in Nepal since the 1960s. That is why monarchy was democratically abolished and people realised the importance of democracy. They are not at all in favour of monarchy. This bogey of monarchy is only raised by certain vested interests. There is zero chance of restoration of monarchy.India-Nepal relations are multifaceted. These things (political issues) won’t impact the relations. Yes, we have open borders, and therefore instability in Nepal may partially impact India. But overall, given our strong and broad bilateral ties, these things won’t impact much.As you know, I was one of the major proponents of that idea. Because every treaty and agreement is time specific. If you see the ancestry of the 1950 treaty, the 1923 treaty was the first between British India and Nepal. This was partially revised in 1950 when Nepal was still under Rana autocracy. And in 1951 partial democracy was introduced in Nepal. So, our position is that the treaty needs to be updated once again with mutual agreement. Apart from that we have the open border issue, which is a bit problematic for both countries and needs to be regulated, and we have some boundary issues left over from the British days. So, let us review our relationship in totality and recalibrate ties for the 21st century. This was mutually agreed upon and the eminent persons group was constituted when I was PM. But unfortunately, it couldn’t fructify. I would request both sides to sit down and revise and strengthen our relations further.This is highly exaggerated. Geopolitics is fast changing in the region with the rise of both India and China as global powers. Add to this the interests of global superpower US. Naturally, their interests would collide to some extent. But I don’t think Nepal can be a playground for any external forces to the detriment of any of our neighbours. Nepal won’t come in between our neighbours and other powers. Nepal being an independent sovereign country would want to maintain its independence and territorial integrity, and won’t allow its soil to be used against anybody.That is not a big issue. I think vested interests overplay these things. Just an example: When we had the Sugauli Treaty in 1816 between Nepal and the British, a delegation was sent to Beijing. The then Chinese emperor advised Nepal to have good relations with the south or the then British empire. Later on also in 1964, when Nepal’s PM visited Beijing, both Mao and Zhou Enlai also advised Nepal to have good relations with India. This is recorded. When I was PM, Chinese premier Wen Jiabao visited, he also gave us the same advice. So, I see that consistency on Beijing’s part. I don’t think any power would like to play Nepal against any power, including India. The Nepalese people are very sensitive about this and they won’t indulge in such games.Recruitment of Nepalese nationals in foreign armies of India and Britain has a long history. This has roots in the British days. The issue of review of our bilateral treaties included a review of recruitment of Nepali citizens in foreign armies. This also needs to be revisited. Again, my humble request is to review all the elements of our relationship as a package.This is due to lack of fast economic development and industrialisation of Nepal’s economy. Many of our youths have been ejected from the agriculture sector. They are forced to migrate for employment to different countries. So Agnipath is not the main reason. Key factor is the lack of industrialisation of our economy and lack of gainful employment.We shouldn’t indulge in issues for partial gains of particular political party or leader. In a democracy, leaders and parties do change periodically. So, state policy should have continuity. In our case, as I have practically experienced, certain leaders for their own arrogance rake up these issues. But the Nepalese people and state shouldn’t engage in matters that vitiate relations with neighbours that will also impact our own economic development. I don’t see any problem between us that cannot be resolved through dialogue. We must propagate our relations for mutual benefit of both sides.With the fast-changing geopolitical scenario across the world, this period is seen as one of a multipolar world. Even if you go by the latest US national security strategy, they have admitted that they are going back to the old Monroe Doctrine and withdrawing from regions outside the western hemisphere. So, they have accepted that the world is heading towards multipolarity. Naturally, this will also impact South Asia where countries have a common history and socio-economic conditions. There is reason for South Asian countries to cooperate and resolve their issues peacefully, and deal with a multipolar world. For that India being the largest country and biggest power in the region, should be taking the initiative and every country should be playing a positive role in this effort.","Baburam Bhattarai is the former prime minister of Nepal and one of the architects of Nepal’s constitution.

The ban, put on it during Hasina's tenure, was lifted last year after Muhammad Yunus took charge of the interim govt.The members wrote to NCP convener Nahid Islam after joint convener Tajnuva Jabeen announced her resignation and senior joint member secretary Tasnim Jara stepped down from her post. Sources said many NCP members may move to rival BNP or contest the polls as independent candidates.In a Facebook post, Tajnuva said she would not contest the upcoming elections as she is objected to NCP's decision to ally with JeI. Tasnim said she will contest as an independent candidate from Dhaka-9.JeI chief Shafiqur Rahman has announced at a press conference Liberal Democratic Party - headed by former BNP-era minister Col (retd) Oli Ahmed - and Nahid-led NCP had joined the JeI-headed eight-party coalition.Shafiqur said the alliance has nearly finalised its nomination list for all 300 constituencies through talks with the partners. On NCP's absence from the briefing, he said, ""The party's leaders were unable to attend due to time constraints. But they have clearly informed us of their decision to join the alliance. They will announce it to the media through a separate press conference,"" he said.Tajnuva said many had assumed her objection stemmed from ideological concerns, but she was troubled by the process through which the alliance was formed. She said after inviting nationwide nominations and selecting 125 aspirants, NCP was now finalising a seat-sharing arrangement for about 30 constituencies.

BSF dismisses Bangladesh claim, says no proof of any fugitive crossing the border into India

DHAKA/SHILLONG: Bangladesh claimed on Sunday that the two prime suspects in the murder of radical Inqilab Moncho leader Sharif Osman Hadi had found sanctuary in neighbouring Meghalaya, inviting instant rebuttals from Indian security agencies about what they said were ""fabricated and malicious"" statements suggesting lapses in BSF's border vigil.""Suspects Faisal Karim Masud and Alamgir Sheikh crossed into the Indian state of Meghalaya with the help of local associates,"" Dhaka Metropolitan Police's additional police commissioner (crime and operations) S N Md Nazrul Islam said at a presser. ""According to our information, the suspects entered India via the Haluaghat border.""Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s additional police commissioner (crime and operations) S N Md Nazrul Islam said his department had received “informal reports” about two men identified as “Purti and Sami” being detained in India for assisting the fugitives.BSF inspector general (Meghalaya frontier) Om Prakash Upadhyay said in Shillong that “there is no evidence to suggest any individual crossed the international border from the Haluaghat sector into Meghalaya” from Mymensingh in Bangladesh. “BSF has neither detected nor received any report of such an incident,” PTI quoted Upadhyay as saying. He said the international border was under constant surveillance & any attempt at illegal cross-border movement would be promptly detected and dealt with.Meghalaya DGP Idashisha Nongrang, too, issued a statement contradicting the Dhaka police officer’s claim about two alleged collaborators of the fugitives being detained in West Garo Hills. She said reports emerging from Bangladesh about the whereabouts of the killers of 32-year-old Hadi, whose shooting on December 12 plunged the country into another cycle of violent unrest, were “unfounded”.Bangladeshi media quoted Islam as alleging that local contacts helped the fugitives travel by taxi to Tura, the headquarters of West Garo Hills district. He insisted the Bangladesh govt was “actively working” to bring the suspects back. “We are maintaining communication with Indian authorities through both formal and informal channels to ensure their arrest and extradition,” Islam said.The unsubstantiated claims come in the wake of Inqilab Moncho’s 30-day ultimatum to the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt to arrest his killers.The countdown started on December 19, a day after Hadi died in a Singapore hospital of bullet injuries to the head. Hadi was among those who led the July-Aug 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh that led to Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League govt being toppled.He was a candidate for the upcoming February 12 parliamentary elections and was shot while campaigning in Dhaka.

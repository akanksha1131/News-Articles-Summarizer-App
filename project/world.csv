In a first-of-its-kind event, humanoid robots took center stage in a kickboxing match in Hangzhou, China. The competition, part of the China Media Group (CMG) World Robot Competition – Mecha Fighting Series, was held on May 25 and marked the debut of robotic fighters in a full-fledged combat sport.The robots were developed by Unitree Robotics, a Chinese tech company known for its advanced humanoid machines. Four Unitree G1 robots took part in the fight, each about 132 centimeters tall and weighing 35 kilograms, reported Asia Times.They were remotely controlled by human trainers using joysticks, and the match was broadcasted by China Central Television (CCTV).While the event sparked excitement among viewers, one social media user commented humorously, “The part that confuses me most is the referee in the ring.”Videos from the match showed the robots exchanging punches and kicks with surprising coordination. Although the strikes were more like soft pushes than real hits, the movements displayed impressive balance and speed for machines.The match was part of a larger effort to test and showcase the growing abilities of AI and robotics in dynamic settings.Earlier this year, a Unitree robot was seen in a viral video aggressively reacting to its handlers during a demo, raising safety concerns.In another case, during February’s Spring Festival Gala in Tianjin, a robot reportedly charged toward a crowd, alarming attendees.Such incidents, including a recent case at Tesla's factory in Texas where a robot allegedly injured a worker, have sparked growing concern over AI safety and the potential risks of advanced robotics. Experts have pointed to software glitches and inadequate testing as common causes, highlighting the need for strict quality control in AI development."," humanoid robots took center stage in a kickboxing match in Hangzhou, China.

Three more inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail earlier this month were re-arrested on Monday in separate states, more than a week after their bold escape.Louisiana State Police announced on X that one of the men was arrested in Baton Rouge, while the other two were captured in Walker County, Texas.Two inmates are still on the run, and police have not released further details about Monday’s arrests, reported AP.On May 16, the inmates managed to yank open a faulty cell door, squeeze through a hole behind a toilet, scale a barbed-wire fence, and disappear into the night.Their absence wasn’t noticed until the next morning during a routine headcount. Graffiti left behind mocked the jail’s security failures with the message “To Easy LoL,” scrawled on the wall with an arrow pointing to the escape route.The most recently recaptured inmates have been identified as Lenton Vanburen, Leo Tate, and Jermaine Donald.Previously, Dkenan Dennis, Corey Boyd, Gary C. Price, Kendell Myles, and Robert Moody had already been taken back into custody.Most of the escapees were being held on serious charges, including murder, and were awaiting trial or sentencing.Following the escape, a jail maintenance worker was arrested after allegedly turning off the water supply to the toilet, a move investigators say facilitated the jailbreak. The worker told authorities he had been threatened by one of the inmates.Additionally, four others have been arrested for allegedly aiding the escapees while they were on the run.","Three more inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail earlier this month were re-arrested on Monday in separate states.

Samoa's leader seeks an early election after opponents reject her budget,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/samoas-leader-seeks-an-early-election-after-opponents-reject-her-budget/articleshow/121426496.cms,"Samoan Prime Minister Afioga Fiamē Naomi Mataʻafa (left) (Image credit: AP)



Warnings about election readiness:





Samoa 's Prime Minister said she would seek to dissolve Parliament, prompting an early election, after a vote on her government's budget for the next year failed Tuesday.Fiamē Naomi Mata'afa's admission of defeat followed months of political havoc in the South Pacific island nation, during which the leader survived two votes of no confidence and struggled on with a minority government. Her budget was rejected during a swift vote in the capital Apia, with 34 lawmakers against it, 16 in favor and two abstaining.An election must be held within 90 days. Samoa, a country of about 200,000 people, was due to go to the polls next April.Samoa's first woman leader Fiamē has led Samoa since 2021, when she ousted her predecessor of 22 years. She is the country's first woman prime minister and in 1991 was the first woman appointed to Samoa's Cabinet.The daughter of a former prime minister, Fiamē is one of the region's longest-serving politicians. She came to power after splitting with the previous leader's party over constitutional changes that she said would undermine the rule of law.Fiamē holds a chiefly rank as a village leader, rare for women in Samoa. She remains an outlier, too, in Pacific island politics, where only 8 per cent of parliamentarians are women, according to January figures from the Inter-Parliamentary Union.Politics roiled for months Tuesday's budget defeat capped months of political turmoil after Fiamē in January sacked a Cabinet member who faced a raft of criminal charges and is also her party's chairman. He in turn expelled Fiamē from the FAST party and forced her into a minority government.She beat two no-confidence motions since. Debate over the efforts to unseat her provoked outrage among some in Samoa when Fiamē's opponents derided her for being unmarried and suggested she needed a husband's advice.Earlier this month Fiamē told reporters she would contest the election next April. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.In Parliament Tuesday morning, the leader warned lawmakers that rejecting the budget would provoke operational problems for the government, according to Pacific news outlet PMN. Fiamē also cautioned that a re-registration process for Samoa's voters, which was expected to conclude before next April's vote, had only captured 52 per cent of Samoans in the new system so far.The old registration system was obsolete, her government said last year.Fiamē has drawn attention outside Samoa for urging larger powers, such as Australia, to do more to curb the effects of climate change, which have been ruinous for low-lying Pacific island nations. She also took a more cautious approach than her predecessor to Beijing's bankrolling of infrastructure projects in Samoa, which is heavily in debt to China.Samoa has this year faced severe electricity shortages that Fiamē warned in April could seriously hamper the country's economy.","Fiamē Naomi Mata'afa's admission of defeat follows months of political havoc in the South Pacific island nation.

Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Monday mocked a viral video in which French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to have his face pushed away by his wife Brigitte upon their arrival in Vietnam.She wrote on Telegram that Macron had received ""A right hook from his wife.""The clip, widely shared on social media, appeared to show an awkward moment between the couple , sparking speculation about a possible dispute.Zakharova also sarcastically suggested various explanations for the gesture, writing, “Did the first lady decide to cheer up her husband with a gentle pat on the cheek and miscalculated her strength? Was she handing him a tissue but missed? Did she want to fix his collar but ended up reaching the beloved face?”“Here’s a hint: maybe it was the ‘hand of the Kremlin’?” she addedThe French president has denied any conflict, saying the couple had simply been joking as they often do. “None of these are true"" and ""everyone needs to calm down.”Even though the claims were later debunked, they still prompted a high-level reaction from the Elysee Palace and the French foreign ministry.This marks the third time in May that Macron has been the focus of viral video content, as France faces what it calls an uptick in disinformation campaigns — many of which it believes are linked to Russia, amid ongoing tensions over the war in Ukraine.","Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova mocked a viral video in which French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to have his face pushed away by his wife.

Liverpool Parade 'Terror Attack'? Fans Reject UK Cops Theory, Footage Of 'Young Driver' Goes Viral

'People treated on road side'







Eyewitnesses shared harrowing details of the car-in-crowd incident at Liverpool victory parade that left nearly 50 injured on Monday. With 27 people hospitalised, a bystander recounted how one could ""hear bumps"" as the car drove over people.“It was extremely fast. Initially, we just heard the pop, pop, pop of people just being knocked off the bonnet of a car. But then he put his foot down again and just plowed through the rest of them, he just kept going. It was horrible. And you could hear the bumps as he was going over the people,"" AP quoted Harry Rashid saying. He was with his wife and two daughters.“My daughter started screaming, and there were people on the ground. They were just innocent people, just fans going to enjoy the parade,” he added.A 53-year-old white British man drove into crowd of Liverpool soccer fans celebrating the city's Premier League title. Police said that the arrested driver is believed to have acted alone, and the incident was not being treated as an act of terrorism.Another onlooker recalled how the injured were ""treated on the side of the road” given the urgency of the situation.“We heard a frantic beeping ahead, a car flew past me and my mate, people were chasing it and trying to stop him, windows smashed at the back,"" said Peter Jones.“He then drove into people, police and medics ran past us, and people were being treated on the side of the road,” Jones added.The incident drew reactions from UK PM Keir Starmer who said, “Everyone, especially children, should be able to celebrate their heroes without this horror.

Brush fire burning near Fort Stanton, New Mexico





A fast-moving wildfire swept through the historic Fort Stanton site in southern New Mexico on Monday, burning more than half a square mile (1.4 square kms) of land and prompting evacuations of nearby campgrounds and a horse ranch.The blaze damaged three structures at the Fort Stanton historic site, a civil war-era landmark, and spread across surrounding federal conservation lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), reported AP.The cause of the fire is still unknown, and a BLM investigator is expected to begin assessing the origin on Tuesday.Ground crews, helicopters, and air tankers worked together to contain the fire, which remained uncontained as of Monday. Firefighters focused on clearing vegetation lines to the north and dropping water on smoldering hotspots from the air, said Laura Rabon, spokesperson for the multi-agency response team.While fire activity had eased somewhat due to mild weather, with temperatures around 75 degrees (24 Celsius) and 10 mph (16 kph) winds, the threat remained.On Sunday, air tankers dropped fire retardant around the edges of the fire to help slow it down.A nearby horse ranch was also evacuated, and a family of four along with their horses were moved to safety. They have now returned home.Highway 220 near Fort Stanton was closed to ensure fire crews had access, and three nearby campgrounds were evacuated and remain closed.The fire has sparked concern in a region still recovering from devastating wildfires last year that destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses in nearby Ruidoso, located about 15 miles (24 kilometers) away. Those fires were followed by severe flooding and erosion.","A fast-moving wildfire swept through the historic Fort Stanton site in southern New Mexico on Monday.

MORRISTOWN: US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he would pause his threatened 50-percent tariffs on the European Union until July 9, after a ""very nice call"" with European Commision president Ursula von der Leyen.Trump had threatened on Friday to impose the steep duties from June 1, voicing frustration that negotiations to avert a 20-percent ""reciprocal"" tariff were ""going nowhere"".But he agreed on Sunday to delay the tariffs until July 9 after von der Leyen said the European Union needed more time to negotiate.Von der Leyen ""just called me... and she asked for an extension on the June 1st date and she said she wants to get down to serious negotiation"", Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One in Morristown, New Jersey.""And I agreed to do that,"" he added.Von der Leyen had earlier said on X that she held a ""good call"" with Trump but that ""to reach a good deal, we would need the time until July 9"".""Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively,"" said the head of the European Commission, which conducts trade policy for the 27-nation EU.European stock markets -- which had tumbled on Friday after Trump threatened the 50-percent tariff -- rallied on Monday as investors welcomed the delay.The Paris CAC 40 index rose 1.1 percent in morning deals while the Frankfurt DAX was up 1.6 percent. London and Wall Street were closed for holidays.Jochen Stanzl, analyst at trading platform CMC Markets, said the delay was a familiar ""Trump Pattern"".""The stock market seems to dance to Trump's tune -- first a threat, then a pullback, quickly followed by a rebound as speculative investors anticipate a concession from the US president,"" Stanzl said.Trump's trade policies have raised concerns that they could spark a recession and fuel inflation, while his stop-start tariff announcements have sent stock markets on a roller-coaster ride.- 'Serious negotiations' -Brussels and Washington have been negotiating in a bid to avert an all-out transatlantic trade war and had agreed to suspend tariff action on both sides until July.But Trump's threat on Friday dramatically raised the stakes.The US leader said on Friday he was ""not looking for a deal"" with the EU, repeating his oft-stated view that the bloc was created to ""take advantage"" of the United States.German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil called on Sunday called for ""serious negotiations"" with Washington, saying he had spoken to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the matter.""We don't need any further provocations but serious negotiations,"" Klingbeil, who is also Germany's vice chancellor, told Bild newspaper.""The US tariffs endanger the US economy just as much as the German and European economy,"" Klingbeil warned.The EU is subject to a 10-percent tariff that Trump imposed last month on imports from nearly every country around the world, along with 25-percent duties on cars, steel and aluminium.The US president originally imposed a 20-percent levy on the EU but subsequently suspended it, giving space for negotiations.EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic, who held talks with his US counterparts on Friday, said the bloc was ""committed to securing a deal"" but that trade ties should be based on ""mutual respect, not threats"".Brussels has announced plans to impose tariffs on US goods worth nearly 100 billion euros ($113 billion) if negotiations fail to produce a deal.The US trade deficit in goods with the European Union was $236 billion in 2024.But when taking account of services, where US firms are dominant, the European Commission calculates that the US trade deficit stood at $57 billion.Earlier this month, Trump reached a trade deal with Britain -- though he maintained the 10-percent ""baseline"" tariff on the country -- and he temporarily reduced his massive levies on China to give space for negotiations.","US President Donald Trump says he will pause his threatened 50-percent tariffs on the European Union until July 9.

WASHINGTON: US President Trump said on Monday he is considering taking $3 billion of previously awarded grant money away from Harvard University and giving it to trade schools across the US.His comments, which were made on Truth Social, come less than a week after his administration sought to block the Ivy League school from enrolling foreign students. Trump has frozen some $3 billion in grants to Harvard in recent weeks, leading the university to sue to restore the funding.Most of that grant money is appropriated by Congress for the National Institutes of Health to disburse to fund biomedical research, however, which is not typically done at trade schools. Harvard did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House did not immediately comment on what specific funds Trump wants to repurpose.On Friday, a US judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students, a policy the Ivy League school said was part of Trump's broader effort to retaliate against it for refusing to ""surrender its academic independence"".The order provides temporary relief to thousands of international students, who were faced with potentially having to transfer under a policy the university called a ""blatant violation"" of the US Constitution and other federal laws. It said the move would have an ""immediate and devastating effect"" on the university and more than 7,000 visa holders. Harvard enrolled nearly 6,800 international students in its current school year, representing 27% of total enrollment.The move was the latest escalation in a broader battle between Harvard and White House, as Trump seeks to compel varsities, law firms, media, courts and other institutions to align with his agenda.(This is a Reuters story)",Trump has frozen some $3 billion in grants to Harvard in recent weeks.

Trump said the best thing Harvard has going for it is that they have shopped around and found the absolute best judge for them. ""But have no fear, the government will, in the end, WIN,"" Trump said, adding that he's still waiting for the lists of foreign students so that the administration can determine how many ""radicalized"" students should not be let back into the country.""Harvard is very slow in the presentation of these documents, and probably for good reason!"" Trump added.Trump also said he is considering taking three billion dollars of grant money away and giving it to the trade schools all across the country. ""What a great investment that would be for the USA, and so badly needed!!!""As of now, Harvard has won against the Trump administration's crackdown as it got a stay on the administration's ban on enrolling foreign students. Harvard's lawyers argued that colleges and universities have a ""constitutionally protected right to manage an academic community and evaluate teaching and scholarship free from governmental interference."" They pointed to case law that protects ""not only students and teachers, but their host institutions as well.

Making a political comeback, Donald Trump won the 2024 US presidential election, defeating Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Trump secured 312 electoral votes, while Harris finished with 226, making Trump the first US president since Grover Cleveland to return to office after a gap.Trump’s win was powered by key victories in battleground states such as Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. His campaign focused heavily on economic issues, immigration, and crime, themes that resonated with large sections of the electorate, particularly in suburban and rural areas.He also made notable gains among Latino and Black voters compared to previous Republican performances.Kamala Harris, who had served as vice president under Joe Biden, ran on a platform of protecting democracy, healthcare access, and abortion rights, but struggled to overcome economic concerns and voter fatigue with the Democratic administration.The Republican Party also regained control of the Senate and held onto the House of Representatives, giving them a full legislative majority.This GOP trifecta marks a significant shift in US politics and is expected to shape future policy directions on immigration, taxes, and foreign affairs.Voter turnout was strong, crossing 63 per cent, reflecting the deep national interest in the high-stakes election.","Trump secured 312 electoral votes, while Harris finished with 226, making Trump the first US president since Grover Cleveland to return to office after a gap.

BLACK LIVES MATTER GOES MAINSTREAM



The Black Lives Matter Blacklist



How the GOP Turned BLM Into a Weapon



BLM FUELS TRUMP MANIA



A DEMOCRATIC ALBATROSS



APATHETIC TO DISSENT







With the benefit of hindsight—and hindsight is always immensely beneficial—one can say that when Derek Chauvin decided to press his knee into George Floyd’s neck, he not only committed an act of brutality that shocked the world but inadvertently triggered a political chain reaction that broke the Democratic Party as we know it and made America apathetic to dissent, thanks to the faltering Black Lives Matter movement.For those who need a trip down memory lane, on May 25, 2020, a white police officer in Minneapolis knelt on the neck of a Black man for over nine agonising minutes because a store clerk alleged he had used a counterfeit $20 bill at a convenience store. The horrifying footage, showing Floyd pleading for his life, calling for his mother, and then going still, became an enduring political image of our time, igniting both America and the world.Millions took to the streets as it became the largest civil rights protest in American history.From Andheri to Amsterdam, activists across the world, who wouldn’t be able to name a single victim of police brutality in their own cities—even with a gun to their head—made placards for George Floyd. Black Lives Matter became a rallying call of global justice against racial injustice, police brutality, and every form of tyranny.America, which till 2008 held the record for the highest percentage of individuals incarcerated (it’s now number five behind El Salvador, Cuba, Rwanda, and Turkmenistan), looked like it would have to reckon with its history of police brutality and intolerance—and the movement that was at the heart of this reckoning was Black Lives Matter.The movement had been around since 2013, but in 2020, it became the litmus test of political morality. Corporates wrote “Black Lives Matter” on their social media profiles. Sports teams and celebrities said it with pride. Even Mitt Romney joined a march, and it appeared that Black Lives Matter was an absolute vote-winner, a chance for Democrats to finally be on the right side of history and wash their racist past of supporting slavery.Statues of Lincoln, Roosevelt, and even Frederick Douglass were defaced or toppled in a frenzy that felt more therapeutic than political.Meanwhile, murals of George Floyd sprang up across the world—not as a symbol of state brutality, but elevated as a near-messianic icon. Yet Floyd was not Malcolm X, nor was he Martin Luther King Jr. He was not a philosopher of resistance or a tactician of civil disobedience. He was just a man caught in the wrong moment, a victim of America’s original sin whose tragic death was contorted into sainthood by a movement too thirsty for symbols and too shallow for substance.BLM became the moral edifice of the post-Obama era, as Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer kneeled in kente cloths to show they were listening and learning.“Defund the police” went from fringe activist language to main theme song. Voices of concern that suggested putting all eggs in this basket could portend troubling times were silenced, among them House Majority Whip James Clyburn, who forewarned that BLM could do as much damage as “Burn, baby, burn” during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.The Dems were also not helped by the internal scandals of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, which raised $90 million in 2020, of which only one-third reached local chapters or other charitable causes. Most was instead used for self-enrichment and self-adducent through consulting fees, salaries, and questionable real estate purchases.Co-founder Patrisse Cullors faced public scrutiny after purchasing four properties worth over $3 million. One, a $6 million mansion in Los Angeles, was described as a ""creative campus"" but appeared more suited to influencer content creation than grassroots organising. $1.6 million was paid to her brother for security services, and $2.1 million went to a board member’s consulting firm. And in 2024, when BLMGNF sued the Tides Foundation for mismanagement of $33 million in donations, it further clouded the narrative.Families of victims whose names powered the movement were among the harshest critics. Breonna Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer, accused BLM of profiting from her daughter’s death. Samaria Rice, mother of Tamir Rice, called the group ""a fraud.""As the Democrats coped with the fallout of the Black Lives Matter movement, the Republicans—always making up in message discipline what they lack in moral urgency—branded themselves the party of rule of law, order, security, and anti-wokeness, while placing their bets on an ex-con and reality TV star best known for wheeling and dealing.Cities with BLM protests like San Francisco, Portland, and Chicago were painted as lawless dystopias where rioters could walk out with any shopping item they needed. Despite the fact that most police budgets grew or remained intact, and that violent crime rates were actually down, perception became reality.In 2022, Republicans had spent over $50 million on crime-related ads, with over half targeting BLM or ""defund the police"" talking points. It was at the heart of Marco Rubio’s re-election to the Senate, as he managed to make his Democratic opponent Val Demings—a former police chief who explicitly called “defunding” crazy—still fend off the attack. The GOP’s framing was ruthlessly effective: Democrats were lifeless, cowardly, and captive to radicals.BLM also became a dog whistle—then a bullhorn—for the Republican cultural offensive that painted Democrats as out-of-touch priests and priestesses of elite academia.For anxious middle Americans, BLM was the main course of liberal overreach, with sides of trans-obsession in schools and sports, Critical Race Theory in classrooms, drag shows, gender pronouns, cancel culture, and ESG mandates.Interestingly, Trump’s popularity dipped in the aftermath of the George Floyd protests, helping swing voters towards the Dems. The aftereffect handed the GOP the initiative.By 2023–24, with Trump staging his comeback, Republicans had tied BLM to everything from crime and inflation to classroom politics. Trump’s “law and order” brand benefited from the perception—if not the reality—of rising urban crime. While FBI data showed violent crime declined in 2022 and 2023 after a 2020 spike, the public felt otherwise: Gallup found 63% of Americans in 2023 believed crime was a “very” or “extremely serious” problem. Perception had overtaken data, and the GOP was quick to exploit it.What the numbers say is this: while BLM initially sparked a wave of sympathy and demands for change, the long arc of public opinion—and electoral data—suggests a backlash that cut deep into Democratic coalitions. Trump’s approval dipped during the height of protests, but by 2024, his support among young Black men and Latino men under 45 had significantly risen, doubling in some cases from 2020 levels. Asian-American support for Democrats slipped by 7 percentage points. Meanwhile, Gallup showed crime concerns hitting a two-decade high, with 77% of Americans believing crime had worsened.FBI data showed crime falling, but perception had become political reality. Democrats, divided over identity politics and slogans like “defund the police,” found themselves losing support from working-class, suburban, and minority voters who had once formed their backbone. In the final tally, these shifts didn’t just help Trump win—they redrew the battleground map, helping Trump become the first Republican since George Bush in 2004 to win the popular vote.BLM's impact on Harris’s 2024 campaign was especially acute. Harris, once seen as a future-facing icon of multiracial America, was dragged down by her past support for bail funds during the protests and her association with reformist messaging. Her lifeless interviews and townhalls, often with vacillating accents punctuated with a laughter track, didn’t really assuage voters.When the DNC moved to coronate her as nominee following Biden’s exit, BLM activists publicly objected, demanding a “virtual snap primary,” accusing the party elites of ignoring grassroots voices. Harris failed to explain whether she was pro- or anti-BLM or how her campaign would be any different from Biden’s, and Trump, on the other hand, used every opportunity to use BLM’s legacy to call out Dems for the disorder and chaos.The cultural reckoning that began with Floyd’s murder had, five years later, helped bring Donald Trump back to the White House—where he and his merry band of Peter Principle apostles returned. The first African-American Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall, had argued that democracy couldn’t flourish amid fear, not when one played ostrich. Liberty could never bloom amid hate, and justice could never take root amid rage.He had said in 1992: “We must dissent from the apathy. We must dissent from the fear, the hatred and the mistrust. We must dissent from a nation that has buried its head in the sand, waiting in vain for the needs of its poor, its elderly, and its sick to disappear and just blow away. We must dissent from a government that has left its young without jobs, education or hope. We must dissent from the poverty of vision and the absence of moral leadership. We must dissent because America can do better, because America has no choice but to do better.”Sadly, Black Lives Matter didn’t just become an albatross around the Democratic Party’s neck. It also ended up making Americans so cynical that instead of dissenting from apathy, they ended up becoming apathetic to dissent.","In May 2020, a police officer in Minneapolis knelt on the neck of a Black man for over nine agonising minutes because a store clerk alleged he had used a counterfeit $20 bill at a convenience store.

Poll Do you believe that climate change is contributing to extreme weather events in Pakistan? Yes No





At least 14 people were killed and more than 100 injured after powerful windstorms swept across central and northern Pakistan following a days-long heatwave, officials confirmed on Sunday.The storms, described as “particularly destructive” by authorities, battered the provinces of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa as well as Islamabad on Saturday afternoon and evening.Mazhar Hussain, spokesperson for the Punjab disaster management authority, was quoted by news agency AFP as saying, “This windstorm was particularly destructive. The wind speed was very high. There was so much dust in it that visibility was greatly reduced.”According to him, the extreme weather followed several days of intense heat, with temperatures exceeding 45°C. “There were three to four days in the recent heatwave where temperatures went up quite a lot,” he added, attributing the sudden storm to the intense build-up of heat.The majority of casualties were caused by collapsing roofs and walls, while at least two people died after being struck by solar panels dislodged by high-speed winds.In one tragic incident, lightning claimed the life of one man and injured three others.The storms uprooted trees, knocked over electric poles, and caused significant damage to vehicles and infrastructure. Social media was flooded with dramatic videos showing the aftermath, including a viral clip filmed inside a passenger plane struggling to land in Lahore before being diverted to Karachi amid severe turbulence.Islamabad and surrounding areas have also seen multiple unusual hailstorms over April and May, damaging vehicles and solar panels—marking a growing trend of erratic and extreme weather events in the country.Pakistan is widely recognised as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, with early summers and intense heatwaves becoming increasingly common.India is also battling extreme temperatures. According to news agency ANI, Rajasthan's Jaisalmer hit 48°C, forcing locals indoors. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) warned that severe heatwave conditions will continue in Rajasthan until May 27 and in Punjab, Haryana, and Jammu and Kashmir until May 26.Meanwhile, heavy monsoon rainfall has already arrived on India’s west coast, with IMD forecasting intense downpours over Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Goa in the coming week.Back in Pakistan, the Meteorological Department has predicted more storms on Sunday, raising concerns about further damage and casualties.","Powerful windstorms swept across central and northern Pakistan following a days- long heatwave.

Abdul Latif Baloch, a well-known journalist in Pakistan's Balochistan province, was shot dead inside his home in Mashkay, in the wee hours of Saturday.The Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), a local rights group, confirmed that he was shot by state-backed armed groups at around 3 am, in front of his wife and children, reported news agency ANI.Latif was respected for his fearless coverage of human rights abuses and military operations in Balochistan. His work focused on enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and the struggle of ordinary Baloch citizens. His death underlines the extreme risk faced by reporters in Pakistan.This incident comes just months after his son, Saif Baloch, and seven other family members were reportedly abducted by security forces and later found dead.

Jailed former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has ruled out any negotiations with Pakistan's civilian government, declaring that only talks with the country’s military establishment are meaningful.In a post on X, Khan said, “Engaging in any talks with the puppet Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government is pointless. This illegitimate Form-47 installed government has already wasted two months. Its only objective is to cling to false authority. It holds no real power.”Khan, who has been behind bars since August 2023 in multiple cases following the collapse of his government in April 2022, stressed that negotiations would only be held with those who actually “hold power”, the military establishment, and only in the national interest.“I do not fear hardship as my resolve remains strong,” he said, while alleging that political cases, abductions, and forced press conferences were being used to dismantle his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. “All prove that the rule of law has been entirely dismantled. What we now have is the law of the jungle,” he added.Reiterating his stance from earlier this week, Khan stated that May 9, 2023, the day of violent protests after his arrest, was a “false flag operation” designed to crush PTI.“No CCTV footage has been presented to this day... The truth will be evident to all if the CCTV footage of that day is made public,” he added, as reported by news agency PTI.In a separate post, Khan also dismissed media reports suggesting that a deal was in the works with the military. “No one has approached me for any negotiations. News claiming otherwise is entirely false,” he said, adding that despite harsh jail conditions, including denial of access to his children and physician, he remains steadfast.He recently took a swipe at Army chief General Asim Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, saying “it might have been more fitting to give him the title of ‘King’ instead, because right now, the country is ruled by the law of the jungle. And in the jungle, there is only one king,” as per PTI.Meanwhile, the Punjab government said Khan has refused to undergo polygraph and voice analysis tests in 12 terrorism cases linked to the May 9 riots for the third consecutive time.Pakistani Punjab’s information minister Azma Bokhari accused Khan of defying court orders, saying he made repeated excuses to avoid the tests. “He must understand this is Adiala Jail, not his Bani Gala residence,” she said.The trial in the GHQ attack case, which was last heard in February, has been adjourned again until May 29. Separately, the hearing in the Toshakhana-II case was postponed to May 26.Khan’s party has also urged the Islamabad High Court to speed up hearings in the Al-Qadir Trust case involving Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi.

Sindhudesh as an independent nation: JSMM demands UN recognition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/sindhudesh-as-an-independent-nation-jsmm-demands-un-recognition/articleshow/121359382.cms,".

The Sindhudesh Global Freedom Charter





The Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), a Sindhi nationalist group led by exiled chairman Shafi Burfat, has issued a renewed plea to the United Nations and other international communities, urging recognition of Sindhudesh as an independent nation and calling attention to what it describes as sustained political repression and human rights violations in Pakistan ’s Sindh province.In a comprehensive political manifesto titled, JSMM has approached the United Nations, international human rights bodies, democratic governments, and global civil society organizations, arguing that the Sindhi people are subject to a form of internal colonialism under Pakistan’s military and political establishment.In a direct appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian public, JSMM cited historical and cultural ties between Sindh and India, requesting moral and political solidarity. The group also called on international institutions to send human rights observers, document alleged violations, and engage with Sindh’s demand for peaceful self-determination.JSMM alleges that demographic engineering through state-sponsored resettlement has diluted Sindh’s ethnic composition, threatening the linguistic and cultural identity of the Sindhi people. Environmental degradation, particularly the diversion of the Indus river’s waters, has compounded local grievances, with widespread desertification of once-fertile lands cited as an ecological consequence of state policy.The statement firmly condemned Pakistan's security forces for committing serious human rights abuses in Sindh, including enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings of political activists, journalists, and student leaders. It mentioned that anti-terrorism legislation is being misused to target secular and nationalist movements, whereas religious extremists receive support from the state.Positioning itself as a secular, democratic movement, JSMM has reiterated its vision for a sovereign Republic of Sindhudesh, grounded in principles of equality, minority protections, and social justice. The group invokes international law including the United Nations Charter and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to support Sindh’s right to self-determination.Long before modern borders were drawn, Sindh flourished as the heart of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation which was a sophisticated urban society that emerged over 5,000 years ago along the banks of the Indus river. With advanced city planning, intricate craftsmanship, and a vibrant mercantile culture, Sindh was once a beacon of early human progress. Mohenjo-daro, one of the civilisation’s most iconic sites, still stands as a testament to the region’s intellectual and architectural legacy. This deep-rooted historical identity is central to the Sindhi nationalist narrative, which views contemporary political struggles as a continuation of a civilisational arc interrupted by colonial conquests and post partition state formation.I n the colonial era, Sindh existed as a distinct administrative region under British India before being annexed, and eventually was re-established as a separate province in 1936. Advocates for Sindhi autonomy argue that this period fostered a unique political consciousness, one that emphasised cultural plurality and regional pride. The Partition of 1947, however, redrew not just boundaries but identities. Over subsequent decades, Sindhi activists have pointed to a pattern of political marginalisation and centralised control, arguing that their historical autonomy has been systematically pulled apart.Framing Sindh’s struggle as both civilizational and contemporary, the charter situated the region within the historical legacy of the Indus valley civilization, asserting that Sindh was forced into joining Pakistan in 1947 and has since faced cultural erasure and economic exploitation. The document claims that Sindh's resources including oil, gas, coal, fertile farmland, and deep-sea ports have been systematically extracted to benefit other regions, while the local population remains economically marginalized.While JSMM’s claims are politically charged and remain unacknowledged by the Pakistani state, the charter marks a significant step in internationalizing what has largely been a domestic conflict.","The Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), a Sindhi nationalist group led by exiled chairman Shafi Burfat, has issued a renewed plea to the United Nations and other international communities.

A promotion after defeat: What's behind Asim Munir's Field Marshal gambit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/field-marshal-asim-munir-pakistan-army-chief-operation-sindoor-india-and-pakistan/articleshow/121319156.cms,"Asim Munir’s grip on power may look firm, but it’s anything but secure.

Promotion or protection?

Officially, the move is being framed as a recognition of ""strategic brilliance."" PM Sharif praised Munir’s ""decisive defeat of the enemy,"" asserting that under his leadership, the military ""staunchly defended Pakistan’s sovereignty."" Munir himself called the promotion ""an honour for the armed forces and the nation.""

But few outside Pakistan’s tightly controlled media landscape are buying it.

""Field Marshal rank is usually conferred after a military victory,"" Tilak Devasher, a seasoned Pakistan watcher, told the Economic Times. ""This may be the first time it has been awarded after a defeat-it seems intended to mask that defeat.""

The timing is hard to ignore. Pakistan’s public is still reeling from the fallout of the India strikes, and internal dissent within the army is reportedly rising.

A widely circulated letter from a group calling itself ""The Guardians of Honour"" accused Munir of corruption and military incompetence. The letter reflects what some analysts say is quiet but growing discontent within senior ranks.

A shield against scrutiny

All ceremony, no strategy

The big picture: The war at home

Munir’s rise comes at a fragile moment for Pakistan. The ceasefire with India has held for now. But underneath the diplomatic calm lies a volatile domestic landscape:

Security turmoil: Over 3,700 terror incidents have claimed nearly 3,900 lives in the past 17 months, according to ISPR figures-pointing to a deteriorating internal security climate, especially in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Critics accuse Munir of leveraging the Pahalgam terror incident to consolidate power.

With rising inflation, IMF-dependency, and India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan's economy teeters on the edge. The military’s growing political role is being scrutinized for exacerbating the instability. Observers note that Munir is not merely defending national borders-he is navigating a labyrinth of domestic vulnerabilities that could unravel his authority.

His use of the two-nation theory and religious rhetoric to frame the India conflict was seen by critics as an attempt to rally the nation behind him. But the strategy may have backfired. ""Instead of unifying the nation, the gambit drew attention to Pakistan’s widening fractures,"" write analysts Ashok Behuria and Uttam Sinha in a joint commentary in the TOI.

The ghost of Imran Khan

What’s next

Munir’s elevation to Field Marshal is not about military strategy-it’s about political survival. It’s about shoring up a fractured command structure, muffling dissent, and projecting strength in the face of growing weakness.

Though the promotion may temporarily strengthen Munir’s position, it doesn’t erase the challenges ahead:

Internal threats persist, from Baloch separatists to the resurgent Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.

PTI's political comeback looms, with Khan’s moral leverage growing even from prison.

Civil-military tension could intensify, especially if the rank is seen as an attempt to silence dissent or circumvent institutional checks.

There’s also talk of Munir eventually transitioning into a political role-possibly even as president. Ayub Khan set the precedent. In Pakistan’s fragile democracy, few would be surprised if history rhymed again.





In a move steeped more in symbolism than substance, Pakistan’s powerful army chief General Asim Munir has been elevated to the rarefied rank of Field Marshal . The announcement, made on Tuesday by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, marks the first such promotion in over six decades. Only one other man-military dictator Ayub Khan in 1959-has held the title.But unlike Ayub, who awarded himself the rank amid consolidating his political power, Munir’s elevation comes on the heels of a military debacle. A bruising exchange with India, following a deadly attack in Pahalgam, resulted in India striking at least nine Pakistani air bases. The damage, while officially downplayed in Pakistan, left Munir politically exposed.So why the promotion? And why now?In a country where generals often enjoy impunity, the Field Marshal title may serve more as legal and political armor than as a mark of distinction. Some analysts see the promotion as a pre-emptive move to insulate Munir from possible court martial or early retirement, the ET report said.Legal experts point out that the Pakistani constitution makes no mention of the rank.Nor does the Pakistan Army Act. Instead, the promotion was reportedly made under Rule 199A of the Army Regulations (1998), which states that a general may be promoted to Field Marshal ""without regard to seniority or any specific appointment.""In essence, the move raises Munir above the military’s existing command structure-and, potentially, above accountability.Though technically ceremonial, the rank carries potent political meaning. In Pakistan’s civil-military power dynamic, optics often matter more than operational command.""Munir is now very much in the driving seat as the pivot of the power structure,"" said Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, former chair of the Senate defense committee. ""Given the weakness and divisions amongst the civilian politicians... all the mainstream political forces were convinced that the road to Islamabad lies through Rawalpindi.""That reality is reflected in the government’s simultaneous decision to extend the term of air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu-his second extension. Sidhu was credited with executing Operation Bunyanun Marsoos, Pakistan’s retaliatory air campaign against India's Operation Sindoor Still, in a tightly managed information environment, the military’s version of events prevails. State media declared a historic victory. Social media was flooded with hashtags like #PakistanStandsUnited. Meanwhile, dissenting voices-journalists, analysts, even former officers-vanished from screens.Munir’s political calculus also includes a rising challenge from behind bars: Former Prime Minister Imran Khan. His PTI party has labeled Munir a ""warmonger and coward,"" accusing him of dragging Pakistan into war to consolidate power. Khan’s moral authority, paradoxically strengthened by his imprisonment, continues to mobilize his base.Sharif’s civilian government, already seen as beholden to the military, risks further erosion of legitimacy. As one viral meme put it: ""War fought by Airforce. Army Chief promoted. Army’s only contribution-taking videos of tanks and hiding in bunkers.""(With inputs from agencies)","Pakistan's powerful army chief Asim Munir has been elevated to the rank of Field Marshal.

COLOMBO: Debt-stricken Sri Lanka hosted one of New Zealand's top ministers to discuss ways to deepen bilateral ties in areas such as trade, tourism and agriculture.Winston Peters, New Zealand's deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister, met Sri Lanka's foreign affairs minister Vijitha Herath in the capital, Colombo, on Monday. The five-day visit by Peters is scheduled to continue until WednesdayThe visit comes as Sri Lanka struggles to emerge from its worst economic crisis, which began in the Indian Ocean island nation three years ago.The countries have improved relations in recent years, establishing a New Zealand embassy in Colombo in 2021 and a Sri Lankan embassy in Wellington this year.The discussion Monday focused on advancing ties in trade, investment, agriculture, education, and tourism, Herath said.""We also explored expanding trade links in high-potential sectors such as dairy, processed food, fresh produce and discussed improving market access for Sri Lankan products,"" Herath told reporters.He commended New Zealand's support in developing Sri Lanka's dairy industry, saying it had a ""transformational impact on rural livelihood.""Sri Lanka has embarked on an effort to expand and modernize its domestic dairy industry in recent years, but still produces only about 40% of the country's demand for milk and dairy products, while the balance is imported.New Zealand is a key supplier of those dairy products, especially milk powder.In 2024, New Zealand exported $335 million in goods to Sri Lanka, with dairy products forming the bulk.Trade balance between the nations favors New Zealand, which in 2024 imported goods worth $64 million from Sri Lanka, including tea, coffee, apparel and rubber products.The discussion included reducing red tape at the border and how to ""increase Sri Lanka's market access capabilities,"" Peters said.""We discussed the growing number of New Zealand companies working with and investing in Sri Lanka or looking to work with Sri Lankan partners,"" said Peters, adding that those collaborations will benefit Sri Lanka's tourism, agriculture and healthcare sectors.Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy in April 2022 with more than $83 billion in debt, more than half to foreign creditors. It sought the help of the International Monetary Fund, which approved a $2.9 billion, four-year bailout package in 2023 under which Sri Lanka was required to restructure its debt.In September last year, Sri Lanka said it had concluded the debt restructuring process after reaching agreements with bilateral and multilateral creditors and private bondholders. Sri Lanka is seeking to obtain $17 billion in debt service relief.Sri Lanka's crisis was largely the result of economic mismanagement combined with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, along with 2019 terrorism attacks that devastated its important tourism industry.

DHAKA: Bangladesh security forces surrounded the national tax authority headquarters on Sunday as its employees extended a two-week-long strike over the interim government's reforms, reportedly leaving millions of dollars in taxes uncollected.Government orders to overhaul the powerful tax authority, the National Board of Revenue (NBR), have sparked fury from ordinary employees to top management.""Tax, customs, and VAT -- all three wings will observe a complete work abstention from Monday,"" Joint Tax Commissioner Monalisa Saha Sushmita told reporters at the main NBR building in Dhaka, where police and armed security gathered.Bangladesh has been in turmoil since a student-led revolt ousted former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, ending her 15-year iron-fisted rule.The interim government -- led by Nobel Peace Prize microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus -- is trying to instil sweeping government reforms.The tax board protest reflects the divisions, rival loyalties and confusion between government branches and the caretaker administration.The government order issued on May 12 proposed splitting the powerful money-raising NRB into two.Crucially, it would also hand control of the new sections to government-chosen civil servants from outside the NRB.Sushmita claimed that the strike will mean, in effect, that ""imports and exports will also be halted"" and that tax revenues totalling between $122-163 million per day had not been collected since the strike began.It was not possible to verify those figures.Bangladesh is the world's second-largest garment manufacturer, while textile and garment production accounts for about 80 percent of the country's exports.The industry has been rebuilding after it was hit hard by last year's unrest.In separate protests on Sunday, hundreds of civil servants demonstrated in Dhaka against a government order giving it greater power to sack employees for disciplinary breaches.""If the government proceeds with the amended ordinance, the interim government will face severe criticism,"" said Mohammad Nazrul Islam from the Inter-Ministerial Employees Association.",Government orders to overhaul the powerful tax authority have sparked fury from ordinary employees to top management.

Rare earth elements crucial industrial inputs?



A call for responsible mining:



Will KIO enforce more responsible mining?





Lahtaw Kai draws an imaginary mountain into the air with her hands and uses her fingers to dot it with holes.""At the top of the mountains, they drill holes and then pour chemicals like ammonium nitrate into the ground to extract the rare earth minerals at the bottom,"" the Myanmar environment activist told DW.Lahtaw Kai — whose name we've changed for security reasons — was illustrating the so-called in-situ leaching technique, which has been applied for decades in mining rare earths in Myanmar's northern Kachin state.The process begins at the top of the mountains, where chemicals are injected into the earth through a network of pipes. As the solution tracks downslope, it gathers rare earth elements, which are then collected in large ponds.At hundreds of mining sites in the region, in-situ leaching is proving to be a huge risk to both the environment and local villagers.""The rare earth sludge dries out in wood-fired kilns, and areas close to the mining sites constantly smell bad,"" said Lahtaw Kai, adding that she and her research team cannot stay there for more than 30 minutes because it's hard to breathe.""But people are working there without gloves and masks.Companies don't provide protection. So, the workers get sick and then [the company] fires them and brings in new workers,"" she added.Seng Li, a human rights activist currently based in Chiang Mai, Thailand, has researched mining sites in Myanmar's north and says the mountains used to be green before mining started.""Now those mountains are very ugly, the river turned red. Some of the chemicals they use in the mining pools, they just dump into the waters,"" he told DW.DW met both Lahtaw Kai and Seng Li on the sidelines of a recent tour of Europe, where they were campaigning for support of their cause. They want to make Europeans aware of what happens at the beginning of global supply chains that finally lead to products such as electric vehicles, wind turbines, medical equipment, and even weapons.Julie Klinger, assistant professor at the University of Delaware in the United States, explains that the term rare-earth elements refers to 17 chemically similar elements in the so-called periodic table of elements.""The thing that distinguishes these elements is their fantastic, magnetic and conductive, and in some cases thermal properties,"" she told DW.Also called the ""spice of industry,"" rare earths can be used in relatively small quantities to enhance industrial processes.Dysprosium, for example, is used as a catalyst in petrochemical refining, said Klinger, and can be found in Myanmar's north. The element with a metallic silver luster is essential for battery production, increasing their heat efficiency and longevity, making it a key component for the green energy transition.Dysprosium is also used in producing permanent magnets capable of maintaining a constant magnetic field needed for modern power generators in electric vehicles or wind turbines.Nonprofit organization Global Witness reported in 2024 that Chinese producers of permanent magnets are sourcing rare earths from Myanmar.Among the customers of China-made rare-earths products specifically named by the report are global auto giants Volkswagen , Toyota, Nissan, Ford and Hyundai, as well as wind power firms like Siemens Gamesa and Vestas.Another report compiled by Adams Intelligence— a consultancy for strategic metals and minerals based in Toronto, Canada — found Germany to be China's biggest customer for sourcing permanent magnets in 2024.China has reduced domestic mining for rare-earth elements, increasing the exploitation of deposits in neighboring Myanmar.Chinese imports of so-called heavy rare earth elements from Myanmar skyrocketed from their previous highs of 19,500 tons in 2021 to 41,700 tons in 2023, the Global Witness report says.""That's like a page out of the US playbook from the 20th century,"" said Julie Klinger, referring to the US approach of strategically not mining its domestic uranium deposits to safeguard them for later.Lahtaw Kai says people in Myanmar don't want the Chinese to continue mining, and adds: ""If the international community wants to continue buying these minerals, they should be responsibly sourced.""Myanmar's lucrative trade in rare earths — worth $1.4 billion (€1.2 billion) in 2023, according to Global Witness — risks financing conflict and destruction in a highly volatile region.In 2018, Myanmar’s civilian-led government had banned exports and ordered Chinese miners to wind down operations, but since 2021, extraction has continued in the context of a ruthless dictatorship and widening civil conflict.In late 2024, the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) and its allied military forces wrested control of most of the mineral-rich region in the north from forces allied with the central government. KIO has been fighting for the region's independence since the 1960s.This power shift has led to new negotiations between KIO and Chinese producers on taxing rare earth extraction.While the KIO enjoys broad popular support in Kachin and greater legitimacy than government-allied militias, the 2024 Global Witness report says that on ""both sides, this largely unregulated mining is environmentally devastating, and the threat it poses to ecosystems and to human health is becoming ever more urgent.""Lahtaw Kai and Seng Li demand more public oversight of safety at the operations.""So far, civil society groups and the people have been excluded from the process of policy-making on mining [...] international organizations and governments should directly engage with the KIO to strengthen their governance,"" said Seng Li.And although Seng Li doesn't think rare-earth mining can be stopped, he said conditions must be improved to ""benefit not only the armed actors and the Chinese investors."" The local populations and the state should ""share the benefits, through systematic and regulated processes.""","Rare earth elements are crucial industrial inputs for electric vehicles, wind turbines, medical equipment, and even weapons.

Poll Do you believe that Afghanistan is adequately prepared for natural disasters? Yes No





An earthquake of magnitude 4.2 struck Afghanistan in the early hours of Sunday, marking the fifth tremor to jolt the country in just over a week. According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the latest earthquake occurred at 6.33am IST at a depth of 135 kms.So far, there have been no confirmed reports of injuries or structural damage, though assessments are still underway.The region experienced four previous earthquakes between May 16 and May 20. On Monday, May 19, a 4.2 magnitude quake was recorded. A day earlier, on May 18, a slightly stronger 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck at a depth of 150 kms. Prior to that, quakes of magnitudes 4.2 and 4.0 were reported on May 17 and 16, respectively.The recent spike in seismic activity has raised concerns among experts and residents alike. Afghanistan, particularly the Hindu Kush region, is recognised as a seismically active zone due to its location along the collision boundary between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. A major fault line also runs through the western province of Herat, further amplifying the region’s vulnerability.The International Red Cross and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) have frequently highlighted Afghanistan’s susceptibility to natural disasters, including earthquakes, landslides, and seasonal flooding.More information is awaited as monitoring agencies continue to assess the impact.","The latest earthquake occurred at 6.33am IST at a depth of 135 kms.

He (Yunus) is definitely staying,"" said Bangladesh planning adviser Wahiduddin Mahmud.He said none of the advisers was going anywhere as ""the responsibility entrusted to us is a significant one; we cannot abandon this duty"".The chief adviser's decision to stay in office came two days after he told student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) leaders that he was mulling resignation as he felt ""the situation is such that he cannot work"", citing difficulties in working amid the failure of political parties to find common ground for change.Yunus reportedly expressed an identical desire to quit in a cabinet meeting on Thursday, where his colleagues persuaded him not to relinquish.Talk of Yunus's resignation came amid reports of discord between the military and the interim govt over the possible timeline for holding parliamentary elections and a policy issue related to Bangladesh's security affairs involving a proposed humanitarian corridor of aid channel to Myanmar's rebel-held Rakhine state.Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman, along with the navy and air force chiefs, met Yunus three days ago and reportedly reiterated their call for election by Dec to allow an elected govt to take charge and conveyed their reservation about the corridor issue. The next day, Gen Zaman told a meeting of senior officers that he was unaware of several strategic decisions despite the military's active role.Yunus was also expected to meet leaders of former PM Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Jamaat-e-Islami, following his call for talks amid the evolving political situation in recent days.","Yunus reportedly expressed an identical desire to quit in a cabinet meeting on Thursday, where his colleagues persuaded him not to relinquish.

A 53-year-old British man was arrested after he plowed a car into the crowd of pedestrians in England who were celebrating Liverpool's Premier League victory at a Monday parade, resulting in injuries to nearly 50 people.Several videos and footage shared by the users on X, showed the car ploughing into the group of people and then speeding up before coming to a halt.Other footage shows people striking the car after it stopped, with the back windscreen shattered.According to the authorities, a man drove his minivan into the crowd of soccer fans in the northwestern English city at approximately 6:03 pm on Monday, May 26, 2025. Emergency vehicles and an air ambulance rushed to the scene to attend to the injured.Merseyside Police initiated an investigation into the incident's circumstances.The incident resulted in the injuries of 47 people, including four children.

Liverpool Victory Parade TURNS NIGHTMARE; Dozens Injured, 2 Critical | WATCH Updates





A day of jubilation turned into chaos in Liverpool on Monday as a car deliberately drove into crowds celebrating the city’s Premier League title win, injuring at least 27 people. Merseyside Police have arrested a 53-year-old local man in connection with the incident and confirmed it is not being treated as an act of terrorism.“We believe this to be an isolated incident, and we are not currently looking for anyone else in relation to it,” said Merseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims at a press briefing. “The incident is not being treated as terrorism,” she added.The crash took place at around 6:00 pm local time near Water Street, shortly after Liverpool's open-top victory bus passed the area. An AFP journalist on site reported several victims being carried away on stretchers, though the full extent of the injuries is still unknown.""It was extremely fast,"" said Harry Rashid, 48, who was attending the parade with his wife and daughters. ""Initially we just heard the pop, pop, pop of people just being knocked off the bonnet of the car. It was horrible and you could hear the bumps as he was going over the people.""Another eyewitness, Mike Maddra, said, ""The car turned left, mounted the pavement, came towards us and ran towards the buildings. We got out the way and it was speeding up.""Emergency services responded swiftly, setting up cordons and treating the injured on-site. The North West Ambulance Service said it was coordinating with other agencies to manage the aftermath.Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the incident as “appalling” and expressed solidarity with those affected. “My thoughts are with all those injured or affected,” he wrote on X, adding that he was receiving updates on the ongoing investigation.BBC journalist Matt Cole, who was at the parade with his daughter, recalled the terrifying moments. “There were screams ahead of us and suddenly this dark blue car just came through the crowd. It just wasn't stopping. I managed to grab my daughter who was with me and jump out of the way... The car missed myself and my family by literally inches.”Videos on social media showed the vehicle being surrounded by angry fans after it came to a halt, with some smashing its windows while officers tried to manage the crowd. Police urged the public not to speculate and confirmed the driver was a white British man from Liverpool.Liverpool FC posted on X that it was working with authorities and said, “Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by this serious incident.” Metro Mayor Steve Rotheram described it as “a difficult day for our city region, but we stand together.”City rivals Everton also extended support, stating, “Our thoughts are with all those who have been affected by this serious incident in our city.”The day had begun in celebration, with hundreds of thousands of fans flooding the streets despite heavy rain to mark Liverpool’s record-equalling 20th English league title. Star players Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk led the team on a 10-mile parade route filled with fireworks and red smoke.This marked the first proper title celebration in 35 years. In 2020, when Liverpool last won the Premier League under Jurgen Klopp, the pandemic forced fans to stay home.The incident also rekindled sombre memories for Liverpool, a city familiar with football-related tragedies. In 1989, 97 fans died in the Hillsborough disaster, and in 1985, 39 fans—mostly Italians—lost their lives at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels before a European Cup final.","A car deliberately drove into crowds celebrating Liverpool's Premier League title win, injuring at least 27 people.

The haunting holiday: Mystery deepens after British woman dies during Turkish trip but returns without heart,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/the-haunting-holiday-mystery-deepens-after-british-woman-dies-during-turkish-trip-but-returns-without-heart/articleshow/121408232.cms,"Mystery deepens after British woman dies during Turkish trip but returns without heart (Pic credit: GoFundMeUK)





A trip turned into a nightmarish mystery for a British family after 28-year-old Beth Martin, a mother of two, died suddenly in Turkey and returned home without her heart.Beth had only just touched down in Istanbul on April 27 when she began feeling unwell during her flight from the UK. Brushing it off as food poisoning, she pressed on with her trip. But within hours of arriving, she reportedly became ""delirious"" and was rushed to Marmara University Pendik Education and Research Hospital.She died the following day, April 28.Turkish authorities say Martin suffered ""cardiac arrest due to multiple organ failure,"" but have not provided any explanation for what triggered the rapid health deterioration. The situation took a bizarre turn when British coroners informed Beth's husband, Luke Martin, that her heart was missing from her chest when her body was repatriated.""It was the most unimaginable news. How does a hospital not know what happened to a patient's heart?"" Luke told the Daily Mail, expressing disbelief and frustration with the Turkish authorities, who he claims were evasive and even initially suspected him of poisoning his wife.In response to mounting media scrutiny, Turkey's ministry of health issued a statement denying any wrongdoing. They claimed Beth had not undergone any surgical procedure and refuted reports that her heart had been removed. However, they did not address why her heart was allegedly missing when examined in the UK.Beth's family has also raised concerns that she may have been given penicillin despite being allergic to it, a potential oversight that could have triggered her organ failure. These questions, coupled with the lack of clarity from Turkish officials, have prompted an investigation into the hospital.The case now spans two countries, with British coroners expected to take up to six months to determine the official cause of death. Meanwhile, Beth's grieving family is left in limbo, demanding answers and accountability.""She was a healthy young mother who went on a holiday and never came back,"" said a family member. ""We just want to know what really happened to Beth.""","Beth Martin, a mother of two, died suddenly in Turkey and returned home without her heart.

Alan Yentob, a pioneering figure in British broadcasting and the creative force behind decades of acclaimed BBC content, has died aged 78, his family confirmed on Saturday.Yentob joined the BBC in 1968 as a trainee and went on to become one of its most influential and recognisable figures. His long career spanned roles including controller of BBC One and Two, head of music and arts, director of television, and the organisation's first creative director, a position he held for more than a decade.His wife, Philippa Walker, paid tribute, calling Yentob “curious, funny, annoying, late and creative in every cell of his body,” and remembered him as “the kindest of men and a profoundly moral man.” She added, “Our life was exciting, he was exciting.”Yentob was widely celebrated for his contribution to arts programming. He edited and presented acclaimed series like Arena, Omnibus and Imagine, which profiled major cultural figures including David Bowie , Maya Angelou, Grayson Perry, and Charles Saatchi. His 1975 Omnibus documentary Cracked Actor, which followed a fragile but creatively explosive Bowie, remains one of his most iconic works.As per BBC, Yentob recalled it captured the singer at his “most fragile and exhausted.”BBC director-general Tim Davie described Yentob as “a creative force and a cultural visionary” whose “passion wasn’t performative – it was personal.” He added, “To work with Alan was to be inspired and encouraged to think bigger. He believed in the power of culture to enrich, challenge and connect us.”According to The Guardian, Davie also said Yentob had “a rare gift for identifying talent and lifting others up – a mentor and champion to so many across the worlds of television, film and theatre.”During his leadership at BBC Two from 1988, Yentob helped launch Absolutely Fabulous, Have I Got News for You and The Late Show. His work was influential in shaping the broadcaster’s arts and comedy output, and he also helped develop children's channels CBBC and CBeebies.Born in London in 1947 into an Iraqi Jewish family, Yentob grew up in Greater Manchester and studied law at the University of Leeds. When he joined the BBC World Service, he was the only non-Oxbridge graduate among his peers that year, reported The Guardian.Yentob's career wasn't without controversy. In 2015, he resigned as the BBC’s creative director amid scrutiny over his role as chairman of the charity Kids Company, which collapsed the same year. He denied any conflict of interest but admitted the coverage had become a “serious distraction” for the broadcaster, according to the BBC.Despite this, he continued producing content and was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2024 for services to the arts and media.Tributes have poured in from colleagues and friends. Actress Dawn French posted a photo with Yentob and Jennifer Saunders, calling him “our advocate from the start” and “a tip top chap.” The Pet Shop Boys called him “a legend in British TV” on social media, noting he was behind some of the BBC’s “finest programmes.”BBC Radio 4 presenter Amol Rajan called him “a towering figure in the culture of post-war Britain” and described his shows as “always brilliant, often masterpieces, sometimes seminal.” Rajan added: “He oozed fortitude until the very last… one of the most generous, influential, singular, passionate, supportive, creative and loved men of his generation.”Yentob is survived by his wife, Philippa Walker, and their two children.","Alan Yentob, a pioneering figure in British broadcasting, has died aged 78.

UK renationalises first train operator under Labour reforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-renationalises-first-train-operator-under-labour-reforms/articleshow/121392033.cms,"Representative Image (AI-generated)

Public good:





A private train operator servicing parts of southern England, including London, on Sunday became the first to be returned to public ownership under a government plan to renationalise Britain's much-maligned railways.All UK rail operators are due to be renationalised within the next two years in a key policy launched by Prime Minister Keir Starmer following his Labour party's return to government last July after 14 years in opposition.""South Western Railway is now under public ownership. And this is just the start,"" Starmer said on X, naming the service kickstarting his government's plan.He vowed the renationalisation ""will put passengers first"", with ""better services, with simpler ticketing, on more comfortable trains"".Train passengers in Britain suffer from frequent cancellations, in addition to high ticket prices and regular confusion over which services they can be used on.The privatisation of rail operations took place in the mid-1990s under the Conservative prime minister of the time, John Major, but the rail network remained public, run by Network Rail.Four of the 14 operators in England are already run by the state owing to poor performance in recent years, but this was originally meant to be a temporary fix before a return to the private sector.Labour triumphed over the Conservative party in elections last year, with its manifesto including promises to fix the country's ailing transport services.Legislation was approved in November to bring rail operators into public ownership when the private companies' contracts expire -- or sooner in the event of poor management -- and be managed by ""Great British Railways"".Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said in a statement that will end ""30 years of fragmentation"", but warned that ""change isn't going to happen overnight"".""We've always been clear that public ownership isn't a silver bullet, but we are really firing this starting gun in that race for a truly 21st-century railway, and that does mean refocusing away from private profit and towards the public good,"" she added.In an example of how passengers might not immediately notice much difference, South Western's first service under public ownership on Sunday was set to include a rail replacement bus because of engineering work.Government figures show that the equivalent of 4 per cent of train services in Britain were cancelled in the year to April 26.The rate was 3 per cent for South Western.Rail unions -- which have staged a stream of strikes in recent years over pay and conditions due to a cost-of-living crisis -- welcomed the state takeover.""We're delighted that Britain's railways are being brought back where they belong -- into the public sector,"" said Mick Whelan, general secretary of union Aslef.""Everyone in the rail industry knows that privatisation... didn't, and doesn't, work,"" he added.Two operators serving towns and cities in southeastern and eastern England are next to be brought back into public ownership by late 2025.All the current contracts are set to expire by 2027.UK media reported that the renationalisation of South Western means a third of journeys are now on publicly owned services.The government has said renationalisation will save up to £150 million ($200 million) per year because it will no longer have to pay compensation fees to rail operators.The main rail operators in Scotland and Wales, where transport policy is handled by the devolved administrations in Edinburgh and Cardiff, are also state-owned.","South Western Railway is the first UK train operator to be returned to public ownership.

‘Shocked’ Zelensky Quietly Watches As NATO Nation Leader Beckons Russia With Praise





Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for tougher sanctions on Russia after Moscow launched its largest aerial assault since the start of the war, striking government buildings and residential areas across the country.In a series of posts on X, Zelenskyy said international condemnation must be matched by concrete steps. ""It is important that today we saw a broad response from our partners to this strike. Clearly, Russia is trying to inflict pain on Ukraine with even more brazen attacks. This is a clear sign that Putin is testing the world – whether they will accept or tolerate this,"" he said.“That is why statements by state leaders and institutions must be backed by strong actions – sanctions against Russia and individuals connected with Russia, tough tariffs and other restrictions on trade with Russia. Their losses must be felt. That is what is truly convincing,” further added Zelenskyy.Further accusing Putin of not wanting an end to the war, he added, ""Equally important – our long-range capabilities. Putin does not want negotiations, he is clearly hiding from them, so Russia’s fuel shortages and other economic troubles are the logical response to its refusal to agree to a ceasefire or a meeting at the leaders’ level.""Zelenskyy's remarks came after the overnight assault that led into Sunday, involved more than 800 drones and 13 missiles, including four ballistic, according to Ukrainian officials. For the first time, the Cabinet of Ministers building in Kyiv was directly hit, with a fire breaking out on its upper floors. Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko confirmed the damage, saying: “For the first time, the Government building, its roof, and upper floors were damaged by the enemy attacks. Rescuers are extinguishing the fire. I thank them for their work.”Air raid sirens rang out in Kyiv for 11 hours. An infant was among at least two people killed when residential buildings were struck, with dozens more injured. “In one of them, the floors between the 4th and 8th stories have collapsed. As of now, two people have been reported killed, including one child,” Zelenskyy said.Other regions were also hit. “More than 20 houses and a kindergarten were damaged in Zaporizhzhia. Warehouses were destroyed in Kryvyi Rih, one person was killed in Safonivka, Sumy region, and another one in the Chernihiv region. A residential high-rise was hit in Odesa. Many regions have been affected over the past day,” Zelenskyy added.He condemned the strikes as “vile,” calling them a “deliberate crime and a prolongation of the war.” He urged allies to deliver on previous commitments made in Paris and Washington to strengthen Ukraine’s air defences. “Every additional system saves civilians from these vile strikes,” he said.The Ukrainian President's call for sanctions followed US President Donald Trump , who said, that he was prepared to impose additional sanctions on Moscow. Asked if he was ready to move to a “second phase” of measures against Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump replied: “Yes, I am.”Trump also said European leaders would visit the White House on September 8 or 9, adding that he expects to speak “soon” with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of efforts to end the war in Ukraine.The attack, which surpassed a massive bombardment in July, comes amid renewed Western efforts to broker a peace deal. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned last week that any Western troops deployed in Ukraine would be considered “legitimate targets for defeat.” “The world can force the Kremlin criminals to stop the killings – all that is needed is political will,” Zelenskyy said.","Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for tougher sanctions on Russia.

'A little bit of lead': Donald Trump says Zohran Mamdani likely to be next mayor; denies meddling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-little-bit-of-lead-donald-trump-says-zohran-mamdani-likely-to-be-next-mayor-denies-meddling/articleshow/123709530.cms,"'Trump A Threat To New York': Zohran Mamdani Challenges U.S. President On Takeover By National Guard





US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that Democrat Zohran Mamdani is likely to become New York City's next mayor unless two of his three major rivals drop out. However, the Republican leader declined to name which candidates he thought should quit.Speaking at a White House dinner with tech executives, Trump denied urging anyone to exit the race but suggested the crowded field benefits Mamdani. ""I don't think you can win unless you have one-on-one, and somehow he's gotten a little bit of a lead,"" Trump said. ""I would like to see two people drop out and have it be one-on-one, and I think that's a race that could be won.""Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, became the presumptive frontrunner after defeating former governor Andrew Cuomo in June's Democratic primary. But both Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams remain on the ballot as independents, joined by Republican Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels.Behind the scenes, Trump allies have floated scenarios for narrowing the race. Intermediaries recently reached out to Adams' circle about the possibility of him dropping his campaign for a federal role, according to people familiar with the talks, AP reported. Adams, indicted last year on corruption charges before prosecutors dropped the case, has said he will not leave the race.""No pressure, no diamonds,"" Adams said Thursday.Cuomo has openly called for Adams to quit, arguing that Mamdani poses ""an existential threat"" to Democrats. Sliwa, meanwhile, rejected speculation that Adams' voters would automatically migrate to Cuomo and insisted he is staying in the race. ""I can assure you for the 9,852th time: I'm not dropping out. I'm in it until November 4,"" Sliwa said.Meanwhile, Mamdani threw down a challenge to Trump, daring him to face off in a televised debate. This came after Cuomo urged him to take part in five debates, one in each borough.""Let's cut out the middle man,"" Mamdani told The New York Post. ""Why should I debate Donald Trump's puppet when I could debate Donald Trump himself?""""If Donald Trump is serious about intervening in the mayoral race, he should come to New York City and debate me directly about why he's cutting SNAP benefits for hungry New Yorkers to give tax breaks to his wealthy donors,"" Mamdani told New York Post.","US President Donald Trump says Democrat Zohran Mamdani is likely to become New York City's next mayor unless two of his three major rivals drop out.

Trump Rebrands ‘Woke’ Pentagon, Announces ‘Department Of War’ | ‘Just Sounds Better…’





The White House on Thursday announced that US President Donald Trump is renaming the department of defence to ""department of war,"" fulfilling his long-standing wish of rebranding it to project a more powerful image.White House, in an official statement, said that Trump will sign an executive order permitting use of the ""department of war"" as a ""secondary title"" for the sprawling department, as Congress establishes its official title.According to Fox News, the move to formally restore the Pentagon's historic name, directing the department of Defence to be once again called the department of war is part of the administration's ""warrior ethos"" campaign.It will make ""department of war"" a secondary title for the agency, with defence secretary Pete Hegseth adopting the title ""secretary of war."" A White House fact sheet says the order also instructs Hegseth to propose legislative and executive steps to make the change permanent.The rebranding will extend beyond titles. A White House official said Pentagon websites and signage will be updated, including renaming the public affairs briefing room the ""Pentagon War Annex.""Longer-term changes are being planned.Trump has teased the shift in recent days, telling reporters on August 25, ""Everybody likes that we had an unbelievable history of victory when it was department of war. Then we changed it to department of defense.""Hegseth, who has already been introduced by Trump as ""secretary of war,"" echoed the president's reasoning, calling the new name symbolic of a cultural shift. ""We won WWI and WWII not with the department of defense, but with a war department,"" he said Wednesday on Fox & Friends. ""We're not just defence, we're offence. Words and names and titles matter.""The department of war served as the nation's primary military authority until 1949, when Congress renamed it the department of defence under the National Security Act of 1947 as part of sweeping postwar reforms.","US President Donald Trump is renaming the department of defence to ""department of war"" The move is part of the administration's ""warrior ethos"" campaign.

US president Donald Trump on Thursday hosted a dinner at the White House with America's top tech leaders. The meeting focused on artificial intelligence and investments in the United States.More than a dozen CEOs attended the event, including Bill Gates, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai. Trump, seated between first lady Melania Trump and Zuckerberg, asked each executive to share how much their companies were investing in America.One conspicuous absence was Elon Musk. The Tesla and SpaceX chief, once among Trump’s closest industry allies, has distanced himself in recent months following clashes over space policy and government contracts.Five Indian-origin executives — including Satya Nadella (Microsoft), Sundar Pichai (Google), Sanjay Mehrotra (Micron), Vivek Ranadive (TIBCO) and Shyam Sankar (Palantir) — were at the table. Their presence underscored the growing clout of Indian Americans in Silicon Valley and Washington, even as Trump moved to crack down on immigration.Trump brushed aside the significance of Friday’s jobs report, arguing that the “real economic numbers” will only be visible a year from now.He also downplayed current gains as being mostly construction-related and promised that the US would soon witness job growth “like our country has never seen before.”When asked if he planned to speak with Russian president Vladimir Putin, Trump confirmed, “I will be, yeah. We’re having a very good dialogue.” The remark came as Russia’s war in Ukraine drags on with no ceasefire in sight. Trump added that resolving the conflict had turned out to be “a bit tougher” than he initially expected, despite his claimed success in settling seven other wars.Sundar Pichai thanked Trump, telling him, “I’m glad it’s over” after a US judge threw out a landmark case that sought to break up Google’s Chrome browser. The ruling sparked a surge in Alphabet’s market value, which crossed $2.5 trillion this week. For Pichai, the dinner was a chance to reset ties with an administration that had frequently accused Google of bias.Bill Gates openly praised Trump’s Covid-19 vaccine initiative, calling it a model for rapid medical innovation. He said Microsoft was committed to helping the US government in disease research and listed ongoing projects on HIV, polio and sickle cell. Gates’ comments were made just hours after RFK Jr’s contentious hearing over vaccine policy.Trump said he did not watch health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr’s Senate testimony but heard he performed “very well.” Calling Kennedy a “very good person” who “means very well,” Trump noted he appreciates his different ideas, even if they are contentious. The hearing itself was marked by heated clashes over Kennedy’s sweeping health care and vaccine policy changes.","US president Donald Trump hosted a dinner at the White House with America's top tech leaders.

US president Donald Trump on Sunday snapped at a reporter after she pressed him on whether he was preparing to “go to war” with Chicago. The question came a day after Trump shared a meme warning that the city would soon learn about the newly renamed “Department of War. ”Trump, speaking to reporters before heading to New York for the US Open, dismissed the question with, “When you say that, darling, that’s fake news.”When she tried to continue, he cut her off sharply. “Be quiet, listen! You don’t listen! You never listen. That’s why you’re second-rate,” Trump told the NNC reporter. “We’re not going to war, we’re gonna clean up our cities. We’re gonna clean them up, so they don’t kill five people every weekend. That’s not war, that’s common sense.”Pressed on why Chicago was being singled out, Trump pointed to its recent homicide figures. “Do you know how many people were killed in Chicago last weekend? Eight. The week before? Seven. Do you know how many were wounded?

He has also floated sending the National Guard into Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans to tackle violent crime.

'Ready to immediately sit at the negotiating table': Hamas







US President Donald Trump on Sunday claimed that Israel has finally accepted his proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release framework and gave Hamas “last warning” to accept his terms for ending the Gaza war.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, ""Everyone wants the Hostages HOME. Everyone wants this War to end! The Israelis have accepted my Terms. It is time for Hamas to accept as well. I have warned Hamas about the consequences of not accepting. This is my last warning, there will not be another one! Thank you for your attention to this matter.""Although, Trump’s social media post did not detail the conditions, but Israel’s Channel 12 reported the plan envisions all hostages being freed on the first day of a truce, with broader talks to follow. In exchange, Israel would release Palestinian prisoners and halt its advance into Gaza City. Negotiations would take place under Trump’s direct oversight, with the ceasefire holding as long as talks continued, Times of Israel reported.Israel has not confirmed its acceptance, but a source close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the government is “very seriously considering” the proposal. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged Israel to back the deal, calling it a potential “breakthrough.”After the “last warning,” Hamas responded with a guarded statement, saying it “is ready to immediately sit at the negotiating table to discuss the release of all prisoners in exchange for a clear declaration to end the war, a total withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and creation of a committee of independent Palestinians to run the Gaza Strip.”“Hamas welcomes any move that helps the efforts to stop the aggression against our people,” Times of Israel quotes statement, affirming that it received “some ideas from the American side aimed at reaching a ceasefire.”Hamas says it is in “constant contact with the mediators to turn these ideas into a comprehensive agreement that meets our demands.”Opposition leader Yair Lapid accused Netanyahu’s government of stalling negotiations despite mediators’ efforts, warning, “There is a hostage deal on the table. It can be done, it must be done.”The reported framework comes as international pressure mounts against Israel’s Gaza City offensive, with critics warning it imperils both hostages and soldiers.The war, which began on October 7, 2023, has killed more than 64,000 people in Gaza, according to Hamas-run authorities, and over 460 Israeli soldiers.","US President Donald Trump claims Israel has finally accepted his proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release framework.

Teen coder made first millennial Catholic saint at youthful Vatican event,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/teen-coder-made-first-millennial-catholic-saint-at-youthful-vatican-event/articleshow/123752590.cms,"



VATICAN CITY: A teenager who died of leukaemia in 2006 became the first Catholic saint of the millennial generation on Sunday, in a Vatican ceremony led by Pope Leo and attended by an estimated 70,000 young worshippers from dozens of countries. Carlo Acutis, a British-born Italian boy who died aged 15, learned computer code to build websites to spread his faith. His story has drawn wide attention from Catholic youth, and he is now at the same level as Mother Teresa and Francis of Assisi.Leo, the first US pontiff, canonized Acutis on Sunday along with Pier Giorgio Frassati, a young Italian man who was known for helping those in need and died of polio in the 1920s.In impromptu remarks to crowds in St. Peter's Square at the opening of the event, Leo said Acutis and Frassati were examples of holiness, and of helping those in need. ""All of you, all of us together here, are called to be saints,"" the pontiff told the young crowd.""Carlo ... loved to say that heaven has always been waiting for us, and that to love tomorrow is to give the best of ourselves today,"" Leo said.The two new saints, said the pope, ""are an invitation to all of us, especially young people, not to waste our lives, but to direct them upwards (to heaven).""Acutis' canonization had been hotly anticipated by many Catholic youths for months. It was originally set for April but was postponed after the death of Pope Francis. Sunday's event was the first time that Leo, elected pope by the world's cardinals in May, presided over such a ceremony.Antonio D'Averio, 24, who was at the ceremony, called the canonization ""a hand extended by the Church toward us young people."" D'Averio said he was a computer programmer and identified with Acutis' story.Being made a saint means the Church believes a person lived a holy life and is now in heaven with God. Other saints who died young include Therese of Lisieux, who died at 24 in 1897 and was known for promoting a ""Little Way"" of charity; and Aloysius Gonzaga who died at 23 in 1591 after caring for victims of an epidemic in Rome.As Acutis progressed along the Church's official path to sainthood, his body was moved to a church in hill town of Assisi in central Italy, where St. Francis was from, in line with Acutis' last wishes. The new saint's final resting place has become a popular devotional site, attracting thousands of worshippers every day.

DUBAI: Undersea cable cuts in the Red Sea disrupted internet access in parts of Asia and West Asia, experts said on Sunday, though it wasn't immediately clear what caused the incident.There has been concern about the cables being targeted in a Red Sea campaign by Yemen's Houthi rebels, which the rebels describe as an effort to pressure Israel to end its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. But the Houthis have denied attacking the lines in the past.Undersea cables are one of the backbones of the internet, along with satellite connections and land-based cables. Typically, internet service providers have multiple access points and reroute traffic if one fails, though it can slow down access for users.Microsoft announced via a status website that West Asia ""may experience increased latency due to undersea fiber cuts in the Red Sea."" The Redmond, Washington-based firm did not immediately elaborate, though it said that internet traffic not moving through West Asia ""is not impacted.""NetBlocks, which monitors internet access, said ""a series of subsea cable outages in the Red Sea has degraded internet connectivity in multiple countries,"" which it said included India and Pakistan.It blamed ""failures affecting the SMW4 and IMEWE cable systems near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.""The South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 4 cable is run by Tata Communications.

In Kuwait, authorities also said the FALCON GCX cable running through the Red Sea had been cut, causing disruptions in the small, oil-rich nation. GCX did not respond to a request for comment.In the UAE, internet users on the country's state-owned Du and Etisalat networks complained of slower internet speeds. The govt did not acknowledge the disruption. Subsea cables can be cut by anchors dropped from ships, but can also be targeted in attacks.

Aleema Khan, sister of Pakistan 's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , was attacked with an egg while addressing reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday.A video of the episode has gone viral on social media, showing the egg hitting Aleema as she spoke to the media.Supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party quickly apprehended two women accused of throwing the eggs and handed them over to police, news agency PTI reported.Rawalpindi police said the arrested women were PTI party supporters who had travelled with members of the All-Government Employees Grand Alliance to protest against unmet demands.The statement added that the egg was thrown after Aleema did not respond to questions from the two women. Both were later taken into custody and moved to the Adiala checkpoint.PTI condemned the act as “shameful,” alleging the women were planted for political motives and accusing police of helping them escape in a car. “The women were sent to Aleema's media talk as part of an agenda,” the party said.Leaders across the political spectrum criticized the attack.Balochistan National Party-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal condemned the act, calling it “the lowest form of politics.”He said, “Even in enmity, a woman deserves dignity. Targeting women is the lowest form of politics, and this cheap stunt must be condemned in the strongest words.”Federal minister for development Ahsan Iqbal said, “Politics must remain a contest of ideas, not of violence or hatred. We should all work to keep it healthy and respectful.”Meanwhile, PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique described the incident as “shameful, vile and crude.”Imran Khan has been in prison for more than two years facing multiple charges. In January 2025, a Pakistani tribunal sentenced the former prime minister to 14 years in prison, while his wife, Bushra Bibi, received a seven-year sentence in connection with a corruption case involving land graft.The allegations centred on the acceptance of land from a property magnate in exchange for facilitating money laundering during Khan’s tenure as prime minister.Prior to this verdict, Khan had received three separate convictions related to corruption, disclosure of state secrets, and violations of marriage laws, carrying sentences of 10, 14 and seven years respectively.","Aleema Khan was attacked with an egg while addressing reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday.

A relatively unknown militant group, Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.The outfit claimed the attack, which involved a car rigged with IED, killed more than two dozen members of the Frontier Corps but Pakistan acknowledged only six fatalities. Predictably, it blamed India for the attack. Pakistan claimed to have neutralised five operatives in a 12-hour counter operation but the group asserted that its 'fidayeen' blew themselves up after carrying out the attack. One of the suicide bombers was identified by the group as Abdul Aziz alias Qassid Mohajir, a resident of Afghanistan's Paktika province.The Pakistan army camp suffered massive destruction in the suicide attack. Pakistan military's ISPR played down the incident, the latest in a series of attacks on Pakistani military personnel. ""During early hours of Sept 2, Indian proxy 'Fitna al Khwarij' targeted the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Bannu district. The Indian-sponsored Kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by vigilant and resolute response.In their desperation, the Kahrjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians,"" ISPR said.IuM Pakistan, active since April, comprises fighters from outfits like Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam and Jamaat-Ul-Ahrar. In the last few months, it has claimed multiple attacks in areas like North Waziristan, Miranshah and Tirah Valley. Its strikes included sniper, rocket launcher and grenade attacks, and ambushes on convoys, besides drone strikes. Its formation had attracted criticism from groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan which termed itself as the most structured and legitimate jihadi group in Pakistan.","Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.

BEIJING: Pakistan's army chief field marshal Asim Munir had his first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping , along with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif , on Tuesday during which the two sides held wide-ranging talks on bilateral and regional cooperation.Munir is part of Sharif's delegation, which participated in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin and will attend a grand parade of the Chinese army to be held here on Wednesday to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.During his first visit to China in July after taking over as field marshal, Munir met vice president Han Zheng but not President Xi, unlike his predecessor general Qamar Javed Bajwa.His visit followed after he was hosted for lunch by US President Donald Trump, a rare gesture by an American leader which raised eyebrows in China, considering Pak-China all-weather ties.While Xi met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a host of other leaders, who attended the SCO summit in Tianjin, Sharif was allocated the slot on Tuesday to meet the Chinese President in Beijing.Munir was expected to join Sharif to watch the parade in which the Chinese military plans to display its most modern weapons of all varieties, including aerial, ground, electronic and missile systems.The weapons systems were of big interest to the Pakistan military as over 80 per cent of its weapons acquisitions are from China.During the meeting, the two sides held wide-ranging talks on bilateral & regional cooperation, said deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, who was also part of the team.Xi said that as global changes unseen in a century are unfolding at a quicker pace, a strong China-Pakistan relationship is conducive to safeguarding regional peace and development.The two sides should accelerate building an even closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era, to bring more benefits to the two peoples and set up a model for the broader neighbourhood, he said.China stands ready to work with Pakistan to build upgraded versions of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement, and hopes Pakistan will take effective measures to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan, Xi was quoted as saying by the state-run Xinhua news agency.On his part, Sharif hailed the Global Governance Initiative (GGI), proposed by Xi at the SCO summit to improve global governance, saying it is of great significance for world peace, development and stability, and Pakistan will give it full support and work actively to implement it.Pakistan firmly sticks to the one-China principle, and looks forward to further strengthening friendship between the two countries and advancing cooperation in all fields, said Sharif, promising to spare no effort in ensuring the safety of all Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan.","Pakistan's army chief field marshal Asim Munir had his first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev has accused India of blocking Azerbaijan's bid for full membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).Aliyev said that the reported blockade from New Delhi came as a response to Azerbaijan’s support for Pakistan during the clashes between India and Pakistan in May.Emphasising brotherly ties between Azerbaijan and Pakistan, Aliyev ""noted that, in response to Azerbaijan’s support, India has attempted to retaliate against Azerbaijan in international organizations, but stressed that this holds no significance for Azerbaijan, as brotherly relations take precedence above all.""Earlier, local media reports claimed that New Delhi blocked Azerbaijan’s bid for full SCO membership.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar spoke by phone with his Armenian counterpart, Ararat Mirzoyan, earlier this week, during which the two agreed to explore the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations.Dar confirmed the conversation on his official X account. Pakistan had earlier suspended ties with Armenia following its occupation of Azerbaijani territories and consistently regarded Armenia as an aggressor, while also supporting UN Security Council resolutions affirming Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity.On the sidelines of the SCO meet, Aliyev also met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday came up with a bizarre solution to tackle floods in the country's northern parts by suggesting that people store the floodwater and take it to their homes.While talking to a local news channel, Asif said that excess water should be taken as a ""form of blessing.""""Now this water, someone should store it.

Five Pakistan army personnel, including two officers, died when a military helicopter went down in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir’s Gilgit-Baltistan region, in the early hours of Monday.According to a statement by the army, an MI-17 helicopter was on a routine training mission when it developed a technical fault and attempted to “crash-land”.

Op Sindoor: Report Reveals Pakistan Lost Rs 1240cr In 2 Months After Shutting Airspace For India

The Express Tribune





Pakistan’s flagship social safety programme, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), is once again under fire for corruption, with the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) uncovering large-scale graft involving its own employees. According to audit findings, as many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million, local media reported on Sunday.Citing the AGP’s revelations,said the rot runs through every level of the bureaucracy. What was envisioned as a lifeline for the country’s poorest has been consistently hollowed out by systemic fraud and abuse. And the Rs 37 million loss, auditors warn, may only scratch the surface.Just months earlier, audit reports for FY24 exposed irregularities worth Rs 141 billion in BISP, ranging from payments to ineligible beneficiaries to bogus biometric verifications and even funds being transferred to the accounts of deceased individuals.“In effect, those entrusted with administering aid to the poor are instead perpetuating poverty,” the report noted.The AGP findings also highlight the involvement of not just BISP employees but also banks and retailers, some of whom were caught illegally skimming fees from beneficiaries using BISP cards. Despite being identified, several perpetrators reportedly “escaped criminal charges despite being caught red-handed and named publicly,”reported.The culture of impunity, it added, remains entrenched. “Even if guilty officials are prosecuted and terminated, recent history has shown that the fear of consequences has not particularly slowed corruption in most government departments, and BISP is no different.”The report stressed that the system’s checks must be tightened: “Controls need to be more proactive, including transparent biometric systems, stricter verification processes and independent monitoring mechanisms.”With BISP catering to roughly 58 million people—nearly a quarter of Pakistan’s population—its credibility carries enormous weight. “Allowing it to become a corrupt and untrusted institution is not just a betrayal of honest and deserving beneficiaries, but of every single taxpayer and international donor supporting the programme,” the report warned.","As many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million.

Flood Threat For Pakistan As India Releases Water From Swollen Rivers Day After Alerting Islamabad





AMRITSAR: Embarrassed by a viral video showing its side of the parade path at Wagah border badly waterlogged - and its Rangers standing in knee-deep water - while the Indian side looks clean, Pakistan has blamed the elevation of Grand Trunk Road on the Indian side for the mess.The fact is India has already implemented a rainwater harvesting system and improved drainage management to prevent waterlogging.Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days. Its side of the parade area at the site of the daily flag ceremony at the Wagah joint checkpost is wallowing in muddy knee-deep water. Sandbags are seen piled up at a few places on the Pakistani side ahead of the ceremony. In contrast, the Indian side is free of water, except for a small area near the international border gates.Sources say Pakistan has raised the elevation of GT Road with Indian authorities. Pakistan also hastily constructed drainage channels and elevated a portion of the road to facilitate water outflow. BSF IG, Punjab Frontier, Atul Fulzele said there was incessant and heavy rainfall on Aug 8-9, and the video was likely from that period.""There has been no waterlogging at any of the three sites of the ceremonial flag-lowering ceremonies - Attari, Hussainiwala, and Sadqi. "" However, several border outposts (BoPs) along the Punjab Frontier were inundated due to heavy rainfall, and some had to be evacuated, he said.BoPs located in enclaves beyond the Ravi river and short of the international border are also being evacuated due to severe flooding.","Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days.

TOKYO: Japanese PM Shigeru Ishiba's resignation on Sunday will trigger a leadership race in his Liberal Democratic Party, with the winner facing a parliament vote to become prime minister. Since the ruling coalition has lost its majorities in both chambers of parliament, the LDP president is no longer guaranteed to become premier. There is a slim possibility an opposition party leader takes the top office. Here is a list of lawmakers who might throw their hats in the ring:If chosen, Takaichi would be Japan's first female prime minister. A party veteran who has held a variety of roles, including economic security and internal affairs minister, she lost to Ishiba in the LDP leadership race in a run-off vote last year. Known for conservative positions such as revising the pacifist postwar constitution, Takaichi is a regular visitor to the Yasukuni shrine to honour Japan's war dead. Takaichi has opposed Bank of Japan's interest rate hikes and backed public spending to boost economy.Heir to a political dynasty with a hand in governing Japan for more than a century, Koizumi would become its youngest PM in the modern era.Koizumi ran in the last year's party leadership race, presenting himself as a reformer. He has been with Ishiba as agriculture minister. In 2019, Koizumi called for Japan to get rid of nuclear reactors.Former PM Noda is the leader of the biggest opposition group Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan. As PM from 2011 to 2012, he worked with the LDP to push through law to double consumption tax to 10% to help curb debt. The tax was raised to 10% in 2019. In the upper house election in July, he reversed course and called for a cut to the consumption tax for food items.

Youth seethe at overnight social media ban in Nepal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/youth-seethe-at-overnight-social-media-ban-in-nepal/articleshow/123743038.cms,"



With access to 26 major platforms cut off overnight, thousands of young Nepalis across the country have called for a protest Monday against what they said was a “digitally repressive” move by the government in Kathmandu. Demonstrations are expected to begin at 9am, with organisers calling the blackout a “direct assault on speech, work and connectivity”.Many users, particularly in urban areas, scrambled for VPNs — virtual private networks that became lifelines to a world that had abruptly become inaccessible. By midday, Google Trends showed searches for “VPN for Nepal” had surged by more than 400% overnight. Proxy browsers, DNS tweaks and foreign eSIMs also became part of the workaround toolkit. Nepal Police’s cyberbureau issued warnings about using unverified VPNs, flagging the risks of malware, fraud, and phishing.Still, these tools remained out of reach for many — particularly older users, rural students and small businesses.Ayoung protest organiser, speaking on TikTok (the only popular platform that is still accessible), urged, “Gen Z is waking up — protests must bring our voice to the streets if social media silences us.”Organising committees across Kathmandu and Pokhara are now coordinating location details offline.The sweeping ban was enforced in the hours before dawn on Friday. One by one, familiar platforms flickered to darkness — not through technical failure, but by force of a govt order acting on a Supreme Court directive. Facebook stopped loading. WhatsApp messages hung on single ticks. YouTube videos would not play.The ban targeted companies that had failed to register with local authorities. “Unregistered social media platforms will be deactivated today (Friday) onwards,” said Gajendra Kumar Thakur, spokesperson, ministry of communication and information technology.Communications minister Prithvi Subba Gurung said platforms were given multiple opportunities to comply, and once they failed to do so, action followed.The blackout fractured routines across education, tourism, recruitment and commerce. Messaging failed. Online meetings stopped. Freelancers lost access to clients. Small businesses in Kathmandu were among the first to feel the pinch.Dipa Gurung, 28, who runs a jewellery business from home, said nearly all her trade occurred through Facebook and Instagram. “I never needed a shop. My livelihood lived in chats and comments. Now, I can’t even reply to regular customers,” she said.In Pokhara, guesthouse manager Rita Rai said most of her guest communication happened on WhatsApp. “A couple from Mumbai couldn’t find our place. They wandered for over an hour before someone helped them.”For students, especially in technical fields, platforms like YouTube and Reddit had long filled learning gaps left by outdated syllabi. Mina Shrestha, 21, a computer science student, said, “We used GitHub forums, subreddits, tutorials. Now even that is gone. We’re stuck with textbooks from another decade.”Recruitment firms sending workers to the Gulf and Southeast Asia were also hit. “With LinkedIn and Zoom gone, we’ve gone back to emails and international calls.,” said Manoj Raut, 52, who runs a manpower agency.The opposition called the blackout a political tool. “First they jail our president (Rabi Lamichhane). Then they block the platforms people use to talk about it. This is tyranny,” said Pratibha Rawal, 42, joint spokesperson for Rastriya Swatantra Party.","Thousands of young Nepalis across the country have called for a protest Monday against what they said was a ‘digitally repressive’ move by the government in Kathmandu.

Nepal’s living Goddess Kumari, draped in her traditional red attire and crowned, was carried through the heart of Kathmandu on Sunday, joined by Ganesh and Bhairav, as the city marked the start of the Indra Jatra festival. Their appearance signals the arrival of the festive season across the Himalayan nation.The three deities, each borne on separate chariots, were pulled through crowded lanes where thousands of devotees had gathered for hours, waiting for blessings and a rare glimpse. The spectacle, staged in Hanuman Dhoka Durbar Square, once the royal palace before the unification of Nepal and now a UNESCO World Heritage site, remains one of the few occasions when the living goddess and gods are seen in public.The square reverberated with the beat of drums and cries of joy as the chariots moved through the packed streets.“As a photographer, the procession itself drags me up to here. Then, after the chariot procession of (Living deities) Kumari, Ganesh and Bhairav, who make this special public appearance once a year, where people flock here to pay obeisance to them. It can also be regarded as Kathmandu's largest procession, signalling the arrival of Dashain, the major festival; these features have been driving me up to here every year,” said Basanta Gautam, a professional photographer, speaking to ANI.The festival, which runs for eight days beginning on Bhadra Shukla Chaturdashi of the Nepali month of Bhadra, sees the three deities paraded around the city in chariots. It begins with the raising of a sacred wooden pole, known as the Ya: Shi:, at Hanumandhoka in Basantapur Durbar Square. Traditional masked dances, folk dramas and processions including Nawadurga, Pulukisi, Lakhe and Dash Avatar fill the city with colour and excitement.Indra Jatra falls on the fourth day of the waxing moon in Bhadra, according to the lunar calendar. The festival is rooted in legend, said to mark the triumph of the gods over demons to free Jayanta, the son of Lord Indra.Stories tell of Lord Indra descending to earth in search of white flowers for his mother, only to be captured by Newars in the Kathmandu Valley. Once his mother revealed his divine identity, he was released and honoured with a procession – a tradition carried forward ever since. Indra, worshipped as the god of rain, remains at the heart of the celebrations, which are embraced by Newar communities following both Hindu and Buddhist traditions.While Kathmandu is the centre of the celebration, Kavre and Dolakha districts also mark the festival with enthusiasm. The week-long revelry concludes tonight with the lowering of the Indradhwoj pole, followed by dramatic dances such as Lakhe Naach, Mahakali Naach and Pulukisi Naach – a vibrant finale to one of the grandest events in the Newar calendar.","Kumari, Ganesh and Bhairav carried through the heart of Kathmandu on Sunday.

"After Afghanistan quake, many rescuers aided men but not women",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/after-afghanistan-quake-many-rescuers-aided-men-but-not-women/articleshow/123728957.cms,"



The first rescue workers reached Bibi Aysha’s village more than 36 hours after an earthquake devastated settlements across eastern Afghanistan’s mountainous areas Sunday. But instead of bringing relief, the sight of them heightened her fears; not a single woman was among them. Afghan cultural norms, enforced even in emergencies by the ruling Taliban, forbid physical contact between men and women who are not family members.In the village of Andarluckak, in Kunar province, the emergency team hurriedly carried out wounded men and children, and treated their wounds, said Aysha, 19. But she and other women and adolescent girls, some of them bleeding, were pushed aside.“They gathered us in one corner and forgot about us,” she said. No one offered them help, asked what they needed or even approached them.Tahzeebullah Muhazeb, a male volunteer who traveled to Mazar Dara, also in Kunar province, said members of the allmale medical team there were hesitant to pull women out from under the rubble. Trapped and injured women were left under stones, waiting for women from other villages to reach the site and dig them out.If no male relative was present, he said, rescue workers dragged dead women out by their clothes so as not to make skin contact.More than 2,200 people died and 3,600 others were injured in thequake, as per figures released by govt.The response to the quake has epitomised the dual standards women and girls face in Afghanistan, aid groups say, trapped both under the rubble and weight of gender discrimination. In Aysha’s village, not a single female aid worker had come as of Thursday, she said. She and her 3-year-old son had spent the past three nights out in the open. “God saved me and my son... But after that night, I understood — being a woman here means we are always the last to be seen. ”","More than 2,200 people died and 3,600 others were injured in thequake.

DHAKA: Former PM Khaleda Zia’s BNP said Friday senior members of banned Awami League “currently residing in Delhi” are conspiring to destabilise the country and derail the process for the Feb election.Bangladesh has alleged that besides former PM Sheikh Hasina, “many” Awami League members fled to India after a “mass uprising” led to her govt’s fall last year. “Some individuals in Bangladesh are collaborating with these politicians under Delhi’s influence to prevent the election from taking place under the interim govt,” senior BNP member Zainul Abedin Farroque said.Farroque also called on Bangladesh’s largest Islamist political party Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) to apologise to the nation for its past mistakes — an apparent reference to the genocide during the 1971 Liberation War — and accused it of using religious sentiments to seek support ahead of the election. Meanwhile, a mob attacked Jatiya Party’s office in Dhaka Friday.","Former PM Khaleda Zia’s BNP said Friday senior members of banned Awami League ‘currently residing in Delhi’ are conspiring to destabilise the country and derail the process for the Feb election.

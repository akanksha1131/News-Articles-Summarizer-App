Planning your year around UAE holidays





Local authorities may add extra holidays

Public holidays are not carried forward if they fall on weekends or overlap with another holiday

Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, so slight adjustments are possible





Residents of the UAE have much to look forward to in 2026, with several public holidays promising opportunities for long weekends and family time. From Eid celebrations to the National Day, a mix of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar holidays will shape the holiday calendar. Here is a detailed guide to all predicted public holidays, how they are determined, and tips to plan your time off.UAE public holidays are a combination of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar calendar dates. Gregorian holidays, such as New Year’s Day and National Day, occur on the same date each year. Islamic holidays, including Eid Al Fitr, Eid Al Adha, Islamic New Year, and Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday (PBUH), shift each year based on moon sightings.The UAE Public Holiday Law, established in April 2024 and implemented from January 2025, allows certain holidays to be shifted to the start or end of the week to create long weekends, except for Eid holidays. Cabinet Resolution No. 27 of 2024 also permits local governments to declare additional holidays for special occasions.Holidays that fall on weekends or coincide with another public holiday are not carried forward, but 2026 predictions indicate no overlap between Islamic holidays and Gregorian holidays.Residents in the UAE can expect at least 12 public holidays in 2026. While final dates depend on moon sightings and government announcements, current predictions give a clear picture of the likely schedule:Transferable holidays: Islamic holidays such as Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al Adha are not typically transferable. Other holidays, including the Islamic New Year, Prophet’s Birthday, and National Day, may sometimes be moved to create long weekends based on Cabinet resolutions.2026 promises several opportunities for extended breaks:Residents are advised to plan ahead, as Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, which may adjust official dates.Public and private schools in the UAE align their breaks with national holidays, though exact dates differ by curriculum and school authority:This schedule helps families coordinate holidays and make the most of predicted long weekends.Understanding the mix of fixed and lunar-based holidays allows UAE residents to strategically plan their annual leave. For example, taking just a few days off around Eid or National Day can significantly maximize time away from work. While the UAE government confirms official dates closer to each holiday, these early predictions serve as a reliable guide for 2026.Residents should note:With this guide, UAE residents can look forward to a year of well timed breaks, long weekends, and ample family and leisure time.","UAE public holidays are a combination of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar calendar dates.

UAE poised to make lunar history with Rashid Rover 2 mission to Moon’s far side,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-poised-to-make-lunar-history-with-rashid-rover-2-mission-to-moons-far-side/articleshow/125926325.cms,"The UAE’s Rashid Rover 2, launching in 2026, will explore the Moon’s far side/Image: X

Far side exploration



Learning from the first attempt



Arab space milestones



Looking ahead







The UAE is moving forward for its historic moment of space exploration. Rashid Rover 2, the country’s second lunar rover, has passed an important round of tests in the US. These checks mean it’s now one step closer to heading to the Moon’s far side in 2026, riding aboard Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost Mission 2 lander.Before leaving the UAE, Rashid Rover 2 went through thorough environmental and functional checks. In the US, engineers worked with Firefly Aerospace to see how it interacts with the lander. They tested the rover’s electrical systems, software, and mechanical parts. Wireless communication between the rover and lander was also checked. Finally, they ran deployment and drive off simulations to make sure the rover can safely move around once it reaches the Moon.Salem Al Marri, head of the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre, said all tests were successful and confirmed the rover is ready. Dr Hamad AlMarzooqi, project manager for the mission, highlighted that the work with Firefly is focused on precision and reliability, reflecting the UAE’s larger goals in space exploration.Rashid Rover 2 will explore the Moon’s far side, the part that never faces Earth. The terrain there is rough and the crust is thicker than on the near side.The rover is equipped with cameras and scientific tools to study the Moon’s surface temperature, soil, plasma environment, and photoelectron sheath.This data will help plan future lunar missions and could guide the use of lunar resources.The mission is also international. The rover will carry instruments from Australia, NASA, and the European Space Agency. Farah Zuberi from Firefly Aerospace said the successful testing brings the mission closer to deployment and will provide new insights into this mysterious region of the Moon.Rashid Rover 2 is the UAE’s second attempt at a lunar landing. The first, Rashid Rover 1, launched in December 2022, was lost in April 2023 when the Japanese lander it was riding, Hakuto R Mission 1, crashed. This second attempt builds on those lessons and aims to succeed where the first one failed.The UAE’s lunar mission is happening alongside another milestone. The first joint Arab satellite, 813, launched from China this week. The 260 kilogram satellite is for Earth observation and was developed by engineers from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain, Sudan, Kuwait, Oman, and Lebanon.The satellite’s name refers to 813 AD, when Baghdad’s House of Wisdom became a public academy. Salem Al Qubaisi, director general of the UAE Space Agency, said the project helps build research capabilities, train Arab talent in space science, and provide climate data for countries in the region.Rashid Rover 2 is scheduled to launch in early 2026 for a 10 day mission on the Moon’s far side. If all goes well, the UAE will become only the second nation to land there successfully. The rover’s work will provide valuable data for future missions and underline the UAE’s growing role in global space research.","Rashid Rover 2 is the UAE’s second attempt at a lunar landing.

Trump FREEZES Green Card, Citizenship Applications From THESE High-Risk Countries After DC Shooting

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled what he called the ""Trump Gold Card,"" announcing that people will be able to apply for Gold Card citizenship starting Wednesday afternoon.In a post on Truth Social, Trump promoted the new immigration pathway, saying, ""THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT’S TRUMP GOLD CARD IS HERE TODAY! A direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent. Live Site opens in 30 minutes!""Speaking further about the initiative, Trump said, ""Very excitingly for me and for the country, we've just launched the Trump Gold Card. The site goes up in about 30 minutes, and all funds go to the United States government... It's somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card. Companies will be able to go to any school, buy a card, and keep that person in the United States... It's a gift to get somebody great coming into our country, because we think there will be some tremendous people who otherwise wouldn't have been allowed to stay.They graduate from college, they have to go back to India or China or France... The companies will be very happy. I know Apple is going to be happy. Nobody talked to me more about it than Tim Cook. He said it's a real problem. And it's not going to be a problem anymore... The other thing is it'll take in, we think, probably billions of dollars that will go to the Treasury of the United States... Many billions of dollars, even.""Trump has previously spoken about a Gold Card–style visa program designed to attract wealthy or highly skilled foreign nationals. The broader objective has been to bring top talent and significant foreign investment into the United States by offering a faster pathway to residency.While full details of the newly announced Gold Card are still unclear, earlier proposals included substantial financial thresholds: individual applicants were expected to donate $1 million to the US Treasury, and corporate-sponsored applicants needed to contribute $2 million, in addition to a non-refundable $15,000 processing fee.A third tier, the Platinum Card, had also been proposed, allowing an individual to spend up to 270 days a year in the US without becoming subject to US tax on foreign income, in exchange for $5 million. It remains unclear whether this tier is part of the current rollout.The website clarifies that simply having the money does not guarantee entry into the US, a point that had been less explicit in earlier announcements. Applicants must still qualify for permanent residency, be legally admissible, and have an available visa slot.Under US immigration rules, Gold Card holders will effectively fall under the EB-1 or EB-2 categories. These visas are typically meant for individuals with “extraordinary ability,” including top researchers, distinguished professors, accomplished artists and leading business figures, and they provide a route to permanent residency and eventual citizenship.","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled what he called the ""Trump Gold Card"" Trump has previously spoken about a Gold Card–style visa program designed to attract wealthy or highly skilled foreign nationals.

China, Russia SLAM Trump After U.S. Military 'HIJACKS' Oil Vessel Off Venezuela





COPENHAGEN: The US is using its economic power to “assert its will” and threaten military force against friend and foe alike, a Danish intelligence agency said in a new report. The Danish Defense Intelligence Service said Washington’s greater assertiveness under the Trump administration also comes as China and Russia seek to diminish Western, especially US’, influence.Perhaps most sensitive to Denmark — a Nato and EU member, and a US ally — is growing competition between those great powers in the Arctic. “The strategic importance of the Arctic is rising as the conflict between Russia and the West intensifies, and the growing security and strategic focus on the Arctic by the US will further accelerate these developments,” said the report, published Wednesday.The report echoes a string of recent concerns about an increasingly go-it-alone approach by the US, which under Trump’s second term has favoured bilateral deals and partnerships at the expense of multilateral alliances like Nato. “For many countries outside the West, it has become a viable option to forge strategic agreements with China rather than the US,” read the report. “At the same time, uncertainty has grown over how the US will prioritise its resources in the future,” it added.“The US is leveraging economic power to assert its will, and the possibility of employing military force – even against allies – is no longer ruled out,” the report said.","The US is using its economic power to ‘assert its will’ and threaten military force against friend and foe alike.

Trump’s Massive Visa Crackdown: 85,000 Cancellations and Social-Media Scrutiny Hit Indians

Impact on schools, hospitals and public services

Trump tightens grip on H-1B visas with higher fees, deeper vetting

White House defends move amid wider backlash





A coalition of 20 US states, led by California, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over a new $100,000 fee imposed on H-1B visas, arguing that the move is unlawful and threatens access to essential public services such as healthcare and education.The legal challenge, announced by California Attorney General Rob Bonta, targets a policy introduced by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) following a presidential proclamation issued in September. The fee applies to all new H-1B visa petitions filed after September 21, and represents an unprecedented increase from the existing charges, which typically range from under $1,000 to around $7,500.In the lawsuit, the attorneys general argue that the Trump administration has exceeded its authority by imposing a fee far beyond what Congress has authorised. They say the policy violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by bypassing mandatory notice-and-comment rulemaking and by setting a charge unrelated to the actual cost of processing visa applications.Bonta said the measure runs counter to the purpose of the H-1B programme, which allows US employers to hire highly skilled foreign workers in “specialty occupations” requiring at least a bachelor’s degree.These include doctors, nurses, researchers, teachers and engineers.“California knows that when skilled talent from around the world joins our workforce, it drives our state forward,” Bonta said, warning that the fee would place “illegal financial burdens” on public employers and worsen existing labour shortages.The coalition, which includes states such as New York, Illinois, Washington and Massachusetts, is seeking to block the policy and have it declared unconstitutional.The states argue that the fee will hit public sector and non-profit employers hardest, particularly schools, universities and hospitals, many of which are exempt from the annual H-1B cap of 65,000 visas. These institutions, they say, cannot absorb an additional $100,000 cost per hire without cutting services or diverting funds from other programmes.The lawsuit highlights the scale of existing shortages. During the 2024–25 school year, nearly three-quarters of US school districts reported difficulties filling teaching posts, especially in special education, science and bilingual education. Educators are among the largest occupational groups using H-1B visas, with tens of thousands employed across the country.Healthcare is another major concern. In the 2024 fiscal year, almost 17,000 H-1B visas were issued for medical and health occupations, including physicians and surgeons. The US is projected to face a shortfall of up to 86,000 doctors by 2036, a gap that is already acute in rural and low-income areas, including parts of California.The Trump administration has sharpened its focus on the H-1B visa programme as part of a broader immigration crackdown, signalling tougher scrutiny, higher costs and expanded data collection. A new proposal seeks five years of social media history from all visitors to the US, including those from visa-waiver countries such as the UK, Japan and Australia. While not yet final, the measure reflects a wider push towards deeper vetting that goes well beyond tourists and directly affects skilled migrants.For H-1B applicants, social media vetting is already mandatory from December 15, alongside stricter compliance checks.The impact is magnified by structural bottlenecks. The H-1B cap remains frozen at 85,000 visas despite soaring demand, while Indians account for over 70% of approvals. Even those who secure visas face decades-long green card backlogs due to per-country limits.The Trump administration has defended the fee as part of a broader effort to reform the H-1B system and prioritise American workers. A White House spokesperson said the policy would discourage abuse of the programme and protect domestic wages, insisting the action was lawful.Critics, however, say the measure risks damaging the US economy and international relationships. Lawmakers have warned that the fee disproportionately affects Indian professionals, who hold an estimated 70 per cent of H-1B visas, and could strain US–India ties while driving skilled workers towards countries with more welcoming immigration systems.","A coalition of 20 US states, led by California, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over a new $100,000 fee imposed on H-1B visas.

Thailand-Cambodia ‘War’: Trump Ally’s Neighbour Fires Back After Airstrikes | ‘Cease Hostilities Or…’





Cambodia on Saturday accused Thailand of continuing air strikes on its territory, hours after US President Donald Trump said the two neighbours had agreed to halt hostilities.""On December 13, 2025, the Thai military used two F-16 fighter jets to drop seven bombs” on multiple targets, the Cambodian defence ministry said through a post on X. ""Thai military aircraft have not stopped bombing yet. ""The development followed a statement by US President Donald Trump on Friday that Thailand and Cambodia had agreed to cease hostilities along their disputed border, clashes that have left at least 20 people dead this week.""I had a very good conversation this morning with the Prime Minister of Thailand, Anutin Charnvirakul, and the Prime Minister of Cambodia, Hun Manet, concerning the very unfortunate reawakening of their long-running War,"" Trump said through a post on Truth Social.Trump said both sides had agreed to immediately halt all fighting and revert to the July peace agreement brokered with his involvement and the support of Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.""Both Countries are ready for PEACE and continued Trade with the United States of America,"" Trump added.The United States, China and Malaysia, acting in its role as chair of the regional bloc Asean, brokered a ceasefire in July following an initial five-day outbreak of violence.Since Monday, Cambodia and Thailand have exchanged rocket and artillery fire at several points along their disputed 817-km (508-mile) border, marking some of the heaviest fighting since a five-day clash in July that was halted after US President Donald Trump called on both leaders to end the violence.The renewed unrest has killed at least 20 people and injured more than 260, according to figures from both countries, with each side accusing the other of reigniting the conflict. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been displaced on both sides of the border.Trump’s remarks contrasted with comments made hours earlier by Thai Prime Minister Anutin, who said the call “went well” but did not mention any agreement between the Southeast Asian neighbours to halt the fighting. Anutin said he had asked Trump to press Cambodia to cease hostilities, withdraw its troops and clear landmines.""I explained to President Trump that we are not the aggressor against Cambodia but we are retaliating,"" Anutin was quoted as saying by Reuters.""He wants a ceasefire. I told him to tell our friends - don't just say a ceasefire but they must tell the world that Cambodia will cease fire, withdraw its troops, remove all landmines it has planted. They must show us first.""Trump, who has repeatedly said he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, portrayed himself on Thursday as a global peacemaker, saying he had “solved eight wars” and was confident he would get the truce “back on track.”","Cambodia accuses Thailand of continuing air strikes on its territory.

Temporary flight restrictions in Skagit County





An atmospheric river dumped heavy rain across western Washington this week, causing major river flooding and prompting evacuations throughout the region.Most rivers hit peak levels on Thursday, but many areas continued to grapple with flooding, and lingering road closures and other weather impacts remained a possibility. A Flash Flood Watch was in effect as the Skagit River was expected to crest on Friday morning, December 12, Fox News reported.At a press conference on Thursday at the Segale Levee in Tukwila, Governor Bob Ferguson said that responding to the historic flooding would likely delay the rollout of the state budget. “The original plan was to release the budget this next week; you know, we’re not sure we’ll met that, given the events of the past few days,” Ferguson said. “The good news is, most of the work had been completed before this crisis arrived, but there are still some decisions that need to be made […] I don’t want to say exactly when that will be […] but we’ll meet our deadline. ”Ferguson was joined by King County Executive Girmay Zahilay and US senator Maria Cantwell. He announced that the Trump administration had approved the disaster declaration, freeing up federal funds for recovery efforts in the coming weeks.The governor continued to urge people to follow emergency orders from authorities.Cantwell thanked first responders and local leaders. “[It’s] supposed to be a 100-year event, but it hasn’t been 100 years since the last time we had this,” she said. “So the issue is that, places like Sumas — which is a border crossing — to be flooded out, and a border crossing closed. To have Highway 2, which is anywhere from $7–$10 million a year of economic impact be closed […] the good news is that federal support is on the way. ”Elsewhere, US-12 was closed near the Porter West city limits after a landslide uprooted trees and blocked the road.In Burlington, the mayor partially lifted an evacuation order for anyone whose home or business was located west of the north-south running railroad tracks.Sedro-Woolley imposed a Temporary Flight Restriction over Skagit County and asked residents not to fly personal drones in affected areas.

US-seized tanker carrying Venezuelan crude sails toward Houston: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-seized-tanker-carrying-venezuelan-crude-sails-toward-houston-report/articleshow/125942631.cms,"



The oil supertanker Skipper, seized by the US near Venezuela this week as part of an increased pressure strategy against President Nicolas Maduro, is heading to Houston, Reuters reported, citing two sources.The Very Large Crude Carrier is carrying about 1.85 million barrels of Venezuela’s Merey heavy crude, according to satellite images analysed by TankerTrackers.com.It is too large to transit through the Houston ship channel and will need to anchor nearby and offload the cargo to smaller ships, the port said.“At this time, we have not received any notifications or agent filings indicating that the M/V SKIPPER is scheduled to call the Port of Houston,” the Greater Houston Port Bureau’s President Eric Carrero said.Meanwhile, Supertankers, the largest class of vessels used to move crude, loaded at the Venezuelan govt-controlled port of Jose this month, up to Friday, according to preliminary data from shipping reports and vessel movements tracked by Bloomberg.They carried almost 880,000 barrels a day of crude oil, up from an average of 586,000 barrels a day in November. The activity at Jose comes two days after the US seized a tanker transporting Venezuelan crude, despite the prospect that the Trump administration may snatch more ships.The seizure formed part of a pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, aiming to deny him oil revenue and force him to relinquish power. The test now is whether those ships will be willing to leave Venezuelan waters and risk seizure. At the same time, the US renewed Chevron Corp.’s licence to continue pumping oil in Venezuela, according to sources familiar with the matter. That renewal further underscores the bind the US is putting Maduro in.US Attorney General Pam Bondi said this week the tanker was intercepted and retained under a seizure warrant. Guyana’s maritime authority said it was falsely flying the country’s flag.The seizure of the sanctioned oil tanker has sharply escalated tensions between Washington and Caracas. Washington is preparing to intercept more ships transporting Venezuelan oil, sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.","The Very Large Crude Carrier is carrying about 1.85 million barrels of Venezuela’s Merey heavy crude, according to satellite images.

The rumors around Representative Ilhan Omar's marriage to her brother on another level, as a top Senator suggested that if the allegations are true, then she could be imprisoned, fined, and even face deportation.Senator Ted Cruz said that if allegations against Representative Ilhan Omar that she married her brother to enter the US were true, she would have violated several federal and state laws. He made the remarks on Friday after President Donald Trump revived the claims during a rally in Pennsylvania earlier this week.Cruz posted on X in response to a White House social media account that charged, ""Yes, [Omar] married her brother,"" and listed three statutes Omar might have breached. ""If this is true, then Omar faces criminal liability under three different statutes,"" he said.He argued that Omar could have committed federal marriage fraud, a felony carrying up to five years in prison, a $250,000 fine and deportation for knowingly entering into a marriage to evade immigration laws.Cruz also noted that she could be breaking Minnesota’s incest law, a state felony punishable by up to ten years in jail, and could face tax fraud charges if joint tax returns were filed while she was not legally married, with penalties of up to a $100,000 fine and three years in prison."" If a couple filed joint federal tax returns while not legally married (due to the marriage being void or still being married to another person), they could be charged with willfully making and subscribing to a false return. ◦Penalties: This is a felony punishable by a fine of up to $100,000 (or $500,000 for a corporation), imprisonment for up to three years, or both,"" Cruz said in a post on X.Omar was born in Somalia and arrived in the US in 1995 after her family was granted asylum. She became a citizen in 2000. She has been married legally three times: first in a religious marriage to Ahmed Abdisalan Hirsi in 2002, then to Ahmed Nur Said Elmi in 2009 before divorcing and legally marrying Hirsi again, and in 2020 she married political aide Tim Mynett, Fox News reported.Trump had earlier in the week repeated the long-standing but unsubstantiated claims that Omar married her brother to gain entry to the US. Omar has denied the allegations. At the rally he said, ""She married her brother to get in, right?"" He added, ""If I married my sister to get my citizenship, do you think I'd last for about two hours or something less than that? She married her brother to get in. Therefore, she's here illegally. She should get the hell out.""","Senator Ted Cruz said that if allegations against Representative Ilhan Omar that she married her brother to enter the US were true, she would have violated several federal and state laws.

The Department of Homeland Security announced it is ending all categorical family reunification parole (FRP) programs for aliens from 7 countries, including Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, and Honduras, along with their immediate family members.“This administration is ending the abuse of humanitarian parole which allowed poorly vetted aliens to circumvent the traditional parole process,” DHS said in a statement.The department added that 'America First' is priority: “Parole was never intended to be used in this way, and DHS is returning parole to a case-by-case basis as intended by Congress. Ending the FRP programs is a necessary return to common-sense policies and a return to America First.”DHS said that family reunification is important, but it does not outweigh the government’s duty to prevent fraud and uphold national security and public safety. The DHS cited security gaps in the FRP programs, which were caused by insufficient vetting, allowing malicious actors to exploit them and harm native Americans.A Federal Register notice guides how the termination will be implemented.Aliens currently paroled under the FRP programs whose parole has not yet expired as of January 14, 2026, will see it end on that date, unless they have a pending Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, postmarked or electronically filed on or before December 15 2025, and still pending on January 14, 2026.

US Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer doubled down on a major crackdown on H-1B visa abuses, warning that “American jobs must go to Americans first.”In a post and accompanying video on X, Chavez-DeRemer discussed the Project Firewall, a Department of Labor initiative launched in September 2025, aimed at preventing wage suppression and prioritizing domestic workers or Amercican workforce. The programme currently has nearly 200 ongoing investigations into suspected H-1B violations.“Under President Trump's leadership, we've launched Project Firewall to ensure that the H-1B program is used as intended—for genuine skill shortages, not to undercut American wages or displace US workers,” she said.She said that foreign workers get paid below market wages and surpass Americans: “Too often, we've seen companies exploit this program by paying foreign workers below-market wages, bypassing qualified Americans, or even forcing U.S. employees to train their own replacements. That's unacceptable, and it stops now.""Chavez-DeRemer said she personally certifies each investigation under Project Firewall and that the Department of Labor is collaborating with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to enhance enforcement. She warned that companies found violating the rules could face fines, visa bans, and other penalties.“To employers doing it right: we appreciate you. Keep recruiting fairly, pay prevailing wages, and invest in our domestic workforce,” she said. “To American workers: your voice matters. If you've experienced displacement or unfair treatment because of H-1B misuse, report it to us.

Pakistan’s Asim Munir Threatens India With 'Severe Response' In First Speech After Becoming CDF





In a first since partition, a course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan, The Tribune reported. The Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) has introduced the course, with Hindu mythologies like Mahabharat and Gita on the cards too.“People ask me why I’m learning Sanskrit. I tell them, why should we not learn it? It is the binding language of the entire region. Sanskrit grammarian Panini’s village was in this region. Much writing was done here during the Indus Valley Civilisation. Sanskrit is like a mountain--a cultural monument. We need to own it. It is ours too; it’s not tied to any one particular religion,” The Tribune quoted associate professor, Shahid Rasheed, who is at the heart of the initiative saying.“A significant collection of Sanskrit palm-leaf manuscripts were catalogued in the 1930s by scholar JCR Woolner, but no Pakistani academic has engaged with this collection since 1947. Only foreign researchers use it. Training scholars locally will change that,” the news outlet quoted the director of the Gurmani Centre, Ali Usman Qasmi, saying.“In 10-15 years, we could see Pakistan-based scholars of the Gita and the Mahabharata,” Qasmi added.The Sanskrit course began as a three-month weekend workshop only to eventually become a four-credit university course after it received an overwhelming response.“After we saw the response, we decided to introduce it as a proper university course. Even though the number of students is still small, we hope it will grow over the next few years. Ideally, by spring 2027, we should be able to teach the language as a year-long course,” the director said.","A course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan.

Mistook bomb for toy: Blast at Pakistan school in Waziristan; two children killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/mistook-bomb-for-toy-blast-at-pakistan-school-in-waziristan-two-children-killed/articleshow/125926997.cms,"



Two children have been killed and more than a dozen others injured in a blast at a seminary in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in an incident that has deepened anxiety in a region already struggling with insecurity.Police said the explosion occurred in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali area at about 2pm after students brought a mortar shell into Madressah Shams-ul-Quran, having mistaken it for a toy they found outside, Dawn reported.The device detonated while the children were playing with it, killing two instantly and injuring 16 others. Several of the wounded were later transferred to hospitals in Bannu and nearby districts.Local officials said security forces had earlier warned residents that an unexploded mortar had landed in the area and urged civilians to avoid it. However, the warning did not reach everyone, and the children unknowingly carried the device into the seminary, as per Dawn.The incident came amid growing concern about public safety in North Waziristan, which on the same day saw a separate overnight attack that destroyed a government primary school in Mir Ali. Officials said explosives were planted at the building in Ayaz Kot, leaving more than 600 children without a place to study.Much of the structure was reduced to rubble, prompting authorities to seal the site and begin planning temporary arrangements for classes.Parents and elders condemned the destruction as a deliberate assault on the community’s future. One elder said the school had been “the heart of our community”, describing its loss as an attack on children’s hopes, Express Tribune reported.Security forces have launched a search operation, though no group has claimed responsibility. District officials called the bombing an “anti-education act” and promised those responsible would be brought to justice. Initial assessments suggest the explosives were detonated remotely or with a timer.","Two children killed and more than a dozen others injured in blast at a seminary in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Pakistan Army Spokesperson Faces Backlash for Winking at Reporter in Viral Video





It started with a simple question —— and ended in full-blown comedy inside Pakistan’s National Assembly.During Monday’s session of the National Assembly in Islamabad, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq found ten PKR 5,000 notes on the chamber floor and called for the owner to identify them.“Whose money is this? Whoever it belongs to, please raise your hand,” the Speaker asked, waving the bundle of notes in the air.Within seconds, 12–13 MPs raised their hands to claim the money.

Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan: Homegrown challenge

Balochistan: The longstanding insurgency

Multi-dimensional security puzzle

Cross-influences and borrowed tactics There is evidence of ideological and tactical cross-pollination between the Afghan Taliban and the TTP, particularly in sanctuary arrangements and recruitment pathways. Conversely, the Baloch insurgency, while largely ethnonationalist, has occasionally sought indirect or tactical alliances with other groups to magnify its impact or leverage state failure.

Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies face the daunting task of differentiating between groups that sometimes share fluid alliances or conflicting rivalries. Heavy-handed military operations risk alienating local populations and driving recruitment, while political engagement with some groups risks being seen as appeasement. International implications India, Iran, and even China watch these internal Trojan horses with varying stakes. India’s support to Baloch separatists, Iran’s concerns about Baloch unrest along its border, and China’s economic interests in Balochistan add layers of strategic complexity.

Conventional approaches falter

Military campaigns may suppress one group temporarily but provide recruits and sympathy to another.

Political negotiations get undermined when factions splinter or external events shift local calculations—such as the Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan.

Economic development efforts in Balochistan are hampered by ongoing violence but are critical to addressing root causes.

Cross-border sanctuaries and international gray zones complicate decisive action.

Multi-pronged strategy

Enhanced Border Security and Regional Diplomacy Strengthening border management with Afghanistan and Iran, paired with robust diplomatic engagement, can limit militant sanctuaries and cross-border flows.

Balochistan ground sweeps





The challenges Pakistan faces today are often described in binary terms — a threat here, a conflict there — but the reality is far more chaotic and intricate, much like the scientific conundrum known as the ""three-body problem"". This problem, rooted in physics and celestial mechanics, deals with predicting the motions of three gravitational bodies interacting with each other. The paradox is that while two bodies' orbits can be predicted with relative simplicity, introducing a third body creates a system so unstable and non-linear that exact forecasts become practically impossible. Pakistan's existential security dilemmas resemble this dynamic complexity: three powerful, interrelated forces that simultaneously influence and destabilize the country’s internal and external equilibrium.These three forces are the Taliban , the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ), and the Baloch insurgency.Individually, each represents a serious security threat. Collectively, their interactions generate overlapping, tangled challenges that confound policy, military strategy, and diplomatic efforts.Recent escalations are a stark reminder of this peril. In October 2025, Pakistan launched airstrikes in Kabul and other Afghan sites targeting TTP leader Noor Wali Mehsud, prompting Taliban retaliation on Pakistani border posts and further Pakistani precision strikes killing dozens of militants.Meanwhile, Baloch attacks surged 53% in 2024 to 938 incidents with over 1,002 fatalities, spilling into 2025 with high-profile hits on CPEC projects.Over 300 attacks rocked Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2025 alone, mostly TTP-led.For the first time since 2015, the number of terror attacks in Pakistan crossed the 900-mark.Grasping their interplay is crucial to understanding why Pakistan’s security apparatus struggles to restore stability — and why conventional approaches have so far failed.The Taliban, an Islamist militant group born in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, rose to international prominence with its capture of Kabul in 1996.Following the US invasion after 9/11, the group was ousted but persisted with insurgency tactics. The Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in 2021 reshaped regional dynamics and profoundly impacted Pakistan.For Pakistan, the Taliban's ascendance is something of a double-edged sword. On one hand, Islamabad sees the group as a strategic asset to exert influence in Kabul and counter Indian presence in Afghanistan. On the other hand, the Taliban's ideological affinity with Pakistan's own Pashtun tribal regions and cross-border networks complicates Islamabad's control over militancy within its own borders.The Taliban's ideology and governance style also inspire elements within Pakistan, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt. This ideological inspiration runs parallel to fears that the group's Afghan governance failures or hardline policies could spill over, destabilising Pakistan’s own tribal regions.The Afghan Taliban's 2021 takeover initially promised Pakistan leverage against India, but it backfired spectacularly. Kabul's refusal to dismantle TTP sanctuaries hosting 6,000-6,500 fighters armed with leftover NATO weapons has fueled Islamabad's woes. Tensions peaked in December 2025 with heavy cross-border fire exchanges killing five Afghans, amid soured ties since 2021.Experts like Tahir Khan note the Taliban's inaction strains relations, pushing Pakistan to airstrikes that risk radicalising more TTP factions toward rivals like ISKP. Failed Istanbul peace talks in October 2025 saw Pakistan threaten to ""obliterate"" the Taliban regime after unmet demands on TTP expulsion. Sirajuddin Haqqani dismissed TTP as Pakistan's ""internal matter,"" vowing forceful responses to violations.This dynamic grants TTP ""strategic depth"" unparalleled in its history, enabling mergers and centralisation under Mehsud. As analyst Hazrat Ali warns, Pakistani pressure on Kabul could splinter TTP, worsening regional chaos.Pakistan’s newly appointed armed forces chief Gen. Asim Munir recently called on Afghanistan’s Taliban government to choose between maintaining ties with Islamabad or supporting the Pakistani Taliban.Munir said that a “clear message” had been delivered to the Taliban government in Kabul: it must decide between Pakistan and “Fitna al-Khawarij,” a term authorities use for the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, known a s Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan.While the Afghan Taliban exerts influence across the border, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan represents a homegrown, highly violent insurgency directly challenging the Pakistani state’s writ. Originating as an umbrella militant organisation around 2007, the TTP embodies a coalition of various Islamist militants and tribal groups united against Islamabad's military operations.The TTP has been responsible for some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Pakistan over the past decade, targeting military installations, government buildings, schools, and civilian populations. Despite several attempted peace negotiations, the TTP's fractured yet resilient network has shown a capacity to regroup, regrouping largely within the tribal regions of northwestern Pakistan and even spilling across the Afghan border during periods of instability.The group opposes Pakistan’s state institutions vehemently and views the military, intelligence agencies, and secular political frameworks as existential enemies. Unlike the Afghan Taliban, which now nominally controls Kabul, the TTP pursues a more violent, confrontational agenda rooted in the Pakistani context.The TTP roared back post-Taliban victory. In 2024, it drove over half of 900+ attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 560+, with 67% targeting security forces. By 2025, its operations hit 600+ confrontations, surpassing all of 2024.A stark October 8, 2025, ambush in Kurram killed 11 Pakistani soldiers, including two officers, via roadside bombs and heavy weapons—exposing border vulnerabilities.TTP now eyes tribal belt control, mirroring Afghan Taliban's path, per CTC West Point analysis. Mehsud's unification of splinters has boosted recruitment, with propaganda invoking Baloch grievances to broaden appeal.Security data shows 96% of attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, blending armed assaults and IEDs, as TTP demands military divestment from businesses. This resurgence, analysts say, stems from Afghan havens, turning Pakistan's past militant proxies into monsters.Simultaneously, Pakistan faces an insurgency in Balochistan—a sprawling, resource-rich, but underdeveloped southwestern province. The Baloch nationalist movement goes back decades, demanding greater autonomy, resource control, and sometimes outright independence. The insurgency has fluctuated in intensity but remains a persistent thorn in Islamabad’s side.Baloch militants have targeted Pakistani security forces, infrastructure projects, and economic installations such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)—a flagship regional development initiative. The province's rugged terrain and Baloch tribal dynamics create a challenging environment for Pakistani counterinsurgency efforts.Unlike the religious militancy of the Taliban and TTP, the Baloch insurgency is rooted in ethnic nationalism and grievances over political marginalization, economic neglect, and human rights abuses. This ideological and geographical distinctiveness makes it harder for the Pakistani state to craft a unified internal security strategy.Attacks ballooned to 327 sites across 25 districts in 2024, with 80% fatality spike to 1,002+. The March 11, 2025, Jaffar Express hijacking by BLA-Jeeyand killed 26 hostages and kidnapped 400+, showcasing tactical evolution from hit-and-runs to coordinated ops.CPEC remains prime target: Operation Dara-e-Bolan in January 2024 and March 2025 barrages hit Chinese workers, amid Israel-Iran and India-Pakistan tensions stoking fears of wider nexuses. BLA's sophistication targets BRI, militarizing the region further.Unlike TTP's jihadism, Baloch fights for autonomy, but heavy state crackdowns alienate locals, per CTC analysis. Injuries rose to 689, property losses to 546, signaling expanded reach despite counter-ops killing 76 insurgents.Here lies Pakistan’s three-body problem: the Taliban, TTP, and Baloch insurgency don’t operate in isolation.Their influences collide, interact, and ripple across Pakistan’s geopolitical landscape in unpredictable ways.Traditional counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategies rely on clear, identifiable enemies that can be neutralised through military might, intelligence operations, or negotiated settlements. The three-body dynamic, however, forces Pakistan to wrestle with fluid, overlapping, and at times contradictory challenges.In essence, each ""body"" in this problem pulls Pakistan’s security landscape in different directions, making any single policy or operation insufficient.Addressing this three-body problem requires Pakistan to adopt a holistic, integrated strategy that acknowledges the distinct yet intertwined nature of these challenges.Pakistan's military has intensified operations since mid-2025 to counter the Taliban-TTP-Baloch nexus, focusing on intelligence-based strikes (IBOs), cross-border actions, and sustained ground campaigns amid over 1,000 attacks nationwide. These efforts emphasize decapitation of TTP leadership, border denial, and Baloch insurgency suppression, though resource strains from multi-front threats limit gains.The army launched precision airstrikes into Afghanistan targeting TTP hideouts. On October 9, 2025, raids hit Kabul, Khost, Jalalabad, and Paktika, aiming at TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud's headquarters, killing dozens of militants despite his survival claim. Retaliatory Taliban attacks on border posts prompted further Pakistani strikes on October 11-12, neutralizing Taliban brigades and TTP operatives.Recent IBOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa yielded kills: December 5-6 saw nine TTP fighters eliminated in Tank and Lakki Marwat districts. September 13 clashes in South Waziristan and Lower Dir killed 35 militants but cost 19 soldiers, highlighting ambush risks. December 6-7 Chaman border strikes destroyed three Taliban bases, killing 23 fighters after ceasefire violations.Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, ramped up in summer 2025, reports near-daily TTP neutralizations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, addressing a terrorism surge to highest levels since 2015.In Balochistan, May 2025 operations deployed over 40 vehicles in Surab, Zehri, and Khuzdar, declaring areas ""sensitive"" to hunt Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) amid 70+ attacks under Operation Herof. August 30 actions post-BLA civilian strikes killed five insurgents and captured two in Kech, part of Azm-e-Istehkam's escalation.Security forces targeted BLA convoys, camps, and intelligence squads, seizing arms despite BLA claims of 25 blockades and 15 camp captures in 2024-2025. These ops focus on CPEC protection, countering 938 incidents with 1,002 fatalities in 2024 extending into 2025.The ongoing volatility reveals that no single strategy will yield a definitive victory; instead, Pakistan must adopt nuanced, integrated policies that combine hard military pressure with political dialogue, regional diplomacy, and socioeconomic inclusion.The future of Pakistan’s sovereignty and regional peace depends on how skillfully it navigates this chaotic three-body problem, turning a disordered struggle into a managed equilibrium before the forces pull the nation into further unrest and fragmentation.","Pakistan’s western tribal belt and Balochistan both border Afghanistan and Iran, turning these regions into transnational conflict zones.

Pakistan ex-ISI chief jailed: Faiz Hameed convicted after court martial; handed 14 years in prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-ex-isi-chief-jailed-faiz-hameed-convicted-after-court-martial-handed-14-years-in-prison/articleshow/125908182.cms,"Uncertainty Over Pakistan’s Top Military Post Could Trigger Conflict: Analyst





A Pakistani military court has sentenced former inter-services intelligence (ISI) director general Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed to 14 years in prison after a 15-month-long court-martial on multiple charges, including political interference and violations of the official secrets act.The Field General Court Martial, held under the Pakistan army act, found Hameed guilty on four counts - engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and state resources, violation of the official secrets act, and causing wrongful loss to individuals. The military did not identify who suffered such losses. Officials said Hameed was provided full legal rights and representation during the proceedings. He retains the right to appeal.Hameed, once considered a close confidant of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , had been detained in 2024 after an internal investigation linked to the Top City housing project near Islamabad. Until Thursday's announcement, neither the charges nor details of the probe had been formally disclosed by the government or the military.Security analyst Syed Muhammad Ali told AP that the verdict followed “a lengthy investigation that gave the former ISI chief ample opportunity to defend himself.”He added: “The decision signals the military leadership’s intent that no officer, regardless of rank, will be allowed to engage in politics, and Hameed’s case has been made an example for all retired officers.”Hameed’s downfall marks a rare instance of a high-ranking former military official facing such a stiff sentence in Pakistan, where the army holds significant institutional influence and senior-level prosecutions are uncommon.His political proximity to Imran Khan had long drawn attention. Khan - who was ousted in 2022 through a no-confidence vote and has since criticized the military and political leadership for his removal - is serving multiple jail terms on graft and other charges. The military, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government and the US have all denied Khan’s claim that they engineered his exit.","Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed sentenced to 14 years in prison.

Pakistan Army Spokesperson Faces Backlash for Winking at Reporter in Viral Video





Pakistan’s military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has come under widespread criticism after he appeared to wink at a journalist following her question about imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan In the video, the reporter questions Chaudhry about the allegations against Khan, referring to him as a “national security threat” and “anti-state.”""How is it different from the past, or should we expect any development in the future?"" the journalist added.To this, the Chaudhary replied, ""and add a fourth point that you are missing: he is also a 'zehni mareez' (mental patient)."" Chaudhary then proceeded to smile and wink at the journalist.The video, now circulating widely on social media, has sparked widespread criticism, with users calling the gesture “shameless.”""This is how corrupt Pakistani military officers treats women... shameless!!"" a user on X said.Last week, Chaudhry criticised the imprisoned former prime minister, calling him “a mentally ill person,” “a narcissist,” and “a security risk,” while noting that it was for the government to determine how to deal with him, as cited by Dawn.During an hour-long media briefing, Chaudhry acknowledged that the military had never before taken such a clear public stance on a political leader, calling the move “unprecedented.”Chaudhry’s strongly worded press briefing came in response to Khan’s latest remarks against the military leadership, conveyed earlier this week through his sister, Uzma Khan, during a jail visit after weeks of limited access. The comments were later shared on Khan’s X account. Uzma told reporters that her brother was in good health but “very angry.”Imran Khan is currently lodged in Adiala Jail, where he was first sentenced to three years in prison in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Subsequent corruption convictions have extended his total jail term to 14 years, the longest imposed on him to date.Meanwhile, Pakistani government officials have dismissed rumours of Khan’s death in custody or a secret transfer from Adiala Jail, maintaining that he remains in the Rawalpindi facility and is in stable condition.","Pakistan Army Spokesperson Faces Backlash for Winking at Reporter in Viral Video.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





Pakistan’s defence ministry on Friday officially notified the appointment of Field Marshal Asim Munir as the country’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).The ""president, on the advice of the prime minister, is pleased to appoint Field Marshal Asim Munir (NI) M as the chief of army staff, concurrently the chief of defence forces for a tenure of five years,” the notification read, news agency PTI reported citing Dawn.This comes a day after President Asif Ali Zardari approved his appointment on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.According to the notification issued under Article 243 of Pakistan’s Constitution and the amended Pakistan Army Act, Munir will serve concurrently as Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces for a tenure of five years. The notification marks the most significant restructuring of Pakistan’s military command since the 1970s.The appointment follows the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment last month, which created the new CDF post to establish a unified command structure and enable faster decision-making in critical situations.The amendment also abolished the office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which had coordinated the tri-services since 1976. The CJCSC post formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.With the restructuring, operational, administrative and strategic authority of the armed forces has been consolidated into a single office headed by the CDF. The revised Article 243 provides that the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, will appoint the army chief, who will concurrently serve as the CDF.Munir was first appointed Army Chief in November 2022 for three years. His tenure was extended to five years in 2024 after amendments to the Pakistan Army Act.He was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal days after the four-day conflict with India in May, becoming only the second officer in Pakistan’s history to hold the rank after Field Marshal Ayub Khan.Alongside Munir’s notification, the defence ministry also confirmed a two-year extension for Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu. His extended tenure as Chief of the Air Staff will begin in March 2026 and continue till March 2028.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Munir on his “historic” appointment, saying his leadership had been pivotal in guiding Pakistan’s armed forces. He also praised the air chief for his command during recent operations. defence minister Khawaja Asif and other senior leaders also extended their congratulations, according to Dawn.Information minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan’s defence had strengthened with the establishment of a unified command. Dismissing speculation over the delay in the notification, he said rumours circulating on social and electronic media had proven baseless.Earlier uncertainty had followed the abolition of the CJCSC post and the end of Munir’s original three-year term in late November, leading to political speculation over upcoming four-star appointments. Government officials maintained that the delay was procedural and linked to the prime minister’s travel schedule.Explaining the significance of the new post, army spokesman Lt General Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry said the CDF headquarters would improve coordination across modern, multi-domain warfare involving land, sea, air, cyber, space and intelligence operations. He added that many countries already operate under similar unified command structures.Under the amended military laws, the five-year tenure of the first COAS-plus-CDF is deemed to begin from the date of notification, effectively resetting Munir’s term.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions

Why Imran Khan still remains a threat to Asim Munir





PTI without Imran: Still a major force





PTI was barred from contesting the 2024 general elections.

Dozens of PTI leaders were detained.

PTI-backed independents still won more seats than any other group.

Popularity that has not faded





A 2023 Gallup Pakistan survey showed 61% of Pakistanis had a “good opinion” of him -- the highest rating among all national leaders as reported by Dawn.

Arab News quoted analysts saying Khan remains ""too politically relevant to sideline.""

Televised appearances that trigger unrest





Nationwide protests

Arson and clashes

Attacks on military installations, including the Corps Commander’s residence in Lahore

Nationwide mobile shutdowns and troop deployment

Why Pak army cannot 'eliminate' Imran Khan





Key factors keeping Khan politically alive:





Victimhood narrative: Solitary confinement and restricted access cast him as a political prisoner, a powerful image in Pakistan’s grievance-driven politics.

Mobilisation without presence: PTI’s digital machinery enables mass mobilisation even without Khan physically present.

Diaspora and social media influence: Global PTI networks amplify every statement, intensifying scrutiny on Pakistan’s military.

High-risk optics: Every court appearance or televised moment risks sparking unrest.

The state vs sentiment





The jail sentence - not the silence





Constitutional shift and expanding military power





Munir's foreign outreach and US engagement





Imran's strength: Mobilisation without access





Why the military needs more than power









Is Imran Khan still a threat to Asim Munir ? The question looms over Pakistan ’s power structure. Former Prime Minister and cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, now over two years into imprisonment, remains a potent challenge to army chief Asim Munir — whose rapid ascent and consolidation of authority have made him Pakistan’s de facto ruler.With Munir now elevated as the Pakistan's first chief of defence forces, commanding the army, navy and air force, his institutional power is at its strongest — yet the confrontation with Khan, even from behind bars, continues to shadow that authority. The two have been locked in a prolonged, deeply personal confrontation.Despite being confined, Khan has transformed from a jailed political leader into a symbolic and political counterweight to Munir’s expanding military-political dominance.Far from fading, the rivalry between the two men has only sharpened. Munir commands the state; Khan commands sentiment. And as the events of the last two years show, sentiment can be far harder to control.Imran Khan's incarceration has fuelled a narrative of persecution and martyrdom among supporters. Long spells of isolation, restrictions on visits, and recurring allegations of mistreatment have strengthened this perception, with some analysts warning that these measures risk backfiring.Imtiaz Gul, executive director of the Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), told Al Jazeera: ""The primary objective of blocking access and keeping Khan in solitary confinement is apparently meant to break him into (agreeing to) a compromise and neutralise the groundswell of anti-government sentiment.”Increasingly, barring visits to Khan is viewed not merely as a security decision, but as a political strategy that may harm the governing PML-N and reinforce Khan’s narrative of institutional overreach.Even without its leader on the ballot, PTI remains one of Pakistan's strongest political forces.PTI claims widespread rigging, accusing the government and military of manipulating the results, allegations echoed by several independent observers. The establishment denies all wrongdoing, but the perception of electoral injustice has only strengthened PTI’s street momentum.For perspective, Imran Khan’s PTI had won 151 seats in the 2018 elections, defeating Nawaz Sharif’s PML-N (81 seats) and PPP (54). That victory was hailed by PTI as ""the end of an era,"" breaking the decades-long political monopoly of the PML-N, PPP and the military establishment.Despite his imprisonment, Khan remains Pakistan’s most popular political figure.This enduring popularity, even at a time of complete political inability, poses a direct challenge to Munir's authority.Even brief, controlled public appearances continue to spark major political reactions.During the May 2023 unrest, Imran Khan's court appearance -- after his dramatic arrest by paramilitary forces -- showed him flashing a victory sign. The televised images spread instantly and triggered:These scenes were unprecedented not only for their scale but because the anger erupted in Punjab, the heart of Pakistan's military recruitment and administrative base.More recently, when false rumours about Khan’s death spread, PTI supporters mobilised across Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, again forcing an immediate government response.A leader who provokes unrest without speaking remains difficult to contain.An analysis in The Diplomat warns that the army ""cannot afford to eliminate"" a leader with deep political roots in Punjab.Such an act, the report cautions, could ""unleash one that the state may not survive.""Khan is ethnically Pashtun but politically anchored in Punjab, with support stretching across Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the diaspora. His arrest in 2023 showed that anger against the military establishment now emerges in Punjab.Eliminating him would not neutralise his influence; it would likely create a ""martyr"" of unprecedented scale.Munir commands the state apparatus. Khan commands sentiment.And in Pakistan, sentiment has repeatedly proved more enduring than power.No prime minister has survived a confrontation with the military, but no army chief has faced a jailed leader with such widespread support and political resilience.Since August 2023, Khan has faced a series of corruption and security-related cases. In January 2025, he received a 14-year sentence in a land-graft case, a verdict his supporters claim was engineered to keep him out of politics.Khan’s public statements from jail fuel the perception of political persecution. He has directly accused Munir of ""moral bankruptcy,"" and called him ""mentally unstable man"" claiming Pakistan's constitution and rule of law have collapsed under him: ""I have been kept in complete solitary confinement, locked inside a cell with no contact with a single human being for four weeks… even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been taken away from us. ""His family members have echoed concerns about his treatment. His sister, after visiting him, said he told her they were subjecting him to ""mental torture"" and held Asim Munir responsible.The recent 27th amendment -- widely called a ""constitutional coup"" -- has entrenched military dominance further. Munir's elevation as chief of defence forces gives him command over all three services.Mahmood Khan Achakzai, head of Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan, warned: ""There is no constitution in Pakistan now. No judiciary. No social contract. They have made one man into a king above all.""Months ago, Munir's increasing visibility included multiple meetings with Donald Trump. Munir even nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, crediting him with easing India–Pakistan high military tensions, a move driven by a desire for US recognition. Trump later referred to him as his ""favourite field marshal.""It is often assumed that political power requires physical presence. Imran's continuing influence disproves that assumption.His followers still speak of him not as a convicted convict, but as a leader wronged. The slogans, the sense of injustice, the personal stories -- all add up to mobilisation potential. And that potential doesn’t require Khan’s freedom; it only requires people’s belief.Statements from his family amplify this -- for instance, the anguish voiced by his son over not knowing whether his father is safe in jail. Such public airing of fear and trauma becomes a magnet for sympathy and solidarity.""Not knowing whether your father is safe, injured or even alive is a form of psychological torture,"" he had said in written remarks.However, Imran Khan's sister was eventually allowed to meet the former prime minister. After the visit, she said, ""Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he told me they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this.""For the military leadership under Asim Munir, the calculus is not just about brute strength, it is about legitimacy. Pakistan’s power dynamics have long relied on a veneer of neutrality: the idea that the army guards the system while politics handles politics. Overplaying that role risks shattering the illusion.From Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan to Zia-ul-Haq and Pervez Musharraf , every era of military rule reinforced the pattern: the army positioned itself not merely as a defender of borders, but as the ultimate arbiter of Pakistan's politics and identity.Each takeover was justified through narratives of chaos, corruption, or national security, allowing the establishment to retain dominance even during civilian periods. Today, under Asim Munir, this pattern continues in a more sophisticated form: instead of overt coups, power is exercised through constitutional engineering, judicial pressure, and political sidelining, most visibly in the dismantling of Imran Khan’s political career. The military’s quest is not only to command the state but to remain indispensable to its very definition.As long as Imran Khan remains a contested figure, not just legally, but symbolically, the army's claim to neutrality becomes harder to maintain.International pressure, media scrutiny, and internal dissent all rise with every heavy-handed move.Hence, the challenge for Munir may be deeper than suppressing one man, it is about managing optics, institutional trust and political fallout.",Is Imran Khan still a threat to Asim Munir? The question looms over Pakistan ’s power structure. Khan has transformed from a jailed political leader into a symbolic and political counterweight to Munir’s expanding military-political dominance.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125789753,imgsize-1800195,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-62.jpg"

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday formally appointed Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir as Pakistan’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) for a period of five years.The move follows the recent passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment on November 12, which created the post of CDF to unify command across the armed forces and streamline decision-making during critical situations.The newly created CDF replaces the abolished office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.President Zardari approved the recommendation submitted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for Munir’s appointment. A press release from the President’s office extended best wishes to Munir in his new role.The same release also announced a two-year extension in the service of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu, Chief of Air Staff, effective from the completion of his current tenure in March 2026.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the reforms “bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while maintaining military honour and tradition” and confirmed there were no legal or political obstacles to Munir’s appointment. He also stated that the Defence Ministry was preparing a new organogram for the CDF to reflect the changes.Field Marshal Munir, who was initially appointed as COAS in November 2022 for three years, had his tenure extended to five years in 2024.With this appointment, he assumes a historic dual role, serving simultaneously as Chief of Army Staff and the first Chief of Defence Forces, marking a significant shift in Pakistan’s military hierarchy and institutional structure.The 27th Constitutional Amendment elevates the army chief to the role of CDF with constitutional authority over all three branches of the military: army, navy and air force.It also introduces judicial reforms, including the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) to handle constitutional matters, allowing the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the amendment as a demonstration of national unity, highlighting the role of law enforcement in recent counterterrorism efforts.While the ruling coalition including PPP, PML-N, and MQM-P, supported the amendment, opposition parties criticized it as unconstitutional, warning it could concentrate excessive power in the military.PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan described it as the “Baku Amendments,” accusing the government of undermining democracy. PPP Senator Raza Rabbani warned the changes could damage provincial autonomy and roll back powers devolved under the 18th Amendment, according to Dawn.Following Munir’s appointment, the next key step will be appointing the commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), a four-star position previously under the CJCSC. The NSC commander will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the CDF.","President Asif Ali Zardari formally appointed Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir as Pakistan’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) for a period of five years.

Parallel governance, ‘parchi’ systems and water mafias





Several informal systems operated during this period:

The ‘Parchi’ System: Residents, businesses and even small schools were required to obtain a stamped permission slip or parchi from PAC offices to build, renovate, operate stalls or open new ventures. What looked like a routine approval process effectively served as taxation, a tool of surveillance and a means to regulate economic activity.

Water and Tanker Control: Amid persistent water shortages across Karachi, PAC factions captured key pipeline points and operated illegal hydrants. Water was sold through tankers at inflated rates, turning a basic utility into one of the most profitable sources of revenue for the gangs. Control over water distribution also gave PAC leverage over entire neighbourhoods.

Welfare Patronage and ‘Robin Hood’ Politics: A share of illicit earnings was used to sponsor madrassas, support religious events, organise football tournaments, fund community funerals and assist poor families. This welfare strategy deepened PAC’s influence and aligned it with PPP’s political base, reinforcing the perception of gang leaders as protectors rather than mere criminals.

PPP, the Bhuttos and the contested 'protector' narrative





A factual account of the events surrounding Benazir’s return and death underscores this point:

Karsaz bombing (18 October 2007): Benazir was in an open truck surrounded by PPP volunteers, not in a car. Her protection was largely handled by party workers and an informal crowd, not gang networks.

Assassination in Rawalpindi December, 27, 2007: At the time she was targeted, she was travelling in a white Toyota Land Cruiser driven by Javed Rehman, a trained PPP driver, not Rehman Dakait. No credible evidence links the gangster to her security detail.

Post-war Lyari: Quiet streets, unresolved questions









NEW DELHI: Karachi’s Lyari has long been associated with a dual identity. To its residents, it is the “mother of Karachi” – one of the city’s oldest settlements powered by dockworkers, truck drivers, boxers and footballers. To the rest of Pakistan, especially through the 1990s and 2000s, it came to signify something very different: a “mini Brazil” of football-obsessed alleys, heavily armed gangs, and extortion rackets, long branded as Karachi’s “wild west.”It is this layered, contradictory Lyari that Aditya Dhar’s recent 'Dhurandhar' turns into cinema. The film revolves around characters that seem to be inspired by gangster Rehman Dakait, police officer Chaudhry Aslam and a shadowy military-intelligence player resembling Ilyas Kashmiri (fictionalised as Major Iqbal). Alongside Pakistani security figures, the narrative hints at a foreign intelligence angle featuring an unnamed “Indian spy chief” — a character with echoes of a former top security official who, in real life, has been involved in covert roles in regional conflicts in Pakistan. These references remain ambiguous on screen, but they mirror real allegations that have circulated for years through local press conferences, dossiers and counterclaims on both sides of the border.Reacting to the controversy around Dhurandhar and the a case file in Delhi high court, Major Mohit Sharma’s brother, Madhur Sharma, said the petition was filed due to ongoing speculation that the film was inspired by the Ashok Chakra awardee’s life without any transparency from the makers. Madhur clarified that the family is not opposed to a film based on Major Sharma, but objected to the possibility of using his story without consent. “We would be proud if a film is made on him. Even in 2021, a film was announced and we supported the producers. He has left a legacy, and it should live on,” he said. The family maintains that they are only seeking clarity and dignity for the officer: “There is no benefit the parents are looking for… If the film is based on him, just say, ‘Sorry ma’am, we didn’t inform you.’ If not, say the hype is untrue.”The Delhi high court heard the plea filed by Major Sharma’s parents seeking a review before the film’s release. While the court did not stay the December 5 release of Dhurandhar, it acknowledged the legitimacy of the family’s concerns regarding similarities to a real-life officer without consent. The court referred the matter to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) for examination, noting the need for regulatory scrutiny before the film proceeds.Following the controversy, director Aditya Dhar issued a clarification on X addressed to the family. He wrote: “Hi, sir - our film Dhurandhar is not based on the life of braveheart Major Mohit Sharma AC(P) SM. This is an official clarification. I assure you, if we do make a biopic on Mohit sir in the future, we will do it with full consent and in complete consultation with the family, and in a way that truly honors his sacrifice for the nation and the legacy it has left for all of us. Jai Hind.”This blurred mix of fact, rumour and state narrative reflects Lyari’s history itself. For more than six decades, the neighbourhood has moved on two parallel tracks. One is a working-class community that powered Karachi’s docks, produced champion boxers and footballers, and remained a loyal base of the Pakistan People's Party ( PPP ). The other is a network of gangs and protection rackets that emerged from the hashish trade of the 1960s and later expanded into narcotics trafficking, extortion, land capture and control of water tankers.Successive governments, including PPP administrations, did not simply fight these groups; at various points they bargained with them, funded them or turned a blind eye. Leaders like Rehman Dakait, and later Uzair Baloch, acted not only as crime bosses but as political intermediaries who ran parallel governance under the banner of the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC), often brandishing PPP flags at their offices. As Taliban networks poured into Karachi in the 2000s and regional intelligence rivalries spilled into the city, Lyari’s gangs were no longer seen merely as enforcers protecting a vote bank — they were gradually treated as potential pieces in a wider security chessboard.With Dhurandhar reigniting attention, this story revisits how Lyari transformed from a labour colony to PPP stronghold to a battleground shaped by gang wars, state patronage, counter-terror operations and allegations of espionage. What emerges is not simply the tale of feared men, but the story of a neighbourhood where poverty, politics and competing security agendas turned everyday life into a prolonged and violent conflict.a long, violent war.Lyari is among the oldest continuously inhabited parts of Karachi and holds a foundational place in the city’s history. Long before Karachi became Pakistan’s financial hub, Lyari evolved as a working-class settlement dominated by Baloch communities who migrated from coastal and interior regions in search of livelihoods. During the 18th and 19th centuries, as the port emerged as the centre of colonial trade, Baloch labourers became indispensable to loading cargo, building roads and supporting maritime activities. This early dependence on manual workers gradually transformed Lyari into a labour colony closely interlinked with Karachi’s industrial and infrastructural growth.Despite its importance in sustaining the city’s economy, the locality remained neglected in terms of urban development. Narrow lanes, dense housing clusters, unreliable utilities and limited state services came to define its daily reality. Yet, Lyari’s social fabric remained strong: sports, community centres and local cultural traditions created a sense of belonging that distinguished it from other Karachi neighbourhoods.In politics, Lyari’s identity further crystallised with the rise of the Pakistan People's Party. Since the 1970s, the PPP’s populist messaging—centred on economic justice and empowerment of marginalised groups—found deep resonance in Lyari. During decades of shifting political power in Karachi, the locality consistently returned PPP candidates to provincial and national assemblies. This loyalty turned Lyari into the party’s most dependable urban stronghold, a constituency where electoral victories were seldom in doubt.Over time, however, this relationship between Lyari and the PPP took a complex turn. As Karachi’s security landscape deteriorated in the 1980s and 1990s, the party increasingly relied on local strongmen, community leaders and later armed groups to maintain influence and protect its vote bank. Patronage networks developed, blurring the lines between politics, street authority and organised crime. What began as a working-class community with a vibrant political identity would eventually become the focal point of Karachi’s most violent gang conflict—one in which loyalty, power and criminality became deeply entangled.The roots of the Lyari gang war go back to the 1960s, when the area emerged as a key node in the local hashish trade. According to both journalistic and academic accounts, early figures like Dad Muhammad (“Dadal”) and his brother Sheru moved into the hashish business in the mid-1960s, challenging the dominance of an older drug boss known as “Kala Nag”.Kala Nag was eventually killed in what was officially described as a police encounter, and the hashish economy fragmented into rival factions. Violence at this stage largely revolved around knives and small arms, with public killings used to send messages and enforce territorial control.In the 1990s, a more educated generation of criminals appeared. One of the most prominent was Iqbal, known locally as “Babu Dacoit”, who reportedly held a Master’s degree in physics. Operating across a wider network, he ran drugs and other rackets while remaining largely beyond the reach of the police. His later arrest, when he was already paralysed, symbolised a shift from small-scale street crime to more organised, networked operations.A major shift in Lyari’s politics and crime landscape came with the ascent of Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch, widely known as Rehman Dakait. Born into a family already linked to smuggling networks, Rehman entered the criminal world at a young age. By the mid-1990s, he had developed a reputation for extreme violence, with local accounts even alleging that he murdered his own mother during a domestic dispute—an unverified but persistent story that reinforced his notoriety.By the early 2000s, Rehman had consolidated control over large parts of Lyari’s illicit economy, including drug trafficking, extortion and gambling rackets. Yet, he also cultivated an image as a benefactor. Oral histories, media reporting and academic studies describe how he funded small clinics, madrassas, football tournaments, neighbourhood parks and schools, using criminal proceeds to build patronage. This dual identity—provider and predator—helped him secure legitimacy among segments of the local population who felt abandoned by the state.Rehman’s rise coincided with Lyari’s continued loyalty to the PPP. As political competition intensified in Karachi, PPP leaders increasingly saw strategic value in a local armed actor who could protect the party’s dominance and mobilise votes. Political alignment, according to multiple accounts, allowed Rehman to operate with greater impunity and helped formalise gang influence under a new name: the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC).Formed around 2008, the PAC presented itself as a community “peace” organisation but functioned as an institutionalised version of Rehman’s operations. It opened offices, appointed local commanders, mediated disputes, collected protection money and distributed welfare. In a context of chronic state neglect, many residents began to rely on the PAC as a parallel administration, making it one of the most powerful non-state authorities Karachi had ever seen.The roots of Lyari’s modern gang war lie in an older conflict shaped by ransom kidnappings, shifting alliances and internal betrayals. In the 1980s and 1990s, parts of Lyari’s criminal economy were dominated by a figure known as Haji Lalu, with another notorious operator, Dadal, working as one of his trusted aides. Disputes over ransom money extorted from wealthy businessmen gradually fractured this relationship. The split laid the foundation for two rival blocs: one centred on Lalu and his son, Arshad Pappu, and the other aligned with Dadal’s family, including his son, Rehman Dakait.The rivalry intensified through the 1990s. Dadal’s murder—widely believed to have been carried out by a competing gang—created a vacuum that Rehman moved to fill, initially with Lalu’s support. But a later dispute over a substantial ransom sum allegedly taken behind Rehman’s back marked the end of that partnership. The fallout turned the former allies into adversaries, cementing a bitter feud between Rehman’s camp and that of Haji Lalu and Arshad Pappu.A separate event subsequently brought an important new actor onto the scene: Uzair Jan Baloch, the son of a transport businessman, Faiz Muhammad, known locally as Mama Faizu. According to both police records and local accounts, Faizu was kidnapped and killed in 2003 by men linked to Arshad Pappu. Uzair initially attempted to seek justice through legal channels but reportedly faced threats and obstruction. Sharing a common enemy in Pappu, he turned instead toward his cousin, Rehman Dakait, joining his organisation.Over the following years, the Rehman–Uzair alliance fought a sustained war against the Pappu–Lalu network. What began as a dispute over illicit profits evolved into a violent cycle of killings, reprisals and territorial battles. By the mid-2000s, the feud had escalated into one of the deadliest urban conflicts in Karachi, with casualties running into the hundreds and paving the way for a new era of militarised gang politics.With the rise of Rehman Dakait and, later, Uzair Baloch, the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC) grew beyond a criminal network and evolved into a parallel governance structure in Lyari. Between roughly 2008 and 2013, researchers describe Lyari as effectively under PAC’s informal administration, with neighbourhood “commanders’’ exercising authority over small jurisdictions. These commanders managed disputes, issued permissions and collected funds in a manner that closely resembled state functions.These overlapping spheres blurred boundaries between state actors and non-state power. PAC offices routinely displayed both their own banners and PPP flags, while police operations in Lyari were often delayed, curtailed or influenced by political pressure. For a period, the PAC did not simply challenge state authority—it partially replaced it.Within Lyari, Rehman Dakait was widely viewed as being closely aligned with senior leaders of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP). Journalistic reporting and local accounts repeatedly describe him as someone who maintained proximity to the Bhutto leadership and attended major PPP political events.A popular narrative in Lyari claims that Rehman “saved” former prime minister Benazir Bhutto during the 18 October 2007 Karsaz attack in Karachi, when two explosions targeted her homecoming procession. In these accounts, Rehman is portrayed as part of an informal security circle that helped her escape following the blast. The story has fuelled his “protector” image and contributed to his Robin Hood-style mystique.However, despite the narrative’s frequency in oral history, there is no independent, verifiable evidence confirming that Rehman personally rescued Benazir or served as her driver or official security guard at any point. What is more clearly documented is the broader political relationship: Lyari’s gangs and the PPP operated in a framework of mutual benefit for years, with the party relying on armed control of the constituency and the gangs receiving political space to operate.After the PPP returned to power in 2008, Rehman publicly rebranded himself as Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch, presenting the Peoples’ Aman Committee as a community organisation rather than a gang body. His growing political visibility, and reported sympathies with certain Baloch nationalist circles, are believed by some analysts and residents to have contributed to his killing in a controversial police “encounter” in 2009.As media scrutiny of Lyari intensified and gang violence spread to other parts of Karachi, state pressure began to mount. At the centre of this response was SSP Chaudhry Aslam Khan, an officer in the Crime Investigation Department (CID) known for aggressive policing tactics. Aslam cultivated a reputation as an “encounter specialist,” targeting both militant groups and organised crime. His public stance against Lyari gangs put him in direct confrontation with Rehman Dakait, who by the mid-2000s had become one of the most influential figures in Karachi’s underworld.Law enforcement records and press reports from the period describe a tense cat-and-mouse dynamic between the two men. Rehman repeatedly evaded capture; in at least two documented incidents, he escaped custody after allegedly bribing police officers. According to local media accounts and later investigations, Rehman paid select CID and jail officials to secure temporary releases or avoid charges, a practice facilitated by weak internal oversight and political protection. These incidents contributed to Aslam’s personal resolve. Journalists covering Karachi’s crime beat recall that Aslam increasingly framed the pursuit of Rehman as a matter of professional and personal credibility for the police force.On 9 August 2009, police announced that Rehman had been killed in a shootout near Steel Town, on Karachi’s outskirts. Officials claimed that Rehman and three accomplices opened fire on police and were killed in retaliatory fire. However, from the outset, rights groups and local residents questioned the official account. Activists, lawyers and researchers later described the killing as a likely extrajudicial execution, consistent with a broader pattern of “encounters” used in Karachi to bypass a slow judicial system and fragile witness protections.With Rehman removed, the gang landscape did not stabilise. Instead, the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC), which he had informally led, underwent a leadership transition. Within weeks, Uzair Jan Baloch was positioned as Rehman’s successor, assuming both the criminal networks and the political connections tied to PPP support. Unlike Rehman, whose authority rested heavily on personality and charisma, Uzair’s tenure was marked by greater bureaucratisation—defined commanders, more formalised extortion systems and deeper conflict with the state. This period would set the stage for some of the bloodiest episodes of the Lyari gang war.After Rehman Dakait’s killing in 2009, leadership of the Lyari network did not pass smoothly to a single successor. Uzair Jan Baloch projected himself as the political head of the organisation: educated, relatively well-spoken, and comfortable appearing alongside PPP leaders. His image contrasted sharply with the operational commander Noor Muhammad, better known as “Baba Ladla”, who had a reputation for ruthlessness built over years as an enforcer in neighbourhood turf battles.Initially, the two worked side by side under the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC) banner. But disagreements over extortion routes, neighbourhood control and access to political patrons gradually turned into open rivalry. Within Lyari, some commanders gravitated toward Uzair’s political authority and alleged links to provincial leadership; others aligned with Baba Ladla’s street power. This divide transformed PAC from a single entity into competing armed factions.The conflict reached its most infamous moment in March 2013, with the killing of rival gangster Arshad Pappu. According to court filings and media reporting, Pappu and his brother Yasir Arafat were abducted from Karachi’s Defence neighbourhood and taken to Lyari. Both were tortured, killed and later mutilated. Their remains were reportedly burned and dumped—widely interpreted as Uzair’s retaliation for the killing of his father, Faiz Muhammad. Some later accounts, including police dossiers and local testimonies, alleged that gang members kicked or played football with severed heads, turning the murders into a grim public spectacle that circulated in local narratives.By this stage, the greatest toll fell on ordinary residents. Prolonged firefights between splinter factions left neighbourhoods barricaded for days. Homes and small businesses were commandeered as torture rooms or lookout posts. Young men were coerced into gang recruitment, teachers and shopkeepers were forced to pay “taxes,” and ambulance workers trying to retrieve bodies were threatened by both sides. In response, the state increasingly turned to large-scale fires, sieges and heavy weaponry, culminating in the militarised crackdowns that would soon follow.In April–May 2012, the Sindh government initiated one of Karachi’s largest security actions against gang networks, later known as Operation Lyari. The police deployed thousands of personnel, armoured carriers and specialised units with the stated goal of clearing the area and arresting key commanders linked to the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC). For the first time, a formal state crackdown directly targeted the network that had operated for years through political patronage and parallel governance.The operation, however, quickly encountered intense resistance. Armed groups used heavy weaponry, including rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), to attack the advancing police. Several armoured personnel carriers were damaged or destroyed, and police units struggled to push through Lyari’s dense alleyways, where snipers and lookout positions gave gang members a tactical advantage. After several days of fighting, rising casualties, and growing criticism from political circles, the operation stalled. It ended without major arrests and was widely perceived as a failure that exposed both the state’s limitations and PAC’s entrenched power.For residents, the consequences were immediate and severe. Lyari was effectively sealed off for about a week, with restricted movement in and out of the neighbourhood. Power and water supplies were disrupted, markets were shut, and families already living under economic strain faced shortages of food and basic essentials. Humanitarian groups and ambulance services reported being blocked or delayed from providing aid, amid police suspicions that relief efforts could serve as a cover to transport weapons or militants.The failed siege deepened mistrust between civilians, gangs and the state. Many residents had already endured years of coercive “taxes” and violence under PAC rule; the security operation then subjected them to collective punishment, indiscriminate fire and deprivation. Instead of restoring confidence, the crackdown reinforced the perception that both the state and the gangs were willing to sacrifice ordinary people to protect their own interests.Even as Lyari’s gang networks fought prolonged turf wars, Karachi was simultaneously becoming a logistical base for militant organisations, particularly factions of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). As security operations intensified in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt, militants sought anonymity in large urban centres. Pashtun-majority neighbourhoods such as Sohrab Goth, Manghopir and SITE became key sanctuaries and transit corridors where fighters, explosives and finances could be moved with relative ease.The turning point came on 8 June 2014, when ten militants launched an armed assault on Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, using automatic weapons, grenades and a rocket launcher. The attack triggered an overnight battle that left at least 36 people dead, including all ten assailants. The incident severely embarrassed federal authorities and exposed vulnerabilities in Karachi’s security infrastructure. The scale of the attack underscored that the city’s violence was no longer just about gangs—it was also linked to national insurgency networks.In the aftermath, the state expanded its response. The federal and provincial governments granted Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) extensive policing and detention powers to target both militants and criminal networks. These operations aligned with ongoing national counterinsurgency campaigns, including Operation Zarb-e-Azb and later Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad, which aimed to dismantle militant networks and disrupt their finances and recruitment pipelines.In Karachi, this translated into a sustained, multi-year crackdown led by the Rangers. Tactical raids, mass arrests, prolonged detentions under special legal provisions and high-profile encounters became common features of urban policing. In Lyari, the result was a shrinking space for gangs to openly control territory. The Peoples’ Aman Committee and splinter factions still operated, but their public influence diminished as armed checkpoints, displays of heavy weaponry and enforced taxation became more difficult to sustain. Although pockets of violence persisted, the crackdown marked the beginning of the end of large, overt gang administrations in the city.One of the most high-profile casualties in the post-2014 security phase was SSP Chaudhry Aslam Khan, the police officer who had led major operations against both Lyari gangs and militant networks. On 9 January 2014, a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into Aslam’s convoy in Karachi, killing him and at least three others. The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility, calling the attack revenge for police operations against its fighters and financiers. Aslam’s death was widely perceived as a serious setback to the city’s counter-terror and anti-gang efforts, though operations continued under other police officers and with greater reliance on Pakistan Rangers (Sindh).For Lyari’s armed groups, the most decisive blow came three years later. Acting on intelligence reports, Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) launched a pre-dawn raid on 2 February 2017 in Phool Patti Lane, Lyari, targeting Noor Muhammad, better known as “Baba Ladla.” According to Rangers’ statements, a gun battle lasting over 30 minutes ensued, during which gang members used automatic weapons and grenades. By the end of the raid, Rangers announced that Baba Ladla and two close associates had been killed.Listed for years among Pakistan’s “most wanted” criminals, Baba Ladla faced cases ranging from murder and extortion to armed attacks on police and suspected collaborations with extremist groups. His death effectively dismantled a key pillar of the Uzair-era structure, removing the most prominent operational commander who had challenged both rivals inside Lyari and the security forces sent to eliminate them.By the mid-2010s, as state pressure intensified and gang structures were fractured by successive operations, Uzair Jan Baloch left Pakistan. In December 2015, Interpol arrested him at Dubai International Airport, reportedly while he was travelling from Muscat. He was subsequently handed over to Pakistani authorities and brought back to Karachi.From 2016 onward, Uzair was charged in dozens of criminal cases, ranging from murder and attempted murder to extortion, kidnapping and terrorism. Many of these cases have since resulted in acquittals due to lack of evidence, hostile witnesses or procedural weaknesses—a pattern that has long characterised Karachi’s organised crime trials, where intimidation makes witness testimony difficult.In April 2017, a new dimension emerged when the Pakistan Army took custody of Uzair to try him under military law. He was accused of espionage and leaking sensitive information to a foreign intelligence agency, reportedly linked to Iran. In April 2020, a military court sentenced him to 12 years in prison on espionage charges, marking a significant shift in how the state officially characterized him—not merely as a gang leader, but as a potential national security threat.Pakistani officials and segments of local media have occasionally linked Uzair’s alleged intelligence connections to the controversial case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Indian national sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court in 2017. One strand of narrative suggests that Uzair’s alleged contacts in Iran overlapped with networks also linked to Jadhav. However, India has rejected Pakistan’s claims in the Jadhav case as coerced and unsubstantiated, and publicly verifiable evidence connecting Uzair directly to operational support for Jadhav remains limited.What is clearer is that, from the perspective of the Pakistani state, Uzair Baloch’s profile evolved from that of a gang leader embedded in local politics to an alleged cross-border security risk—reshaping the narrative around Lyari’s gangs and their significance.As violence worsened and Lyari began drawing national and even international scrutiny, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) gradually shifted its stance on the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC). Between 2012 and 2013, amid pressure from rival parties, security agencies and media coverage, the PPP formally disowned the PAC, despite years of visible proximity.Senior party leaders later framed PAC figures as rogue actors or products of state neglect, arguing that they were not part of a deliberate political strategy. Critics, however—including journalists, residents and some researchers—contend that the PPP benefitted for years from PAC’s armed control of Lyari, only distancing itself once the political and reputational costs became unsustainable.This distancing reflected a broader shift: as the state redefined Lyari’s gangs from political intermediaries to security liabilities, political actors recalibrated their alliances. What had once been an informal partnership built on patronage and vote control became a liability in the age of counterterrorism and international scrutiny.Security indicators suggest that overt gang violence in Lyari has dropped sharply since the mid-2010s. Rangers-led operations, the removal or incarceration of key gang leaders such as Rehman, Uzair and Baba Ladla, and broader counter-terror campaigns have reduced the frequency of armed clashes and targeted killings in the area.The legacy of the Lyari gang war remains unfinished. For many families, the years of kidnappings, torture, blockades and forced recruitment left deep social and economic scars. Questions continue to surround extrajudicial killings, disappearances and the conduct of both the gangs and state agencies tasked with fighting them. Although large armed networks have been dismantled, traces of informal control and low-level criminality persist in new forms.At the same time, Lyari’s cultural and political identity is evolving again. The football grounds, community schools and cultural centres that once defined the neighbourhood are re-emerging, even as residents remain wary of new power brokers. In popular culture, recent portrayals such as Dhurandhar and other planned projects reflect an enduring public fascination with Lyari—its blurred boundaries between criminal groups, political actors and state security agencies, and the unanswered questions they leave behind.Seen in retrospect, the gang war was not merely the story of violent figures in a marginalised settlement. It grew out of structural inequality, weak state institutions and a political party’s reliance on armed intermediaries to protect its vote bank. As militancy and regional intelligence rivalries later intersected with local crime networks, a neighbourhood built from labour and sport became entangled in national security narratives.Lyari today is quieter, but its past continues to shape how residents understand politics, policing and protection. The names of Rehman Dakait, Uzair Baloch, Baba Ladla and Arshad Pappu remain part of local memory—sometimes condemned as criminals, sometimes recalled as flawed protectors, always as evidence of how quickly a working-class community can become a battleground when crime, politics and security policy converge.","Karachi’s Lyari has long been associated with a dual identity. To its residents, it is the ‘mother of Karachi’ – powered by dockworkers, truck drivers, boxers and footballers. To the rest of Pakistan, especially through the 1990s and 2000s, it came to signify something very different: a “mini Brazil” of football- obsessed alleys, heavily armed gangs, and extortion rackets. It is this layered, contradictory Lyari that Aditya Dhar's recent 'Dhurandhar' turns into cinema.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125768364,imgsize-87724,width-400,resizemode-4/lyari-gang-war.jpg"

Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain on Wednesday said it is “strategically possible” for Dhaka to join a regional grouping with Pakistan that excludes India, amid signals from Islamabad about forming a new trilateral initiative with China and Bangladesh.Responding to a question at the foreign ministry, he said, “It is possible for us (Bangladesh) strategically … (but) it is not possible for Nepal or Bhutan to form a grouping with Pakistan excluding India.”His remarks follow Pakistan deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar’s recent statement at the ‘Islamabad Conclave’ that discussions had begun on a trilateral initiative involving Pakistan, China and Bangladesh, which could later expand.Touhid said Dar “has said something, and perhaps at some point this could see some progress,” adding that he had no further comment as he had only seen the information in media reports.He also addressed other ongoing diplomatic issues, noting that the process to lift US sanctions on the rapid action battalion (RAB) is in progress. He highlighted “significant progress” in the elite force’s operations over the past 15 years and reiterated the government’s commitment to preventing human rights violations, abductions and extrajudicial killings.Asked about the possibility of sanctions targeting Bangladeshi leaders after August 5, he dismissed the likelihood, saying he had not seen any allegations suggesting such risks. He added that discussions with the United States on the general security of military information agreement (GSOMIA) were continuing.On high visa refusal rates for Bangladeshi students and applicants, the adviser said many cases stemmed from forged documents submitted during the visa process.Earlier in June reacting to a trilateral meeting between Pakistan, China and Bangladesh and potential grouping, the ministry of external affairs had said, ""We maintain a constant watch on the developments in our neighbourhood that have a bearing on our interests and our security, our relations with individual countries, while they stand on their own footing, take into account the evolving context as well.""",Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain on Wednesday said it is “strategically possible” for Dhaka to join a regional grouping with Pakistan that excludes India.

Afghanistan FM Muttaqi Defends India Ties, Slams Pakistan Over Deoband Row And Shifting Accusations





Four 'Peaky Blinders' fans in Afghanistan were detained by the Taliban for adopting a style they said was “in conflict with Afghan values.” According to officials, the men were summoned by the Taliban’s department of vice and virtue after dressing in outfits inspired by the TV series.A video shared on Instagram invited this action from the Taliban government for ""promoting foreign culture"", according to the Taliban spokesperson. Saiful Islam Khyber, spokesperson of Taliban's department of vice and virtue, said, ""Even jeans would be acceptable, but the values in the Peaky Blinders series are against Afghan culture,"" BBC reported.The men, all in their twenties and residents of Jibrail in Herat province, appeared in several videos that highlighted their distinct fashion style. These videos, according to Taliban officials, were the basis for summoning them.Khyber stated that a rehabilitation centre was set up for the group, where they were not arrested but advised and ultimately released. He described the process as a corrective measure aimed at preventing the spread of what authorities view as foreign or inappropriate influences.“They were promoting foreign culture and imitating British actors in Herat, arrested, and a rehabilitation program started for them,” he said.Khyber explained that their clothing lacked any connection to Afghan identity and that their gestures and poses mirrored British actors, which he argued was unacceptable in a Muslim society with its own longstanding traditions.“We have our own religious and cultural values, and especially for clothing, we have specific traditional styles,” he said. “The clothing they wore has no Afghan identity at all and does not match our culture. Secondly, their actions were an imitation of actors from a British movie. Our society is Muslim. If we are to follow or imitate someone, we should follow our righteous religious predecessors in good and lawful matters. ”Before their detention, the four friends had appeared on a YouTube channel to discuss their unconventional style. They described how they were initially unsure about public reactions but soon found that many people appreciated their fashion choices.“At first we were hesitant, but once we went outside, people liked our style, stopped us in the streets and wanted to take photos with us,” one of the men said, according to CNBC.","Taliban detained four 'Peaky Blinders' fans in Afghanistan for 'promoting foreign culture' The men, all in their twenties, appeared in several videos that highlighted their distinct fashion style.

What charges did Hunter Biden face before father and US President Joe pardoned him?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-charges-did-hunter-biden-face-before-father-and-us-president-joe-pardoned-him/articleshow/115881306.cms,"Gun charges



Tax violations



US President Joe Biden has granted his son, Hunter Biden, a full and unconditional pardon, reversing his earlier stance of not intervening in his son’s legal matters. The pardon, announced on Sunday, covers federal gun and tax charges Hunter Biden faced for offences committed between January 1, 2014, and December 1, 2024, including all offences charged or prosecuted (including any that have resulted in convictions) by Special Counsel David Weiss.In June, Hunter Biden was convicted in Delaware on three felony counts related to his purchase of a firearm in 2018. He had falsely claimed on his gun-purchase form that he was not using illicit drugs at the time. The charges stemmed from a lengthy investigation into Hunter’s actions, which were tied to his personal struggles with addiction. Despite these circumstances, the case was pursued in federal court, resulting in a conviction.President Biden defended his son’s actions, claiming that such cases are typically resolved without criminal penalties, especially when drug addiction is involved. Hunter Biden, who Joe Biden claimed has been sober for over five years, faced these charges while in recovery.In September, Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to nine tax offences, related to over $1.4 million in unpaid taxes from income he spent on lavish expenses, including escorts, drugs, and cars. The charges were filed after a lengthy investigation started in 2018. Hunter’s legal team argued that he was unfairly targeted by Republicans, with some suggesting the case was politically motivated to damage Joe Biden’s presidential campaign. The pardon granted by Joe Biden eliminates any possibility of Hunter facing prison time for these tax violations.President Biden’s decision to pardon his son and use of executive authority has been met with mixed reactions, but he maintained that Hunter was subjected to unfair prosecution. “Hunter was treated differently,” the president said, pointing to political motives behind the charges.","US President Joe Biden has granted his son, Hunter Biden, a full and unconditional pardon.

"In U-turn, US president Joe Biden pardons son Hunter Biden in gun, tax fraud charges",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-hope-americans-will-understand-in-u-turn-us-president-joe-biden-pardons-son-hunter-in-gun-tax-fraud-charges/articleshow/115881097.cms,"US President Joe Biden pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, for gun and tax fraud charges. The pardon covers federal crimes Hunter Biden may have committed between January 1, 2014, and December 1, 2024. Hunter Biden faced sentencing in December for tax and gun convictions. The decision comes as a U-turn as Biden had repeatedly said he would not use his presidential authority to pardon his son, as reported by CNN.The pardon prevents Hunter Biden from being sentenced or imprisoned for crimes. The scheduled court hearings will likely be canceled. The pardon also covers the period when Hunter Biden served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma, a position that drew scrutiny over foreign business dealings.“Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter,” the president said. The White House confirmed it is a “full and unconditional pardon.” This action reverses Biden’s previous statements that he would not pardon his son.Hunter Biden was found guilty in June of illegally purchasing and possessing a firearm, with the trial focusing on his struggles with drug addiction and family issues. In September, he admitted to nine tax violations for failing to pay taxes on $1.4 million in income, which he spent on things like escorts, strippers, cars, and drugs. Hunter's lawyers argued that he was being unfairly targeted by Trump and other Republican lawmakers. Hunter's lawyers had claimed that he was being targeted by Trump and other congressional Republicans.The two charges stemmed from a probe started in 2018 by then-US Attorney David Weiss who filed indictments in 2023.President Biden said he pardoned Hunter Biden because he believes his son was unfairly prosecuted. “Hunter was treated differently” from others who commit similar crimes, the president said. He also asserted that political opponents used the charges to attack him. “I hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision,” he said.""I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,"" President Biden said in Sunday's statement.""The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election,"" he added.""I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.""The pardon comes as criminal cases against President-elect Trump have come to a standstill after a sweeping ruling on presidential immunity by the Supreme Court -- all but ensuring Biden's Republican rival will likely never see a jail cell, even after his landmark conviction for falsifying business records in May.A White House official said president Biden felt his son was targeted to hurt him politically. “He feels Hunter was targeted in order for his political opponents to hurt him and that was cruel and he endured enough,” the official explained. President Biden spent Thanksgiving with his family, including Hunter, before announcing the pardon.One factor that influenced the president’s decision was his belief that his political opponents were trying to ""break Hunter,"" especially while he was recovering from addiction. The president highlighted his son's five and a half years of sobriety, despite facing constant attacks and unfair treatment.He said he struggled with the decision but made up his mind over the weekend.“No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son – and that is wrong,” Biden said.Meanwhile, president-elect Donald Trump has condemned outgoing President Joe Biden's decision to pardon his son, Hunter Biden, calling it a “miscarriage of justice.”“Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years? Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social, hinting at potential pardons for the January 6 rioters once he assumes office.","US President Joe Biden pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, for gun and tax fraud charges.

'Our brand is toxic': Former US Democratic lawmaker calls for 'complete reset' of party after Harris loss to Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/our-brand-is-toxic-former-us-democratic-lawmaker-calls-for-complete-reset-of-party-after-harris-loss-to-trump/articleshow/115879612.cms,"Former US Democratic lawmaker Tim Ryan urged the party to “rebrand” on Saturday, calling the party’s image “toxic” in many areas. Speaking on MSNBC's ""The Weekend,"" Ryan argued the party needs a major overhaul after President-elect Donald Trump 's victory over vice president Kamala Harris “You start with a complete reset. We need a rebrand. I think you and I have been talking about this since 2016, like, our brand is toxic in so many places and it is like, you are a Democrat? That’s the stuff we get like in Ohio.

He believed the party hadn’t offered enough to voters in the political middle ground who were reluctant to vote for Trump.Ryan suggested the Democrats should focus on policies that resonate with working-class voters , like reindustrialization and American competitiveness. He questioned the party’s stance against the crypto industry and called for a return to “bread and butter policies.” He contrasted his view with a focus solely on redistribution.Ryan cited former President Bill Clinton’s campaign as a model for the party moving forward, saying, “The other thing that I think is really big, we can’t be for solely redistribution. It is about getting back to you want — it is the Bill Clinton campaign. It is the modern Democratic campaign. Look at the touchstone.

Senator Bernie Sanders believes the party’s losses stem from abandoning the working class. However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi disagreed with Sanders’ assessment. “With all due respect, and I have a great deal of respect for him [Sanders], for what he stands for, but I don't respect him saying that the Democratic Party has abandoned the working class families.

Japan is prosecuting a teenager who fell from the rooftop of a shopping centre and landed on a pedestrian below, resulting in the death of both, Japan Today reported.The incident occurred on August 31 this year, when a 17-year-old girl from Japan's Chiba Prefecture went to an open space on the 12th floor of the NEWoMan shopping complex above Yokohama Station. She climbed over a 2.5-meter glass barrier surrounding the public area and jumped from the building in the afternoon.The 17-year-old student landed on 32-year-old Chikako Chiba, who was walking with friends. Both were taken to the hospital, where the teenager died first, followed by Chiba about three hours later.Investigators believe the teenager’s fall was a suicide, though the reason is unclear. The teenager has been charged posthumously with ""gross negligence resulting in death"". Yokohama police said that the student was aware of the potential danger to pedestrians below.The decision to prosecute the teenager has sparked debate, with critics questioning the value of prosecuting someone who is deceased. A comment on Japan Today described the action as ""peak government ridiculousness.""Japan has the highest suicide rate among teenagers in the G7 countries and records more suicides by minors on September 1 than on any other day in the calendar year.

Meghan will now fully focus on her career but her jam brand American Riviera Orchard could not procure a trademark because of some issues with the filing. Meghan was given three months to address the errors in the application in August.

Who is Massad Boulos?



What is Boulos role in Trump campaign?



Who are there in his family members?



US President-elect Donald Trump appointed his daughter Tiffany Trump 's father-in-law and a Lebanese-born billionaire Massad Boulos as senior adviser for Arab and Middle Eastern affairs .Trump announced via Truth Social, commending Boulos's legal expertise and his dedication to Middle Eastern peace initiatives.""I am proud to announce that Massad Boulos will serve as Senior Advisor to the President on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs. Massad is an accomplished lawyer and a highly respected leader in the business world, with extensive experience on the International scene,"" Trump wrote. ""Massad is a dealmaker, and an unwavering supporter of PEACE in the Middle East. He will be a strong advocate for the United States, and its interests.""This is for the second time, a family member has been assigned with a role in Trump's new cabinet. Earlier, Trump offered a position in his administration to Charles Kushner, his daughter Ivanka’s father-in-law, to serve as ambassador to France.Trump has long turned to his family members to serve in political roles, raising questions about conflicts of interest and nepotism.Born in Lebanon, Boulos relocated to Texas during his teenage years to study at the University of Houston. His professional journey began in Nigeria, where he advanced to leadership positions at SCOA Motors and Boulos Enterprises, Newsweek reported.Reports about Boulos's political involvement in Lebanon have been contested. While some sources suggested he contested a parliamentary seat in 2009 and maintained connections with Lebanon's Christian political establishment, Boulos clarified to Newsweek that he holds no party affiliations, though he acknowledges acquaintance with Christian leaders.During a June interview with AP, Boulos acknowledged his friendship with Suleiman Frangieh, who leads the Marada Movement and received Hezbollah's endorsement for the Lebanese presidency. Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah, who supported Frangieh's candidacy in 2023, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut in September.Before the election last month, Boulos played a major unofficial role in the Trump campaign, courting Arab American voters who Republican strategists hoped would support Trump out of frustration with President Biden’s support for Israel. Despite Trump’s own defiantly pro-Israel policies during his first term as president, Boulos worked to build support for him in heavily Arab American and Muslim corners of Michigan, New York Times reported.Although there are very less information about his private space, but his connection with Donald Trump is surely on every internet posts. Boulos' son Michael is married to Tiffany Trump in 2022. Boulos has recently focused on garnering Arab American support for Trump's campaign, particularly in Michigan. Sources indicate he has also facilitated communications between Trump and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.","Lebanese-born billionaire Massad Boulos appointed as senior adviser for Arab and Middle Eastern affairs.

Expert calls for alternatives to euthanasia

Allegations of premeditated euthanasia

Legal and public backlash

The euthanasia of ' Peanut ', a social-media-famous pet squirrel, and Fred, a rescued raccoon, by New York State’s Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), has drawn sharp criticism from experts and animal rights advocates.As per the New York Post, infectious disease specialist Dr Edward R. Rensimer described the decision as “insane,” arguing that the odds of either animal having rabies were “virtually zero.”Peanut and Fred were seized from Mark Longo’s upstate animal sanctuary in October, allegedly for being housed without permits.According to the DEC, the action was necessitated after Peanut reportedly bit an agent on the thumb through protective gloves. However, Dr Rensimer, who has been studying rabies for decades, pointed out that no documented cases of squirrel-to-human rabies transmission exist in the United States.“Some animals almost never get rabies,” he said, citing a New York State Department of Health fact sheet.Dr Rensimer criticised the DEC’s approach, suggesting that quarantining the animals for 10 days to monitor for symptoms would have been a more rational response.He further noted that rabies symptoms typically manifest within a specific timeframe in animals like cats, dogs, and ferrets, making the immediate decapitation of Peanut and Fred for rabies testing unnecessary.Fred, a young raccoon found in poor condition months ago, had been under Longo’s care for an extended period, while Peanut had lived with him for seven years.According to Dr Rensimer, this timeline made the likelihood of either animal being rabid extremely low. He also emphasised that rabies immunisation for the allegedly bitten DEC agent could have neutralised any potential risk.Adding to the controversy, The New York Post reported that the DEC had allegedly planned to euthanise the animals at least a week before the supposed bite incident. The DEC has not provided evidence of the bite nor explained why less invasive alternatives were not pursued.Test results later confirmed that neither animal was rabid.Mark Longo, devastated by the loss of Peanut and Fred, described the raid on his sanctuary, Peanut’s Freedom Farm, as excessive, taking five hours and involving multiple officers. ""You need that many officers to literally pull my closets apart?"" he said in a video on Instagram, where he also mourned the loss of Peanut.According to CBS News, Longo had been in the process of obtaining the necessary permits to comply with state regulations. “We were ready to comply... We needed a little bit of guidance from the DEC,” he said. Longo’s attorney, Nora Constance Marino, called the euthanasia “outrageous” and suggested that officials acted without considering humane alternatives.Animal rights activists have rallied behind Longo, with tens of thousands signing an online petition demanding justice for Peanut. Meanwhile, Longo has filed a legal claim against the state, seeking answers for what he calls a senseless killing.Dr Rensimer also questioned the DEC’s intentions, saying, “It sounds more to me like they had an agenda and created a fact basis around it rather than doing the right thing.”","Peanut and Fred were seized from Mark Longo’s upstate animal sanctuary in October, allegedly for being housed without permits.

Indian-origin American entrepreneur and Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy has again shared his remarks on the US immigration system being broken, which he claims incentivises dishonesty.Responding to a viral TikTok podcast clip, Ramaswamy took to X (formerly Twitter) to voice his concerns.""The #1 human attribute that our immigration system currently rewards isn’t your intelligence, willingness to work hard, or your love of America. It’s your willingness to lie to the US government . That must change & it will,"" he wrote.The viral clip features Ramaswamy discussing the challenges within the current immigration framework. He asserted that the system unfairly rewards dishonesty, particularly in the asylum process .""If you're somebody coming from another country and you can't in good conscience say you're seeking asylum under threat of imminent bodily harm due to race or religion, because it’s not true, you won’t get it.

Patel’s push for declassification

Kash Patel’s appointment as FBI chief

In the wake of President-elect Donald Trump’s appointment of Kash Patel as the new Director of the FBI, a social media post advocating for declassification of controversial documents has gone viral, garnering support from none other than Elon Musk.The conversation began when a user on platform X (formerly Twitter) shared a screenshot of an article quoting Patel’s recent call for “massive declassification” of sensitive documents, including the infamous “Epstein list” and the lesser-known “Diddy list.”The user captioned the post simply with “Do it.” Musk amplified the call by sharing the post and replying, “Yes”.Kash Patel, a key Trump aide and national security figure, has urged in the past to release information linked to Jeffrey Epstein and Sean “Diddy” Combs, asserting that the American people deserve transparency.The “Epstein list” allegedly details individuals connected to the disgraced financier, while the “Diddy list” reportedly involves links to entertainment and political elites.According to Econotimes, Patel’s statements emphasised the need for truth, stating that “the truth must come out, no matter how uncomfortable.”Musk’s endorsement of the call has amplified public interest, further igniting the conversation around transparency and the implications of Patel’s tenure at the FBI.Known for his vocal stance on free speech and governmental accountability, Musk’s single-word response, “Yes,” has been interpreted as a significant nod toward the demand for unveiling these controversial records.Trump’s decision to appoint Patel as FBI chief likely represents his intention to overhaul the bureau’s operations.Trump in a statement on Truth Social praised Patel’s record, citing his efforts to expose corruption, champion accountability, and defend the Constitution. Patel’s career, marked by his roles in counterterrorism and intelligence during Trump’s first term, has been both influential and controversial, with critics pointing to his combative rhetoric against political and media adversaries.As Patel prepares to take charge of the FBI, the growing calls for transparency—now amplified by Musk—signal potential shifts in how sensitive information is handled. Whether this will result in the declassification of the so-called Epstein and Diddy lists, remains to be seen.","Kash Patel, a key Trump aide and national security figure, has urged in the past to release information linked to Jeffrey Epstein and Sean “Diddy” Combs.

Donald Trump warns Brics it will lose access to US if it dumps dollar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-warns-brics-it-will-lose-access-to-us-if-it-dumps-dollar/articleshow/115869354.cms,"TOI Correspondent from Washington

: US President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday demanded a ""commitment"" from Brics nations, which includes China, India, and Russia , that they will not seek to create a new currency or back any other currency to replace the ""mighty"" US dollar , failing which he warned they would face 100 per cent tariffs and be denied access to the ""wonderful"" US economy.The provocation for Trump's sudden tirade was not immediately clear, but several skeptics of the long-term viability of the US economy based on the dollar's dominance have discreetly begun exploring other currencies and methods for global trade. The move is driven by Russia, which is suffering from crippling US sanctions, and China, which hopes to displace the US as the pre-eminent power in the world.The expanded Brics alliance includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran & United Arab Emirates. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have applied to become members and several other countries have expressed interest in joining the grouping which now accounts for 35 per cent of the global economy based on purchasing power parity, overtaking the 30 per cent share of the G7 developed nations in recent months.In an abrupt social media post without preamble, Trump appeared to fire a warning shot against the group's recent deliberations on ""de-dollarisation,"" saying, ""the idea that the Brics Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER.""""They can go find another “sucker!” There is no chance that the Brics will replace the US Dollar in International Trade, and any Country that tries should wave goodbye to America,"" Trump said, adding that the US requires ""a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new Brics Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty US Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US Economy.""The dollar’s unique status and primacy rests on the perception of America being a stable, reliable bedrock of global politics and business, something that is being called into question in recent years in the face of mounting US debts and deficits, and political uncertainty and gridlock. Despite challenges, the dollar continues to reign supreme, accounting for more than 58.36% of official foreign exchange reserves across the world because of its scale and liquidity, and the perception of US as a stable society with a mature economy. The euro is currently the second most commonly held reserve currency, representing about 20% of international foreign currency reserves.Most US experts see no immediate threat to the dollar. The last time the world switched its reserve currency from the British pound to the American dollar some 80 years ago, the transition was relatively seamless because the US and UK were allies, but even with the adversarial relationship Washington faces with Beijing and Moscow, they reckon the dollar is safe although Trump's sudden ferment suggests he sees some discomfort as he comes into office for a second term.","US President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday demanded a ""commitment"" from Brics nations that they will not seek to create a new currency or back any other currency to replace the ""mighty"" US dollar.

PESHAWAR: The death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surged to 130, with at least six people killed and eight injured on Sunday, as clashes in the volatile Kurram district continued for the eleventh consecutive day.The clashes between Alizai and Bagan tribes in the district started on November 22, after an attack on a convoy of passenger vans near Parachinar in which 47 people were killed a day earlier. Several passengers who had sustained grave injuries succumbed later, raising the toll in the convoy killing to 57.Police said the situation remained tense, and violence persists despite a recent ceasefire agreement between the Sunni and Shia groups.The six new deaths reported on Sunday brought the death toll to 130, while the total number of injured rose to 186 after eight fresh injuries were reported.The 10-day truce brokered last week has been rendered ineffective by intermittent violence, which shows no signs of abating.A high-powered delegation, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry and IGP Akhtar Hayat Gandapur, had also negotiated a ceasefire last weekend, but violence resumed shortly afterwards.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi earlier planned to dispatch members of the grandpeace jirga (council of tribal leaders) from Kohat division to Kurram for engaging with leaders from both warring factions to negotiate peace.Addressing a gathering of political leaders and tribal elders in Kohat on Sunday, he called for strict action with public cooperation to make the region weapon-free through joint operations.He said he was ready to go to Kurram and stay there for as many days as the jirga suggested to ensure peace in the region.""No other country or province will resolve our issues. We must take responsibility for improving the situation ourselves,"" he said.Kundi announced an All-Parties Conference (APC) for peace and the province's rights and invited Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur to join it.The governor stressed the role of religious scholars in promoting peace, urging them to focus on unity.Several other leaders addressed the gathering, putting aside their ideological differences on other issues.The continued violence forced the closure of the main Peshawar-Parachinar Road for travel, and commuting at the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border has also been suspended.The closure of the main arteries has created a scarcity of oil, food commodities and medicines in the region.The Kurram region is also experiencing a communication blackout, with mobile and internet services suspended and educational institutions closed.Police and other security forces personnel had been deployed in various parts of Lower Kurram, said Deputy Commissioner Javed Ullah Mehsud, adding that all-out efforts will be made for a truce in other areas today as well.""We are hopeful for progress on a ceasefire and reopening of transport routes,"" he stated.Previous efforts to mediate peace, including a seven-day truce brokered by provincial officials in November have failed to hold.","Death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surges to 130.

Pakistani authorities are seeking to arrest Bushra Bibi, the wife of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan , for failing to appear in court in an alleged corruption case involving 190 million pounds.Authorities attempted to arrest Bibi at her residence in Peshawar on November 23, but the attempt was unsuccessful as she was not present when the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) team and police arrived, according to a PTI report.An accountability court issued non-bailable warrants for Bibi on November 22 after she missed eight court hearings. The warrants led the NAB to dispatch a team to arrest her. Bibi currently resides in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where Khan's political party, PTI, holds power.Both Khan and Bibi face accusations of misusing 50 billion Pakistani Rupees (190 million pounds).

Instead, authorities claim they were used for the personal benefit of the businessman who helped Bibi and Khan establish a university.Bibi, a trustee of the Al-Qadir Trust , is accused of benefiting from the settlement and acquiring 458 kanals of land for Al-Qadir University in Jhelum.

Bangladesh wants to renegotiate Adani power deal unless court cancels,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-wants-to-renegotiate-adani-power-deal-unless-court-cancels/articleshow/115882639.cms,"DHAKA: Bangladesh wants to sharply lower prices under a power purchase deal with India's embattled Adani Group unless it is cancelled by a court, which has called for an investigation into the 25-year deal, its de facto energy minister told Reuters on Sunday.Adani Group founder Gautam Adani is already facing allegations by U.S. authorities that he was part of a $265 million bribery scheme in India, charges he has denied, even as one Indian state reviews a power deal with the group and France's TotalEnergies pauses its investments.In Bangladesh, based on an appeal by a lawyer demanding the power deal's potential cancellation, the High Court last week ordered a committee of experts to examine the contract under which Adani supplies power from a $2 billion coal-fired plant in eastern India. The investigation is expected to be concluded by February, when the court is due to make its order.The deal was signed in 2017 by Adani and a government entity under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted this year amid a popular uprising and accusations of widespread corruption. Supply from the 1,600 megawatt plant, which uses expensive imported coal, started last year and meets about a tenth of Bangladesh's consumption.""Renegotiate in case of anomalies in the contract. Cancel only in case of irregularities such as corruption and bribery,"" Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan, Bangladesh's power and energy adviser, said in an interview in his office.""Both based on the findings of the court-ordered investigations.""He said some issues, such as Bangladesh not benefiting from some Indian tax exemptions to the power plant, have already been flagged to Adani and could partly form the basis of a deal renegotiation.Adani did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the weekend. Adani Power Ltd said in its latest annual report that the plant in India's Jharkhand state would provide Bangladesh uninterrupted, reliable and affordable electricity and ""significantly reduce the average cost"" for the end consumer.Khan said the U.S. corruption allegations against Adani themselves may not have any bearing on the Bangladeshi deal.A separate committee formed by Bangladesh's interim government is already probing the Adani deal and six other power contracts with the aim to ensure the investigations ""will be acceptable in international negotiations and arbitration"", said a government statement.At 14.02 taka a unit, Adani charged the highest rate for Indian-generated power to Bangladesh in the 2022/23 fiscal year, compared with an average price of 8.77 taka ($0.0737), according to the state-run Bangladesh Power Development Board.Adani's rate fell to 12 taka a unit in 2023/24, still 27% higher than the rate of India's other private producers and as much as 63% more than Indian state-owned plants, Reuters has reported.The retail price in Bangladesh is 8.95 taka per unit, which results in an annual power subsidy bill of 320 billion taka for the exchequer, Khan said.""Because the prices are high, the government has to subsidise,"" Khan said. ""We would like power prices, not only from Adani, to come down below the average retail prices.""Bangladesh, however, will keep paying for the power it is importing from Adani, he said. The company had recently halved its supply because of a delay in payment.Khan said Bangladesh has enough domestic capacity to meet its needs, though some plants are currently idle or generating below capacity because of a shortage of gas or other reasons.""When Adani cut their supply to half, nothing happened,"" he said. ""We will not allow any power producer to blackmail us.""",Bangladesh wants to sharply lower prices under a power purchase deal with India's Adani Group unless it is cancelled by a court. The deal was signed in 2017 by Adani and a government entity under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. A court has called for an investigation into the 25-year deal.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115882687,imgsize-1388700,width-400,resizemode-4/115882687.jpg"

The panel was headed by economist Debapriya Bhattacharya.Yunus said the report should be published once it is finalised and be a part of national college and university curricula. ""This is a historic document. It will show us the economy we inherited after the July-Aug mass uprising,"" he said. ""Our blood curdles to know how they plundered the economy. The sad part is they looted the economy openly,"" he said, adding that even multilateral agencies that monitor the economy were also largely silent when this plunder took place.Bhattacharya said the panel worked independently.","The committee on ""White Paper on the State of the Bangladesh Economy "" submitted its report to chief adviser Muhammad Yunus.

Bangladesh HC acquits Zia’s son in 2004 grenade attack cases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-hc-acquits-zias-son-in-2004-grenade-attack-cases/articleshow/115877079.cms,"DHAKA: Bangladesh high court on Sunday acquitted all the accused in the Aug 21, 2004, grenade attack cases, including BNP acting chairperson Tarique Rahman and former state minister Lutfozzaman Babar.The ruling has sparked renewed hope among BNP supporters for Rahman's return from London after overcoming remaining legal issues.Rahman is former PM Khaleda Zia 's son and could become Bangladesh's next PM if Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is voted into power.The 2004 attack targeted an anti-terrorism rally organised by the Awami League at Bangabandhu Avenue. The Awami League claims that the primary target was Sheikh Hasina , who was the leader of the opposition at the time, under the BNP-Jamaat alliance govt.The attack claimed the lives of at least 24 people, including Awami League's women's affairs secretary Ivy Rahman, who was also the wife of late President Zillur Rahman. Over 300 others were injured, and Hasina, though surviving the attack, suffered permanent hearing impairment.The high court also annulled a lower court's verdict, which had convicted 49 individuals in connection with the attack. The court declared the trial court's 2018 decision illegal, noting it had been delivered in an improper manner.The lower court's conviction had relied on the confessional statement of Mufti Abdul Hannan, an accused who was later executed in a separate matter. The HC ruled that his testimony lacked evidential value, as it had been obtained under duress and wasn't properly examined by the magistrate.BNP hailed the move and accused Awami League of using state power to unjustly convict Rahman and other leaders.","Bangladesh high court on Sunday acquitted all the accused in the Aug 21, 2004, grenade attack cases.

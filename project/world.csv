US President Donald Trump was presented with Olympic medals from the 1984 Los Angeles Games on Tuesday by Casey Wasserman, chairman of the LA28 organising committee.During the exchange, Trump joked, “Can I say that I won them athletically? That would be a great honour”He later thanked Wasserman through a post on Truth Social, saying, “Thank you to Casey Wasserman, Chairman of 2028 LA Olympics…”The medal presentation took place at a White House event where Trump later signed an executive order establishing a presidential task force for the 2028 Olympic Games, which will be hosted in Los Angeles.Calling the event a “wonderful moment for America,” Trump said, “The LA Olympics is shaping up to be a wonderful moment for America. It’s going to be incredible.

"Canada wildfire: Thick smoke chokes Midwest, Northeast US; air alerts widen",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/canada-wildfire-thick-smoke-chokes-midwest-northeast-us-air-alerts-widen/articleshow/123084098.cms,"



Thick smoke from hundreds of Canadian wildfires drifted across the border, causing hazy conditions over parts of the Midwest and northeastern United States on Sunday.According to government records, Canada is experiencing its second-worst wildfire season, with nearly 4,000 fires documented this year, NPR reported.The cross-border smoke has impacted air quality across several US states. Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota experienced concerning air quality levels this weekend. Air quality alerts were issued for parts of Illinois and Indiana.Authorities in New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine advised residents to reduce outdoor activities due to smoke pollution.Bob Oravec, National Weather Service Lead Forecaster, told NPR that current wind patterns are facilitating the movement of polluted air from Canada into the US.""Air is moving at all levels and a lot of times it'll move in the same direction through the whole depth of the atmosphere, so the smoke is rising into the winds and the winds just transport it downstream, like anything — like a leaf getting blown,"" Oravec explained.Minnesota's Pollution Control Agency extended its statewide air quality alert until noon on Monday, August 4th.According to Minnesota Public Radio, the state is experiencing its longest air quality alert since the agency began issuing alerts in 2008, expected to last seven days.Some areas of Minnesota saw improved conditions on Sunday. Earlier in the weekend, the agency predicted the air quality index (AQI) would reach the severe ""red"" level statewide, considered unhealthy for all residents.The Pollution Control Agency stated that even healthy individuals might experience symptoms including eye irritation, coughing, or breathing difficulties. They warned of more severe impacts for others.""Sensitive or more exposed individuals may experience more serious health effects, including worsening of existing heart or lung disease and respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, possibly leading to an asthma attack, heart attack, or stroke,"" according to the Pollution Control Agency statement.Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources extended air quality alerts until noon on Monday, August 4th, primarily in southeastern counties. Michigan officials also extended alerts across all counties through Monday.The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported over 700 active fires across Canada on Sunday, predominantly in southern Manitoba, north of Minnesota. Over 500 fires remain uncontrolled, forcing thousands of Canadians to evacuate.Canada has faced wildfires throughout the year. Two individuals perished in a southeastern Manitoba wildfire in May. Similar smoke conditions affected the US in June.Oravec suggests poor air quality could persist in US regions.""It looks like that pattern maintains itself going forward through this week, so it doesn't really appear to be any big break. There may be a day or so where there's a temporary break to it, but overall it looks like there is potential for additional smoke to be transported southeastward into the United States,"" he said.On Sunday afternoon, IQAir ranked Detroit, Chicago, and Minneapolis among the US cities with the most polluted air.","Smoke from hundreds of Canadian wildfires drifted across the border, causing hazy conditions over parts of the Midwest and northeastern U.S. Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota experienced concerning air quality levels this weekend.

US President Donald Trump administration has unveiled a new 12-month pilot program that could require foreign visitors applying for B‑1/B‑2 tourist or business visas to post a bond of up to $15,000, in an effort to curb visa overstays and improve vetting standards.""Aliens applying for visas as temporary visitors for business or pleasure (B-1/B-2) and who are nationals of countries identified by the Department as having high visa overstay rates, where screening and vetting information is deemed deficient, or offering Citizenship by Investment, if the alien obtained citizenship with no residency requirement, may be subject to the pilot program,"" the US department said in a Federal Register notice on Monday.""Consular officers may require covered nonimmigrant visa applicants to post a bond of up to $15,000 as a condition of visa issuance, as determined by the consular officers,"" the notice added.The Department said it will roll out the new 12-month visa bond pilot program, starting August 20 and it will remain in effect for one year from the date.While the program hasn't yet named target countries, India’s existing history of visa violations, particularly in overstay and screening lapses, could raise the risk of being included.According to a public notice posted on the Federal Register’s website, the program will require certain applicants for B-1/B-2 nonimmigrant visas, typically used for tourism or short-term business trips, to post refundable bonds of $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000.Eligible travelers include nationals from countries with high visa overstay rates, insufficient screening procedures, or offering “Citizenship by Investment” programs without residency requirements.The pilot program gives consular officers the discretion to determine bond amounts “sufficient enough to ensure the alien does not overstay,” while also factoring in the applicant’s individual circumstances.""The funds will be returned to travelers if they depart in accordance with the terms of their visas,"" the notice stated, emphasising that the bond is fully refundable upon compliance.While the notice did not name the countries included, it clarified that the list of covered nations will be announced at least 15 days before the program takes effect and could be updated throughout its duration.These will include countries with ""high visa overstay rates,"" and ""deficient screening and vetting information,"" or those offering citizenship-by-investment (CBI) programs where citizenship is granted without any residency requirements.The State Department said the pilot is not just about enforcement, but also intended as a ""tool of diplomacy"", encouraging foreign governments to tighten their internal security systems.""The pilot program is further designed to serve as a diplomatic tool to encourage foreign governments to take all appropriate actions to ensure robust screening and vetting for all citizens in matters of identity verification and public safety... and to encourage specified countries with visa overstays to ensure their nationals timely depart the United States after making temporary visits,"" it added.Quoting data from the Department of Homeland Security, the document noted that in fiscal year 2023, the US recorded over 500,000 suspected in-country overstays, individuals who remained beyond their authorized period of stay.This comes as tough immigration policies under Donald Trump continue to impact travel to the United States, with some international visitors opting to skip US trips altogether.Adding to traveler concerns, a new provision passed in July by the Republican-led US Congress introduces a $250 ""visa integrity fee"" for all approved non-immigrant visa applicants.

Russiagate: Tulsi Gabbard says Russia believed Hillary Clinton's 2016 victory 'inevitable'; claims Obama admin orchestrated hoax,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russiagate-tulsi-gabbard-says-russia-believed-hillary-clintons-2016-victory-inevitable-claims-obama-admin-orchestrated-hoax/articleshow/123084080.cms,"Tulsi Gabbard (PTI)





Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has claimed that Russian officials privately anticipated a Hillary Clinton victory was “inevitable” in the 2016 US presidential election, based on her assessment of recently released documents by her office.Speaking on Miranda Devine’s “Pod Force One” podcast, Gabbard has said that Russia had a strategy of undermining public trust in the American political system while preparing for a Clinton-based White House, despite the prevailing narrative that Russia was in support of Donald Trump “It surprised me that all of these documents still existed, quite frankly,” she said on an episode that is scheduled to release on Wednesday, reports the New York Post. “As we’ve learned in later documents that we’ve reviewed throughout that campaign, Russia believed that Hillary Clinton would win the election.“They felt it was inevitable,” she added.Tulsi Gabbard’s office last month began releasing a series of internal documents detailing how officials navigated the investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 elections.Among the disclosures was a 2020 House Intelligence Committee report, which alleged that Russian operatives may have obtained intelligence suggesting Hillary Clinton was “placed on a daily regimen of ‘heavy tranquilizers’” and was “afraid of losing.”“If Russia aspired to help Trump get elected, which is what the manufactured January 2017 intelligence community assessment says with high confidence, according to Brennan and Clapper, then Putin would have released the most damaging information and emails to help President Trump,” she said, questioning why the alleged Russian intelligence was never made public if Moscow truly had a goal to uplift Trump’s campaign.“It was intentionally withheld and not released because they assumed that Hillary Clinton would win that election, and their plan,” Gabbard said, reports the New York Post.Much of the material released by Gabbard focuses on challenging the findings of a 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA), which asserted, among other conclusions, that “the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.”Gabbard accused former President Obama of ordering the 2017 ICA of Russian interference in the 2016 election, highlighting the actions of his administration, outlined in the newly released documents.“Out of respect for the office of the presidency, our office does not normally dignify the constant nonsense and misinformation flowing out of this White House with a response. But these claims are outrageous enough to merit one,” a spokesperson for Obama said, slamming the revelations made by Gabbard.“These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction. Nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes,"" said the Spokesperson.","Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has claimed that Russian officials privately anticipated a Hillary Clinton victory was “inevitable” in the 2016 US presidential election. “It surprised me that all of these documents still existed, quite frankly,” she said on an episode that is scheduled to release on Wednesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123084128,imgsize-958982,width-400,resizemode-4/123084128.jpg"

Facing limited diplomatic options to resolve the hostage crisis, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is advocating for a “military solution” to secure the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas, an Israeli official was quoted as saying by ABC News on Sunday.Netanyahu has proposed expanding military operations in Gaza, aiming to use force to rescue approximately 20 hostages still believed to be alive since their capture during Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023.The official said that there is an increasing understanding within the Israeli leadership that Hamas is not interested in making a deal for the officials, reports ABC News.""Therefore, prime minister Netanyahu is pushing to expand military operations to release the hostages through a military solution,"" said the official.Tens of thousands gathered in the coastal city of Tel Aviv on Saturday to demand that Netanyahu’s government secure the release of the remaining hostages.""They are on the absolute brink of death,"" said Ilay David, the brother of Evyatar David, whose video was released by Hamas showing him in what he described as digging his own grave. ""In the current unimaginable condition, they may have only days left to live.""""The prime minister expressed profound shock over the materials distributed by the terror organisations Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and told the families that the efforts to return all our hostages are ongoing, and will continue constantly and relentlessly,"" Netanyahu’s office stated late Saturday.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday called on the International Committee of the Red Cross to assist with the hostages held in Gaza, reports AFP.Hamas’s armed wing responded by agreeing to grant the agency access to the hostages, but only on the condition that ""humanitarian corridors"" for food and aid are opened “across all areas of the Gaza Strip.""For months, humanitarian groups and international agencies have warned that Gaza is experiencing ""critical"" hunger levels, with famine ""imminent"" in some areas of the Gaza Strip.Gaza’s health ministry has also reported an increasing number of deaths linked to malnutrition.

Ex-DOGE employee ‘big balls’ assaulted in Washington DC: Why was he attacked; who was behind it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ex-doge-employee-edward-coristine-big-balls-assaulted-in-washington-dc-why-was-he-attacked-who-was-behind-it/articleshow/123130808.cms,"Attack on 'Big Balls': What happened



Trump threatens federal takeover of DC



City Officials Respond as juvenile crime surges







A former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee known online as “Big Balls” was violently attacked during an attempted carjacking in Washington DC early Sunday morning. Edward Coristine, the victim, was reportedly trying to protect a woman near their parked vehicle in the city’s Logan Circle neighbourhood when a group of teenagers approached and assaulted him.The incident occurred around 3 a.m. on Swann Street NW, according to the Metropolitan Police Department. Authorities said the suspects attempted to steal the vehicle and began beating Coristine when he intervened. Two 15-year-olds from Hyattsville, Maryland, a boy and a girl, were arrested on the scene and charged with unarmed carjacking. Several other suspects fled and remain at large.According to a police statement, the group approached Coristine and the woman near their vehicle and made a threat about taking the car. Coristine pushed the woman into the vehicle for her safety before confronting the group. Multiple attackers then allegedly beat him severely until nearby officers intervened, causing the group to flee. Coristine sustained injuries requiring treatment at the scene.Former DOGE chief Elon Musk chimed in claiming that a ""gang"" of about a dozen young men tried to assault a women causing Coristine to ""run in and defend her"". After which he was beaten ""to the point of concussion.""Images shared on social media by President Trump showed Coristine bloodied and sitting on the pavement following the assault.The New York Post further cited the police report identifying Coristine as the victim and detailing how he was struck after trying to fend off the attackers. The incident remains under investigation, with DC’s Carjacking Task Force and the FBI Washington Field Office involved.The attack has fuelled President Trump’s push to take federal control of the city. “Crime in Washington, D.C., is totally out of control,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, calling for minors as young as 14 to be tried as adults. “If D.C. doesn’t get its act together... we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City.”In remarks to reporters on Tuesday, Trump reiterated, “Either they’re going to straighten their act out... or we’re going to have to federalize and run it the way it’s supposed to be run.”The president has repeatedly claimed that DC’s current government is failing to curb youth violence and protect its citizens. He previously suggested federalising DC during a cabinet meeting in July, a move that would require congressional approval to repeal the 1973 Home Rule Act.District Attorney Brian Schwalb called the attack “horrific and disturbing,” adding that his office would prosecute juveniles when there is sufficient evidence. Jeanine Pirro, the US Attorney for DC, echoed Trump’s frustration, stating, “It’s time we start taking crime more seriously irrespective of the age of the criminal.”While violent crime in the district has declined overall, youth-led offences — particularly carjackings — remain a persistent issue. According to Fox5 DC, Coristine’s case follows a disturbing pattern: several recent carjackings in the capital have involved teenagers, including cases where children as young as 14 were implicated in fatal attacks.Locals continue to report feeling unsafe amid what many see as a breakdown in law enforcement’s ability to deter violent youth offenders. As NYPost highlighted, Washington’s juvenile arrest rate nearly doubles the national average, with more than 2,200 youth arrests annually between 2016 and 2022.The police have urged anyone with further information to contact the MPD tip line and are offering up to $10,000 for tips leading to further arrests in this case.","Edward Coristine, a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee known online as ‘Big Balls’ was violently attacked during an attempted carjacking in Washington DC early Sunday morning.

'Totally out of control': Trump calls for prosecuting minors amid Washington crime concerns; threatens to take federal control,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/totally-out-of-control-trump-calls-for-prosecuting-minors-amid-washington-crime-concerns-threatens-to-take-federal-control/articleshow/123127632.cms,"US President Donald Trump (Image credits AP)





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to place Washington, DC, under federal control, claiming the city’s crime is “totally out of control” and urging that minors as young as 14 be prosecuted as adults. His comments came the same day the FBI released new data showing a nationwide drop in violent crime.In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “Crime in Washington, DC, is totally out of control. Local ‘youths’ and gang members, some only 14, 15, and 16-years-old, are randomly attacking, mugging, maiming, and shooting innocent citizens, at the same time knowing that they will be almost immediately released.”While sharing a photo of a critically injured youth from a recent violent incident involving local teenagers, Trump claimed the victim had been “beaten mercilessly by local thugs,” though he did not provide specific details about the case.“The Law in DC must be changed to prosecute these ‘minors’ as adults, and lock them up for a long time, starting at age 14,” he added.Trump also suggested that if city leaders fail to act, he would move to federalise the capital. “They are not afraid of Law Enforcement because they know nothing ever happens to them, but it’s going to happen now! If DC doesn’t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run,” he said.Trump’s remarks directly contradict the FBI’s annual crime report, released earlier Tuesday. According to the report, cited by NBC News, violent crime in the US fell by 4.5% in 2024, with significant declines in murder, robbery, rape, and aggravated assault. Property crime and hate crime rates also saw drops compared to 2023.The report draws from data submitted by over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, covering 95% of the US population. FBI Assistant Director Timothy Ferguson noted during a media briefing that although crime is down overall, violent and property crimes still occur regularly.Trump has frequently made crime a central theme in his political messaging, often portraying American cities as lawless. At a campaign event near Detroit last year, he said, “You can’t walk across the street to get a loaf of bread. You get shot, you get mugged, you get raped,” according to NBC News.While crime remains a contentious political issue, particularly in major urban areas like Washington, DC, recent federal data indicates that overall trends are moving in the opposite direction of Trump’s claims.","US President Donald Trump threatened to place Washington, DC, under federal control.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday, while speaking about the impact of his administration’s immigration policies on the agricultural sector, claimed undocumented migrants are more “naturally” inclined to perform hard labor — a statement that many have condemned as racist and dehumanising.During an interview with CNBC, addressing the impact of his immigration policies on American agriculture, Trump acknowledged the difficulty farmers are facing in finding labor amid ongoing deportation efforts. “We can’t let our farmers not have anybody,” he said.He suggested that, while deportations would continue, some undocumented farm workers might be allowed to return legally under a “touchback” plan. “In some cases, we’re sending [migrants] back to their country with a pass back in legally.”“These [are] people that you can’t replace them very easily — you know, people that live in the inner city are not doing that work. They’re just not doing that work. And they’ve tried — we’ve tried, everybody tried. They don’t do it. These people do it naturally, naturally,” he added.Trump also recalled a recent conversation with a farmer about the physical demands of the job. “I said, ‘What happens if they get it — to a farmer the other day — what happens if they get a bad back?’ He said, ‘They don’t get a bad back, sir, because if they get a bad back, they die.’… You know, in many ways they’re very, very special people.”The remarks come as the White House continues to wrestle with how to address the agricultural sector’s reliance on undocumented workers without angering immigration hardliners.Officials are reportedly exploring ways to expand the H-2A visa program to year-round agricultural industries like dairy. But that change would fall short of covering the estimated 320,000 undocumented farm workers already in the US, reported Politico.Proposals like the touchback program are also drawing criticism from immigration hawks who oppose any form of legal return or special carveouts for specific industries, viewing them as a slippery slope toward amnesty","US President Donald Trump on Tuesday claimed undocumented migrants are more ‘naturally’ inclined to perform hard labor.

A University of California San Diego associate professor is under investigation after being confronted on video in an alleged online child predator sting. The video, widely circulated on social media, shows Nisarg Shah being accused of attempting to meet someone he believed to be a 14-year-old boy for sex.Shah, who teaches in the Aiiso Yufeng Li family department of chemical and nano engineering at UCSD’s Jacobs School of Engineering, was confronted on Saturday, inside a Pavilions grocery store in San Diego’s Hillcrest neighborhood.The sting was coordinated by online activists using Instagram handles @timjohnson.458 and @vans_against_predators, with the video watermarked by the group ""People v Preds,” reported San Diego Ville.Activist Tim Johnson, who claims to have exposed more than 500 suspected predators, confronted Shah over sexually explicit messages allegedly exchanged on the dating app Grindr. Screenshots shared by the group show Shah identifying himself as 28 years old and continuing to chat after the decoy disclosed they were “bout to be 15.”During the encounter, Shah repeatedly expressed remorse. “I feel horrible, the worst I’ve ever felt,” he says.He describes his conduct as “abhorrent” and admits to bringing personal lubricant and a douche, claiming it was to help the person “get ready” and “prep.” He adds, ""I need to maybe get help or something.”Two San Diego police department patrol cars arrived during the confrontation. An officer is seen in the video informing the activists that Shah would not be arrested at the time, stating he was “not allowed to arrest him” under the circumstances.Shah’s phone was seized, and evidence from the sting was turned over to the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task force. Although a photo shows Shah in handcuffs, he was reportedly released at the scene.When contacted by San Diego Ville, Shah responded through his attorney, “These are wrongful allegations and while I would have been willing to share my account, my attorney will not let me do so but he would be happy to speak with you.”In response to inquiries, SDPD Lt Travis Easter issued a statement, saying, “We are aware of the incident and our ICAC unit is actively investigating it. There have not been any charges made as of yet.UC San Diego also released a statement, “We have been made aware of the allegations against Nisarg J Shah. We will cooperate with all law enforcement agencies as needed during any investigation. The health, well-being and safety of our campus community members is our top priority. All allegations of sexual harassment and sexual violence are taken very seriously.”Shah is a specialist in immunoengineering and nanoscale materials. He earned his PhD from MIT and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University before joining UC San Diego, where he currently leads a research lab and teaches.The incident has sparked widespread backlash online, with many calling on the university to investigate and take disciplinary action.","Nisarg Shah, an associate professor at UC San Diego, is accused of trying to meet someone he believed to be a 14-year-old boy for sex.

'Antisemitism': Fema no longer requires states to oppose Israel boycotts; DHS confirms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/antisemitism-fema-no-longer-requires-states-to-oppose-israel-boycotts-dhs-confirms/articleshow/123125909.cms,"DHS representative image





The Trump administration has quietly removed a clause from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) guidelines that required states to maintain commercial ties with Israel in order to qualify for federal emergency funds.The clause, previously listed in the department of homeland security’s (DHS) internal terms and conditions, stated that states “must not support severing commercial relations, or otherwise limiting commercial relations specifically with Israeli companies or with companies doing business in or with Israel.”The condition was removed without public announcement on Monday.The reversal comes after mounting backlash and media scrutiny over the administration’s threat to withhold at least $1.9 billion in disaster relief from states and cities that support boycotts of Israel or Israeli firms. Fema funding is essential for states to manage natural disasters, support emergency operations, pay staff, and maintain critical equipment.DHS oversees Fema operations, and on Monday, agency spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed the policy shift, saying, “Fema grants remain governed by existing law and policy and not political litmus tests,” as quoted by Euro News.The clause appeared to target the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which seeks to apply economic pressure on Israel over its military actions in Gaza, now ongoing for more than 20 months.The DHS had previously referred to the BDS campaign as a “discriminatory prohibited boycott,” language that has now been removed from Fema’s updated guidelines, reported Euro News.“There is NO Fema requirement tied to Israel in any current NOFO. No states have lost funding, and no new conditions have been imposed,” DHS said in a post on X Tuesday.“DHS will enforce all anti-discrimination laws and policies, including as it relates to the BDS movement, which is expressly grounded in antisemitism. Those who engage in racial discrimination should not receive a single dollar of federal funding,” it added.The administration’s initial inclusion of the clause was widely criticised for tying life-saving emergency assistance to political ideology. Multiple US media outlets condemned the move as using federal aid to enforce political loyalty.The decision to backtrack also comes amid growing international criticism of Israel’s ongoing military offensive in Gaza. While the Trump administration has maintained strong pro-Israel policies, it has also pledged to combat what it calls “left-wing induced antisemitism,” asserting that it has no place in the US and “will not be tolerated.","The Trump administration has quietly removed a clause from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) guidelines that required states to maintain commercial ties with Israel.

US President Donald Trump surprised reporters on Tuesday morning when he was seen walking along the roof of the White House, directly above the press briefing room, joking that he was “just taking a little walk” — before laughingly adding that he was scouting a spot to install “nuclear missiles. ”The president, known for his interest in real estate and renovations, was accompanied by a small group, including James McCrery, the architect behind the newly announced $200 million privately funded East Wing ballroom project, reported WCNC News. The group moved slowly as Trump frequently gestured and pointed at the rooftop and the grounds below.Trump, gesturing as if envisioning a circular structure, was asked what he planned to build. He quipped, “nuclear missiles,” chuckled, and mimicked a projectile with his hand.At one point, he shouted toward reporters, “Anything I do is financed by me!” He also remarked that he was exploring “another way to spend my money for this country.”While the president was walking on the west side of the White House, above the press briefing room and not the East Wing, he appeared to be inspecting ongoing or potential construction projects.He did not respond to questions about whether he plans to add another floor to the West Wing to accommodate staff or press.Trump has completed several renovation projects during his term and has proposed more. The $200 million ballroom is among his highest-profile plans, which he hopes to finish before leaving office.He may also have been checking out the recently renovated Rose Garden, located directly below the West Wing roof. The redesign included a concrete floor, aimed at making it easier for women in heels to walk without sinking into the ground, according to WCNC News.Throughout his presidency, Trump has regularly toured the White House grounds to speak with construction crews and observe projects firsthand. Past additions include two 100-foot flagpoles, one on the North Lawn and one on the South Lawn, each flying large American flags. He also redecorated the Oval Office with gold plating on the ceiling, fireplace, and floor.","US President Donald Trump was seen walking along the roof of the White House, directly above the press briefing room.

The US House oversight committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, and several former senior justice department and FBI officials as part of its investigation into the crimes committed by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.On Tuesday, committee chairman James Comer, R-Ky, announced the subpoenas, which demand testimony from a wide range of former officials. Those targeted include former attorneys general Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder, Bill Barr, Merrick Garland, Jeff Sessions, and Alberto Gonzales, as well as former FBI directors James Comey and Robert Mueller.The committee is seeking answers regarding what Comer described as “horrific crimes perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein.” as quoted by NBC News. Comer has also subpoenaed the Department of Justice, demanding it hand over the “full, complete, unredacted Epstein Files” by August 19, 2025.The move follows mounting criticism of the DOJ’s handling of the Epstein case. Last month, the department said it would not bring charges against additional individuals and would not release further details. That decision has sparked bipartisan frustration and renewed calls for transparency.Among the most notable subpoenas is one directed at former President Bill Clinton, asking him to sit for a deposition on October 14. In his letter, Comer cited Clinton’s past ties to Epstein.“By your own admission, you flew on Jeffrey Epstein’s private plane four separate times in 2002 and 2003,” Comer wrote.“You were also allegedly close to Ms Ghislane Maxwell, an Epstein co-conspirator, and attended an intimate dinner with her in 2014, three years after public reports about her involvement in Mr. Epstein’s abuse of minors,” he added, referring to Ghislaine Maxwell, whose name was misspelled in the letter, reported NBC News.Comer also pointed to “conflicting reports about whether you ever visited Mr Epstein’s island.” While Clinton has consistently denied visiting Epstein’s private island, the location where some of the abuse allegedly took place, President Donald Trump has publicly claimed Clinton traveled there “28 times,” though he has provided no evidence.Representatives for the Clintons have not responded to the latest subpoenas. However, Clinton’s spokesperson Angel Urena issued a statement in 2019, saying the former president “knows nothing about the terrible crimes” Epstein had been charged with. Urena confirmed that Clinton had traveled on Epstein’s private jet four times in 2002 and 2003 as part of Clinton Foundation work, and was accompanied on each trip by staff and Secret Service agents.“He has not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade,” Urena said at the time.","The US House oversight committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, and several former senior justice department and FBI officials.

US President Donald Trump said Tuesday that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is no longer being considered to replace Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal Reserve, after Bessent expressed his desire to remain in his current role.“I love Scott, but he wants to stay where he is,” Trump said in a morning interview with CNBC, quoted by CNN. “I’ll take him off, because I asked him just last night, ‘Is this something you want? Nope, I want to stay where I am.’”Trump said he is now looking at other candidates, including former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and top White House economist Kevin Hassett, along with two other unnamed individuals.The president has long been critical of Powell over the Fed’s decision not to cut interest rates this year. “Too late,” “a numbskull,” and “a complete moron” are just some of the terms Trump has used to describe the central bank chief, as cited by CNN.Although Powell holds the top post at the Fed and influences monetary policy significantly, he is one of 12 members who vote on interest rate decisions. Still, Trump’s repeated and aggressive public attacks have sparked concerns about the White House interfering with the independence of the central bank.Meanwhile, Bessent continues to play a key role in U.S. trade negotiations. Last week, he traveled to Sweden for talks with Chinese trade officials about extending current tariff rates on goods exchanged between the two countries.

Pakistan political standoff deepens as PTI marks Imran’s two years in jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-political-standoff-deepens-as-pti-marks-imrans-two-years-in-jail/articleshow/123125854.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: Two years after former prime minister Imran Khan was jailed, Pakistan is caught in a dangerous political deadlock. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) marked the anniversary with nationwide protests on Tuesday, confronting an increasingly dominant military establishment led by Field Marshal Asim Munir.Demonstrators took to the streets in Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar, and other cities, demanding Khan’s release from Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where he has been held since Aug 2023 on charges ranging from corruption to incitement. PTI called the protests a “do-or-die” moment for democracy. In response, police in Punjab and other regions launched a crackdown, detaining dozens of workers and raiding party politicians’ homes, a move Punjab police denied, though sources confirmed at least 20 arrests in Lahore.The crackdown follows sweeping convictions last week, when an anti-terrorism court in Faisalabad sentenced 108 PTI members, including opposition politicians Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz, and Zartaj Gul Wazir, to 10 years in jail over the May 9, 2023 riots in which military installations were attacked following Khan’s brief arrest. Additional convictions were also handed down by another Punjab court, signalling what critics say is a coordinated effort to decapitate the party.PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan denounced the rulings as “engineered”, timed to sabotage the protests. “These are not trials, they’re political purges,” he said.Khan, speaking through his X account, has accused the military of rigging the 2024 elections and enforcing what he called “Asim Law” — de facto military rule propped up by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). The bitter personal feud between Khan and Munir dates back to 2019, when Khan, then PM, removed Munir as ISI chief, a humiliation the now army chief has apparently not forgotten.Since Munir’s appointment in 2022, the military has tightened its grip on civilian institutions. In June, Munir was controversially promoted to field marshal, Pakistan’s first since Ayub Khan, drawing criticism as a face-saving move after recent strategic and political setbacks. The military’s power has been further entrenched by a May 2025 Supreme Court ruling allowing civilian trials in military courts, and the passage of the 26th Amendment, which PTI says undermines judicial independence.The PTI’s cause has found support overseas, where diaspora communities have launched sustained protest campaigns in cities like London, Toronto, and Houston. Demonstrators have condemned what they call “military rule in civilian clothing”, using social media and digital billboards to amplify their message. While their efforts have gained some attention from rights groups and sympathetic lawmakers, they have yet to translate into meaningful international pressure on Islamabad.Back home, the govt defends the crackdown as a lawful response to what it sees as attempts to destabilise the state. But human rights groups, including Amnesty International, accuse authorities of using “unlawful and excessive force”, including arbitrary arrests, internet shutdowns, and blanket bans on public gatherings.Pakistan’s escalating political crisis is no longer just about Imran Khan. It is a contest for power, legitimacy, and the future of democratic space in the country.","Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) marked the anniversary with nationwide protests on Tuesday.

Pakistanis Describe Strikes; ‘Worse Than Earthquake…’ | India Destroys Terror Camps | Op Sindoor





A 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck several parts of Pakistan early Saturday morning, causing panic among residents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and the capital Islamabad, as reported by ARY News.The National Seismic Monitoring Centre (NSMC) reported that the earthquake occurred at 2.04 am PST at a depth of 102 kilometers. Its epicentre was located in the Hindukush mountain region in Afghanistan.Tremors were also felt across various regions in Afghanistan and Tajikistan, the NSMC confirmed.In Pakistan, the tremors were reported in multiple districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including Peshawar, Swat, Malakand, Nowshera, Charsadda, Karak, Dir, Mardan, Mohmand, Shangla, Hangu, Swabi, Haripur, and Abbottabad.Tremors were also felt in several parts of Punjab province including cities such as Lahore, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Attock, Taxila, Murree, Sialkot, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sheikhupura, Ferozwala and Muridke.Although the earthquake caused no reported loss of life or property, it led to widespread panic. Many residents rushed out of their homes in fear and began reciting verses from the holy Quran, according to ARY News.Pakistan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world, as it lies at the intersection of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. This collision zone makes the region highly vulnerable to frequent seismic activities.High-risk areas include Balochistan , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, which are located near major fault lines like the Main Central Thrust. Punjab, situated on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate, also remains susceptible. Sindh, though relatively less prone to earthquakes is also not free from risk due to its tectonic positioning.One of the most powerful earthquakes in the country's history was the 1945 Balochistan earthquake that measured 8.1 in magnitude.","A 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck several parts of Pakistan early Saturday morning.

ISLAMABAD:

‘Trump Angry As India Denies Nobel Push, Rejects' Mediation In Operation Sindoor Ceasefire | WATCH





In a symbolic assertion of strategic alignment, Pakistan’s military hosted on Friday a grand ceremony at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi to mark the 98th anniversary of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), showcasing its deepening defence partnership with Beijing.The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump just days after Washington and Islamabad concluded new trade deals.While the tariff decision is believed to have been discussed between the two sides as part of broader trade negotiations, Trump’s typically blunt commentary on social media appeared aimed more at India than Pakistan. In recent days, Trump has taken jabs at New Delhi over its continued purchase of Russian oil and defence equipment, while casting Pakistan in a more favourable light.At GHQ, however, Pakistan’s military made its strategic loyalties unambiguous. Army Chief Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir hosted Chinese ambassador Jiang Zaidong and PLA defence attaché Maj Gen Wang Zhong at a ceremony that included military tributes, visuals of joint defence hardware, and strong political messaging. Munir described the Pakistan-China relationship as a “beacon of mutual trust and shared destiny” and referred to the PLA and Pakistan Army as “iron brothers”.The messaging was clear: Pakistan is reaffirming its long-standing alignment with China even as it navigates transactional ties with Washington and economic turbulence at home. With IMF conditionalities tightening and Western funding streams growing unpredictable, Islamabad continues to anchor itself in Beijing’s strategic orbit, particularly through projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).For China, the event was a diplomatic win. As Beijing faces intensifying rivalry with the US across the Indo-Pacific, its deepening influence over a nuclear-armed ally in South Asia reinforces its foothold in the region.

A Pakistani anti-terrorism court on Thursday sentenced more than 100 members of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan 's party to prison terms on charges related to riots that targeted military sites in 2023, a court order said.Fifty-eight of the defendants, who included parliamentarians and senior officials, were sentenced to 10 years in prison and the rest were given sentences ranging from one to three years, the court said.The accused include Omar Ayub Khan and Shibli Faraz, the leaders of Khan's opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) in the lower and upper houses of parliament respectively, the court order seen by Reuters read.""The prosecution has proved its case against the accused without a shadow of doubt,"" it said in announcing the sentences.Khan, who has been in prison since 2023 facing charges of corruption, land fraud and disclosure of official secrets, is being tried separately on similar charges related to the riot.The government accuses him and other leaders of inciting the May 9, 2023, protests, during which demonstrators attacked military and government buildings, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi.He denies wrongdoing and says all the cases are politically motivated as part of a military-backed crackdown to dismantle his party.

Pakistan's prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday thanked US President Donald Trump for the ""historic"" trade deal between Islamabad and Washington.“I wish to convey my profound thanks to President Trump @realDonaldTrump for his leadership role in finalization of the historic US-Pakistan trade agreement, successfully concluded by our two sides in Washington, last night. This landmark deal will enhance our growing cooperation so as to expand the frontiers of our enduring partnership in days to come,” Sharif said in a post on X.On Wednesday, Trump announced that the United States has reached an agreement with Pakistan to jointly develop the country’s “massive oil reserves.”“We have just concluded a deal with the country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive oil reserves,"" the US president said in a post on Truth Social.The development comes amidst a meeting between Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick, and US trade representative ambassador Jamieson Greer, as per the state-run Radio Pakistan.Pakistan has long asserted the presence of significant oil reserves along its coastline, but efforts to tap into them have seen little progress.

ISLAMABAD: At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June as glacial lake outbursts, cloudbursts, and relentless monsoon rains triggered catastrophic floods across the country, from the Himalayas to the southern plains.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of another severe monsoon spell starting July 29, raising fears of fresh flash floods and landslides, especially in northern regions like Swat, Chitral, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Torrential rains have wreaked havoc across the country, sweeping away entire families, burying homes under landslides, and cutting off remote valleys. A sudden cloudburst near Babusar Top and Naran stranded scores of tourists, prompting military-led rescue operations by air and road. Washed-away bridges and blocked highways have hampered relief efforts.The NDMA, provincial agencies, and army teams are on the ground, but operations remain slow and patchy, especially in the hard-to-reach northern areas. Helicopter sorties continue, though poor weather and visibility are disrupting missions.Experts blame successive govts for ignoring climate adaptation and disaster preparedness, despite warnings. “The pattern is repeating itself — glacial melts, erratic monsoons, unprepared institutions. It’s a deadly mix,” said a disaster risk analyst in Islamabad.The crisis echoes the devastating 2022 monsoon floods, which killed over 1,700, submerged a third of the country, and displaced over 30 million people, causing $30 billion in economic losses. Yet, activists say climate resilience remains absent from Pakistan’s national priorities.With more glaciers than any non-polar country, Pakistan faces an increasing frequency of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) due to rising temperatures. Add to that deforestation, poor drainage, and unregulated construction, and experts say even routine monsoons now turn deadly.As another deluge looms, govt has advised evacuations from high-risk zones and warned tourists to stay away from northern areas. But for many already stranded, the warnings have come too late.","At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June.

Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi, officials confirmed on Monday.Among those killed was Zafran, who was identified as the mastermind of a November 2024 attack on two Chinese engineers in Pakistan's largest city. He carried a bounty of Rs 20 million.The operation was conducted late Sunday night in the Manghopir area by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and intelligence agencies, CTD official Raja Umer Khattab told. The TTP men opened fire when they saw security personnel approaching, triggering a firefight which lasted over an hour.Authorities recovered a suicide jacket, three grenades, a Kalashnikov rifle, two pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition from the site.On November 5 last year, a private security guard opened fire on two Chinese nationals at a textile mill in Karachi, injuring both before fleeing.Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in militant attacks—particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan—since the TTP ended its ceasefire with the federal government in late 2022.Founded in 2007, the TTP is an umbrella organisation of various extremist groups seeking to impose a strict version of Islamic law across Pakistan. It has claimed responsibility for numerous high-profile attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad, the 2009 assault on army headquarters, and multiple strikes on security installations.","Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi.

Pakistan tribal council threatens highway block over girl’s murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tribal-council-threatens-highway-block-over-girls-murder/articleshow/122939897.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: A tribal jirga (council of elders) in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway on July 29 after the killing of a nine-year-old girl sparked public outrage. Convened in Tank’s Gul Imam on Saturday, the jirga issued an 11-point charter of demands, warning of a full blockade if authorities fail to respond.Indus Highway (N-55) is a critical national artery that runs along the river, connecting Karachi in Pakistan’s south with Peshawar in the north and cutting through multiple provinces. The planned blockade at Pezu will impact trade routes, passenger transport, and military convoys.The protests gained momentum after a viral video showed residents confronting armed security personnel -- an extraordinary act in this militarised stretch of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The footage amplified long-standing anger over arbitrary detentions, raids without warrants, and what locals call collective punishment disguised as counterterrorism.“Our decision to block the highway remains. If our demands are accepted, we’ll reconsider.If not, Pezu will be shut down on July 29,” jirga leader Abdul Qayum Kundi said.Police have registered a case in the girl’s death, but authorities have yet to disclose any findings. Locals allege misconduct or negligence by security forces—claims that remain unverified but widely believed within the community.In a bid to defuse tensions, local officials delivered three sheep and (Pak) Rs 2.5 million (around $9,000) to the girl’s family -- an act rooted in tribal custom, meant to symbolise remorse and reconciliation. But jirga members view it as a token gesture. “This is hush money in ceremonial form,” said one elder.The jirga’s demands include the release of detainees not proven to have militant ties, an end to forced house searches, and a halt to arrests of suspects’ relatives. They also call for the return of confiscated weapons and an end to detentions based on vague accusations of mukhbiri (spying).The jirga’s demands echo those of the banned Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which for years challenged Pakistan’s security policies in its tribal belt.","A tribal jirga in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway.

‘Reject Pakistani Rule’: BNM Accuses Pakistan of Genocide in Balochistan, Launches Armed Resistance

Poll Do you think that protests and appeals by families of the abducted individuals can lead to change? Yes, they can raise awareness. No, they are largely ineffective.





The crisis of enforced disappearances in Pakistan's Balochistan region and beyond has deepened this week, as a disturbing string of abductions emerges from Karachi, Noshki, and Kech, according to The Balochistan Post (TBP).Among the most alarming cases is that of Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi.On Monday evening, he was reportedly abducted near the university's Maskan Gate. Eyewitnesses say he was taken by unidentified men in a vehicle while returning to his hostel with friends.Originally from Mashkay in Awaran district, Muslim Dad was a familiar face within the Baloch student community in Karachi. His sudden disappearance has sparked fear among his peers and left his family devastated.In Noshki, another troubling case unfolded earlier today when Hafeezullah, the son of Peer Mohammad and a resident of Qaziabad, was allegedly picked up from his home by Pakistani security forces. His family has raised alarm over his unknown whereabouts and is demanding his immediate release.TBP also reported two recent disappearances in Kech district.On July 23, 16-year-old shopkeeper Qambar Baloch was allegedly taken by men believed to belong to Military Intelligence and the ISI while he was in Jusak, Turbat. And on June 27, Imran Khan, a 26-year-old student of Balochi language and culture at the University of Turbat, was reportedly abducted by Frontier Corps and Military Intelligence personnel in Turbat city—in broad daylight.“These are not isolated cases. This is a pattern,” said a representative from Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), a group that has long campaigned for the safe recovery of abducted individuals. Despite repeated appeals and protests, most cases remain unresolved, with no accountability or formal investigations.","Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi, was reportedly abducted on Monday.

Bangladesh Interim Chief Yunus To Stay After Resignation Threat Amid Protests Over Rohingya Corridor

July Declaration unveiled:

Tight security and public celebration:





Bangladesh’s interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus on Tuesday announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026, ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. He made the declaration during his address to the nation via state television, BTV and radio to mark the first anniversary of the mass uprising that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ""On behalf of the interim government, I will write to the Chief Election Commissioner, requesting that the Election Commission organise a national election in February 2026, before the next Ramadan,"" Yunus said.The announcement marks a shift from his earlier indication that polls would be held in April. The revised timeline comes after consultations with major political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia which had called for earlier elections.""We will all begin mental preparation and institutional arrangements from tomorrow to complete all arrangements so that this year's election is memorable in the country's history in terms of joy and celebration, peace and order, voter turnout, and cordiality,"" he added.Yunus urged political parties to ensure that youth and women are not excluded from their manifestos or future governance plans. ""Remember, the youth who have changed Bangladesh have the power to change the world as well,"" he said.Earlier today, the interim government had also formally released the ""July Declaration"", a 26-point document outlining proposed reforms in governance, constitutional and political issues.Top leaders from political groups such as the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, and the newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP) were present during the official unveiling at the Bangladesh Parliament Complex, commemorating the uprising anniversary.The declaration sharply criticized the 1972 Constitution after its independence war against Pakistan in 1971, calling for reforms aligned with the will of the people.""Whereas, the post-independence Awami League government failed to materialise the people's aspirations because of the weaknesses in the procedures of drafting and in the structure of the constitution, along with its inappropriate application,"" the July Declaration said.It also condemned Sheikh Hasina’s administration, accusing it of turning Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state through alleged authoritarian rule and human rights violations.""Whereas, during the rule of Sheikh Hasina, under her very leadership, an extreme force that was anti-people, autocratic and against human rights turned Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state and thereby tarnished Bangladesh's international image,"" it added.The document calls for the 2024 uprising to be given official recognition and proposes that the July Declaration be included in a reformed constitution.Tens of thousands gathered at Manik Mia Avenue in Dhaka to mark the anniversary of Hasina’s ouster. The government declared the day a national holiday. Security was heightened across the capital, with police checkpoints and patrols in sensitive areas.Sheikh Hasina, who had been in power for 15 years, fled to India in August last year following mass protests. Her party, the Awami League, has since been banned by the interim administration, and its registration has been revoked by the Election Commission, effectively barring it from contesting in future polls unless the ban is lifted.Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch (HRW) raised concerns over the interim government's progress on human rights.""The hope of the thousands who braved lethal violence a year ago when they opposed Sheikh Hasina's abusive rule to build a rights-respecting democracy remains unfulfilled,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at HRW.She warned that the interim leadership is struggling to balance security reform with pressures from hardliners and rival political factions.As the nation reflects on the events of the past year, Bangladesh remains on high alert. The month of August also marks the anniversary of the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s founding figure and Hasina’s father.","Bangladesh's interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026.

A newly formed political party led by students who played a key role in the anti-government protests that led to the ouster of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina held a rally in the country's capital Dhaka on Sunday, pledging to build a new Bangladesh amid ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the next national election, reported news agency AP.The National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters. Party leader Nahid Islam announced a 24-point agenda and called for the creation of a new constitution to replace the one adopted in 1972.“Exactly one year ago, at this Shaheed Minar (memorial), we vowed to free this country from the hands of dictatorship. By responding to that call, we together defeated the fascist rule and regained control of our country,” Islam said.“Let us all unite and transform this historic 24-point agenda into reality to build a new Bangladesh, a Bangladesh that fulfills the dreams of all citizens, as we move toward the formation of our second republic,” he added, as quoted by the agency.The party did not provide specific details on the proposed constitution but said its goal was to reflect the aspirations of a new generation of Bangladeshis.Separately, the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) also held a large rally in Dhaka.BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, who has been in exile in London since 2008, addressed the crowd virtually and urged supporters to mobilise young voters ahead of the upcoming polls, according to AP.Rahman said, “We must reclaim our democratic rights and engage the youth in shaping Bangladesh’s future.”The rallies took place two days before the interim government, led by Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is set to mark the first anniversary of Sheikh Hasina’s departure from power.Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, following weeks of mass protests and political unrest that resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. Yunus assumed office on August 8.The demonstrations come amid criticism of the interim government’s handling of law and order, with opposition parties accusing it of failing to contain mob violence and uphold human rights.With Hasina’s Awami League banned and the political future still unclear, the rallies highlighted the growing activity among both new and established political forces ahead of the next election.","National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Electric vehicles account for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal.

Industrialist Sunjay Kapur died of natural causes, the Surrey coroner has determined. Speculation had been triggered by his mother, Rani Kapur, that there was foul play involved or that he was murdered.Kapur, a US citizen who was chairman of Sona Comstar, passed away due to left ventricular hypertrophy and ischemic heart disease, as per the coroner’s report shared by the office of his wife, Priya Sachdev Kapur, on Tuesday.The Surrey coroner’s office confirmed to TOI: “The death was reported to the coroner. The coroner’s investigation has been closed with a natural cause of death.” It is understood a post-mortem was carried out, but no inquest was held.Surrey police said his death was being treated as “non-suspicious”.His death has intensified a bitter family dispute about inheritance and who controls the family’s flagship company, Sona Comstar.On Monday his mother Rani Kapur revealed that she had written to Surrey police demanding an investigation into his death, alleging foul play. “His death may have been facilitated or orchestrated as part of a transnational conspiracy, with the involvement of individuals and entities in the UK, India and maybe the US,” Rani Kapur wrote.She said she had “credible and concerning evidence that suggests her son’s death may not have been accidental or natural, but may have involved foul play, including possibility of murder, abetment, conspiracy, fraud, and forgery.”Sunjay Kapur, owner of the Aureus polo team, was playing a polo match in Smith’s lawn at the Guards Polo Club in Windsor on June 12 when he died after becoming unwell. The club has links to the British royal family.A Surrey police spokesperson said they were aware of Rani Kapur’s letter. “Police were called to The Guards Polo Club just after 5pm on June 12 following the death of a man in his 50s at the location. Colleagues from South East Coast Ambulance also attended and confirmed that the man had sadly died at the scene. His death is being treated as non-suspicious,” the spokesperson said.A US embassy spokesperson in London told TOI: “When a US citizen dies abroad, the department provides consular assistance to the legal representative, next-of-kin, and family. Depending on the situation, this can include preparation of a consular report of the death of a US citizen abroad. Local authorities are responsible for determining the cause of death.”","US industrialist Sunjay Kapur died of natural causes, the Surrey coroner has determined.

Pamela Anderson says there is no feud with Meghan Markle over cooking shows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/pamela-anderson-says-there-is-no-feud-with-meghan-markle-over-cooking-shows/articleshow/123119046.cms,"How the rumour started

Walls Closing In? Meghan Markle Faces Royal Cold Shoulder Amid New Fears: Reports

Different networks, same idea

Anderson’s calm response

What critics say about Markle’s show

Positive buzz for Anderson

No reaction from Meghan





Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series. The former Baywatch star spoke about the issue on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. When Cohen asked her to rate, on a scale of one to ten, how much Markle’s With Love, Meghan looked like her own Pamela’s Cooking With Love, Anderson answered “One.” She added, “I didn’t invent cooking shows. She’s just doing her thing.”Fans noticed that both shows feature garden scenes, casual kitchen chats, and celebrity guests. Anderson’s trailer came out in October 2024. Markle’s teaser followed three months later. Online threads pointed to similar camera angles and even matching font styles in the titles. Some viewers accused the Duchess of releasing a “frame-for-frame” copy.Pamela’s Cooking With Love is streamed on Amazon Prime. Episodes show Anderson and a guest chef picking vegetables in her Vancouver garden before cooking a meal outdoors. Markle’s eight-part Netflix show centres on simple dishes and home-grown produce in Montecito.Both series mix recipes with lifestyle tips, but Anderson stressed that overlap is normal in food television.Anderson told Cohen she had only seen quick clips of Markle’s programme and did not spend time looking for likenesses. She joked that there is room for anyone who wants to share food and stories on screen. Her relaxed tone cooled much of the online debate.With Love, Meghan drew mixed-to-negative reviews (≈38% on Rotten Tomatoes; 37 on Metacritic). It briefly entered Netflix’s Top 10 in its first week, and mid-year engagement tallies cited by several outlets place it outside Netflix’s Top 300. Even so, Netflix has ordered Season 2.Anderson’s series has earned strong notices and a high user score on IMDb. Executive producer Jesse Fawcett said any comparison is a compliment because it proves their team set a trend others want to follow. Anderson plans to film a second garden season next spring.Markle has not commented on Anderson’s remarks. Sources close to her say she is focused on shooting new episodes and expanding her As Ever lifestyle brand. Observers doubt she will address copy-cat talk directly. They note she has stayed silent through similar critiques from Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.Two stars can host cooking shows without a feud. Anderson’s light answer suggests she sees no threat. Unless Markle fires back, the story may cool as fast as it boiled up. For viewers, the choice is simple: prime-time garden meals with Pamela or California comfort food with Meghan. Either way, dinner is served.",Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series.

22-inch rat found in UK home image goes viral, residents report more sightings







Why are rat sightings increasing



Overflowing bins and improper waste disposal

Overgrown public land and unmaintained council-owned plots

Increased availability of food sources for pests

Reduced domestic pest control intervention by local authorities

Rising rodent sightings raise concerns over urban management



Clearing overgrown public plots

Addressing waste collection and bin overflow issues

Considering reinstating council-supported domestic pest control services

Residents of Normanby in Redcar and Cleveland, North Yorkshire, were left horrified after an enormous rat measuring 22 inches from nose to tail was discovered inside a home. The rodent, described as being “almost the size of a small cat,” was found by a pest control worker responding to a routine callout. What was initially an isolated incident quickly became a viral social media topic after local councillors shared photos online, drawing attention to a growing rat infestation problem across the region.The discovery has ignited a broader conversation among residents, who have reported increasingly frequent rat sightings in alleyways, around overflowing rubbish bins, on overgrown public land, and even crossing streets in broad daylight. Many locals are concerned about potential disease spread, property damage, and safety risks. The fact that such a massive rodent managed to find its way inside a home has amplified fears of a public health crisis.The shocking image of the oversized rat, carefully sealed inside a large plastic bag, was posted on Facebook by Eston Ward councillors David Taylor and Stephen Martin. They revealed that the rat was discovered during routine pest control work in the Normanby area.The Facebook post instantly caught attention, with horrified residents sharing their own experiences:One user described seeing two rats left dead on the street to rot. Another claimed to have spotted a rat “the size of a Jack Russell” drinking from a puddle. Others expressed disbelief, comparing the rodent to the size of their grown domestic cats.Comments ranged from disgust to fear, with one person writing, “That rat is bigger than my grown cat,” while another questioned, “Proper sewer rat that... must be something going down if they’re surfacing?”This surge of public reaction has revealed the scale of the issue and how unsettled residents feel about the worsening rodent population in their neighborhoods.According to the councillors, several factors have contributed to the surge in rodent activity:Two years ago, Redcar and Cleveland faced similar rodent issues but managed to control them through coordinated pest control measures. However, the councillors warn that the current situation is more severe because the council no longer handles domestic rat infestations. Instead, residents are now given advice and are required to hire private pest control services at their own expense.This shift has left many residents vulnerable, especially those who cannot afford costly pest control treatments, creating an ideal environment for rats to multiply unchecked.The councillors stressed that if the issue is left unaddressed, rats will continue to invade homes and public areas, putting the health and safety of the community at risk. They have urged immediate action, including:The discovery of the giant 22-inch rat is being seen as a wake-up call for local authorities. Residents are demanding proactive measures to prevent a potential full-scale rodent infestation and restore public confidence in local sanitation and safety. While isolated incidents of large rodents are not unheard of in urban areas, the Normanby case stands out due to the sheer size of the rat and the growing pattern of infestations across Redcar and Cleveland. For many residents, this incident has transformed what was once an occasional nuisance into a major community concern.The incident also raises questions about how urban environments and public health systems manage pest control responsibilities amid budget constraints and changing policies. Until decisive measures are implemented, locals fear that sightings of oversized rats could become even more common—potentially putting homes, businesses, and public health at risk.","Residents of Normanby in Redcar and Cleveland, North Yorkshire, were left horrified after an enormous rat measuring 22 inches from nose to tail was discovered inside a home.

Marching in the name of legacy: Sikh regiment debate rekindled in Britain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/marching-in-the-name-of-legacy-sikh-regiment-debate-rekindled-in-britain/articleshow/123097673.cms,"Marching in the name of legacy: Sikh regiment debate rekindled in Britain





The debate over whether there should be a Sikh Regiment in the British Armed Forces has resurfaced but the ministry of defence (MOD) insists there are no such plans.The debate was triggered after Lord Sahota asked defence minister Lord Coaker in the House of Lords on 7 July whether there was any progress of having a Sikh regiment in the British Army, given the loyalty of Sikh soldiers in both world wars. Coaker replied, “Let me consider that request from my noble friend. I am quite happy to meet him to see what more we can do to recognise the contribution of soldiers such as Sikhs.” This led to UK headlines such as ‘Minister open to British Army Sikh regiment proposal.’But MOD sources told TOI, “Over the years, there have been conversations about this, but it would breach Britain’s anti-discriminatory laws. There are no current plans for a Sikh regiment as it goes against the Equality Act. We want to do something to recognise Sikh contributions in some way, but not through a Sikh regiment.”Lord Sahota, whose grandfathers served in the British Indian army, including the 15Punjab Regiment, told TOI: “I don’t think it would go against the Equality Act.”He pointed out the British Army has had the Staffordshire regiment and currently has the Brigade of Gurkhas, the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, the Royal Welsh and Royal Regiment of Scotland and so on.“It doesn’t mean other faiths like Hindus, Muslims or Christians wouldn’t be able to serve in a Sikh Regiment. If you are in the Royal Regiment of Scotland, it doesn’t mean you have to be Scottish.”.“We are struggling to recruit ethnic minorities in this country,” he said, and so having a Sikh Regiment would give Sikhs a “reason to join.” “They would wear turbans and have beards and it would reflect Sikh heritage and values,” he said.“It would foster a better relationship with other countries such as India and South Asia as well,” he added.There are estimated to be only 200 Sikhs in the British Armed Forces currently.“People tend to go into the army if their grandfather was in it. Sikhs don’t have that role model here,” Sahota said. He said if there was a Punjab or Sikh Regiment, they would have that role model. “There are more than 700k Sikhs in the UK. I am sure quite a few would be prepared to follow in their great grandfather’s footsteps. King Charles even told a Sikh soldier he wanted to see more Sikhs in the British Army,” the Labour life peer added.India-born Sahota (74) said he plans to meet Lord Coaker after the summer recess and will take Sikhs in the British Army and MPs with him.Preet Kaur Gill MP, who has met the armed forces minister many times, to raise the issue, said: “The ministers are looking at doing something. No decision has been made. It is being looked at. There have been existing Sikh regiments in the army. It’s not anything new.”The modern Indian army has a Sikh Regiment, which continues to recruit from the Sikh community and a Punjab Regiment. The Sikh regiment is one of the most decorated regiments and traces its origins to the first Sikh battalion raised by the East India Company in 1846.But veteran army reservist Captain Jay Singh-Sohal OBE is against the idea.“Even if they did this they wouldn’t fill out a regiment with recruits - we struggle with getting young Sikhs into the military as it is. A Sikh regiment isn’t going to change this and would become massively understaffed. A single battalion regiment requires 700 plus. A Sikh regiment will fail as it won’t get 700 plus young Sikhs joining. And if the answer is to look beyond Sikhs then what’s the point of a race specific regiment?” he said.“These British Sikh politicians need to make the argument for the benefit of Sikh specific regiments in the context of the threats we face today,” Sohal added. “It’s not about harking to past glories but about practical ways in which Sikhs today can make an impact through military service. I believe Sikhs do make an impact as we serve alongside those who represent Great Britain as a whole,” Johal said.“The Sikh identity is already recognised as a strength in the British Army and protected by UK law. We don’t need special treatment. We already practice our faith in the army. A modern army is about bringing capabilities and insights from different walks of life and backgrounds to create a synergy into a whole team setting. Sikhs can contribute a lot to that. Having a Sikh specific regiment won’t motivate more youngsters to join. What would, is if they see value in soldiering or developing themselves as a leader through military experience. I challenge Preet Gill and Lord Sahota to find me 20 Sikhs willing to sign up to the British Army right now, regardless of whether we have a Sikh regiment or not. They won’t be able to do it.”Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi MP, chair of the defence committee, which scrutinises the work of the MOD, said: “Given the extraordinary history, martial traditions and sacrifices of Sikh soldiers, especially during both world wars, I have supported the establishment of a British Sikh Regiment for several years, including meetings with ministers and other activists.""""While the campaign has not achieved success thus far, we will certainly continue to make the case"", Dhesi added."," debate over whether there should be a Sikh Regiment in the British Armed Forces has resurfaced.

Biden calls for unity in final holiday message

The 2024 Holidays at the White House: A Season of Peace and Light

Trump delivers politically charged Christmas posts

Biden bows out with civility, Trump returns with combative agenda

As the United States prepares for a new administration, outgoing President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump shared starkly contrasting Christmas messages, reflecting their differing approaches and visions for the nation.Biden, in his final holiday message as president, called for reflection and unity. In a video tour of the White House Christmas decorations published on YouTube, he urged Americans to set aside divisions. ""We’re here on this Earth to care for one another, to love one another,"" he narrated as images of decorated trees and festive fireplaces played.Biden also acknowledged the country’s polarization, saying, ""Too often we see each other as enemies, not as neighbors."" Biden encouraged moments of ""quiet reflection"" to inspire dignity, respect, and unity, saying, ""We’re truly blessed to live in this nation.""In contrast, Trump’s Christmas Day posts on Truth Social included a spirited ""MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL!"" alongside a photo of himself and Melania. He also said, ""This will be the best Christmas of our lifetime, because of what is going to come!"" in one of his posts. This was followed by a series of politically charged posts, including retweets backing his positions on issues like controversial defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth and past ambitions like acquiring Greenland.One of the posts featured a meme mocking former US President Barack Obama , showing a 2017 inauguration photo captioned, ""When you see the guy who said 'you’ll never be president' at your inauguration.""""Merry Christmas to all, including to the wonderful soldiers of China, who are lovingly, but illegally, operating the Panama Canal (where we lost 38,000 people in its building 110 years ago), always making certain that the United States puts in Billions of Dollars in “repair” money, but will have absolutely nothing to say about 'anything,'"" Trump said in another post.Biden, who stepped aside from the 2024 presidential race in July to support unity, marked the end of his decades-long career with a call for civility. In contrast, Trump—who defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in November—continues to take a combative approach, vowing to prosecute political adversaries and restructure the federal government.As Biden exits with a message of healing, Trump prepares to re-enter the White House, becoming the second president in US history to serve non-consecutive terms. The contrast in their holiday messages stresses the ongoing political divide as the nation transitions into a new chapter.","Outgoing President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump shared starkly contrasting Christmas messages.

Sacks labels backlash a ‘Division grift’

Trump’s vision for AI leadership

The

immigration debate

reignited

A divisive narrative

David Sacks , the President-elect’s nominee for White House AI and Crypto Czar , has launched a scathing attack on critics targeting Sriram Krishnan , calling the backlash a “cabal” driven by misinformation and divisive agendas. Sacks took to X (formerly Twitter) and said, ""This whole cabal against Sriram is totally out of control. There’s no self-serving agenda whatsoever here, nor character flaws. We should celebrate people like Sriram who are going to leave so much $ on the table to serve the country. Enough of this nonsense.”The controversy erupted last week after Donald Trump nominated Krishnan, an Indian-American entrepreneur, as senior policy advisor for Artificial Intelligence .Social media backlash quickly followed, fueled by far-right commentators like Laura Loomer. The criticism ranged from immigration fears to baseless allegations about Krishnan’s US citizenship and supposed political contributions to Kamala Harris.In a series of tweets, Sacks tore into the criticisms, suggesting they were part of a calculated effort to derail the conversation around pressing issues like illegal immigration. He wrote, “A recap of the past few days: A woman was burned alive by an illegal migrant on the NY Subway. The whole country was unified in its outrage. Everyone wants to seal the border and stop migrant crime.""Then the online conversation suddenly shifted to a non-existent threat of unlimited H1Bs by attacking a tech appointee who has never advocated for that position, Sacks noted. ""His remit doesn’t even include immigration.""""When I corrected the record, the lies just shifted, including to some nasty attacks that he wasn’t a US citizen, and a false accusation that he contributed to Kamala Harris. Hard to say what’s going on here, but it seems like a division grift if I’ve ever seen one.""Sacks further criticized the misplaced outrage over employment visas compared to the broader issue of illegal immigration. “Number of illegal aliens/year: 3+ million. Number of employment visas/year: 140k. As a start, maybe we should focus on the 95% where we all agree,” he wrote on X.Announcing the appointment last week, Donald Trump said Krishnan would play a pivotal role in advancing US leadership in artificial intelligence. Trump said, “Working closely with David Sacks, Sriram will focus on ensuring continued American leadership in AI, and help shape and coordinate AI policy across Government, including working with the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.”Krishnan, who began his career at Microsoft as a founding member of Windows Azure, is considered a rising star in the tech world. Trump’s decision to pair him with Sacks reflects a commitment to leveraging private-sector talent for public policy.Although Krishnan’s role is unrelated to immigration, his appointment has sparked renewed discussion about the US visa system. Critics have tied his nomination to concerns over H1B visas and the longstanding green card backlog disproportionately affecting countries like India.According to the Immigration Act of 1990, every country is allocated an equal number of green cards regardless of population size, creating a massive backlog for countries with larger populations. For instance, India, with a population of 1.4 billion, faces the same quota as the Marshall Islands, home to just 36,930 people.This imbalance forces skilled immigrants from India to endure decades-long waits for green cards, restricting their ability to work, travel, or settle permanently in the US Krishnan, along with figures like Sacks and Elon Musk, has been vocal about attracting global talent to strengthen the American economy, an argument that stands at odds with the recent criticism.The backlash against Krishnan underscores the polarization surrounding Trump’s cabinet picks. Sacks, however, remains firm in his defense, portraying Krishnan as a patriotic figure making personal sacrifices to serve the country.As Sacks put it: “We should celebrate people like Sriram who are going to leave so much $ on the table to serve the country.”","David Sacks, the President-elect’s nominee for White House AI and Crypto Czar, has launched a scathing attack on critics targeting Sriram Krishnan.

Illustration of flight path isn't provided due to no PLA aircraft operating around Taiwan were detected,"" the Ministry of National Defence said in a post on X.Earlier on Wednesday, MND reported the operation of three Chinese military aircraft and six naval vessels. Of the three People's Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft, one of them entered Taiwan's eastern Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ).On Tuesday, MND reported the operation of eight Chinese military aircraft and five naval vessels. The aircraft and vessels were detected operating around Taiwan until 6 am (local time) on Tuesday. Of the eight People's Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft, six of them crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's northern and southwestern ADIZ.Meanwhile, following the White House announcement of arms sales and assistance to Taiwan, China's foreign ministry said that the ""Taiwan issue"" is the core of China's interests and the ""first red line that cannot be crossed in China-US relations,"" Taiwan News reported.Further, the ministry also accused the US of ""playing with fire.""A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry on Sunday condemned the latest US arms package to Taiwan, stating that it ""seriously violates the one-China principle and the three Sino-US joint communiques, especially the 'August 17' communique, seriously infringes on China's sovereignty and security interests, and seriously violates the US leaders' commitment not to support ""Taiwan independence.""The spokesperson claimed that Washington's actions sent a ""seriously wrong signal to the 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces.""Recently, Nato secretary general Mark Rutte also criticised China's stance towards Taiwan and said that ""China is bullying Taiwan, and pursuing access to critical infrastructure in ways that could cripple societies.""He said, ""We need to be clear-eyed about China's ambitions. China is substantially building up its forces, including its nuclear weapons - with no transparency and no limitations. From 200 warheads in 2020, China is expected to have more than 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030. Its space-launch investments are skyrocketing.

This uptick in activity is viewed as a show of force by Beijing, aimed at intimidating Taiwan amid ongoing diplomatic support from the United States and other international allies.The Taiwan Strait remains a focal point of heightened tensions, with Taiwanese officials repeatedly condemning the increase in Chinese military operations as a direct threat to the island's sovereignty and regional peace. However, China, which considers Taiwan part of its territory, insists on eventual reunification, by force if necessary.","Taiwan's ministry of national defence on Thursday reported the operation of five PLAN vessels around Taiwan.

Canada Flagpoling Ban: Canada ends flagpoling for work and study permits. What it means?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-ends-flagpoling-for-work-and-study-permits-what-it-means/articleshow/116657872.cms,"Representative image

Reasons behind ban

Limited exemptions

Citizens or permanent residents of the United States.

Professionals and technicians under free trade agreements with countries such as the United States, Mexico, Chile, Panama, Peru, Colombia, and South Korea.

Spouses or common-law partners of professionals under these agreements.

International truck drivers leaving Canada for work who held maintained status due to a timely renewal application.

Individuals with pre-existing CBSA appointments for permit processing.

Canada has officially ended the practice of flagpoling for work and study permits at its ports of entry.Effective from December 23 at 11.59 pm ET, foreign nationals holding temporary resident status in Canada must submit renewal applications through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) instead of re-entering Canada after briefly leaving for expedited immigration services, according to a statement by the Canada Border Services Agency .Flagpoling has long been used by temporary residents to bypass typical processing wait times for work and study permits. However, Canadian authorities now aim to streamline port operations and enhance border enforcement.“This change will enable us to further streamline activities at our ports of entry and allow Canadian and American border officers to focus on what they have been expertly trained to do – border enforcement,” public safety minister David McGuinty said in a statement, as reported by CBC News.Flagpoling has placed a significant burden on Canadian and American border services. Between April 1, 2023, and March 31, 2024, the CBSA processed over 69,300 flagpolers, primarily in regions like the Pacific, southern Ontario, and Quebec, according to CIC News.The CBSA emphasised that border services are intended for individuals entering Canada rather than those already in the country. Diverting resources for flagpolers has added congestion and hindered critical border enforcement activities.“A strong Canada-US relationship keeps people and goods moving safely while protecting both sides of the border,” immigration minister Marc Miller said, adding that the policy shift would enhance fairness, ease border congestion, and improve overall border efficiency.Certain groups will still qualify for port-of-entry processing under specific circumstances:Those who attempt to flagpole without meeting these criteria will be redirected to IRCC for their applications.The policy is likely part of a broader initiative to bolster Canada-US border security . The Liberal government's fall economic update allocated $1.3 billion over six years for measures like drones, helicopters, and improved monitoring of the shared border. The changes also come amid concerns over potential US tariffs.Flagpoling, once a viable option for expediting permits, is now phased out to prioritize border security and efficient management. Applicants are being urged to use IRCC’s online services for work or study permit renewals moving forward.","Canada has officially ended the practice of flagpoling for work and study permits at its ports of entry.Effective from December 23 at 11.59 pm ET, foreign nationals holding temporary resident status in Canada must submit renewal applications through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.

British-Indian writer says he had a chat with Luigi Mangione: 'His major concern was...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/british-indian-writer-says-he-had-a-chat-with-luigi-mangione-his-major-concern-was-/articleshow/116656189.cms,"Luigi Mangione was concerned about 'non-playing characters' and identified himself as one, a writer revealed.

Agency was a major concern of Luigi's

'I was sickened. Vigilantism is always wrong'

'I didn't know he had spinal or mental issues'

British-Indian writer Gurwinder Bhogal has claimed that long before the shocking murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, he had a video call and a chat with accused Luigi Mangione around April-May when Mangione was vacationing in Japan.The author described how Luigi Mangione reached out to him through membership of his blog and was warm and gregarious. Mangione told him that he was on holiday in Japan and loved the culture there -- its sense of honor. ""One morning in Japan, he saw a man having a seizure in the street, so he ran to the nearest police station for help. They followed him back to the man, but refused to cross any street if the stoplight was red—even if the road was empty—as the man was seizing on the ground. Mangione lamented what he called “a lack of free will” in Japan, by which he meant a lack of agency,"" Bhogal described an anecdote from his interaction with Mangione.""I quickly realised that agency was a major concern of Luigi’s,"" the writer added.""Luigi believed people everywhere were becoming NPCs (Non-player characters -- people who don't think for themselves), increasingly living their lives as a series of reflex reactions rather than consciously choosing their behaviours. The West was following closely behind Japan, driven by tech companies intent on mesmerising us into servile consumers. Luigi feared that once we’d surrendered our agency, we’d surrender everything else,"" Bhogal wrote.Mangione too identified as an NPC living much of his life on autopilot, he told the author recalling how he sometimes wasted whole afternoons doomscrolling social media. ""He said he wanted to regain some of the agency he felt he'd lost to online distractions, so we spent much of the chat discussing ways he could become more active,"" the writer wrote adding that he thought Mangione was someone who had a desire to help even those whom he didn't know.The writer then described how he withdrew himself from social media and didn't notice that Mangione vanished and then came the murder and the social media glorification of the alleged murderer. ""If you celebrate someone gunning down a defenseless person in the street, then you advocate for a world in which this is an acceptable thing for anyone to do. You, in fact, advocate for a world in which a stranger can decide that you’re also a bad person, and gun you down in the street. In such a world, I promise you, your health insurance would cost much more,"" Bhogal wrote.The writer said that in his limited interactions with Mangione, he never got the impression he had spinal or mental issues. ""But I did get the sense he felt alienated. He often decried the lack of social connection in the modern world, and on a couple of occasions, he lamented that the people around him were 'on a different wavelength' to him,"" he wrote.","British-Indian writer Gurwinder Bhogal has claimed that long before the shocking murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, he had a video call and a chat with accused Luigi Mangione.

Six more people, mostly children, were wounded, the Taliban government spokesman informed.The strikes hit seven villages, including Laman, where five members of a single family lost their lives.According to reports, Pakistani jets were responsible for the bombings, with Murg Bazaar village bearing significant destruction.The Taliban’s ministry of defence condemned the airstrikes and vowed retaliation. “Defending our land and sovereignty is our legitimate right,” the ministry stated, adding that ""Waziristani refugees"" were among the victims.Official casualty figures have not yet been disclosed, but at least 15 bodies have reportedly been recovered.The airstrikes occur against a backdrop of escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, particularly over the presence of militants from Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghan territory. Pakistan has repeatedly accused the Afghan Taliban of providing shelter to TTP fighters, who have increased attacks on Pakistani forces in recent months. In response, the Afghan Taliban denies these allegations, asserting that civilians, not militants, were targeted in the latest strikes.“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan considers this a brutal act against all international principles and blatant aggression and strongly condemns it,” said the Afghan ministry of defence. “The Islamic Emirate will not leave this cowardly act unanswered but rather considers the defense of its territory to be its inalienable right.”Islamabad contends that many TTP leaders and fighters have fled to Afghanistan, finding refuge in border provinces under Taliban protection. Afghan officials, however, have refuted these claims, stating that the victims of the bombings were primarily displaced civilians.The strikes came just after Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan’s special representative for Afghanistan, visited Kabul for discussions on trade and bilateral relations. The timing has fueled speculation about a deterioration in diplomatic ties between the two neighbors.The TTP, which ended a ceasefire with the Pakistani government in November 2022, has intensified its attacks on Pakistani security forces. These attacks have killed and injured dozens of soldiers in recent months, heightening security concerns in Islamabad.","Pakistan launched a series of airstrikes targeting Afghanistan’s Barmal district in Paktika province on the night of December 24, killing at least 46 people, including women and children.

Who is Wayne Gretzky?

Gretzky's non-political legacy

Gretzky fans divided

Trump’s “51st State” joke and Trudeau criticism

Gretzky’s potential as a leader

US President-elect Donald Trump sparked a holiday uproar on Truth Social by suggesting Canadian hockey legend Wayne Gretzky should run for Prime Minister—or “Governor” of Canada, as Trump quipped. Reviving his long-running joke about Canada becoming the 51st US state, Trump’s remarks combined flattery, satire, and a jab at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “I just left Wayne Gretzky, ‘The Great One,’ as he is known in Ice Hockey circles,” Trump wrote. “I said, ‘Wayne, why don’t you run for Prime Minister of Canada, soon to be known as the Governor of Canada – You would win easily, you wouldn’t even have to campaign.’”Trump revealed that Gretzky, 63, wasn’t interested in entering politics but called on Canadians to launch a ""DRAFT WAYNE GRETZKY Movement,"" claiming it would be “so much fun to watch.” He took the opportunity to wish Trudeau a “Merry Christmas,” while mocking him as “Governor Trudeau” and criticizing Canada’s tax policies .“Taxes are far too high, but if Canada was to become our 51st State , their Taxes would be cut by more than 60%, their businesses would immediately double in size, and they would be militarily protected like no other Country anywhere in the World,” Trump asserted.Wayne Gretzky, nicknamed “The Great One,” is a symbol of excellence in hockey and one of Canada’s most beloved sports figures. Born in Brantford, Ontario, in 1961, Gretzky began showing extraordinary talent as a young player, often competing against older children and dominating games with his strategic brilliance.Over his 20-year NHL career, Gretzky shattered records and won hearts, becoming the all-time leader in goals (894), assists (1,963), and total points (2,857). His achievements include four Stanley Cup championships with the Edmonton Oilers, nine Hart Trophies as league MVP, and 10 scoring titles. His legendary career culminated in a first-ballot Hall of Fame induction in 1999, with the league retiring his iconic jersey number 99 across all teams.Though celebrated for his on-ice prowess, Gretzky has remained largely apolitical throughout his life. After retiring, he transitioned into roles as a coach, ambassador for hockey, and entrepreneur. Despite occasional public appearances with political figures, Gretzky has been careful not to wade into partisan debates—a stark contrast to Trump’s brash and divisive style.This makes Trump’s suggestion all the more curious. While many fans relished the humor of imagining “The Great One” as a political leader, others were quick to criticize his association with Trump. A photograph of Gretzky at Mar-a-Lago wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" cap has only fueled the backlash.While some Canadians saw humor in Trump’s comments, Gretzky’s association with the president-elect sparked outrage among others. Social media users expressed disappointment after Gretzky was photographed at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" cap.“Gretzky was my idol growing up, so this stings. A lot,” wrote one user on X. Another lamented, “You were the role model for decency and family… I will no longer think of you as one of the greats on and off the ice.”Trump’s suggestion also reignited his trolling of Canada as the “51st state” and Trudeau as its “governor.” In his post, Trump had jabbed Trudeau’s leadership and claimed that annexing Canada would resolve many of the nation’s challenges, including its tax policies and economic struggles.“Thanks for dinner last night, President Trump. I look forward to the work we can do together, again,” Trudeau later posted on X, referencing a recent meeting at Mar-a-Lago where the two leaders discussed trade and the fentanyl crisis. Trump claimed Trudeau had made “a commitment to work with us to end this terrible devastation.”Amid growing domestic challenges, including Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland’s resignation, Trudeau has faced calls to step down. Trump seized the opportunity to criticize Freeland, calling her departure a win for Canada. “Her behavior was totally toxic, and not at all conducive to making deals which are good for the very unhappy citizens of Canada. She will not be missed!!!” Trump wrote.Although Gretzky has never entertained the idea of entering politics, his leadership qualities and universal admiration make him an intriguing hypothetical candidate. Known for his humility, sportsmanship, and work ethic, Gretzky embodies traits Canadians often seek in public figures.“He’s not just a hockey legend; he’s a cultural icon who brought Canadians together,” said David O’Brien, a Canadian sports historian. “If he ever decided to run for office, he’d likely have widespread appeal.”Still, Gretzky’s reluctance to engage in politics remains evident. Responding to Trump’s post, a source close to Gretzky stated, “Wayne is deeply honored by the respect, but he’s a hockey guy, not a politician.”","US President-elect Donald Trump suggested Canadian hockey legend Wayne Gretzky should run for Prime Minister or ""Governor"" of Canada. Trump's remarks combined flattery, satire, and a jab at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. While many fans relished the humor of imagining “The Great One” as a political leader, others were quick to criticize his association with Trump.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116666120,imgsize-2088307,width-400,resizemode-4/116666120.jpg"

10 things to know about Laura Loomer

Laura Loomer is known for her hate speech and conspiracy theories and she became prominent just ahead of the election as she was seen with Donald Trump on his campaign trail. The GOP distanced itself from Laura Loomer after her racist comment that if Kamala Harris won the election, the White House would have smelled like curry and White House speeches would have been facilitated via a call center. Laura Loomer entered the 2020 Florida UD House of Representatives race as a Republican but lost it. Two years later she lost a Republican primary. Loomer was banned from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter for her anti-Muslim remarks. Donald Trump said Laura Loomer did not work for him and wherever she said was her opinion and not the party's. Laura Loomer said she did not vote for Trump to facilitate ""Indian invaders"" to steal US jobs. She has become the line between the MAGA and Elon Musk team. Laura Loomer said ""skilled tech workers"" from India mostly hold fraud degrees. ""Their programming capabilities are abysmal. And their attitudes are even worse."" Now Laura Loomer is advocating for a divorce between Donald Trump and tech bros (Elon Musk) as Elon Musk supporter Sriram Krishnan's idea of removing the cap on visas for countries -- thereby allowing more H-1B visa holders from India. In one of her rants, she said she has a big tech executive fatigue and wants to vomit every time she seen one of them at Mar-a-Lago. ""The best thing for MAGA is for there to be a divorce between Big Tech and Donald Trump. This fake love fest is unsustainable for our country and our national security."" Laura Loomer also thinks of herself as the ""litmus test"" for being MAGA. As many Republicans blocked her because of her H-1B rant, she declared that those who blocked her are not MAGA.

Laura Loomer is a far-right influencer, activist, journalist who has been spewing venom against India in her defence of the America First policy. The 31-year-old conspiracy theorist said India does not have running water or toilet paper. She also asked why people in India excrete in the same water they bathe and drink from. Calling Indians highly skilled at stealing US jobs, she asked if India was so high-skilled, why Indians have been flocking to the US. She also said she doesn't care if she's called racist.","Laura Loomer is a far-right influencer, activist, journalist who has been spewing venom against India in her defence of the America First policy.

Many were grateful at the time. Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah!"" David Sacks wrote.Elon Musk reacted to it saying 'good times' as he has been supporting Krishnan's call to remove the country caps for green cards.Sriram Krishnan recently suggested to Elon Musk that anything to remove country caps for green cards would be huge. This was before his nomination for the AI role. MAGA activist Laura Loomer called out Sriram Krishnan for undermining America First and opening jobs for more Indians by removing the cap on H-1B.David Sacks clarified that Sriram did not say he wanted to remove all caps on green cards. ""He said he wants to remove ""country"" caps on green cards. Right now, every country in the world gets allocated the same number of green cards, no matter how many qualified applicants it has. So applicants from India have an 11 year wait whereas applicants from many other countries have no wait at all,"" Sacks said. Elon Musk supported this argument.Laura Loomer kept on ranting against India and Indians in her fight against Elon Musk, David Sacks and Sriram Krishnan. She also replied to David Sacks' reminder that they worked toward restoring her Twitter account. She said she is grateful that her X account was restored by Elon Musk but she would still push for accountability from big tech.""Dining with Trump is a reward. Advising the Trump admin is a reward.

More shocking details of the NYC subway horror emerge



Accused claims he has no memory of incident



The 33-year-old Guatemala migrant, Sebastian Zapeta-Calil , did not only set the victim on fire but also fanned the flames by waving a shirt around her aiding the spread of the fire, according to testimony from police officers on the scene, CNN reported. The medical examiner determined that the victim died of thermal injuries and smoke inhalation.Zapeta-Calil approached the victim silently approached the victim and then ignited her blanket. The woman had layers of clothing which immediately got engulfed in fire. CNN earlier reported that the victim had mobility issues and did not respond to the fire immediately. She sat still as she kept on burning and could only stand up when she was fully burnt. The suspect waved a shirt around her and then came out of the train and watched the victim turning to ashes -- from a bench outside the subway car.Zapeta-Calil did not enter a plea during his arraignment on Tuesday. He told police he did not know what happened and that he was intoxicated at that moment. He, however, identified himself in the images of the attack. Zapeta is an undocumented migrant from Giatelama who was deported in 2018. But he subsequently returned to the US illegally. His most recent address was listed as a homeless shelter in Brooklyn and other residents of the shelter identified him.They said he used to remain intoxicated but never hurt himself or anyone else. On that fateful morning, he had his breakfast at the shelter home and told his mates that he was going for his morning run. The next thing the mates saw on the television was that he got arrested for setting a woman on fire. He was arrested from a different station and at least eight hours after the incident. He is expected to appear in court again on Friday.The identity of the victim has not been ascertained but law enforcement said she was an adult, over the age of 18 and she was probably a homeless person who took the subway train to save herself from the cold.

What Donald Trump said on Luigi Mangione

Legal experts believe the transition from President Joe Biden to President-elect Donald Trump would impact the Luigi Mangione case as Donald Trump condemned Biden's latest clemency and said he would vigorously pursue the death penalty from day one of his office. ""As soon as I am inaugurated, I will direct the Justice Department to vigorously pursue the death penalty to protect American families and children from violent rapists, murderers, and monsters. We will be a Nation of Law and Order again!"" Trump said.Luigi Mangione is a murder accused who cold-bloodedly fired at UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson killing him on the spot. He has been charged with federal murder which makes him eligible for the death sentence. Apart from federal murder, he has been charged with first and second-degree murder and terror by the New York state government.Luigi Mangione gained unbelievable stardom even before he was arrested as many social media users hailed the killer for avenging the death of many Americans who must have been denied their insurance payout by UnitedHealthcare. After Luigi Mangione was arrested, he became viral for his good looks, his Ivy League education and started receiving a huge amount of funds for his legal defense. The admiration reached such a point that his looks, his sweater, his perp walk in New York -- everything makes headlines.Donald Trump did not say anything about Luigi Mangione or Brian Thompson per se but condemned the admiration he's been getting. ""How people can like this guy, that's a sickness actually. It seems like there's a certain appetite for him. I don't get it.... It was cold-blooded, just a cold-blooded, horrible killing. That's very, very bad, especially the way that it was done.""",Luigi Mangione is a murder accused who cold-bloodedly fired at UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson killing him on the spot.

A prison expert said Luigi Mangione , the accused killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson , will soon be on psych meds inside the Brooklyn jail which is known as the hell on earth. Larry Levine, the director and founder of Wall Street Prison Consultants, told the US Sun that Mangione would soon turn into a zombie as prison life is not what he's been prepared for and not the this infamous prison at least.Larry Levine said Luigi's mind is a ""little f**ked up"" right now as he never thought that he'd be in the feds. It is the same jail where Diddy had been held since his arrest in September. But Diddy and Luigi Mangione are different, Levine said analyzing both of their response to the arrests.""Luigi is acclimating himself to his new surroundings. His lawyers are thanking God he's in New York, and they don't have to travel to Pennsylvania to visit him. So he's just adjusting to where he's at.""""But Diddy can handle his s**t. I just know Mangione is f**king scared, and now they're probably trying to force-feed him. They're gonna offer him psych meds. He's gonna be like a f**king zombie. That's a given.""Levine served 10 years in federal prison on racketeering, securities fraud, obstruction of justice, and narcotics trafficking charges.Levine said if Mangione is living in a cell like Diddy was for a while, it would be like living in your bathroom. There is no TV, no computer and nothing to read except the Bible. Even in jail, Mangione has no dearth of funds as money is pouring in for the accused killer from all corners but there is no good food that he can buy in that jail, Levine said. Mangione can have cheese crackers and maybe a bottle of a soda and everything is knock-offs, no original food is available.Traditionally, the inmates get a Christmas or holiday snack including goodies such as cookies, potato chops and candy. ""It's a bunch of crap that probably was purchased because it was out of date because the prison system sells you out-of-date stuff. And they're trying to act like they're doing the inmates a favor,"" Levine said.Mangione pleaded not guilty to the New York state charges in his recent production in the court. His lawyer Karen Agnifilo blasted New York mayor Eric Adams for orchestrating Mangione's perp walk and said her client is being treated as a political fodder, a human ping-pong ball.","Luigi Mangione will be put on a steady diet of psych meds, a prison expert said.

Kabul claims Pak airstrikes killed 46 civilians in Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/kabul-claims-pak-airstrikes-killed-46-civilians-in-afghanistan/articleshow/116661701.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The interim Afghan Taliban govt claimed on Wednesday that 46 people, mostly women and children, were killed in airstrikes by Pakistani fighter jets on civilians in eastern Afghanistan late Tuesday night.Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province near Pakistan’s volatile South Waziristan tribal district, on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). This has been the fourth time in the past few years that Pakistan has conducted airstrikes inside Afghanistan, and the second time since March 2024.“Last night (Tuesday), Pakistan bombarded four points in Barmal district of Paktika province. The total number of dead is 46, most of whom were children and women,” said Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson for the Afghan Taliban govt. He added that six others, mostly children, were wounded.Condemning the airstrikes, the Afghan defence ministry called them “barbaric” and a clear “aggression”. It stated that several refugees, including women and children, were killed and injured. “The Pakistani side should understand that such arbitrary measures are not a solution to any problem,” Enayatullah Khowarazami, spokesperson for Afghanistan’s defence ministry, wrote on social media platform ‘X’. “The Islamic Emirate (Afghan Taliban regime) will not leave this cowardly act unanswered, but rather considers the defence of its territory and sovereignty to be its inalienable right,” he added.The strikes took place hours after Pakistan special representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq met interim Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul, intending to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long gap. The deteriorating ties, however, are likely to worsen following Tuesday night’s airstrikes, analysts said.Pakistan alleges the Afghan government harbours armed groups, particularly the TTP, which conducts cross-border assaults against Pakistani security forces. In one of the worst recent assaults on security forces, the TTP had claimed responsibility for the killing of at least 16 Pakistani soldiers in South Waziristan last week.Kabul, however, denies providing shelter to armed groups or allowing their territory to be used for cross-border attacks.Border tensions between the two countries have surged since the Taliban regime took control in 2021, with Pakistan experiencing a revival of militant activity along its western border. Deadly air attacks by Pakistan’s military in Afghan border regions in March, which the Taliban claimed killed eight civilians, had sparked confrontations along the the disputed border between the two countries.","Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province.

Yet now, the same individuals are lobbying internationally against these courts,"" Tarar said.He assured that military trials adhere to fair trial principles and dismissed claims of injustice in military trials.The military courts tasked to hear cases of suspects involved in the attacks on military facilities on the May 9, 2023 protest last week sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from 2-10 years.Khan's party criticized the verdicts, arguing that military courts have no jurisdiction over civilians.",Information minister Attaullah Tarar says military courts are competent to deal with cases related to attacks on army facilities.

The sanctions had frozen any US property owned by the targeted entities and barred US nationals from doing business with them.“Pakistan does not harbour any intention in which its nuclear system is aggressive, it is 100% in Pakistan’s defence. It is just intended for deterrence purposes and nothing else,” Sharif told cabinet members during a meeting.Noting that his foreign affairs ministry had given a “comprehensive response” to Washington on the matter, Sharif said, “This programme is not mine, nor any political party’s; it belongs to the 240 million people of this country, and it is dear to them. There will be no compromise on this programme, and the entire nation is united on this issue.”According to a US state department factsheet, the Islamabad-based NDC had sought to obtain components for Pakistan’s long-range ballistic-missile programme and missile-testing equipment. It stated the NDC “is responsible for the development of Pakistan’s ballistic missiles,” including the Shaheen family of missiles.The US sanctions were preceded by high-level military engagements between China and Pakistan. Last month, a top Chinese military official, General Zhang Youxia, visited Pakistan along with a high-ranking delegation. Youxia, who is vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the overall command of the Chinese military headed by President Xi Jinping, had held one-on-one talks with Pakistan army chief Gen Asim Munir during his visit. Engagements between the two sides, according to the official handout, had focused on “matters of mutual interest, regional security dynamics, measures for regional stability, and enhancing bilateral defence cooperation”.","Washington had announced on Dec 12 that it was imposing more restrictions on Pakistan’s long-range ballistic-missile system.

Four former Pakistan international airlines (PIA) employees confessed to using fake degrees to secure employment or promotions within the organisation. Among them were two pilots, a stewardess, and a data entry operator. Their confessions came after an extensive Federal investigation agency (FIA) audit, conducted in 2022, revealed that 457 PIA employees had been recruited on fraudulent credentials.The accused, who initially denied the charges, later approached the court for pre-arrest bail, which was granted. However, during their indictment, they pleaded guilty and requested to record their confessional statements. Judge Tanveer Ahmad Sheikh ensured the accused understood the implications of their confessions, allowing them 30 minutes to reconsider before recording their statements.Nazia Naheed, a former stewardess from Karachi, admitted to using a fake BA degree to gain a promotion. Hired on a contract in 2001, she was terminated in 2014 when her forged credentials were discovered. Similarly, Mohsin Ali, a co-pilot since 2006, confessed to using a fake BA degree despite the job requiring only intermediate qualifications.Arif Tarar, who served 39 years with PIA, admitted to using a fake FA degree to move from peon to data entry operator. He retired in 2018 but was implicated in the FIA probe. Lastly, Kashan Aijaz Dodhy, a cadet pilot since 1995, confessed to submitting a fake BSc degree to show extra qualifications, leading to his termination in 2019.The court sentenced the four to imprisonment until the court’s rising and imposed fines.","Four former Pakistan international airlines (PIA) employees confessed to using fake degrees to secure employment or promotions.

Copying Cirus

MUMBAI: A little-known incident in the history of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme is a purported attempt made by the country in the early ’70s to copy the design of India’s Cirus reactor — a 40 MW thermal neutron research facility, which first achieved criticality at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Trombay, near Mumbai, on July 10, 1960. An acronym for Canada India Reactor Utility Services, Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million, according to news reports.Pakistan’s attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan , a man who played a role in the neighbouring country’s nuclear weapons programme. In his book “Eating Grass: The Making Of The Pakistani Bomb”, published in 2012 by the Stanford University Press, Feroz wrote, “Munir Ahmed Khan, later chairman of the PAEC [Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission], recalled that in October 1965 he had met Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto [the then Pakistan foreign minister] in Vienna. Munir explained to him that he had been to India’s Cirus facility at Trombay in 1964 and saw for himself that India was well on its way to making the [nuclear] bomb. Bhutto asked Munir to meet Ayub Khan in December during Ayub’s upcoming visits to the United Kingdom and the United States and try to convince the president of the urgency of a weapons programme.” The country eventually carried out its first nuclear weapons tests on May 28 and 30, 1998.Feroz’s disclosure, though now 12 years old, assumes immediate significance in the context of the US last week announcing fresh sanctions on Pakistan’smissile development programme. For the first time, the measures target Pakistan’s state-run National Development Complex, for its role in the country’s mission development programme. US deputy NSA Jon Finer has said, “Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology… If these trends continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.”Feroz’s writing about the Cirus reactor is important because the plutonium for India’s Smiling Buddha project — the country’s first nuclear weapons test at Pokhran on May 18, 1974 — was from this reactor.According to Feroz, “Pakistani leadership wanted the rights to copy technological designs for its indigenous programme without incurring penalties and while remaining on the ‘good side’ of the international system.” He recalled: “While work to commission KANUPP [Karachi Nuclear Power Complex] went on, Munir Ahmed Khan said that there would be a secret team headed by a nuclear official, Sardar Ali Khan, to work on replicating India’s Cirus reactor.The author quotes Pervez Butt, who was purportedly part of the secret “copying’’ team and was chairman of PAEC between 2001 and 2005, as telling him, “Our team worked tirelessly, I did the mechanical part. When we merged our work and presented, Munir Khan could not believe it.”Feroz, however, has questioned Pakistan’s decision to copy the design of the Cirus reactor because there were some fundamental differences between Cirus and Kanupp.The team had modified the basic Cirus design.","Pakistan's attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan. Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million.

Meaningful dialogue based on positive intentions should be held,"" PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said.He stressed that the potential talks should have a defined timeframe, adding that the dialogue must progress positively considering the sensitivity of the situation.National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq had taken the lead by offering on Wednesday that he was ready to host the two sides and facilitate their parleys.He welcomed the newly constituted committee and invited the government and opposition for talks, saying ""the speaker's office is always open for members"", according to a statement issued by the NA Secretariat.The speaker called on members of both committees to meet on Monday morning, adding that he would meet them at his chambers in Parliament House.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram said his party accepted the speaker's invitation to meet. He said their committee will attend the meeting on Monday.Akram said the PTI founder will be informed about the progress of the meeting and he will decide whether to cancel the civil disobedience movement .The talks are being held after the PTI had threatened to give a call for civil disobedience.The party posted on X from the account of the jailed former prime minister regarding the call for civil disobedience movement, which was initially shared on December 19, stating that the campaign will be launched if the government doesn't make progress on the party's demands by Sunday.""I had presented two demands to the government, the release of under-trial political prisoners and the establishment of a judicial commission for a transparent investigation into the events of May 9, 2023 and November 26, 2024,"" the post quoted PTI founder Khan. It further stated that both of these demands ""are legitimate"".""If the government fails to take any action on them by Sunday, the first phase of the civil disobedience movement - 'remittance boycott' - will be launched,"" it said.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram also reiterated that the civil disobedience drive would be launched tomorrow (Monday) if the party's demands go unmet.However, the issue of civil disobedience has been apparently put on hold for some time while allowing the two sides to address the differences through political means.Khan, 72, on December 5 had warned of a civil disobedience movement from December 14 if his demands about the release of political prisoners facing trial and the formation of a judicial commission to probe the events of May 9, 2023, and November 26 this year were unmet.Meanwhile, Pakistan's military courts sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for attacking military installations during riots which erupted following the arrest of Khan in May last year, the Army announced on Saturday.On May 9, 2023, Khan's PTI supporters allegedly attacked several military installations, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and the ISI building in Faisalabad, to vent their anger against the arrest of their party founder in a corruption case.Hundreds of suspects were arrested in the countrywide swoop and at least 103 were handed over to the military authorities for trial due to their involvement in attacks on military installations.Khan's party has launched multiple protests through 2023 and 2024 demanding the release of their supreme leader, the latest being in November 2024.The former prime minister, currently lodged at the Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, was arrested in August last year and faces multiple cases since his government was toppled in April 2022.","The committee includes deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan.

"1,566 terror attacks killed 924 in Pakistan over past 10 months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/1566-terror-attacks-killed-924-in-pakistan-over-past-10-months/articleshow/116551393.cms,"KARACHI: Ten years have passed since Ajoon Khan's son died in a ghastly attack by the Pakistani Taliban that killed about 150 people, mostly children, at a military-run school in Peshawar, in northwestern Pakistan. But the pain of loss is unrelenting - it grows only deeper with time. Khan, a lawyer, said he could never forget the parents sobbing and pleading outside the school gates.The brutal assault on the school in Peshawar led to rare political unity in support of a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy for Pakistan and a vast military operation in the country's former tribal areas near Afghanistan. The efforts forced militants to retreat across the border and brought a degree of relative peace to Pakistan. Large-scale terrorist attacks were significantly reduced, with fatalities dropping from 2,451 across 1,717 attacks in 2013 to 220 in 146 attacks in 2020. But the hard-won gains are now in jeopardy.Over the past few years, violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan. Experts attribute the increase to the Afghan Taliban's seizure of power in neighbouring Afghanistan in Aug 2021.Last week, the interior ministry reported that 924 people, including civilians and law enforcement personnel, had been killed in 1,566 terrorist attacks across the country over the past 10 months. It said 341 terrorists had been killed during the period.Early on Saturday, sixteen soldiers were killed in northwest Pakistan in an attack by Islamist militants, a senior police official in the South Waziristan region said. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack, giving a higher figure for the number of personnel killed, Reuters reported.Experts and security officials have identified a range of challenges impeding Pakistan's progress against terrorism: political instability, weak governance, dwindling public support, economic constraints and reduced US counterterrorism assistance after the end of the 20-year war in Afghanistan.""The greatest challenge lies in mobilising the necessary financial resources and manpower for operations across such vast regions,"" said Muhammad Amir Rana, director of the Pak Institute for Peace Studies, a security think tank in Islamabad. The source of the problem for Pakistan, experts say, is found across the border, in Afghanistan.The Taliban administration in Kabul, the Afghan capital, denies accusations of harbouring militants from TTP. But Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace, said the TTP had been given ""a permissive safe haven in Afghanistan,"" which had allowed it to become ""resilient and lethal.""Pakistani security officials privately acknowledged that they had misjudged how the new Taliban rulers of Afghanistan would handle TTP. The officials had anticipated that the Taliban leaders would help curb the TTP in return for the covert support that Pakistan had provided them during the US-led war. Instead, the Taliban in Kabul have provided the TTP with resources and advanced American-made weapons and equipment seized after the collapse of the US-supported Afghan govt, according to a senior security official in Islamabad who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The TTP has gone on to unleash a wave of attacks inside Pakistan as it wages a campaign whose aim is to overthrow the govt. Among them was a suicide bombing in January 2023 that killed over 100 people at a mosque in Peshawar.Pakistani security forces have also been locked in a conflict with ethnic separatist groups in Balochistan, an arid province bordering Afghanistan and Iran that is home to the Chinese-run port Gwadar. nyt","Violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan.

Sixteen Pakistani soldiers were killed and five critically injured on Saturday after militants attacked an army post near the Afghan border.The attack happened overnight in the Makeen area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, roughly 40 kms (24 miles) from the border.More than 30 militants assaulted the post, according to two intelligence officials who spoke to AFP (anonymously). The attack lasted two hours. “The militants set fire to the wireless communication equipment, documents and other items present at the checkpoint,” one official said. The militants then retreated.The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility, stating the attack was “in retaliation for the martyrdom of our senior commanders.”The militants reported getting hold of significant military equipment, including machine guns and night vision technology.Meanwhile, in connection to another attack on Pakistan military in May last year, 25 people have been sentenced to periods of two to 10 years of ""rigorous imprisonment"", the military's media wing announced on Saturday. ""This is an important milestone in dispensation of justice to the nation,"" the Inter-Services Public Relations said in a statement. ""It is also a stark reminder to all those who are exploited by the vested interests and fall prey to their political propaganda and intoxicating lies, to never take law in own hands ever in the future.""Since the Taliban's ascent to power in Afghanistan in 2021, Pakistan has experienced increased militant activity along its western frontiers. Authorities contend that Kabul's administration is not taking sufficient action against militants who conduct attacks on Pakistan from across the border.Afghanistan's current leadership has made commitments to remove foreign militant groups from their territory.However, a July UN Security Council document indicated approximately 6,500 TTP fighters are stationed in Afghanistan, noting that ""the Taliban do not conceive of TTP as a terrorist group"".The report indicated that Afghan Taliban provide ""ad hoc support to, and tolerance of, TTP operations, including the supplying of weapons and permission for training"".The increased militant activity has strained relations between Islamabad and Kabul. Security concerns were cited as a key factor in Pakistan's initiative last year to remove hundreds of thousands of undocumented Afghan residents.","More than 30 militants assaulted the post, according to two intelligence officials.

History of displacement

Authorities respond

At least 17 houses belonging to the Christian Tripura community were allegedly set ablaze on Christmas Eve night at Sarai Union in Lama upazila, Bandarban, reported the Daily Star.The arson attack left the residents, who were away in a nearby village for prayers and Christmas celebrations, homeless and devastated.According to victims, the miscreants targeted the new Tongjhiri Tripura Para, where the community had rebuilt their homes after being displaced several years ago.Locals reported that 17 out of 19 houses in the village were completely gutted, leaving little to salvage.Tongjhiri has long been home to the Tripura community, but residents alleged they were forcibly evicted several years ago and claimed that the land on which they were living, had been leased to the wife of a high-ranking police officer during the Awami League regime.Paisapru Tripura, the head of the community, told the outlet, ""We have been living here for three or four generations. A group of people, identifying themselves as 'SP's men,' evicted us four to five years ago.""The community returned and rebuilt their homes following the fall of the Awami League government.Gungamani Tripura, one of the victims, shared his anguish, ""Our houses have been completely burned to ashes. We could not save anything. Today is supposed to be our happiest day, but this has turned into a nightmare. We demand exemplary punishment for the criminals.""Md Idris, chairman of Sarai Union Parishad, confirmed about the incident, adding that 17 houses were destroyed. Acting Lama Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO), Ruppayan Deb, visited the site and provided initial relief, including a blanket and a sack of rice for each affected family.""I have asked the families to file a written complaint,"" Ruppayan Deb said. ""We will coordinate with the deputy commissioner and the upazila project implementation officer for further action"", Deb added.Md Enamul Haque Bhuiyan, inspector (investigation) of Lama Police Station, noted that land disputes in the remote area have been ongoing, with complaints and counter-complaints of land grabbing reported since August 5. He assured that law enforcement is working diligently to identify the perpetrators and conduct a fair investigation.","At least 17 houses belonging to the Christian Tripura community were allegedly set ablaze on Christmas Eve night at Sarai Union in Lama upazila, Bandarban.

'Political witch hunt': Hasina's son accuses Yunus govt of 'weaponising the judiciary',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/political-witch-hunt-hasinas-son-accuses-yunus-govt-of-weaponising-the-judiciary/articleshow/116648697.cms,"Muhammad Yunus and Sheikh Hasina (File ph

Sanjeeb Wazed , son of ousted Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina , has accused the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government of ""weaponising the judiciary"" to carry out a "" political witch hunt "" against the Awami League leadership.His allegations made in a detailed post on X, came shortly after the Bangladeshi interim government sent a diplomatic note to New Delhi seeking Hasina's extradition .Hasina, 77, has been residing in India since August 5, after fleeing Bangladesh amid massive student-led protests that toppled her 16-year rule. Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has since issued arrest warrants for her and several former cabinet members, citing ""crimes against humanity and genocide.""In his post, Wazed, an IT entrepreneur and former ICT adviser in Hasina's government, condemned the ICT process, describing it as a ""farcical trial"" orchestrated by judges and prosecutors appointed by the unelected Yunus-led regime.He claimed the tribunal was part of a broader effort to persecute Awami League leaders, alleging extrajudicial killings, mass incarcerations, and violent attacks on party activists.""The kangaroo tribunal and subsequent request for extradition come while hundreds of leaders and activists are extrajudicially killed, framed with outrageous charges, and subjected to violent attacks, including looting, vandalism, and arson,"" Wazed wrote.India confirmed receiving the diplomatic communication but refrained from commenting. Under the India-Bangladesh extradition treaty, extradition can be denied for offenses of a ""political character.""Bangladesh's de facto foreign minister Touhid Hossain pointed out that Dhaka seeks Hasina's return to face judicial proceedings.However, Wazed expressed no confidence in the ICT, citing the appointment of chief prosecutor Tajul Islam, whom he accused of spreading misinformation about an alleged Interpol red notice against Hasina.""This is a desperate bid to extradite her and hold a farcical trial to serve the interests of Dr Yunus,"" Wazed alleged, pointing out that the prosecutor later retracted his statement after media exposure.""We reiterate our position that every single incident of human rights violation between July and August need to be investigated in a free and fair manner but the Yunus led regime weaponised the judiciary, and we express no confidence on the justice system,"" he added.Meanwhile, Yunus, who assumed office on August 8, defended the government’s actions. In a national address marking 100 days in power, he confirmed plans to seek Hasina’s extradition, saying, “We must ensure justice in every killing.” Yunus also claimed that over 1,500 people had been killed and nearly 20,000 injured during protests leading to Hasina's ouster.India has expressed growing concerns about attacks on minorities, including Hindus, in neighbouring Bangladesh since the political upheaval. During a recent visit to its capital, Dhaka, foreign secretary Vikram Misri raised these issues, emphasising the safety and welfare of minorities.In response, Hasina has accused the interim government of perpetrating ""genocide"" and failing to protect minority communities.","Sanjeeb Wazed, son of ousted Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina, has accused the interim government of ""weaponising the judiciary"" The interim government has sent a diplomatic note to New Delhi seeking Hasina's extradition.

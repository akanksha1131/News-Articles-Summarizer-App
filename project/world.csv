A Tribute to Visionaries

Art as a bridge between past and future





Strengthening national identity through creative initiatives





The artist behind the vision









A monumental new artwork now commands the façade of Dubai International Financial Centre’s Gate Building, honoring the UAE’s Founding Fathers and celebrating the nation’s journey from its historic roots to its bold future. Commissioned under the directive of H.H. Sheikh Ahmed bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Second Deputy Ruler of Dubai and Chairman of the Dubai Media Council, the installation serves as a striking centerpiece of Dubai’s ‘National Month’ campaign, blending artistic vision with national prideAs part of the ongoing ‘National Month’ celebrations in Dubai, Brand Dubai, the creative arm of the Government of Dubai Media Office, partnered with Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) to unveil a large-scale installation on the façade of The Gate Building, an iconic landmark of the Centre.The artwork pays homage to the UAE’s Founding Fathers, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan and the late Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum. It forms a centerpiece of the #ZayedAndRashid campaign, organised for the second consecutive year by Brand Dubai, which runs from UAE Flag Day on 3 November to the 54th Eid Al Etihad on 2 December. The installation visually narrates the story of the Union and the nation’s continuous achievements across generations.Shaima Al Suwaidi, Director of Brand Dubai, highlighted the importance of the collaboration, stating, “We take pride in our renewed partnership with DIFC for the third consecutive year to mark key national occasions through creative works that express our deep gratitude to the founding leaders Sheikh Zayed and Sheikh Rashid, who together laid the foundations of the Union.”The artwork, designed by Emirati artist Ahmed BaFadhl, captures the UAE’s identity with a blend of national spirit and creative vision. It merges portraits of the Founding Fathers with symbols of modern achievement, including the Hope Probe, Etihad-SAT, Rashid Rover 2, and the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre’s Rashid Rover. This combination reflects the UAE’s trajectory from its historic founding to its pioneering role in science and space exploration.Al Suwaidi emphasized that the installation conveys both heritage and ambition: “The artwork reflects the enduring legacy and vision that continue to shape the UAE. It embodies values of determination and faith, while inspiring the community to carry forward the nation’s journey of progress.”Alya Al Zarouni, Chief Operating Officer at DIFC, remarked, “The stunning artwork on The Gate Building blends heritage with future aspirations and symbolises how economic leadership and innovation are anchored in strong national foundations.”Amina Taher, Member of the #ZayedAndRashid Campaign Organising Committee, noted that the installation exemplifies the power of art in conveying a national message of loyalty and belonging. The campaign’s creative initiatives, from murals to community events—have become tangible symbols of the Union’s spirit, helping younger generations connect with their history while looking toward the future.Standing 50 metres tall, the artwork is part of a series of events organised by Brand Dubai with government, semi-government, and private sector partners. These activations pay tribute to the historic meeting of the Founding Fathers in Al Khawaneej, marking the beginning of the Union, while reinforcing the unity of Emirati society and its enduring bond with the nation’s leadership.Ahmed BaFadhl, an architect and visual creator, drew inspiration from his late grandfather and the UAE’s landscape to develop a style that blends simplicity with imagination. Starting with pencil and coffee sketches, he now uses digital art to create works that express both emotion and national identity. His approach embodies a distinctly Emirati perspective, connecting traditional values with modern creativity.","50-metre Gate Building artwork honors UAE Founding Fathers, blending portraits, space symbols, and national pride.

"‘It’s an op, dude’: Bombshell texts reveal how Bannon secretly helped Epstein rehab his image",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/its-an-op-dude-bombshell-texts-reveal-how-bannon-secretly-helped-epstein-rehab-his-image/articleshow/125358553.cms,"



A lot of names have been released in the Jeffrey Epstein case, and one of them is ""Steve Bannon,"" a former White House chief strategist. The new document revealed text messages between Bannon and Epstein.Texts released by the House oversight committee on Wednesday show that from June 2018 through mid-2019, Steve Bannon, a Maga influencer and convicted sex offender, and Jeffrey Epstein, collaborated on legal and media strategies to shield Epstein from public scrutiny and legal challenges while also promoting Bannon’s rightwing populist agenda. The communications reveal detailed planning of interviews, opinion pieces, film production and crisis communications, Guardian reported.The messages, numbering hundreds over almost a year, emerged as public outrage mounted over Epstein’s criminal history and his connections to powerful figures. In early exchanges from June 2018 Bannon described the scrutiny as “a sophisticated op” and advised Epstein on responses to media outlets, the justice system and his victims.In one unredacted exchange on June 22-2018, Bannon asked Epstein: “Who is running this op on u something serious going on.”Epstein replied: “First a protest at Clinton and then at Trump. Lots of people very angry at our friendship.” Bannon responded: “It’s an op dude – I do this for a living – the pieces that are dropping are deeply researched. This is sophisticated op.”By November the Miami Herald began publishing blockbuster coverage highlighting Epstein’s misdeeds and apparent leniency. In December an unknown correspondent tried to reassure Epstein, writing: “It will all blow over! They’re really just trying to take down Trump and doing whatever they can to do that … !” Epstein replied: “yes thx. its wild. because i am the one able to take him down.”In early February 2019 Bannon linked Epstein to an item on Zero Hedge quoting Republican then senator Ben Sasse. Epstein wrote: “Yes/ wild,” and shared a Fox News item. He then asked for advice: “Continue to ignore? Ann Coulter on hannity/. Attack? Op ed , ? Not my skill set. What about the attunes penning something that suggests indignation and lays out some of the facts.”Bannon advised: “I think makes it way worse.” Epstein asked: “K, what about Ken talking directly to sasse.” Bannon replied: “Won’t help but yes.” Other exchanges reference Ken Starr, Epstein’s 2007 defender and later counsel in the Trump impeachment trial.Later that month Bannon counseled on interviews: “If you do an interview it can’t be like ‘Johnnie does a utube’ – has to be amazingly professional and perfectly cut.” Epstein replied: “woody said he would help edit. not sure how to stage, what points to make. but better than trying to do an interview that i have no experience doing. goal to himanize the monster. anything written carries iittle weight.” Epstein then sought Bannon’s technical advice on format, topics and style.The following day Epstein attacked his victims in a text: “One of the most important facts for the public seems to be the girls used the agreement to get money and only after then tried to have it voided.”By April the pair appeared to plan a film production to “redeem” Epstein’s reputation. On 30 April Epstein wrote: “the christians i met with feel , the media portraying me as beyond redemption is deeply troubling and offensive.” Bannon replied: “Yes yes yes of course – but we must counter ‘rapist who traffics in female children to be raped by worlds most powerful , richest men’ – that can’t be redeemed – that why we let them blow up the argument while showing the 12 you redeemed. Can’t redeem unredeemable – – you are a lot of things – which we will show – but you are NOT that.” He then asked: “Did u get the film we shot ?” Epstein replied: “Just landed.” They discussed filming and crew size, with Bannon advising a “limited crew – 5 max prob 3.” Further texts addressed Epstein’s appearance.In May 2019 Bannon urged Epstein to hire a crisis communications professional. He texted: “Did u hire the crisis comms guy so we can drive the narrative off that great times piece.” Epstein replied: “Hes here with me now. He thinks stick to legal legal legal . A deal is a deal etc. and then a few months from now.” Epstein added: “Decide how to deal with the pervert hermit image and fill the box with another narrative.” Bannon said: “Agree:: how are we ‘sticking to the legal legal legal. ” Epstein wrote: “Articles by legal people . Professors. Lawyers etc. now I’m focused.” Bannon responded: “U had me worried – focus good.”On 28 May Epstein and Bannon criticised Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury. Epstein wrote: “I have now seen some of Wolffs book. Mentions me and underage prostitutes. You as the man behind and in front of the curtain. Lots of Steve quotes. Lots.” Bannon replied: “Ugh – anything awful??? Wish he hadn’t done that – why are u mentioned @ all?” Epstein said: “Palm beach house purchase. . don’t reach out to Michael.” Bannon responded: “Ugh. ” He also reacted “ugh” to a Raw Story link sent by Epstein.On 25 June, weeks before Epstein’s re-arrest, Epstein texted Bannon a Miami Herald headline: “Jeffrey Epstein plea deal must stand, prosecutors tell sex abuse victims.” Bannon responded: “Dude!!!! Is this real Tell me this is real” and “Is that out anywhere yet.” Epstein replied: “Miami herald. But more and better july 9.” Bannon said: “Epic epic epic.” Epstein was re-arrested on 7 July.In other exchanges Epstein commented on unrelated political events. In May he wrote: “Underwater office ? How nuts are these people.” On 3 June, the day of a royal visit to the UK, Epstein texted: “prince andrew and trump today. t000 funny” and “recall prince andrews accuser came out of mara lago.” Bannon said: “Can’t believe nobody is making u the connective tissue.”The communications also show Epstein advising Bannon in September 2018 on how to undermine allegations against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh by focusing on Christine Blasey Ford’s medications. On 30 September 2018 Epstein told Bannon Republicans should “make sure they ask ford about her medications , what type and for how long. . my guess is that katz won’t let her answer”. Bannon replied: “Roger.” Epstein sent links on false memories and added: “she couldn’t recall if the lie detector was given the same day as her mothers funeral or the next day. ? MEDS.” Bannon asked: “Is this a hint” and Epstein said “duh”.Epstein’s correspondent identity is redacted throughout the files, but contextual evidence and an unredacted phone number in one document link the communications to Bannon and match a number cited in a legal case against Trump adviser Roger Stone. Bannon did not respond to requests for comment. When Elon Musk stated earlier this year that “Bannon is in the Epstein files”, Bannon told the Independent he wanted a special investigator to review “all” the Epstein documents.Bannon left the Trump White House in late summer 2017 but maintained influence as a Maga figure. The texts outline how both men coordinated legal defences, shaped public perception and sought to protect Epstein’s reputation while advancing Bannon’s political objectives.","Texts released by the House oversight committee on Wednesday show that from June 2018 through mid-2019, Steve Bannon and Jeffrey Epstein collaborated on legal and media strategies.

Hasan Piker reacts to claims and talks about China, Cuba, and IShowSpeed







Hasan Piker, who everyone knows as HasanAbi on Twitch, spoke very openly after many people online said he was “spreading Chinese propaganda.” He talked about this during his livestream on November 14, 2025. The talk started when he read a post from X (Twitter) made on November 13, 2025, by user @joni_askola. The post said that Hasan Piker was “doing Chinese propaganda for a living.” This comment came while Hasan is on a trip to China.Hasan Piker said he does not agree with these claims. He told his viewers that China is a country with good things and bad things, just like any other place, and visiting the country does not mean he is promoting anything.He also said that many foreign affairs people are “not very fond” of him being in China right now. Hasan shared that he finds it strange that people get angry when he goes to China but do not react the same way when he visits other places like Japan. During the stream , Hasan Piker read the full post from @joni_askola and said he did not understand why people think traveling to China means he supports everything the government does. He said he always talks about both sides, the good and the bad, and that he enjoys learning about new cultures and meeting people.He said he feels lucky to be able to visit China and see things with his own eyes. He shared that the food, culture, and people have all been very nice to him. He also said that online critics make travel seem like a crime, which he finds very odd.Hasan Piker compared the reaction to when YouTuber IShowSpeed went to China. He said nobody gave IShowSpeed the same trouble because many of IShowSpeed’s fans are very young and do not stay active on X. Hasan explained that younger fans usually do not argue on social media the same way older audiences do.Hasan then talked about Cuba. He joked that a trip to Cuba would be even worse because he believes he would land in prison afterwards. This came up when a viewer commented that people would react the same way if he went to Cuba.Also Read: Who Is Jack Doherty?

In the entire history of the United States, the country has never elected a female president. This year, as nations from Japan to Italy make headlines by elevating women to their highest offices, the US still lags.So, is America ready for a woman in the Oval Office?According to former First Lady Michelle Obama , the answer is no. She said the country is still not prepared for a female president and that the US has “a lot of growing up to do.”“As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain’t ready,” Obama said. “That’s why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying. You’re not ready for a woman. You are not.” President Donald Trump defeated former vice president Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.Obama made the remarks during a November 5 conversation at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for her podcast. The discussion with actor Tracee Ellis Ross centred on Obama’s new book, “The Look.”Ross had asked Obama if she felt that the first lady role, serving as an archetype for “wifedom and femininity,” had affected “the room that we’ve made for a woman to be president.” “You know, we got a lot of growing up to do, and there’s still, sadly, a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it,” Obama continued.Obama stumped for Harris on the 2024 campaign trail, drawing large crowds to campaign events, advocating for women’s health care and pleading with men to vote for Harris. The former first lady has faced speculation and calls to run for president but has repeatedly said she does not want to seek the Oval Office.",Former First Lady Michelle Obama said the country is not ready for a female president.

"‘Unnecessary fear’: Border patrol deployments prompt arrests, alarm, and political pushback in Charlotte",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/unnecessary-fear-border-patrol-deployments-prompt-arrests-alarm-and-political-pushback-in-charlotte/articleshow/125358145.cms,"



Border patrol deployments triggered a wave of arrests in Charlotte on Saturday, with federal agents moving into multiple locations.“We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.Local officials including Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles criticised the operation, saying it “are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.” The statement, also signed by County Commissioner Mark Jerrell and Stephanie Sneed of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg education board, added, “We want people in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to know we stand with all residents who simply want to go about their lives.”Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden confirmed earlier this week that two federal officials had told him Customs agents would be arriving soon.Paola Garcia, a spokesperson with Camino — a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte — said she and her colleagues had observed an increase in Border Patrol and ICE agents pulling people over since Friday. “Basically what we're seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,” Garcia said. “I even saw a few people being pulled over on the way to work yesterday, and then just from community members seeing an increase in ICE and border patrol agents in the city of Charlotte.Willy Aceituno, a Honduran-born US citizen, was on his way to work when he saw agents chasing people. “I saw a lot of Latinos running. I wondered why they were running. The thing is, there were a lot of Border Patrol agents chasing them,” he said. Aceituno, a 46-year-old Charlotte resident, said he was stopped twice by Border Patrol agents. On the second encounter, they forced him out of his vehicle after breaking the car window and threw him to the ground. “I told them, 'I'm an American citizen,'” he told The Associated Press. “They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn't believe I was an American citizen.” He was finally allowed to go free after showing documents that proved his citizenship.Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials.Local organisations responded by holding trainings to inform immigrants of their rights and considering peaceful protests. President Donald Trump’s administration has defended federal enforcement operations in cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago as necessary for fighting crime and enforcing immigration laws.Governor Josh Stein, a Democrat with a Republican-majority legislature, said on Friday that the “vast majority” of those detained in these operations had no criminal convictions, and some were American citizens. He urged people to record any “inappropriate behaviour” they saw and notify local law enforcement about it.The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department had emphasised ahead of time that it was not involved in federal immigration enforcement.","Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born.

When and how to watch the Northern Lights





What makes this Aurora event unique





Understanding the science behind the Northern Lights





How geomagnetic storms are classified





Tips to improve your chances of seeing the Northern Lights





Find a dark viewing spot far from city lights and face north for the best view. Light pollution can wash out faint auroras, so rural or elevated areas are ideal.

Use your smartphone camera as many modern phone cameras are more sensitive to light than the human eye and can detect faint auroras before they become visible.

Let your eyes adjust to the dark for at least 20 to 30 minutes and avoid looking at bright screens. This allows your vision to adapt to low light and makes it easier to spot subtle colour shifts in the sky.

Dress warmly because temperatures can drop significantly at night, especially in northern regions. Layered clothing, gloves, and hats are essential for comfort during long viewing periods.

Be patient. The Northern Lights are unpredictable and can appear suddenly. Staying outdoors for an extended period improves your chances of witnessing the spectacle.

What to do if you miss tonight’s display

The night sky across the United States is expected to dazzle millions as the Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, become visible in over twenty states from November 11 to 12, 2025. This rare spectacle is fueled by heightened solar activity, including several powerful solar eruptions that send charged particles hurtling toward Earth at incredible speeds. As these particles interact with the planet’s magnetic field, they create stunning displays of shifting light in shades of green, pink, and violet, dancing across the sky in dynamic, ever-changing patterns. The phenomenon, usually confined to polar regions, may reach as far south as states like Kansas and Virginia, offering a rare opportunity for Americans to witness one of nature’s most captivating and colourful celestial events.The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, are expected to dazzle skywatchers across the United States tonight, offering a rare opportunity for millions to witness one of nature’s most mesmerising displays. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), enhanced solar activity has created ideal conditions for auroral visibility, pushing the colourful phenomenon much farther south than usual.If weather conditions remain clear, shimmering curtains of green, pink, and violet light could illuminate the skies across multiple regions, from the Pacific Northwest to the Northeast. This widespread coverage marks one of the most extensive Northern Lights forecasts in recent years, making tonight a particularly exciting occasion for stargazers and photographers alike.Here’s the list of US states:Timing is crucial for observing the aurora borealis. NOAA’s three-day geomagnetic forecast predicts that activity will peak late in the evening and continue into the early hours of 12 November. The best viewing windows are expected to be between 4 pm and 10 pm EST (2100–0300 GMT) for minor to moderate activity, and between 10 pm and 1 am EST (0300–0600 GMT) for stronger geomagnetic storm levels.During these peak hours, observers may witness luminous arcs or shimmering curtains of light dancing across the northern horizon. In some areas, the lights could stretch overhead in glowing ribbons that shift and ripple as magnetic fields interact.The combination of multiple CMEs and an exceptionally powerful solar flare makes this event stand out from recent auroral displays. The convergence of these solar bursts increases the likelihood of intense geomagnetic disturbances. Such interactions can create stacked auroras, where layers of colour overlap, giving the sky an even richer appearance. The last time auroras of this strength reached similar latitudes was during strong solar events several years ago. Additionally, solar activity tends to rise and fall in roughly 11-year cycles known as solar cycles. We are currently nearing the peak of Solar Cycle 25, which explains the recent increase in both sunspots and flares that are the main drivers of auroral events, producing spectacular skies visible to many observers across high-latitude regions.The Northern Lights occur when streams of charged particles from the Sun, known as the solar wind, reach Earth and interact with gases in the upper atmosphere. These collisions release energy in the form of light, producing the stunning patterns that dance across the sky.Oxygen atoms are responsible for the green and red colours most commonly seen, while nitrogen produces blue and purple hues. The exact colours depend on which gases are hit and at what altitude the interactions take place.This week’s event is particularly special because several coronal mass ejections (CMEs), enormous bursts of plasma and magnetic energy from the Sun, are headed toward Earth. These CMEs are part of heightened solar activity linked to an X5.1-class solar flare, the most powerful flare recorded so far in 2025. When these charged particles collide with Earth’s magnetic field, they can cause strong geomagnetic storms, expanding the auroral oval and pushing the Northern Lights much farther south than usual.Geomagnetic storms are measured on a five-level scale from G1 (minor) to G5 (extreme). These classifications are determined by the strength of the disturbance in Earth’s magnetic field.A G3 storm is strong enough to make auroras visible at mid-latitudes, while a G4 storm can extend the visibility range even farther south and may affect some radio communications and satellite operations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued a G4 geomagnetic storm watch, suggesting that much of the continental United States could witness the aurora. It is rare for auroras to reach such southern latitudes, making this a potentially historic event for skywatchers.While space weather determines when the aurora will occur, your viewing experience depends largely on preparation and local conditions. Experts recommend several strategies to increase your odds of seeing the lights clearly.If cloudy skies or poor visibility spoil your view tonight, there is still hope. The sequence of solar eruptions means geomagnetic activity could remain elevated for several days. Keep an eye on forecast updates through NOAA’s channels or dedicated aurora-tracking apps, as new opportunities may arise later this week.Even if you miss this particular show, solar activity is expected to stay strong for the remainder of the year, providing additional chances for aurora sightings across mid-latitudes.","The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, are expected to dazzle skywatchers across the United States tonight.

"Where is Aleksander Barkov, and how long will the Florida Panthers be without their Captain after his injury?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/where-is-aleksander-barkov-and-how-long-will-the-florida-panthers-be-without-their-captain-after-his-injury/articleshow/125351747.cms,"Aleksander Barkov (Image Via Twitter)

What are the reasons behind the Florida Panthers captain Aleksander Barkov’s absence?





At the Baptist Health IcePlex in Fort Lauderdale, the atmosphere was so tense that for a few moments, the ice did not make a sound when Aleksander Barkov fell during a captain's routine preseason drill. The whole situation very quickly went from being a simple deke attempt in a non-contact session to being about concern when his right leg gave way under him, leaving him rolling on the ice with a visible sign of pain. Trainers were immediately upon him while his teammates stood still, watching their captain in difficulty. A short while later, Barkov was led off the ice, putting almost no weight on the injured leg—a situation which would become one of the biggest early-season setbacks for the Panthers.By the next day, the Florida Panthers revealed that Barkov had experienced severe ACL and MCL damage, thus requiring an operation, which would keep him off the ice for seven to nine months. This prognosis not only means that the lion’s share of the regular season is out of reach but also takes away the hope of him being part of the Finnish team at the Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics. For a team that is aiming for a rare three-peat, the loss of their captain for such a long time terribly alters the expectations, and, even before the opening night, there is already a need for major adjustments in the roster.Aleksander Barkov, as fans are well aware, is not participating, and his absence is not the end of the world for the Florida Panthers. According to the organization, he will be out for at least two months after suffering a knee injury during practice on September 26, 2025. The lack of Barkov, accompanied by Matthew Tkachuk's post-surgery recovery, creates a huge void in leadership and playmaking. Florida has no choice but to rely on its depth—the younger centers, the defensive-minded forwards, and the role players—to get through the initial phase of the season. Even though Barkov's return for the playoffs is not completely ruled out, the Panthers will have to go through several months of hockey without the two-way player who is often the mainstay of their identity.Before getting injured, Barkov had already secured his franchise status. The Panthers' top scorer in almost all major offensive categories: games played (804), goals (286), assists (496), points (782), power-play goals (84), and game-winning goals (52) to this day. He is a three-time winner of the Selke Trophy who works and plays hard throughout the season and is known for his tight-knit relationship with the referees.As Barkov starts his long rehabilitation, the hope of the fans is that their captain will make it back in time to have an impact during the most critical phase of the season. The team's history-making quest will be determined by how well they manage to cope without their most dependable player on the ice in the meantime.More coverage on NHL","Aleksander Barkov will be out for at least two months after suffering a knee injury during practice on September 26, 2025.

Red Sea Global: Driving regenerative development









Saudi Arabia is set to redefine luxury, wellness, and economic impact with the opening of AMAALA Triple Bay. Developed by Red Sea Global, the ultra-luxury coastal destination on the Red Sea is projected to create 50,000 jobs and inject USD 3 billion into the nation’s GDP, marking a landmark step in the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 transformation. Beyond its economic significance, AMAALA promises an unparalleled fusion of regenerative tourism, wellness experiences, and world-class hospitality.AMAALA, derived from the Arabic word for hope, is nestled across three naturally occurring bays where the Hijaz Mountains meet the Red Sea. The destination offers a new approach to coastal luxury, with a focus on wellness, rejuvenation, and connection to nature. Its guiding principle is simple: to help guests and residents “live longer, better,” whether through tranquil retreats or adventure-filled experiences along the sun-drenched coastline.John Pagano, Group CEO of Red Sea Global, underscores the ambition: AMAALA is envisioned as the new home of wellness, drawing inspiration from Saudi Arabia’s long-standing traditions of retreat and renewal. The destination is designed to balance high-end luxury with environmental and cultural stewardship.AMAALA’s launch will introduce six world-class resorts, alongside a yacht club, marine life institute, state-of-the-art marina, and a Marina Village. A 5km linear park, the Wellness Route, will connect the resorts and experiences, allowing visitors to traverse pristine natural surroundings seamlessly.Additional first-phase attractions include Corallium, a three-level marine life institute highlighting the Red Sea’s biodiversity, and the AMAALA Hotel, offering 144 keys and multiple dining options for staff and guests alike.AMAALA is integral to Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030. Red Sea Global anticipates the project will create 50,000 jobs and contribute SAR 11 billion (USD 3 billion) to the national GDP upon completion. Phase One alone involved an investment of SAR 51.04 billion, encompassing nine resorts and over 1,600 keys. Future openings include the Clinique La Prairie Health Resort, Jayasom Wellness Resort, and The Ritz-Carlton Resort.The destination also promotes sustainable development at a global scale. Designed to host no more than 500,000 visitors annually, AMAALA aims to achieve a 30% net conservation benefit to local ecosystems by 2040. The development is fully powered by renewable energy, preventing the emission of 350,000 tCO₂e each year.Guests can now easily reach AMAALA via the Red Sea International Airport, now offering direct flights from Doha, Dubai, Jeddah, and Riyadh. Transfers to the resorts will be conducted in luxury electric vehicles, with additional convenient European routes imminent. AlWajh Airport is scheduled to fully reopen in 2026, further enhancing regional accessibility and connectivity.Red Sea Global, wholly owned by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, is a multi-project developer committed to regenerative tourism. The company prioritises environmental protection, community upliftment, and sustainable economic growth. AMAALA exemplifies this vision, combining luxury development with environmental stewardship, cultural heritage preservation, and socio-economic impact.The project reflects RSG’s broader ambition to demonstrate how luxury tourism can be both world-class and responsible, serving as a model for destinations globally while actively contributing to the wellbeing of communities and ecosystems.","AMAALA, derived from the Arabic word for hope, is nestled across three naturally occurring bays where the Hijaz Mountains meet the Red Sea.

Just months after its opening, a portion of a highway bridge in China’s Sichuan province collapsed on Tuesday, giving in to a combination of a landslide and apparent structural weakness.The Hongqi bridge in Maerkang, is a 758-metre-long span on a national highway designed to improve travel between Sichuan, China’s central regions, and Tibet, Reuters reported.Footage from the scene shows debris slamming onto the bridge, with part of the span breaking away and falling into the river below. A large plume of dust rose from the collapse site as rubble scattered across the surrounding valley.The bridge was only completed earlier this year, a milestone that the contractor, Sichuan Road & Bridge Group, shared in a video posted on social media.Local authorities confirmed that the incident occurred when landslides struck a mountainside overlooking the structure.However, there were no casualties as the bridge was already closed to traffic before the collapse.Police had shut the structure on Monday afternoon after engineers spotted cracks on slopes and nearby roads, and detected shifts in the mountain terrain above the bridge. Officials in Maerkang said that the closure decision was taken as soon as the cracks and ground movement were detected, and that worsening instability on Tuesday directly led to the collapse, New York Post reported.According to the local government, conditions deteriorated rapidly the following day.On Tuesday afternoon, the weakening mountainside gave way, triggering landslides that destroyed the approach bridge and roadbed.The destroyed bridge section was part of a key highway link intended to ease travel between Sichuan, China’s interior, and the Tibetan Plateau.","A portion of a highway bridge in China's Sichuan province collapsed on Tuesday, giving in to a combination of a landslide and apparent structural weakness.

Nikki Haley Warns Donald Trump of ‘Strategic Disaster’ as 50% US Tariff on India Nears Deadline





Amid the ongoing Christian-Hinduism controversy, Nalin Haley , the son of former US ambassador to UN Nikki Haley, has spoken about his unique journey in finding his faith in a multi-faith family. In an interview with UnHerd, the 24-year-old Indian-origin MAGA voice said he was confused over religion in his childhood. His maternal grandparents who were almost his surrogate parents, followed Sikhism while his parents were Protestant Christians.Haley said he immersed himself in books on world religions to find out what he should follow when other kids of his age were reading about cars and dinosaurs. Eventually, he concluded that Christianity is the true faith but the conclusion was preceded by a spiritual experience that he did not detail in the interview.“I needed to research my own faith better in terms of the history, the early beliefs, the Church Fathers,” he said. “When I did that, I felt as though anyone who does that kind of research will walk away a Catholic.”The interview comes as Hindu Indian-origin politicians in the US are facing unprecedented attacks over their religion. Vice President JD Vance recently said he would like to see his wife Usha Vance converted to Christianity.Though JD clarified that Usha Vance has no intention of converting, the episode showed how MAGA is Christian nationalists at core and unapologetic about it.Haley said he chose his political path too in a similar fashion. I was not just going to have the same political views as my parents,” he said adding that he supported Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican primary only to be a ""good son"". “I didn’t and was never going to be an advocate for a view that I did not have,"" he said. Like he thinks the US should stop legal immigration as well, though he himself belongs to an immigrant family.","Nalin Haley, the son of former US ambassador to UN Nikki Haley, has spoken about his unique journey in finding his faith in a multi-faith family.

Greene said she would introduce a bill to stop H-1B visa program completely though Trump believes America needs certain foreign talent.The H-1B row amid MAGA was triggered last year during Christmas when Vivek Ramaswamy called out American culture and said American education system does not produce enough STEM workers needed for American tech companies and hence companies have to rely on H-1B.

The Donald Trump administration is working on a policy change that would limit green cards and other approvals for immigrants who are from Trump's 'travel ban' countries. In June, President Trump signed a travel ban on 12 countries in Africa and the Middle East. People from Afghanistan, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen can not travel to the US.If their nationals are already in the US, before the travel ban list came, they would find it hard to get a green card or other approvals in the US, the New York Times reported, after reviewing draft documents as the policy is still being finalized.""The policy change is a major expansion of the administration’s push to crack down on immigration from countries that it says lack sufficient screening and vetting for official documents.

People from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela cannot enter the United States permanently of receive certain visas.The administration made some exceptions to the travel ban as it exempted people with existing visas, people with green cards, athletes traveling to the United States for the 2026 World Cup or the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and Afghans eligible for the Special Immigrant Visa program.Though there is no official word, the new policy change is an expansion of the administration’s push to crack down on immigration from countries that it says lack sufficient screening and vetting for official documents, the NYT report said.In the draft documents, the agency said some countries might not share enough vetting and screening information.

'Love Us Again': Donald Trump Offers Fair Trade Deal, Promises To Reduce India Tariffs After Tension





Indian spice merchants and tea growers will be among global exporters who will breathe a sigh of relief along with American consumers after US President Donald Trump, feeling the heat of rising domestic prices due to tariffs, moved to lower import duties on nearly 200 food, farm, and agricultural items.While coffee from Brazil, beef from Argentina, and bananas and other fruits from Latin and Central American countries made headlines for Trump’s tariff rollback stemming from domestic disquiet about cost of living, tucked deep in the so-called TACO (Trump always chickens out) list is a range of spices including black pepper, cloves, cumin, cardamom, turmeric, ginger etc, varieties of tea, mango derivatives, and some nuts including cashew, all of which India exports to the U.S.Indian spice exports to the U.S was valued at more than $ 500 million in 2024, and the U.S imported tea from India worth nearly $ 90 million in the same period. The U.S also imported $843 million worth of fresh or dried cashew nuts -- which also got a break -- from across the world, with India accounting for around 20 percent of the imports.Not making the cut however are Indian seafoods, including shrimp, and basmati rice, which are multi-BILLION dollar exports from India to the U.S.Indian gems, jewelry, and apparel too remain under 50 percent US tariff+sanctions, pending a trade deal that Trump has said will happen once New Delhi turns off the Russian oil spigot and steps up buying U.S energy.Effectively, the exemptions apply only to about $500 million to $ 1 billion in qualifying agricultural exports from India, potentially boosting competitiveness and stabilizing market access amid a 37% drop in India's overall U.S. exports since the tariffs hit. The broader challenges posed by the U.S.'s punitive 50% tariffs on most Indian goods (imposed in August 2025 over India's Russian oil purchases) remain.Trump’s rollback, announced through an executive order he signed on Friday, comes amid growing disquiet across the country over cost of living, reflected in voter dissatisfaction that led to a GOP rout in by elections at the hands of Democrats who campaigned on the “affordability” message.The U.S President has also floated the idea of using tariff revenue to issue $2,000 rebate checks to Americans and launched a probe into the meat packing industry following Americans’ beef over high prices.U.S trade associations and political and economic commentators expressed relief at the President’s rollback, which came even as he insisted his tariffs have not increased cost of living and prices have actually come down. ""Trump just reduced tariffs on beef and coffee because people are so pissed off about groceries, and the recent election kicked him in the nuts over it,” read one social media post.The President and his minions are accused of being tone deaf to cost of living issues that prompted one wag to remark “My budget and my reality are not on speaking terms anymore.” The subject became a lighting rod for criticism after Trump hosted a Gatsby-themed Halloween party at his Mara-a-Lago estate and embarked on building an extravagant ballroom bigger than the White House it will be attached to – all the while preening about what critics describe as a gilded Oval Office now garishly overlaid with gold curios and accents.","US President Donald Trump has moved to lower import duties on nearly 200 food, farm, and agricultural items.

Months after reigniting his long-standing dispute with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, US President Donald Trump has once again launched a sharp attack, calling him a “terrible mayor” and a “nasty person”.The remarks were made during an interview with GB News on Thursday night.""Your mayor is a disaster, I can tell you.

The relationship has remained strained since Trump’s first term, when Khan criticised his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States.In the past, Trump has repeatedly labelled Khan a “stone-cold loser”.Khan has accused Trump of targeting him because of his background and Muslim identity, telling Time magazine earlier that the US President’s “toxic politics does not work”.",US President says London Mayor Sadiq Khan is a 'terrible mayor' and a 'nasty person' Claims crime has risen under Khan's leadership and suggests 'Sharia Law' operates in some areas.

‘Desperate’ For Saudi-Israel Ties, Trump 'IGNORES' Pentagon's China Threat; Okays 48 F-35 Jets Deal





US President Donald Trump on Friday indicated he was open to considering Saudi Arabia 's request to purchase F-35 stealth fighter jets. “They wanna buy a lot of jets,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding, “I am looking at that. They have asked me to look at it. ”Trump's comments come ahead of his meeting with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House next week, where both sides are expected to sign economic and defence agreements, Reuters reported.The proposed sale involves 48 F-35 jets and is awaiting clearance within the US government. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth was expected to sign off on the deal before it proceeded to an interagency review. The White House said it would not comment ahead of the president’s discussions.On being asked about the upcoming talks, Trump said it was “more than meeting, we are honouring” Saudi Arabia. He also repeated that he hoped Riyadh would join the Abraham Accords, although Saudi Arabia has resisted such a step without a clear roadmap to Palestinian statehood.As per NYT, Pentagon intelligence assessment has raised concerns that China could gain access to the F-35’s sensitive technology if the sale goes ahead.People familiar with the Defence Intelligence Agency’s findings told the newspaper that US officials are worried about potential Chinese espionage and Beijing’s expanding security cooperation with Riyadh.Saudi defence minister Prince Khalid bin Salman recently took to social media to share that he had met Hegseth, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to review bilateral ties and strategic cooperation.

The Biden administration paused the sale in 2021, citing fears that China could access the jet’s technology, and later proposed conditions that the UAE rejected. Similar concerns now cloud the proposed sale to Saudi Arabia.",US President Donald Trump indicated he was open to considering Saudi Arabia's request to purchase F-35 stealth fighter jets. Trump's comments come ahead of his meeting with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House next week. Pentagon intelligence assessment has raised concerns that China could gain access to the F- 35’s sensitive technology if the sale goes ahead.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125350234,imgsize-1097713,width-400,resizemode-4/image-2025-11-15t205358106.jpg"

GOP ERUPTS As Trump Cuts Ties With Marjorie Taylor Greene Over Epstein Document Fight | WATCH

Is Greene eyeing for a 2028 presidential run?







Donald Trump and his longtime ally Marjorie Taylor Greene picked up their last night's fight where they stopped, as Trump nicknamed Marjorie 'traitor' and called her a disgrace to the Republican Party. Marjorie said she forgives Donald Trump and prays for him to return to his original MAGA promises though she thought out loud what must be there in the Epstein file that her demand for the release of all of it for the sake of the women voters irked the president so much that he rescinded his endorsement for Greene.MTG stood by Donald Trump during the 2020 political storm and has been a longtime ally of the president. But of late, she accused Trump of forgetting his promises to the American people as Trump got more occupied with foreign affairs. Greene publicly condemned the tariff war that Trump waged with countries, pressed the administration for a full disclosure on Epstein case; pushed for a new bill to end the H-1B program.According to insiders, Trump became impatient with Greene's constant complaining and finally gave in to his frustration and anger as he made a long post on Truth Social cutting MTG loose. He called her a ranting lunatic and said Greene was upset because he could not return her calls.He asked Republicans to primary Greene and said Greene's constituents are fed up with her antics.Greene refuted Trump's claim and said she never called the president but indeed dropped a message on how the administration must come clean on sex offender Epstein issue for the sake of the women voters.Many believe that Greene has some ambitious plans up her sleeves and that's why she started to clash with the president to come out as an alternative candidate for 2028 presidential run. Greene too hinted at something new as she wrote: ""There needs to be a new way forward"".Greene said she never thought that fighting against a pedophile would make her a traitor in Trump's eyes. ""The toxic political industrial complex thrives on ripping us all apart but never delivers anything good for the American people, whom I love. The PIC tells us to hate each other, fundraises off why we have to hate each other, and pits Americans against each other to the point of violence and nearing civil war,"" Greene said.","MTG stood by Donald Trump during the 2020 political storm and has been a longtime ally of the president.

'You Don’t Have Talent in US': Donald Trump’s Shocking Shift on H-1B Visa Policy Debate

Employers prefer H-1B because...







Indian-origin Howard professor Ronil Hira, who has been a staunch critic of the H-1B visa, weighed in on the fresh H-1B controversy and explained that it is a no-brainer as to why US companies prefer H-1Bs. The fresh controversy started after President Donald Trump appeared softer on H-1B as he recently said in a FOX interview that America needs certain types of foreign talent. Weeks ago, the administration took a strong step against H-1B as it imposed a $100,000 visa fee, meaning any company that hires H-1Bs will have to cough up this amount. But Trump not dismissing H-1B outright and claiming that America needs certain talents sent a mixed signal to MAGA.As MAGA is divided and Indians are targeted in the US, Ronil Hira explained that employers love H-1B. Citing examples of Disney and the University of California, economist Ron Hira said there are widely reported incidents of American workers being forced to train their H-1B replacements, which proves that H-1B visa holders are not always high-skilled.Most of the people coming to the US on H-1B visas have ordinary skills, skills that are abundantly available from American workers, Dr Hira said.But employers prefer H-1B workers because they can legally be paid less than American workers and because they are controllable, as they are indentured to their employers. ""It's kind of a no-brainer for employers to prefer the H-1Bs. On the other side, there are some very highly qualified people who come on H-1Bs, and so the real issue is how do you fix the program so that most of the people coming in are actually filling genuine skill gaps and not coming in because they are cheaper and controllable,"" Dr Hira said.The Indian-origin expert said H-1B often gets muddled with immigration, while H-1B is a labor policy as it's a guest worker program. ""It's not an immigration issue but a labor issue. You are intervening into the labor market, injecting workers here. You should have a high bar to inject workers who have fewer rights, who are sort of second class in a lot of ways and their worker protections are just very weak. Any guest worker program needs very strong worker protection. H-1B has very weak worker protection and that's why Silicon Valley loves it,"" Dr Hira said.",Indian-origin Howard professor Ronil Hira weighed in on the fresh H-1B controversy.

Trump's H-1B U-Turn: From 'America First' To ‘US Lacks Talent’ Shocker; MAGA Stunned





WASHINGTON: MAGA supremo Donald Trump on Friday unloaded on a one-time loyalist lawmaker after she broke ranks and mutinied on a range of issues, including moving a bill to nix the H1b visa program.In growing signs of major fissures and brewing rebellion in the MAGA movement, Republican Congresswoman and conspiracy theorist Marjorie Taylor Greene, often referred to as MTG, lashed back at party supremo after he called her “wacky,” accused her of going far left, and threatened to end her political career.Among the issues MTG is tormenting Trump with is demanding release of the Epstein files which his critics believe implicate him, and challenging the President’s commitment to the “America First” credo after he defended the need for foreign workers and foreign students in a US that he insists is short of tech talent.“Maybe it was my bill to get rid of the H1B visas,” the Georgia lawmaker, for long a rabble-rouser on the fringe right, posted on X in a conjecture on why Trump is torching her political career.The bigger reason appears to be her going rogue on the Epstein files, which she and a growing band of MAGA lawmakers want released even though they purportedly implicate Trump.“It’s astonishing really how hard he’s fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,” MTG said, responding to Trump’s charge that she had been harassing him with phone calls.Asserting that the President was lying, she said she had only sent him text messages seeking release of the Epstein files and “this is what drove him over the edge.”“And of course he’s coming after me hard to make an example to scare all the other Republicans before next weeks vote to release the Epstein files,” she said in a defiant post on X.“I never thought that fighting to release the Epstein files, defending women who were victims of rape, and fighting to expose the web of rich powerful elites would have caused this, but here we are,” she added on Saturday morning amid signs of a rebellion from sections of MAGA, including several lawmakers disenchanted with a range of Trump policies, including tariffs, they believe is causing disaffection in the base.A furious Trump earlier went ballistic against MTG and another mutinous Republican lawmaker, Thomas Massie, threatening to have them “primaried” (defeated by challengers in inner-party elections), and making personal attacks.“Did Thomas Massie get married already??? Boy, that was quick! Anyway, have a great life Thomas and (?). His wife will soon find out that she’s stuck with a LOSER!” the US President posted on his platform. Massie lost his wife of 31 years to breast cancer last June and married again earlier this month.The snide slight is typical of MAGA catfights where some of its mutually antagonistic divas like MTG, Laura Loomer, Candace Owens have savaged each other with charges of adultery and infidelity, mental instability and ideological betrayal, and generally dragged politics into the gutter after fighting for the supremo’s attention and affection. Loomer, a social media gadabout, is widely believed to have the President's ear currently to the extent that she can make or break careers in Washington DC.The circular fire that is making America GRATE again has included Loomer calling MTG a ""jealous bitch with roid rage” and a “a washed-up hag” and MTG responding by calling Loomer ""mentally unstable and a documented liar.""","Republican Congresswoman and conspiracy theorist Marjorie Taylor Greene, often referred to as MTG, lashed back at party supremo after he called her “wacky,” accused her of going far left, and threatened to end her political career.

Social media reactions



The clip set off a wave of trolling, sarcasm and disbelief across X. Among the reactions:

“Denied.”

“Pretermitted Hair Rule.”

“Embrace your natural self.”

“Big Mike better straighten that hair!”

“Why would any white person care how Black people manage their hair?”

“If she’s so mad about it, why is she wearing her hair straight?”

“Plenty of white people have curly hair too.”

“So victimised.”

“I’ve never heard anyone say Black women need straight hair.”

“White women curl their straight hair all the time.”

“She’s blacksplaining.”

“We’re not in your hair, Michelle. You’re in ours.”

“Why is she blaming white people for her styling choices?”

“Straight hair isn’t a standard — it’s just how many white people are born.”

“Why must everything be about race?”

“Blacksplaining?”

“I’ve never heard a white person tell a Black woman to straighten her hair.”

Michelle Obama’s book and tour







A clip from Michelle Obama ’s recent book-tour appearance has gone viral after she suggested that societal expectations around hair contribute to why some Black women avoid activities like swimming. The remark quickly spread across X, where some users heavily mocked the statement, turning it into a viral moment on social media. The clip continued circulating across multiple platforms, making it one of the most discussed excerpts from her tour.Obama made the comment while explaining how many Black women straighten their naturally curly hair and then feel pressure to keep that style intact. She said that once the hair is straightened, “we are trapped by the straightness,” adding that water or sweat can undo hours of work. She joked that this is “why so many of us can’t swim” and why some avoid gyms or other activities that might disrupt their hairstyles. As she delivered the line, the host burst into laughter, reacting to the unexpected turn in the conversation.She went on to note that getting hair wet during swimming means the styling process has to be repeated, which she described as time-consuming and demanding. She suggested that this extra effort is one reason some women choose to avoid water-based activities altogether.The Look is a photographic and narrative exploration of Michelle Obama’s style across her years in the public eye, featuring more than 200 images from official events, personal moments and behind-the-scenes settings. In the book, she reflects on how her fashion choices intersected with identity, public expectations and her evolving role on the national and global stage.As part of the book’s release, Obama has embarked on a multi-city tour, beginning on 5 November 2025 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in conversation with Tracee Ellis Ross. The tour includes additional stops such as Washington, DC, where she appeared at Sixth & I with critic Wesley Morris. The events highlight the themes of the book while offering audiences live discussions and insights into her experiences and visual archive.","Michelle Obama made the comment while explaining how many Black women straighten their naturally curly hair and then feel pressure to keep that style intact.

Trump versus Marjorie Taylor Greene



Public fallout between Trump and MTG







After Rep Thomas Massie, President Donald Trump has now targeted his longtime ally Marjorie Taylor Greene as she was insisting on the release of Epstein documents. Trump called her 'wacky' and 'lunatic' and dumped her, making the MAGA implosion complete. The MAGA movement has lost sight with far-right influencers like Nick Fuentes being given a platform by Tucker Carlson and now it's floundering with Epstein and H-1B issue.Greene is known for her controversial remarks often fuelled by unsubstantiated conspiracy theories but her devotion to Donald Trump has been unquestionable. She stood by Trump's 2020 claims of election fraud; she also supported Trump in the wake of the Epstein controversy and said that she believed Trump has no involvement in Epstein's sex scandal.But in the recent months, Greene started breaking ranks with Trump inb several key issues. She urged Trump to focus on domestic policies instead of foreign involvement and criticized his tariff fallout, his 50-year mortgage proposal, and his stand on H-1B. Greene even proposed a bill that would phase out H-1B completely while Trump said America needs certain talents from outside and hence America will not stop hiring foreign talents.MTG is not the first Republican that Trump is going after but since she's a vocal MAGA supporter, her political breakup with Trump signals a point of no return for MAGA. MAGA supporters are divided as Trump announced he would endorse MTG's rival candidate in 2026.Trump alienated Kentucky Rep Thomas Massie as well, but a woman politician clashing with Trump over an issue that involved a pedophile sends a strong message.While Trump said MTG has been telling people that Trump did not return her calls, Greene claimed that she did not even call Trump. She said she sent messages to Trump and his aide over Epstein issue, where she urged them to stop ignoring women who openly voted for Trump.","Marjorie Taylor Greene is known for her controversial remarks often fuelled by unsubstantiated conspiracy theories.

Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene reacted to President Donald Trump's snub and said she is not Trump's servant or worshipper. MTG said she remains America First and America Only, after Trump withdrew his endorsement from the firebrand MAGA leader after MTG clashed with Trump over the Epstein files and H-1B issue. Greene is running for reelection in 2026 and now she does not have Trump's endorsement because Trump said she has gone 'Far Left'.Calling her a 'ranting Lunatic', Trump said MTG told people that she was upset that the President didn't return her phone calls anymore. But Trump said in his Truth Social post that it was not possible for him to attend every call.Greene said she didn't even call him in the first place and so the alleged disgruntlement over not returning calls is a lie. ""I have supported President Trump with too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him even when almost all other Republicans turned their back and denounced him. But I don’t worship or serve Donald Trump. I worship God, Jesus is my savior, and I serve my district GA14 and the American people,"" MGT said, unleashing her full rebellion against Trump.Greene is a vocal MAGA supporter but she has been expressing her disappointment over the Trump administration openly.She is one of four House Republicans who signed on to a discharge petition to force a vote on the release of Justice Department documents on the Epstein case.MTG said Trump is making an example out of her to scare all the other Republicans so that they don't vote for the release of the Epstein files. ""It’s astonishing really how hard he’s fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level. But really most Americans wish he would fight this hard to help the forgotten men and women of America who are fed up with foreign wars and foreign causes, are going broke trying to feed their families, and are losing hope of ever achieving the American dream,"" Greene said.Greene is, however, not sure whether it's her insistence to release all Epstein files or her anti-H-1B bill that she proposed that rankled Trump more. As Trump recently said America needs 'certain' talents from foreign countries, MTG said she would introduce a bill to end the mass replacement of American workers by phasing out the H-1B program. ""Americans are the most talented people in the world, and I have full faith in the American people. I serve Americans only, and I will ALWAYS put Americans first.

A judiciary under reconstruction



Munir’s expanding power base



(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment reshapes the balance of power in favour of the military. Behind the crisis is the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, a sweeping package pushed through parliament within days. Lawyers, judges and opposition parties argue that it has weakened the courts and elevated the military’s top commander to a position with no modern parallel.Since then, Pakistan’s judiciary has been hit by a series of high-profile resignations. On Saturday, Lahore High Court judge Shams Mehmood Mirza stepped down, and his family said his decision was directly linked to the 27th Amendment. His departure followed those of Supreme Court justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, who issued sharply worded letters condemning the amendment as a direct attack on judicial independence.The creation of a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) lies at the heart of judicial restructuring. The FCC now holds exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters, stripping the Supreme Court of its original powers. Pending petitions have already been shifted to the new court. President Zardari swore in Justice Aminuddin Khan as its first chief justice; six other judges were appointed, including serving Supreme Court and high court judges, though one judge reportedly refused to join.The FCC’s establishment has sparked intense concern. Critics say the president’s new power to transfer judges risks becoming a tool to sideline dissenting voices. Opposition groups argue this will fundamentally weaken judicial independence and concentrate constitutional authority in the executive and military leadership.Government ministers, however, hailed the package as “historic” and a step toward greater efficiency and national unity. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the amendment proved that “solidarity” prevailed during a time of national strain.With judges resigning, courts being reconfigured, and the military gaining unprecedented constitutional control, Pakistan faces a moment of reckoning.The amendment passed with overwhelming numbers in both houses has dramatically restructured Pakistan’s defence architecture, elevating army chief Asim Munir to Chief of Defence Forces with command over all three military branches. His five-year tenure now resets from the date of notification, enabling him to remain in office until 2030.The Senate has since rushed through four related bills, including amendments to the Army, Air Force and Navy Acts, along with changes to Supreme Court practice rules. These laws remove the earlier equality among service chiefs and replace references to the Joint Chiefs of Staff system with a new “National Strategic Command”, further centralising military authority under Munir.Dawn reported that appointments, extensions, and tenures under these reforms “shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.Experts quoted in multiple reports warn that the shift risks internal military tensions and further erodes civilian oversight. Lawyer Osama Malik described the reforms as something “usually granted in absolute monarchies”, arguing they grant lifetime protections not only to Munir but also to President Zardari.Opposition lawmakers responded with uproar, shredding copies of the bill and walking out. PTI leaders labelled the move “deeply undemocratic” and “the final nail in the coffin of an independent judiciary”. Critics say these changes could reshape the political landscape, particularly for nearly 200 cases involving former prime minister Imran Khan.","Pakistan's judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment.

What next







Pakistan’s National Assembly on Wednesday passed the 27th constitutional amendment bill, granting sweeping powers to the military in general and country’s army chief Asim Munir in specific, and restructuring the judiciary.The vote, held amid a ruckus in the lower house, saw 234 lawmakers in favour and only four against, speaker Ayaz Sadiq announced. The session was attended by top political leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.The amendment comes at a time of heightened political tension in Pakistan, with the ruling coalition seeking to consolidate control over key defence and judicial institutions. The legislation follows earlier Senate approval, where it received 64 votes in favour and no opposition, as the opposition benches boycotted proceedings.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the passage as a demonstration of national unity, saying the house exhibited solidarity. He also condemned a recent terrorist incident in Wana, drawing parallels to the Army Public School massacre, and praised law enforcement for securing the safety of students and cadets.The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces, giving him constitutional authority over all three branches: army, navy, and air force. Honorary five-star ranks such as field marshal, marshal of the air force, and admiral of the fleet remain lifetime titles. According to the country's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the reform “aims to bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while preserving military honour and tradition.The bill also establishes a federal constitutional court (FCC) to handle constitutional and provincial matters, leaving the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases. The FCC will have equal representation from all provinces and the power to take suo motu notices on constitutional petitions. The Judicial Commission will oversee judge transfers; refusal of a transfer will be treated as retirement.The ruling coalition, including PML-N, PPP, MQM-P, and allies, backed the amendment. Opposition lawmakers condemned it as unconstitutional. PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan called it the “Baku Amendments” and accused the government of undermining democracy. Mehmood Khan Achakzai of PkMAP protested by tearing a copy of the bill in the house.The amendment now returns to the Senate for final approval before becoming law. Analysts say the 27th amendment significantly strengthens Munir’s role in Pakistan’s military hierarchy while altering judicial oversight, marking a shift in Pakistan’s institutional framework.(With input from agencies, Dawn)","The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Why it matters

The big picture

The Field Marshal’s expanding power evokes a hybrid of Pakistan’s two most dominant military rulers:

Ayub Khan, who introduced centralized presidential control and laid the foundations for military-led governance.

Zia-ul-Haq, who used the Army and Islamization to seize power, marginalize the judiciary, and suppress civilian opposition.

Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament.

If Zia’s coup was loud and brutal against a strong popular leadership, Munir’s is silent, yet possibly more far reaching, being done through a political front office that’s pliant and dependent on the Army for authority. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.

The transformation follows the India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025, a four-day exchange of air and missile strikes after the Pahalgam terror attack.

India’s Operation Sindoor targeted Pakistani airbases, radars, and command centers.

Pakistan requested a ceasefire after intense damage - a request reportedly initiated by Pakistan’s DGMO.

Donald Trump, who claimed to have brokered the truce(India has repeatedly denied the US President's claims), was effusively thanked by Munir and PM Shehbaz Sharif. Trump now calls Munir his “favorite field marshal.”

The Financial Times described their dynamic as a “bromance,” with Trump showcased on billboards across Pakistan alongside Munir and Sharif.

This international validation was followed by Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, the second such promotion in Pakistan’s history - and the first codified under the Constitution.

Between the lines

This isn’t just about military command - it’s about rewriting the DNA of the Pakistani state.

The amendment creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, potentially diluting the powers of the Supreme Court and creating ambiguity about the hierarchy of judicial authority.

President Zardari is also granted lifelong immunity in the amendment, mirroring the legal shield given to Munir.

This dual protection signals a strategic alliance between the military and top civilian figures to institutionalize mutual insulation from accountability.

“Too much has been left to ad hoc and arbitrary decisions,” Mazari warned.

The domestic question: Can repression deliver reform?

The three-front storm: Taliban, TTP, and India

“If you nurture snakes in your backyard, they will bite you,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military’s official spokesman, referencing the Taliban. What a comeuppance : The remark could just as well apply to all Pakistan-grown terror groups and the TTP, whose resurgence is a grim case of blowback.

The bottom line





In Pakistan, where generals have often ruled with impunity and influence, Field Marshal Asim Munir is scripting a new playbook-quiet, precise, and constitutionally sealed. His rise is not just another chapter in the country’s well-worn saga of military dominance. It is, as one senior opposition leader put it, “a rewrite of the entire power manual.”Pakistan’s controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment proposes to recast the country’s military command structure by abolishing the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and creating the role of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) - a position that will be held by the Army Chief, currently Field Marshal Asim Munir •The amendment vests unprecedented legal and constitutional power in the CDF, giving Munir operational and institutional control over the army, navy, and air force, as well as the country’s nuclear command.•It also grants five-star officers life-long rank, privileges, and immunity, a move seen as creating a parallel unelected authority beyond the reach of civilian or judicial oversight.“This amendment appears tailored to benefit a specific individual rather than to strengthen the defence structure,” Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, former defence secretary, told Dawn.The CJCSC post - created after the 1971 war to ensure coordination among services - will be dissolved on November 27, 2025, when the current chairman, Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, retires.The 27th Amendment represents the largest shift in Pakistan’s civil-military balance since the Zia era, codifying the military’s supremacy in a way that future civilian governments may struggle to reverse.•The military will no longer merely influence governance from behind the scenes - it will be constitutionally entrenched at the center of executive authority.•Strategic nuclear assets, previously overseen by the National Command Authority, will now fall under the commander of national strategic command, appointed by the PM on the army chief’s advice, and selected from within the army.“All nuclear weapons and delivery systems will be under army control, including second-strike missiles traditionally under the Navy,” warned Dr Shireen Mazari, former human rights minister, a Dawn report said.•The change grants the army a monopoly over promotions, transfers, and postings across the services, threatening morale and inter-service harmony.“If promotions in the Air Force and Navy are determined by an army-origin CDF, it could lead to festering resentments,” Mazari cautioned.At home, Munir is both omnipresent and embattled. According to a Financial Times report, his supporters compare him to Mohammed bin Salman or South Korea’s General Park - ruthless modernisers willing to bulldoze institutions in the name of reform. His critics, however, see echoes of Zia-ul-Haq’s theocratic militarism cloaked in constitutional legitimacy.The judiciary is already split, thanks to a proposed constitutional court that would dilute the Supreme Court’s power. Journalists are censored, civil rights groups are muzzled, and political opponents - most notably former Prime Minister Imran Khan - are jailed or silenced.And yet, Munir has cast himself as the architect of reform. In his speech at the Pakistan Military Academy, he spoke of “treasures hidden beneath our land” and claimed that Pakistan had begun to “regain its rightful place in the comity of nations.”But the economy tells another story. As per the FT report, Pakistan’s investment rate is the lowest in South Asia, its poverty rate has risen to 25%, and its youth unemployment is dangerously high. The country remains dependent on IMF bailouts and Gulf financing that has yet to materialise in promised volumes.While Munir consolidates power at home, Pakistan finds itself encircled by a resurgent triangle of threats - each historically rooted, each dangerously revived. In the west, the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has proved more liability than leverage. Once covertly supported by Pakistan’s security establishment, the Taliban now resist Islamabad’s demands and turn a blind eye to cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil.More ominously, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot long declared outlawed, has regrouped in Afghanistan and resumed attacks in Pakistan’s tribal belt and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This year alone, militant violence has killed over 1,400 people - the highest toll in a decade.“The military simply lacks political support on the ground there,” Iftikhar Firdous, founder of The Khorasan Diary, told FT. “The crackdown has alienated entire communities.”Simultaneously, Pakistan’s eastern border with India remains fragile after the four-day air conflict in May.Add to that domestic insurgencies in Balochistan and the Pashtun belt, and Pakistan now faces not one, but three overlapping security fronts. Instead of acting as a force-multiplier, the military’s expanding political and economic footprint is beginning to stretch its operational capacity thin.The 27th Amendment enshrines military supremacy in Pakistan's Constitution under the guise of reform and modernization.•It moves the country further away from parliamentary democracy, and deeper into military-led constitutional authoritarianism.•As Field Marshal Asim Munir prepares to become the first Chief of Defence Forces, Pakistan’s most consequential question remains: Can a military man fix a failing nation - or will history repeat itself?(With inputs from agencies)","Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment.

ISLAMABAD: A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence that the defence minister said had pushed the country into a ""state of war"".Pakistani govt ministers accused neighbouring Afghanistan of complicity in the bloodshed - an accusation Kabul denied - and vowed retaliation if Afghan authorities failed to rein in the militants Islamabad says were responsible. ""We are in a state of war,"" said defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif after the attack, the first strike on civilians in Islamabad in a decade. ""Bringing this war to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which Pakistan has the full power to respond. ""The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said. The court bomber blew himself up near the entrance at around lunchtime. Images on local media showed people covered in blood lying next to a police van. A vehicle was seen on fire and another car was badly damaged. Police cordoned off the site. Naqvi said the bomber had tried to enter the court building on foot but, unable to find a way in, detonated the device outside, close to a police vehicle.Several of the wounded were in critical condition, a hospital source said.No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The main Pakistani militant group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denied involvement in the attacks. But a group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, according to The Khorasan Diary, a digital platform in Islamabad that monitors militant activity in the region.TTP militants have in recent years focused attacks on security forces. Civilians had not been hit in Islamabad for a decade, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group that tracks attacks.Islamabad says that the Pakistani Taliban and other militants are based in Afghanistan, with the support of India. ""We are totally clear that Afghanistan has to stop them. In case of a failure, we have no option but to take care of those terrorists who are attacking our country,"" Naqvi said, speaking at the scene of the court bombing. The Taliban administration spokesperson in Kabul did not respond to a request for comment on Pakistan's accusations.The court attack happened hours after militants stormed a school near the Afghan border on Monday. The attack on the school in Wana, in the north west, began Monday, when a suicide vehicle rammed the main entrance, killing three people, Naqvi said. Militants then entered the school, which is run by the military but educates civilians.By Tuesday evening, three militants were still inside the compound, security officials said, with rescue operations under way for the students trapped in another part of the school. Naqvi said that the school assailants were in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan during the attack.Reuters","A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence.

Attack outside court complex



Surge in militant violence and worsening ties with Afghanistan







Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country was “in a state of war” after a suicide bomber struck outside the Islamabad district courts on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 27.The blast one of the deadliest to hit the capital in recent years has intensified tensions with Afghanistan, with Asif accusing the Taliban government in Kabul of allowing militants to operate freely.In a post on X, Asif said: “Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: This is a war for all of Pakistan.”He wrote that Pakistan’s military was making “daily sacrifices while providing citizens with a sense of protection and security”, but warned that hoping for negotiations with Kabul would be a “mistake”. Asif insisted that Afghanistan “has the ability to prevent terrorist attacks inside Pakistan” and that bringing the conflict to the capital was “a message from Kabul”.He added that Pakistan “has the strength to respond fully”, saying the attack had erased any remaining doubts about the threat posed by militants operating from Afghan soil.The explosion took place around midday in Islamabad’s G-11 district, just outside the judicial complex where hundreds of lawyers and visitors were present. Police said the attacker tried to enter the court premises but failed, eventually detonating explosives next to a police vehicle, igniting cars and sending a fireball through the street.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed that 12 people were killed and 27 wounded. He said authorities had recovered a severed head believed to be that of the attacker, and CCTV footage captured him moments before the blast. Witnesses described scenes of chaos, with people screaming for help as ambulances rushed to the site.The blast comes amid a sharp rise in militant violence across Pakistan. Security officials say the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has carried out hundreds of attacks this year, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border, but strikes in major cities have been rare. Islamabad was last hit by a suicide attack three years ago.On Monday night, militants also attempted to storm an army-run college in Wana, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Security forces killed two attackers quickly, while others were cornered inside an administrative building. Students and staff were evacuated, and the military said the assault resembled the TTP’s 2014 massacre in Peshawar that killed 154 people.Pakistan says the Afghan Taliban have allowed TTP fighters to take refuge across the border. Afghanistan denies harbouring the group.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Sunday that it was committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban but demanded that Kabul must address concerns regarding the use of its territory by terrorists.Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi issued a statement on different media queries regarding the third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime in Istanbul on November 6, which concluded a day later. Turkiye and Qatar mediated the parleys.The peace talks ended without any agreement to tackle the thorny issues of cross-border terrorism , the top officials had said on Saturday.""Pakistan remains committed to the resolution of bilateral differences through dialogue. However, Pakistan's core concern, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needs to be addressed first and foremost,"" the FO said in a statement.It also said that Pakistan's Armed Forces and its people were well determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism from its soil and take action against its supporters, abettors and financiers.In the long statement, the spokesperson said that for the past four years, since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil.""Throughout these years, Pakistan, despite suffering military and civilian casualties, exercised maximum restraint and did not retaliate,"" it said.Pakistan's expectation was that the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna al Khawarij (TTP/FaK) elements present on Afghan soil, the FO said.The Pakistan government last year notified the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as ""Fitna al-Khawarij"", a reference to a group in earlier Islamic history which was involved in violence.Pakistan also tried to positively engage with Afghanistan by offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance, and the intention to constructively engage with Afghanistan so as to enable it to become a stable, peaceful and prosperous country that is at peace within and with its neighbours, the statement said.However, despite all these positive gestures, ""the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction,"" it added.Instead of acting upon the core expectation to stop Afghan territory from being used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions, it said.""Instead, it has tried to confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues. By confusing the main issue of terrorism, it keeps trying to develop a narrative which absolves the Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards the international community and its own people,"" it added.The statement said that Pakistan's October 2025 response to the consistent attacks emanating from Afghanistan was a manifestation of the will and determination that it will not leave any stone unturned to safeguard its territory and its people.The statement added that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK terrorists.Pakistan also accused the Afghan Taliban of using the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue, adding that they had fled in 2015 to avoid a military operation and fought together with the Afghan Taliban against Nato troops.""These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by the Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to the Afghan Taliban,"" it said, and added that the same terrorists established training camps in Afghanistan to launch terrorist activities in Pakistan.The FO rejected the Kabul excuse of lack of control over TTP and demanded definite and concrete actions. Pakistan also rejected the portrayal of TTP as refugees and asked Kabul to hand them over to Pakistan.It said Pakistan has never eschewed dialogue with any Government in Kabul, but it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group.",Pakistan says it is committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

What does it mean?



Opposition backlash and protests



Divided legal opinions



Support for reforms







Pakistan’s government has introduced a major constitutional change that has sparked widespread debate and protests across the country. The proposed 27th constitutional amendment, which will be voted on in Parliament next week, seeks to restructure the military’s chain of command and overhaul the judiciary, prompting strong criticism from the Opposition.The current move mirrors the era of General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s longest-serving de facto head of state, who introduced sweeping constitutional changes to entrench military control under a civilian façade. The proposed 27th Amendment, risks reviving that legacy by placing the armed forces once again at the centre of Pakistan’s political structure.The bill, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after cabinet approval, proposes to abolish the post of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC) and replace it with a new and more powerful position -- chief of defence forces (CDF).According to reports in Dawn, the post will be held by the serving chief of army staff, who will also become the constitutional head of the army, navy and air force. This change would make General Asim Munir the most powerful military officer in Pakistan’s history, formalising his recent promotion to Field Marshal.The amendment also includes plans to set up a new federal constitutional court (FCC) and change how high court judges are appointed.It seeks to transfer some powers from the Supreme Court to the new court, while also granting the president lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution.Pakistan law minister Azam Nazir Tarar presented the bill in the senate, where chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred it to a committee led by Farooq Naek for review. Naek said the goal was to “create consensus among members” before the bill comes up for voting on Monday. The government is confident of securing a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the national assembly.Opposition parties have strongly opposed the amendment, calling it a direct threat to Pakistan’s Constitution. A coalition of opposition groups, the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes Imran Khan’s PTI, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) has announced nationwide protests starting Sunday.“Democratic institutions have been paralysed within Pakistan… the nation must step up against the [proposed] 27th Amendment,” MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said.PkMAP leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai said the protests would begin with the slogan: “Long live democracy, down with dictatorship.” He warned, “The opposition alliance had no choice but to launch a protest movement following the government’s move, which is shaking the foundations of the Constitution.”Legal experts are split on the amendment’s impact. Critics say it would reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, making it “irrelevant,” and tighten executive control over the judiciary.One senior counsel told Dawn, “Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’.”Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar warned that the changes would “empower [the new] Federal Constitutional Court by disempowering the Supreme Court.” He said the amendment also gives the Chief of the Defence Forces constitutional authority for life, formally recognising the Field Marshal rank.Another lawyer pointed out that under the new Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC would outrank the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and serve until the age of 68 -- three years longer than the current limit of 65.Some legal experts, however, have welcomed the changes. Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar called the 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in Pakistan’s justice system.He said the plan to have two separate apex courts -- one for appeals (Supreme Court) and one for constitutional cases (FCC) -- would bring “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence.”He also argued that the reforms could reduce political influence in the judiciary, cut down case backlogs, and modernise the justice system.Khokhar added that the new defence structure under Article 243 was in line with “modern constitutional democracies,” ensuring that the armed forces would operate under a single advisory framework accountable to the prime minister, defence minister and National Security Committee.Newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association in Pakistan, President Haroonur Rasheed also supported the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court, saying it could help streamline the judicial process.","Proposed 27th constitutional amendment will be voted on in Parliament next week.

Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday, citing “serious security concerns” in Balochistan, news agency PTI reported.The temporary suspension — enforced from 9 to 12 November — follows multiple insurgent attacks on the train over the past year, including a dramatic hijacking in March that left 26 people dead.Railway officials said the move came after fresh intelligence warnings of possible attacks targeting tracks, railway assets and civilian passengers. “The precautionary measure is based on advice from security and intelligence agencies to ensure the safety of passengers, railway staff, civilians and critical rail assets,” a senior official said, as quoted by PTI.The Jaffar Express is one of Pakistan’s busiest long-distance routes, carrying thousands of passengers daily at a cost far lower than road travel. Local commuters have criticised the shutdown, saying it leaves people in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with few affordable transport options.Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups, particularly the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).In March, BLA militants hijacked the train with 380 passengers on board, triggering a two-day standoff in a mountainous tunnel. Twenty-six people were killed before security forces rescued more than 350 passengers. Authorities said 33 militants also died in the rescue operation.Security officials say insurgent groups are increasingly targeting railways to cripple movement and signal the state’s inability to secure critical transport arteries. Analysts note that the frequency of attacks shows “a collapse of basic security control” across parts of Balochistan’s rail corridor.Political leaders in the province argue that Islamabad has ignored decades of local grievances. Balochistan National Party chief Akhtar Mengal recently warned that the state has “lost control” of the region, saying: “There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority.”The suspension comes as Pakistan faces one of its most dangerous security challenges in years. Not only has the BLA intensified operations across Balochistan, but attacks linked to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Islamic State Khorasan (ISK) and cross-border militants have surged.According to the latest Global Terrorism Index, Pakistan recorded a 45% jump in terrorism-related deaths this year. Security officials warn the country is now battling “four fronts at once”—an insurgent network straddling provincial, sectarian and cross-border lines.Diplomatic efforts have yielded little. Peace talks this week between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement, with both sides blaming each other for breakdowns in the ceasefire. Pakistan accuses Kabul of sheltering TTP fighters; the Taliban dismisses the allegations.","Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday.

Pakistan’s government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades. The proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after approval by the federal cabinet, rewrites the chain of command of the armed forces and places Field Marshall Asim Munir higher than any military officer before him.The bill restructures Article 243 of the Constitution and creates a powerful new post: Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). According to Dawn, the position will be held by the serving Chief of Army Staff, who will simultaneously become the constitutionally recognised head of Pakistan’s Army, Navy and Air Force. The development formalises General Munir’s elevation as Pakistan’s Field Marshal — a title that the government has already awarded but is now seeking to permanently embed into the Constitution.The changes have ignited intense debate in Islamabad, dividing political parties, lawyers and civil society. Supporters argue that the bill modernises command structures, while critics see it as a dramatic centralisation of military power that weakens civilian oversight.As per report from Dawn, the bill abolishes the position of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), the top coordinating office among Pakistan’s military services, from 27 November, when the tenure of the current CJCSC General Sahir Shamshad Mirza ends.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told Parliament that no new appointment will be made, because the Army Chief will take over the role’s functions as Chief of Defence Forces.Under the amendment, the President will appoint the Army, Naval and Air Chiefs on the Prime Minister’s advice, while the CDF will be constitutionally empowered to command all three services.A new position Commander of the National Strategic Command will oversee Pakistan’s nuclear and strategic arsenal. Dawn reported that the commander must be an officer from the Army, appointed by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the CDF. This further cements the Army Chief’s control over nuclear command authority.The bill also grants unprecedented rights to officers who attain five-star ranks such as Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force, or Admiral of the Fleet.Law minister Tarar clarified that Parliament not the Pakistan Prime Minister will have the power to cancel such titles.The amendment does not stop at the military. The second half of the proposal restructures Pakistan’s judicial system.According to Geo News, the bill establishes a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC): a powerful new judicial body that would:Legal experts quoted by Dawn warned that the changes could “dethrone” the Supreme Court as Pakistan’s top judicial authority. One senior counsel said the Supreme Court risked being turned into a “Supreme District Court”, dealing mostly with ordinary appeals, while constitutional matters shift to the FCC.Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar argued that the amendment tightens executive control over the judiciary and “empowers the FCC by disempowering the Supreme Court”.However, other senior lawyers called it a “forward-looking reform”. They say separating constitutional and appellate functions would reduce delays, depoliticise the Supreme Court and bring Pakistan closer to judicial models in other democracies.The bill has triggered fierce debate in Islamabad. The timing — months after Munir’s elevation and amid delicate coalition negotiations — has intensified public scrutiny.Dawn reported that the proposal surfaced after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari revealed that PML-N leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, requested PPP support for constitutional reforms.Government allies insist the reform merely formalises existing military structures and honours national heroes. Critics say it permanently rebalances power in favour of the Army.If adopted, the 27th Constitutional Amendment will be one of Pakistan’s most consequential defence reforms since the 1980s, dissolving one of the military’s oldest offices, raising the Army Chief to unprecedented constitutional supremacy, and reshaping Pakistan’s highest courts.","Pakistan's government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades.

Donald Trump Stuns Shehbaz Sharif With India-Pak Peace Remark After Gaza Ceasefire Summit In Egypt





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday once again thanked US President Donald Trump for resolving the India-Pakistan conflict in May.New Delhi has been consistently maintaining that India and Pakistan reached an understanding on May 10 to end the conflict after four days of intense cross-border drone and missile strikes, and no third party was involved in the process.""It was President Trump's bold and decisive leadership that brought about the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, restoring peace in South Asia, averting a major war, and saving millions of people,"" Sharif said while addressing Azerbaijan's Victory Day parade in Baku.Since May 10, when Trump announced on social media that India and Pakistan had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" after a ""long night"" of talks mediated by Washington, he has repeated his claim several times that he ""helped settle"" the tensions between the two countries.India has consistently denied any third-party intervention.Pakistan has praised Trump on multiple occasions, claiming that he brokered a ceasefire during the May conflict.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians.In his address, Sharif also mentioned Kashmir, saying that Azerbaijan's victory in Karabakh is a beacon of hope for all nations fighting against oppression.The Prime Minister said Pakistan seeks peace, but it will not allow anyone to challenge its sovereignty or undermine territorial integrity.The parade also included contingents of the armed forces from Pakistan and Turkiye who marched alongside Azerbaijani forces.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: A day after peace talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan in Turkey broke down, the Taliban on Saturday accused “elements within the Pakistani military” of pursuing “anti-Afghanistan policies for years. ”“Unfortunately, certain military elements in Pakistan appear to view a stable and strong Afghanistan as contrary to their interests,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement on X. “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts.”Mujahid also rejected claims that the rise of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was linked to the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul. “Some groups have falsely accused the Islamic Emirate, suggesting that instability in Pakistan and the TTP’s growth began with our arrival. In reality, both date back to 2002, a result of misguided policies by certain Pakistani military elements who aligned with the US, permitted drone strikes in Waziristan, and turned against their own people,” he wrote.He pointed to a series of Pakistani military campaigns against the TTP — including Operations Al-Mizan, Rah-e-Rast, Sher Dil, Nijat, Koh-e-Safid, and Zarb-e-Azb — that, he said, displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians.“In this so-called war on terror, 80,000–90,000 soldiers and civilians were killed, by Islamabad’s own count, long before the Islamic Emirate’s rise,” Mujahid added.Calling Pakistan’s instability “an internal issue,” Mujahid remarked the Taliban has taken steps to prevent cross-border militancy since taking power. These include mediating dialogue among political and religious figures, relocating refugees from the Durand Line, banning weapons among refugee populations, and issuing fatwas against unauthorized foreign jihad.“The Islamic Emirate welcomes all efforts that allow refugees to return safely,” he stated, reaffirming that Afghanistan would not allow its territory to be used to interfere in another country’s affairs.","The Taliban accused “elements within the Pakistani military’ of pursuing “anti- Afghanistan policies for years” “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125186693,imgsize-78016,width-400,resizemode-4/taliban-accuses-pakistani-military-of-fueling-instability-through-quotmanufactured-pretextsquot.jpg"

Will it make Pak army chief Asim Munir's position stronger?



Proposed change to Article 243 Description Why it increases Munir’s power Formal recognition of Field Marshal Field Marshal to be constitutionally recognized as a rank, not just an honorary title Grants Munir secure legal status, enabling tenure extension and legal protection against dismissal or demotion Creation of 'Commander of Defence Forces' (CDF) Establishes a new central position to oversee army, navy, air force Munir may transition to/head this role, consolidating command over all forces, superseding the current setup Shift of supreme command away from president to CDF Reduces President and PM’s operational control over armed forces Centralizes authority in Munir (as CDF or Field Marshal), further reducing civilian oversight Tenure extension via new constitutional language Secures longer term (potentially unlimited) for Munir in his new post Provides Munir greater continuity and leverage in national affairs Centralization of civilian government functions Ministries like education, population welfare moved under federal control Increases central government (and de facto military) power, indirectly empowering Munir Reduction of provincial autonomy Provincial share in federal resources reduced, central government gains more control Weakens provincial challenge to federal/military authority, strengthening Munir’s policy reach

Why Pakistani critics are skeptical?







Taking ""lessons"" from tensions with India, Pakistan has moved to fortify the constitutional basis of military command, signaling a push to modernize defense structures and tighten civilian-military coherence. Its law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house, a move aimed at revising Article 243 to formally enshrine the appointments and parallel ranks of the Army, Air, and Naval chiefs.Citing “lessons” from recent India-Pakistan standoffs, Tarar said the nature of modern warfare had changed, requiring constitutional alignment with evolving command realities.“Recent Pakistan-India tensions have taught us many lessons. The nature and strategy of war have completely changed. Appointment procedures and some positions were previously in the Army Act but were not mentioned in the 1973 Constitution. Parallel ranks exist worldwide for Air Chief and Naval Chief,” Tarar said.The move, however, has come under scanner as many believe it could give more power to military than the civilian government in Pakistan.India, on May 7, launched Operation Sindoor against terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists and targeting key JeM and LeT camps. The move, which came in retaliation to Pahalgam terror attack, turned into a major India-Pakistan issue with the latter also launching a military operation against India.By May 10, the two nations announced a ceasefire after Pakistan approached India for truce talks.Ten days after the truce, Pakistani army general Asim Munir was promoted to the rank of field marshal, the principal military advisor to the prime minister and the president of Pakistan on all matters related to national security. Before Munir, former Pakistan President Genral Ayub Khan had self elevated himself to field marshal in 1959.The proposed changes to Article 243 in Pakistan's Constitution, are designed to significantly bolster the authority of the military, specifically, army chief and recently designated field marshal Asim Munir. Here's how:According to an article by Pakistani media outlet Dawn, legal experts in Pakistan remain divided on whether such institutional adjustments truly warrant a constitutional amendment, noting that most operational reforms can be achieved through ordinary legislation rather than altering Article 243.Constitutional experts argued that modernising command structures or creating a Chief of Defence Staff-type position does not require amending Article 243. Such reforms could be introduced through ordinary legislation or defence rules. Altering the Constitution, they warned, risks expanding military autonomy under the guise of structural integration.Another confusion surrounding Article 243 stems from the changes introduced by the 26th Amendment, which extended the army chief’s tenure from three to five years. The current chief, appointed under the old law and later elevated to the ceremonial rank of field marshal, a position not mentioned in the Constitution, has become the focal point of legal ambiguity.Dawn reported that experts remain divided on whether his term automatically extends under the new law or requires a fresh notification, raising questions about the real intent behind the proposed 27th Amendment: to resolve this technical uncertainty or to further cement the military’s influence within Pakistan’s constitutional framework.","Pakistan's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house.

"'We will work on this together': French President Emmanuel Macron holds call with Donald Trump, Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss Ukraine peace",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/we-will-work-on-this-together-french-president-emmanuel-macron-holds-call-with-donald-trump-volodymyr-zelenskyy-to-discuss-ukraine-peace/articleshow/118343130.cms,"French President Emmanuel Macron. (AP)

French President Emmanuel Macron engaged in talks with US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and stressed on the importance of working together to establish 'strong and lasting peace in Ukraine .'He insisted that Russia cease its hostile actions, alongside providing Ukraine with robust security assurances.Macron took to X and said, ""After bringing together several European leaders, I have just spoken with President @realDonaldTrump and then with President @ZelenskyyUa. We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine. To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians. Otherwise, there is a risk that this ceasefire will end up like the Minsk agreements.""He continued, ""We will work on this together with all Europeans, Americans, and Ukrainians. This is the key. We are convinced that Europeans must invest better, more, and together in their security and defense--both for today and for the future.""Following discussions with European leaders about Ukraine's security situation, Zelenskyy conveyed details of his dialogue with French President Macron. He reinforced the need for substantial security assurances for Ukraine , noting that inadequate guarantees would enable Russian deception and potential conflict renewal.Zelenskyy posted on X, ""I just had a long conversation with President of France @EmmanuelMacron following his meeting today with other European leaders to discuss the global situation, the state of affairs in Europe, and security guarantees for Ukraine.""He further stated, ""We share a common vision: security guarantees must be robust and reliable. Any other decision without such guarantees--such as a fragile ceasefire--would only serve as another deception by Russia and a prelude to a new Russian war against Ukraine or other European nations. Emmanuel also briefed me on his talks with other leaders, not just European ones. We agreed to stay in constant contact as major decisions are being made. Ensuring a robust and lasting peace is a must. And that can only be achieved through strong security guarantees.""European leaders affirmed their support for Ukraine on Monday amidst Russian invasion, yet offered no additional security assurances, particularly as Donald Trump advocates for Russian negotiations, according to Euro News.At Paris's emergency summit conclusion, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer indicated readiness to deploy British forces alongside others following a permanent peace agreement.He emphasised that American security backing remains crucial to prevent future Russian aggression towards Ukraine.""I am prepared to consider committing British forces on the ground alongside others if there's a lasting peace agreement. But there must be a US backstop because a US security guarantee is the only way to effectively deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again,"" Starmer declared at the Paris emergency summit's end.""We have to recognise the new era we're in, not cling hopelessly to the comforts of the past. It's time for us to take responsibility for our security, for our continent,"" he concluded.","French President Emmanuel Macron engaged in talks with US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

'Biggest fraud': Elon Musk says millions listed in social security database are over 100 years old,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biggest-fraud-elon-musk-says-millions-listed-in-social-security-database-are-over-100-years-old/articleshow/118343731.cms,"US department of government efficiency head Elon Musk on Monday claimed to discover ""the biggest fraud in history"" after he found over 20 million individuals listed in the Social Security database as centenarians.In a social media post on X, Musk shared a chart showing age distribution from zero to 369 years and noted the number of 'eligible' social security numbers exceeded the US population.""According to the Social Security database, these are the numbers of people in each age bucket with the death field set to FALSE!"" Musk said.According to a report by the New York Post, the revelation was previously documented by the Social Security Administration's (SSA) oversight body. A July 2023 audit identified 18.9 million people listed as centenarians in the database, despite only 86,000 actual centenarians living in the US according to Census data.A previous March 2015 audit also found 6.5 million individuals over 112 years old with Social Security numbers but no death records, though only 35 people globally had reached that age.Both audits confirmed that virtually none received Social Security payments, despite records showing individuals born in 1886 and 1893 as living. Approximately 18.4 million hadn't received benefits or reported income for 50 years, suggesting they were deceased.The report attributes this to historical limitations: ""We believe it likely SSA did not receive or record most of the 18.9 million individuals' death information primarily because the individuals died decades ago—before the use of electronic death reporting.""Of those listed, 44,000 were receiving benefits, including 13 over age 112. Salustiano Sanchez-Blazquez, the world's oldest man at 112 - a musician, coal miner and gin rummy enthusiast from western New York - passed away shortly after the first audit commenced.The audits revealed 531 million unique Social Security numbers in circulation, with potential identity fraud cases. The 2015 audit identified roughly $3.1 billion in earnings reported using incorrect Social Security numbers.Alex Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute noted many numbers belonged to ""illegal immigrants paying in, not fraudulent recipients taking out."" He told The Post that migrants were ""stealing identities of people who are deceased but not marked in the Social Security system.""Experts believe Musk accessed the ""Numident"" list, containing all numbers issued since 1936. A former SSA employee explained some individuals have multiple numbers, either due to fraud or as victims requiring new numbers.Other federal agencies have faced similar issues. The Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation made $127 million in overpayments to a Teamsters' pension fund with nearly 3,500 deceased members during Joe Biden's presidency, later settling with the DOJ.Ida May Fuller, born in 1874, became the first US Social Security recipient in January 1940, collecting $22,888.92 until her death in 1975.SSA representatives haven't yet responded to comment requests.",Elon Musk shared a chart showing the number of 'eligible' social security numbers in the US.

Arctic Blast To Bring Record Cold Temperatures Across The US

Flooding devastates Kentucky and Appalachia

Frigid cold temperatures expected as polar vortex sweeps across U.S. after deadly weekend flooding

FOX Weather breaks down the deadly storms to hit the American Heartland

What is a Polar Vortex?

A brutal cold wave has swept across the central and northern US, bringing life-threatening temperatures, snowstorms, and deadly floods. The extreme weather, caused by a polar vortex , has already led to at least 13 deaths and widespread disruption.The National Weather Service (NWS) issued extreme cold warnings from the Canadian border down to Texas. Wind chills dropped to -60°F (-51°C) in North Dakota and -50°F (-46°C) in Montana on Monday, with even colder conditions forecast for Tuesday.As per predictions, the temperature in North Dakota could be around -21°C to -28°C on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Montana could face temperatures around -20°C to -27°C.Millions are experiencing freezing temperatures, with Oklahoma and Texas bracing for near-record lows. The NWS has warned of frostbite and hypothermia risks , urging people to limit outdoor exposure.North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong has waived service requirements for drivers delivering propane and petroleum products due to heating fuel shortages.Severe weekend storms in Kentucky and Tennessee dumped up to six inches (15 cm) of rain, triggering deadly floods. According to AP, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear confirmed 11 deaths, nine of them flood-related. Two additional deaths resulted from vehicle accidents. In West Virginia, Governor Patrick Morrisey has requested federal disaster assistance after floods ravaged 13 counties.Flood warnings remain in effect across Kentucky, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, West Virginia, Virginia, and Ohio.In Atlanta, a person died after a falling tree crushed a home during the storm.Blizzards and icy conditions have made travel hazardous in large parts of Michigan and Nebraska. A Nebraska state trooper died on Monday while responding to a crash on Interstate 80, authorities confirmed. Meanwhile, Colorado has reported eight weather-related deaths since Valentine’s Day.Avalanche warnings are in place for Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. The Mount Washington Avalanche Center in New Hampshire rescued two climbers after an avalanche buried one of them.In southwest Detroit, a nearly century-old water main burst, flooding streets and homes under several feet of water. Firefighters rescued stranded residents, including one person trapped on a car roof. The Great Lakes Water Authority is working to contain the damage, though the cause remains unclear.A polar vortex is a large circular air pattern in the Arctic, typically keeping frigid air trapped near the North Pole. However, disruptions in the vortex can push this cold air south, leading to extreme winter events in the US and Europe.Scientists suggest that climate change may be increasing the frequency of these disruptions. While this winter has seen record-breaking cold, global temperatures continue to rise, with January marking the 18th month in 19 to exceed the internationally agreed 1.5°C warming threshold.Authorities have urged caution, advising people to stay indoors, check on vulnerable neighbours and bring pets inside to prevent frostbite and exposure-related deaths.","Extreme weather, caused by a polar vortex, has already led to at least 13 deaths and widespread disruption.

'Be the first man on Mars': Salman Rushdie slams Elon Musk over free speech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/be-the-first-man-on-mars-salman-rushdie-slams-elon-musk-over-free-speech/articleshow/118342688.cms,"British-Indian author Salman Rushdie on Monday slammed tech billionaire Elon Musk and said that the he would love the billionaire to be the first man on Mars.In an interview to El Pais at the Hay festival, Rusdie criticised Musk for creating a discourse of the extreme-right.""Elon Musk doesn’t defend free expression. His social network curates the discourse of the extreme-right. Appropriating a noble cause — such as freedom of expression — when what you really do is the opposite is very dishonest. I’m not a fan of Mr. Musk. And I would love for him to be the first man on Mars,"" Musk said.Rushdie also recalled his meeting with Musk a decade back in Los Angeles.""If he likes it so much, then let him go. I once met him, in Los Angeles, 10 years ago. And he said that it would take seven years to get to Mars. Seven years have already passed, and I really want him to leave,"" he added.During the conversation, Rushdie also attacked the US President Donald Trump 's crackdown on illegal immigration and said that “cultural values like tolerance or empathy have lost so much support.”Emphasising that he is a double migrant, from India to England, from England to the United States, Rushdie said that he has “always tried to celebrate the more positive side of that” and that “all that migration feeds culture.”“Isn’t the United States a nation of immigrants? Apart from Native Americans, everyone is a migrant. That’s been the case since the founding fathers. The great American myth is now said to be bad, evil. Even Elon Musk is from South Africa,” said Rushdie.Rushdie survived a stabbing attack in August 2022 and recently appeared for a hearing of the ongoing trial. During the hearing that took place on February 11, Rushdie removed his glasses to show his blind right eye.Rushdie recalled how the event had barely begun when he noticed someone rushing towards him from the right.“I only saw him at the last minute,” he said. “I was aware of someone wearing dark clothes and a black face mask. I was very struck by his eyes, which were dark and seemed very ferocious to me.”",British-Indian author Salman Rushdie slammed tech billionaire Elon Musk and said that the he would love the billionaire to be the first man on Mars.

He, however declined to provide additional details on the fundraising.“Getting the Trump name behind the Enhanced Games was a monumental effort,” D’Souza told The Post.“This is now a very American project,” he added.The first edition of the Enhanced Games will include events like track, swimming, weight lifting, “combat” and gymnastics, and will likely take place later this year in a “warm” US city conducive to winter months, New York Post reported.D'Souza contends that the International Olympic Committee opposes the Enhanced Games due to concerns about competition.The event organisers will implement comprehensive medical assessments, including cardiac and brain imaging and heart rhythm monitoring, as stated on their website.""The IOC has never had competition, and they're very threatened by that,"" D'Souza said, describing them as ""legacy incumbents that have a giant, multi-billion dollar, century-long monopoly.""D'Souza anticipates better alignment with the Trump administration, particularly with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new Health and Human Services secretary, who acknowledges using testosterone replacement therapy.“We wouldn’t have hosted the games in the United States if Biden was elected,” he said.“Silicon Valley CEOs were by and large all Democrats until this election, and it was because of the Biden administration’s deep, deep antagonism towards innovation and technology,” he added.""He's in his 70s and he's doing pull-ups and going to the gym every day in a way that Joe Biden never could,"" D'Souza remarked.The venture has attracted prominent investors, including crypto investor Balaji Srinivasan and German billionaire Angermayer, who specialises in biotech and psychedelics investments.Thiel, the PayPal and Palantir Technologies co-founder, is also involved. His previous notable involvement includes funding Hulk Hogan's successful lawsuit against Gawker, which D'Souza managed.D'Souza, who has invested significantly and admits to using performance enhancers, argues that alcohol poses greater risks, citing a 15-year-old study.He criticises the Olympics' association with what he considers harmful substances.""The two drugs...are fast food and processed food, and those have done more damage to public health than any other substance in the totality of human history,"" he saidCurrently, only retired Australian Olympic swimmer James Magnussen has publicly expressed interest, following a $1.5 million offer to break the 50-metre freestyle record.""If they put up $1m for the 50 freestyle world record, I will come on board as their first athlete,"" he stated on a sports podcast, adding, ""I'll juice to the gills and I'll break it in six months.""","The Enhanced Games will include events like track, swimming, weight lifting, “combat” and gymnastics.

"Porsche loses 'premium' tag in China, thanks to 'smarter' tech at budget price",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/porsche-loses-premium-tag-in-china-thanks-to-smarter-tech-at-budget-price/articleshow/118342225.cms,"BERLIN: After decades of dominating China's market for high-performance cars with precision engineering, German automakers are losing out to Chinese rivals that have shifted the definition of a high-end car to one that is electric, smart and affordable.Many new Chinese vehicles resemble their German rivals, including the popular Xiaomi SU7, which mimics Porsche's Taycan. The SU7 rivals the Taycan in power and braking, but also includes integrated artificial intelligence that can, for instance, help with parking and greet drivers with their favorite song. The cherry on top: It sells for roughly half the price of a Taycan. As a result, German automakers that for decades commanded China's premium car market are now seeing their sales dwindle, while Xiaomi - a leading Chinese smartphone manufacturer - last year sold more than 100,000 models of the SU7.Among the hardest hit has been Porsche, which reported last month that its deliveries in China plunged 28% in 2024. Although Porsche's sales were up in every other region around the world, the decline in China was significant enough to pull down its global deliveries for the year by 3%.For years, German automakers relied on the Chinese market to make up for weaker demand elsewhere, leading them to ignore deeper problems at home. Chief among them was a reluctance to adopt technology that has come to define driving in China: electric vehicles equipped with sophisticated software and, increasingly, artificial intelligence.Market experts said advances in software and features such as automated driving and remote control had become standard in Chinese electric cars , pressuring European automakers used to cashing in on their brand names to step up their game. ""I think Chinese consumers right now are ready to accept that Chinese companies can produce cars that are considered as premium to them,"" said an economist.This month, Porsche said it would part ways with its finance chief and a top sales executive, both of whom had come under pressure for poor performance, including in China. Last week, Porsche said it would cut up to 1,900 jobs in Germany over the coming years. The SU7 is not yet available for export, but a few models have reached the US. Ford Motor CEO James D Farley Jr. said he had one shipped to Chicagoand ""didn't want to give it up"".Xiaomi has also been testing pared-down versions of its SU7 Ultra, which will be released in China in March, on Germany's storied racetrack, the Nurburgring. In Oct, the car set a record for the ""fastest four-door sedan,"" and industry media and car fans cheered the news, excited that the SU7 had beaten Porsche's Taycan by 20 seconds. Racetrack officials, however, said the times were not comparable because the Chinese car was a preliminary version competing in an essentially open category, while the Taycan was a showroom-ready model and ran in a highly regulated category. Regardless, the message was unmistakable. nyt","Many new Chinese vehicles resemble their German rivals, including the popular Xiaomi SU7, which mimics Porsche's Taycan.

Elon Musk Jokes About Vampires After US Social Security Data Anomaly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-us-social-security-database-makes-elon-musk-think-vampires-are-real/articleshow/118321397.cms,"DOGE lead Elon Musk stirred up a storm on social media when he shared a screenshot of what seemed to be data from the US Social Security database . The screenshot featured some unusual records that raised eyebrows, and Musk’s witty commentary took the attention of many.In his X post, Musk pointed to a surprising anomaly in the Social Security database—an official record containing information about individuals in the SSA's age demographics.The data shown seems to represent the age brackets of individuals still listed as alive in the SSA's records and includes highly unlikely age ranges like 100-109 and above. This raises questions about potential data errors, fraud , or humorous speculation about immortality or vampirism.The data pointed out millions listed as being over 100 years old. This is where Musk humorously suggested that perhaps these individuals are not just elderly citizens but vampires .“According to the Social Security database, these are the numbers of people in each age bucket with the death field set to FALSE!” Musk wrote. “Maybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security,” he added, referencing the popular vampire-themed ""Twilight"" series.The mention of vampires, like Edward Cullen from the “Twilight” franchise, implied that these individuals, though listed as over 100 years old, might just be immortal beings collecting Social Security benefits . Musk’s post also raised important questions about the integrity of the data within the database.Commenters on Musk’s post quickly pointed out that this could be a “massive fraud red flag” and called for an urgent audit of the data. The concerns stem from the possibility that these numbers could reflect errors in the database or fraudulent activity that goes unnoticed and needs to be addressed.""Over 20M 'people' listed as 100+ years old in the SS database? Time for a serious audit. Either we've got immortals gaming the system or some major data integrity issues,"" said one X user, calling for a thorough check and audit of the database.While the data in question is real and pulled from an official source, its accuracy in representing the actual population is now in doubt. The sight of so many people supposedly over 100, especially when compared to the total US population , is highly unusual and suggests potential data integrity issues.The discrepancy in the Social Security data might point to a serious need for these techniques, especially if fraud is a factor.","DOGE lead Elon Musk shared a screenshot of what seemed to be data from the US Social Security database.

Argentina's President Javier Milei was charged with fraud on Sunday for promoting a cryptocurrency called '$LIBRA', which caused significant financial losses to its investors.The fraud charges were filed in a criminal court after Milei posted about the coin on social media last week, claiming that $LIBRA was designed to encourage economic growth by supporting small businesses and startups. However, the post was removed just hours after it was shared, leading to a sharp drop in the value of the currency and significant losses for investors, according to financial site Dexscreener.One of the plaintiffs, lawyer Jonatan Baldiviezo, told the news agency Associated Press that Milei's actions could be considered part of an illicit scheme designed to defraud investors. He compared the incident to a ""rug pull"" in the crypto world, where developers abandon a project after attracting investors, leaving the token worthless.Following the public backlash, Milei claimed on X that he was unaware of the details of the cryptocurrency's development and explained that he deleted the post after learning more about the project.The president's office also said that Milei was not involved in the cryptocurrency's development. They said that the post was deleted to limit further speculation and exposure to the project.The president’s office also confirmed that the anti-corruption office would be investigating the matter. .","Argentina's President Javier Milei was charged with fraud on Sunday for promoting a cryptocurrency called '$LIBRA' The fraud charges were filed in a criminal court after Milei posted about the coin on social media last week.

Enraged, he left his home in Epinay-sur-Orge, Essonne, on February 7 to walk off his anger. But what followed was a horrific crime.Prosecutor Grégoire Dulin said Owen initially planned to “rob or extort money from someone to calm down” but instead “accidentally” crossed paths with 11-year-old Louise Lasalle , who was on her way home from school. The suspect noticed her mobile phone, which she wore on a cord around her neck, and decided to follow her.He reportedly tricked Louise into following him into the woods by pretending he had lost something.

French President Emmanuel Macron has convened an emergency meeting of European leaders to discuss the implications of US President Donald Trump 's actions, according to European officials.The meeting, scheduled for Monday in Paris, was revealed by Polish foreign minister Radosław Sikorski at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. Two European Union officials confirmed the development to Politico.""I'm very glad that President Macron has called our leaders to Paris,"" Sikorski said, emphasising that the discussions will address Trump’s recent moves ""in a very serious fashion.""Sikorski also compared Trump's approach to foreign policy to a Russian military strategy known as razvedka boyem—or ""reconnaissance through battle""—where a leader pushes boundaries to test reactions before adjusting positions. ""You push and you see what happens, and then you change your position. And we need to respond,"" he added.Trump's impact on Nato and European security has been a recurring concern among EU leaders. While Sikorski has previously acknowledged Trump's calls for European nations to increase their defence spending , he has also been vocal about the broader risks the US president poses to global stability .Macron, however, has maintained a cordial relationship with Trump. Following Trump's re-election in November, the French leader expressed a willingness to collaborate with him again. ""Ready to work together as we did for four years. With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition.

Wave of deportations

Families in distress

Political reactions

NEW DELHI: A third US aircraft carrying 112 illegal Indian immigrants landed at Amritsar International Airport on Sunday, sources said. This marks the latest batch of deportations as part of the US administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration.This comes after two earlier flights brought back Indian immigrants. On February 5, a US military aircraft carrying 104 deportees landed in Amritsar, followed by another flight late Saturday night carrying 116 deportees. Reports indicate that many had spent lakhs on illegal routes, often referred to as ""donkey routes,"" only to be detained and sent back.According to officials, the deportees hail from Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Goa, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir. Most are between 18 and 30 years old.The deportations have left families in shock, many of whom took massive loans or sold land to finance their relatives' journeys. A relative of Gurjinder Singh (27), a deportee from Punjab, revealed that the family spent nearly ?50-55 lakh to send him abroad, only to see their hopes shattered.Punjab NRI affairs minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal met some deportees at the airport and assured them of the state government's support. He also urged victims to file complaints against travel agents who deceived them, promising strict action.Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann criticized the Centre, saying, “Do not make our holy city a deport center.” He assured that the Punjab government has arranged transportation and food for the deportees and even extended support to those from Haryana.Meanwhile, Haryana’s government faced criticism for using buses typically reserved for prisoners to transport deportees back home. Punjab’s ministers have slammed the move, calling it disrespectful.","Aircraft carrying 112 illegal Indian immigrants landed at Amritsar International Airport on Sunday.

Pritam Singh: Indian-Origin Opposition Leader in Singapore Found Guilty of False Testimony,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/singapore-indian-origin-opposition-leader-pritam-singh-found-guilty-of-giving-false-testimony/articleshow/118320043.cms,"File photo: Singapore’s leader of the opposition Pritam Singh (Picture credit: AFP)

Potential disqualification from elections

Indian-origin opposition leader in Singapore, Pritam Singh , was found guilty on Monday of giving false testimony to a parliamentary committee, a verdict that could see him disqualified from Parliament and affect his ability to contest the upcoming general election.Deputy principal district judge Luke Tan convicted Singh on two charges related to his handling of a case involving Raeesah Khan , a former lawmaker from his Workers’ Party, who was found to have lied in Parliament. As per PTI, Singh was accused of wilfully providing false answers to the committee of privileges (COP) during its inquiry into Khan’s case on December 10 and December 15, 2021.The case stemmed from Khan’s false claim in Parliament, where she alleged that she had accompanied a sexual assault victim to the police station and witnessed insensitive comments by an officer. However, the claim was later debunked, leading to her resignation from Parliament.Judge Tan, in his ruling, stated that Singh had not taken sufficient steps to ensure Khan admitted to her falsehood and dismissed Singh’s defence that he was unaware of the fabricated story.According to AFP, the judge also accepted Khan’s testimony that Singh had told her to ""take the lie to the grave.""Singh, 48, now faces a potential prison sentence of up to three years, a fine of up to SGD 7,000 ($5,290), or both for each charge. Under Singapore’s constitution, a person fined at least SGD 10,000 ($7,400) or jailed for at least one year is disqualified from contesting elections and holding a parliamentary seat for five years.The prosecution has indicated that it will seek a fine for each charge, as per AFP.This conviction is a significant setback for Singapore’s opposition, particularly ahead of a general election that must be called by November 2025. Singh’s Workers’ Party achieved a historic victory in the 2020 elections, winning 10 seats in Parliament, marking its best performance since independence.Singapore’s ruling People’s Action Party (PAP), which has governed since 1959, continues to dominate the political scene, but the Workers’ Party had been seen as a growing opposition force. The upcoming election will be the first major political test for Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.","Indian-origin opposition leader in Singapore, Pritam Singh, was found guilty on Monday of giving false testimony to a parliamentary committee.

The Social Security Administration 's acting commissioner has stepped down from her role at the agency over Department of Government Efficiency requests to access Social Security recipient information, according to two people familiar with the official's departure who were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly. Acting Commissioner Michelle King's departure from the agency over the weekend - after more than 30 years of service - was initiated after King refused to provide DOGE staffers at the SSA with access to sensitive information, the people said Monday.The White House has replaced her as acting commissioner with Leland Dudek, who currently works at the SSA, the people said.White House spokesperson Harrison Fields released a statement Monday night saying: "" President Trump has nominated the highly qualified and talented Frank Bisignano to lead the Social Security Administration, and we expect him to be swiftly confirmed in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the agency will be led by a career Social Security anti-fraud expert as the acting commissioner.""Fields added, ""President Trump is committed to appointing the best and most qualified individuals who are dedicated to working on behalf of the American people, not to appease the bureaucracy that has failed them for far too long.""King's exit from the administration is one of several departures of high-ranking officials concerned about DOGE staffers' potential unlawful access to private taxpayer information.DOGE has accessed Treasury payment systems and is attempting to access Internal Revenue Service databases.Since Republican President Donald Trump has retaken the White House, his billionaire adviser Elon Musk has rapidly burrowed deep into federal agencies while avoiding public scrutiny of his work through the DOGE group.Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the preservation of Social Security benefits , said of DOGE's efforts that ""there is no way to overstate how serious a breach this is. And my understanding is that it has already occurred.""""The information collected and securely held by the Social Security Administration is highly sensitive,"" she said. ""SSA has data on everyone who has a Social Security number, which is virtually all Americans, everyone who has Medicare, and every low-income American who has applied for Social Security's means-tested companion programme, Supplemental Security Income .""""If there is an evil intent to punish perceived enemies, someone could erase your earnings record, making it impossible to collect the Social Security and Medicare benefits you have earned.""The future of Social Security has become a top political issue and was a major point of contention in the 2024 election. About 72.5 million people, including retirees, disabled people and children, receive Social Security benefits.","Acting Commissioner Michelle King stepped down after more than 30 years of service.

Trump admin fires hundreds of FAA workers weeks after DC plane crash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-admin-fires-hundreds-of-faa-workers-weeks-after-dc-plane-crash/articleshow/118333672.cms,"Struggle with understaffing

The Trump administration has begun dismissing hundreds of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) employees, disrupting air travel during a busy weekend. This move comes just weeks after the fatal mid-air collision at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.The notifications continued into the night, and more staff could be anticipated to get fired over the long weekend or even prevented from entering FAA buildings from Tuesday.These firings were focused on probationary staff, with employees receiving emails late on Friday informing them of their dismissal, said David Spero, president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union.The affected workers include those working with FAA radar, landing, and navigational aid maintenance as per AP.Spero stated that the lay off happened “without cause nor based on performance or conduct.” The termination mails were sent from an 'exec order' Microsoft email address rather than a government address.These layoffs come as the FAA struggles with a staffing shortage, specifically among air traffic controllers . Federal officials have been raising concerns about the strained and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially following a series of close calls between aircraft at US airports.These staffing issues have been attributed to factors like low pay, long working hours, intense training and mandatory retirements. The news of the firings was first reported by CNN.During the tragic crash on January 29 between a US Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines passenger jet, both commercial airline and helicopter traffic were managed by a single controller at the busy airport.The Elon Musk-led department of government efficiency, which is overseeing the administration’s efforts to reduce the size of the federal government, did not immediately comment on the matter.","FAA employees received emails late on Friday informing them of their dismissal.

Empire Builder. Environmentalist. Destroyer. Father: What Elon Musk has in common with Genghis Khan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/empire-builder-environmentalist-destroyer-father-what-elon-musk-has-in-common-with-genghis-khan/articleshow/118330183.cms,"Empire Builders: One Conquered Land, the Other Conquers Industries

Fearless Expansionists

Destroyers of the Status Quo: Out with the Old, In with the Chaos

Followers Across the Globe: Armies of Soldiers vs. Armies of Fanboys

Unusual Naming Habits: From Warriors to Equations

Genghis Khan’s sons: Jochi, Chagatai, Ogedei, Tolui—strong, powerful names of warriors.

Environmentalists: Yes, Really

The 13th Child: Musk’s Personal Khan Moment?

What’s Next? The Legend Grows

Amid rumors that he has birthed a 13th child, Elon Musk tweeted that he finds the history of Genghis Khan ""particularly interesting."" Now, that’s not surprising at all, given the fact that Elon Musk and Genghis Khan are practically the same people—warlords hellbent on spreading their seed, conquering new lands, destroying the status quo, annihilating their opponents, and reducing carbon footprints on a global scale.While Musk has so far fathered 13 children (if rumours are to be believed), Genghis Khan is estimated to have fathered thousands, with modern genetic studies suggesting that roughly 16 million men today carry his Y-chromosome. By comparison, Musk—who has often spoken about his mission to combat declining birth rates—seems to be operating at a more modest scale.At first glance, Musk and Genghis Khan couldn’t be more different. One was a warlord who united the Mongol tribes through brutal conquest, while the other builds electric cars, sends rockets to space, and manipulates stock markets with a tweet. But dig a little deeper, and the parallels are uncanny.Genghis Khan didn’t just win battles—he reshaped entire civilizations. The Mongol Empire, at its peak, spanned 9.27 million square miles, making it the largest contiguous land empire in history. He crushed old systems, destroyed cities that resisted, and rewrote the rules of warfare and governance.Musk, too, is an empire builder—not with swords, but with technology and aggressive business tactics. He disrupted the automotive industry with Tesla, taking on legacy giants like General Motors and Toyota. With SpaceX , he forced NASA and Boeing to play catch-up, making space travel not only cool again but commercially viable. With X (formerly Twitter), he turned an already chaotic social media landscape into an unfiltered war zone of free speech absolutism. Neuralink and xAI? More territories on the map of Musk’s ever-expanding dominion.If the 13th-century world was a chessboard of rival warlords, Musk’s is a marketplace of outdated industries, ripe for disruption and conquest.Genghis Khan didn’t play defense. His strategy was simple—attack, expand, dominate. The Mongols moved at lightning speed, taking city after city, crushing their enemies, and absorbing the best talent into their empire.Musk operates the same way. Tesla didn’t just make electric cars—it waged war on the entire auto industry . SpaceX didn’t just launch rockets—it rewrote the space race. Musk’s companies don’t enter markets; they storm the gates. Tesla’s aggressive pricing strategies forced legacy automakers to shift toward EVs at breakneck speed. SpaceX’s reusable rockets made traditional aerospace contracts look like relics of a bygone era.And then there’s X. When Musk bought Twitter, he didn’t just take over a company—he declared war on the entire media establishment, journalists, and traditional social norms around content moderation. He slashed staff, upended the business model, and turned the platform into his own digital fiefdom.Like Khan’s blitzkrieg across Eurasia, Musk’s expansion is relentless, unorthodox, and utterly ruthless.Genghis Khan wasn’t just a conqueror—he was a disruptor. His armies dismantled centuries-old feudal systems, shattered powerful kingdoms, and redrew the map of the known world. The Mongols introduced new governance models, promoted trade routes (like the Silk Road ), and even established an early postal system. But before innovation came destruction. Entire cities were razed. Dynasties were obliterated. The old world had to die for the new one to rise.Musk follows the same philosophy. When he takes over an industry, he doesn’t just compete—he destroys the old order. Traditional automakers laughed at Tesla until they found themselves scrambling to go electric. NASA underestimated SpaceX until its own programs looked archaic. And Twitter? The moment Musk took over, he fired nearly 80% of its staff, tore up content moderation policies, and rebranded it as ""X,"" discarding years of accumulated brand equity.Just as Khan rewrote the rules of war, Musk rewrites the rules of business and media. Both leave destruction in their wake—though one with swords, the other with spreadsheets and tweets.Khan commanded one of the most disciplined, effective military forces in history. His soldiers were fiercely loyal, adopting the Mongol way of war and governance. His empire, at its height, ruled over more than 100 million people, from China to Eastern Europe.Musk? He commands a different kind of army—tech investors, engineers, and die-hard fanboys. He has millions of followers who hang onto his every tweet, push Tesla stock to astronomical heights, and defend him against any and all criticism. Musk’s followers aren’t just customers; they’re disciples.Khan’s warriors rode on horseback. Musk’s army fights online, flooding social media with memes, arguing with skeptics, and buying Tesla stock like it’s a ticket to Valhalla.Khan named his sons after great warriors. Musk? He takes a slightly more… futuristic approach. His children’s names sound like they were generated by an AI glitch.Elon Musk’s children: X Æ A-12, Exa Dark Sideræl, Techno Mechanicus—strong, powerful names of... math equations?Khan’s names carried the weight of history. Musk’s sound like he’s future-proofing them for a dystopian cyberpunk world. Either way, both leaders ensure their bloodline is marked by distinct, unforgettable names.Like Thanos, Musk is famously obsessed with reducing carbon footprints. Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. His solar and battery companies aim to make fossil fuels obsolete. Even SpaceX’s long-term goal—colonizing Mars—is framed as a way to secure humanity’s survival.But here’s the wild twist—Genghis Khan was, in a way, also an environmentalist. His conquests wiped out an estimated 40 million people, and in the process, vast farmlands were abandoned, forests regrew, and global carbon levels dropped. Some researchers argue that the Mongol invasions effectively acted as a carbon sink.Musk reduces emissions through electric cars. Khan did it through sheer annihilation. The methods couldn’t be more different, but the outcome—lowering humanity’s footprint—is oddly similar.The timing couldn’t be more intriguing. Just as speculation swirls that Musk has fathered a 13th child—this time with conservative influencer Ashley St. Clair—his sudden interest in history’s most infamous conqueror raises eyebrows.If the rumours are true, Musk’s growing dynasty mirrors Khan’s legendary genetic legacy. He’s often spoken about the dangers of declining birth rates, and unlike most billionaires who simply tweet their opinions, Musk actively contributes to the solution.Yet, unlike Khan, whose children were openly acknowledged, Musk’s latest offspring remains shrouded in mystery. No public records. No official confirmation. Just whispers and a cryptic ""Whoa"" from Musk himself.Elon Musk isn’t slowing down—neither in business nor in family planning. Whether he’s launching rockets or raising heirs, his approach remains the same: aggressive, unconventional, and utterly relentless.Genghis Khan reshaped the world through conquest. Musk is doing it through technology. Both men built empires. Both disrupted the status quo. Both were, and are, unstoppable forces in their respective eras.And if Musk’s fascination with Genghis Khan is any indicator, he’s only just getting started.","Elon Musk tweeted that he finds the history of Genghis Khan ""particularly interesting"" Musk and Khan are practically the same people: warlords hellbent on spreading their seed. Musk’s companies don’t enter markets; they storm the gates.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118330492,imgsize-56046,width-400,resizemode-4/118330492.jpg"

This was an extremely vile act. The electricity in my cell was shut off for five days, leaving me in complete darkness. I was confined to the cell for ten days. For several weeks, any visits by family members, doctors, or lawyers were blocked. They want to break me through this torture and hardship, but I will stand firm for the genuine freedom of the Pakistnation.""Under the constitutional amendment, the term for the chief justice of Pakistan has been set at three years.

NEW DELHI: Eight years after he was declared an absconder by a court in Delhi, Mohammed Usman , a hardened operative of the al-Qaida in Indian subcontinent ( AQIS ) has been traced in Pakistan, sources say.Usman is learnt to be lodged in Lahore jail subsequent to his arrest in a criminal case in that country. A routine enquiry from the ministry of external affairs by the Pak govt about a dozen Indian origin inmates and fishermen lodged in different jail led to this discovery and ultimately blew Usman's cover.Usman, a resident of Sambhal , had absconded after Delhi Police's special cell first the first AQIS module in 2015. He was termed a fugitive in 2016 along with other AQIS chiefs Asim Umar aka Sanaul Haq and Farhatullah Ghori besides other operatives identified as Sharjeel Akhtar, Mohammed Arshiyan, Rehan, Shahid Faisal, Umar Hyderabadi and Abu Sufiyan.A group of arrested AQIS operatives including Mohammad Asif were convicted in 2023. The court had then observed that the prosecution would revive its case against these accused -- who have been declared s ‘Proclaimed Offenders’ vide order dated 12.07.2016 -- when they are arrested by the police.The operation against the AQIS module had kicked off after special cell received information that the terrorist outfit was trying to set up its base in India. ""The objective is to disturb its peace and tranquility for which its module became active in Western UP, particularly in District Sambhal. The tip was developed and surveillance mounted to ascertain the identity of suspects visiting foreign countries including Iran, Turkey and Pakistan in a suspicious manner,"" recalled a senior investigator.During investigation, the arrested suspects spilled the beans on Usman and others and also revealed the identity of elusive AQIS chief Maulana Asim Umar as Sanaul Haq, a resident of Deepa Sarai in Sambhal.""One of the accused Zafar Masood had visited Pakistan in November-December, 1999 pretending to be doing the business of 'Pan/Kattha' and met Asim Umar at a training camp named Harkat-e-Mujahidin .

ISLAMABAD: At least 10 people were killed and six injured a bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by in Harnai district of southwestern Balochistan province on Friday, officials said.Hazrat Wali Kakar, Harnai’s top civilian official, said the bomb was an improvised explosive device (IED). “Ten mining workers were killed in the attack,” Kakar said.Saleem Tareen, another local official, said most of the victims were from the country’s northwestern Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province. “The labourers were traveling to a market in Harnai,” he added. Harnai lies some 160 km east of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province.Authorities said they were investigating the attack, with officials saying evidence was being collected and that preliminary investigation showed the explosive material had been planted on the roadside.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet. But the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organisation fighting for independence, is active in the restive province that borders Afghanistan and Iran. The group usually targets security forces as well as Pakistanis from other provinces.

Such steps accentuate military imbalances in the region and undermine strategic stability.

Pakistan says at least 16 nationals died in migrant boat sinking near Libya,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-says-at-least-16-nationals-died-in-migrant-boat-sinking-near-libya/articleshow/118152842.cms,"Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed grief after a boat carrying Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya’s coast

ISLAMABAD: At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank at the weekend off the coast of Libya , officials said Tuesday.The ministry of foreign affairs said that 33 of the 37 survivors were in Libyan police custody and one was being treated at a hospital. An estimated 65 people were on the boat, it said.Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his deep grief and sorrow for those lost in the capsizing in Marsa Dela port in the western city of Zawiya.Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to complete the process of identifying the victims and provide assistance to those affected. He also ordered action against those involved ""in heinous acts like human trafficking,"" according to a statement.Most of the victims came from Kurram, a district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan , where hundreds of people have been killed in recent years in sectarian clashes.""People try to travel to Europe through illegal means because of unemployment"" at home, said Javed Hussain, a nephew of Shehzad Hussain, one of the victims. He said mourners were gathering at the homes of those who perished in the latest tragedy.In January, authorities said dozens of Pakistanis died when a boat capsized off West Africa. Some of the survivors later accused smugglers of killing 43 migrants in a dispute over payment. Pakistan has since confirmed the deaths of 13 of its nationals.Hundreds of Pakistanis die every year while trying to reach Europe by land and sea with the help of human smugglers. They also use dangerous land and sea routes to reach Europe in an effort to find jobs.Libya, which has borders with six nations and a long shore on the Mediterranean, was plunged into chaos following a Nato-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Since then, the oil-rich country has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East for Europe.At least 674 migrants were reported dead and more than 1,000 missing off Libya in 2024, according to the International Organization for Migration's missing migrants project. More than 21,700 migrants were intercepted and returned to the chaos-stricken country.In 2023, the IOM reported 962 migrants dead and 1,563 missing off Libya. Around 17,200 migrants were intercepted and returned to Libya that year, it said.Those who are returned are held in government-run detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture - practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to UN-commissioned investigators. The abuse often accompanies attempts to extort money from the families of the imprisoned migrants before releasing them or allowing them to leave Libya on traffickers' boats to Europe.","At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya.

Corruption Perceptions Index: Pakistan's ranking on corruption index drops by 2 spots: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-ranking-on-corruption-index-drops-by-2-spots-report/articleshow/118143601.cms,"Pakistan's flag

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024 out of 180 countries, a media report said on Tuesday. The CPI ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption on a scale of zero (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean), Dawn.com reported.The CPI report is released annually by Transparency International Berlin.Transparency International Pakistan (TIP) has no role either in the collection of data or the calculation of the country's score, TIP explains.The score for Pakistan also reduced by two points from 29 in CPI 2023 to 27 in CPI 2024.According to a Transparency International document listing Pakistan's CPI ranking and scores from 1996 to 2024, which was seen by Dawn.com, the country's score in the past 10 years has ranged between 27 and 33 points (a higher score indicating less corruption).Since 2012, when the index changed to a scoring scale of 100 from 10, Pakistan's score rose from 27 to 33 in 2018 but declined consecutively back to 27 last year.Statistics from the past show that in 1996, Pakistan ranked only second-last out of 54 countries part of the index back then, with a score of 1/10.From 1997 to 2011, the country's score went back and forth, reaching as high as 2.7 in 1998 and dropping as low as 2.1 in 2004 and 2005.According to TIP chair Justice (retired) Zia Perwez, the scores of all countries in the region except Oman, China, Turkiye and Mongolia declined. The downslide for the region showed that Pakistan was one of the countries holding up against the overall trend in the region.Global corruption levels remained alarmingly high, with efforts to reduce them faltering, according to the CPI report, which exposed serious corruption levels across the globe, with more than two-thirds of countries scoring below 50 out of 100.Almost 6.8 billion people live in countries with CPI scores under 50 - equivalent to 85 per cent of the world population of 8 billion.For the seventh year in a row, Denmark obtained the highest score on the index (90) and was closely followed by Finland (88) and Singapore (84).Countries with the lowest scores were mostly fragile and conflict-affected ones like South Sudan (8), Somalia (9), Venezuela (10), Syria (12), Libya (13), Eritrea (13), Yemen (13) and Equatorial Guinea (13).While the CPI noted that the Middle East and North Africa's rising average score was a ""reason for optimism"", it pointed out that it was the first increase in over a decade and only by one point - to 39 out of 100.According to Transparency International, the top-scoring region was Western Europe and the European Union, but its score ""decreased overall for the second year in a row - many leaders are serving business interests rather than the common good and laws are often poorly enforced"".""While Asia Pacific does have a range of improving countries, its average score is decreasing, as vicious cycles of corruption and climate change impacts take their toll,"" it added.Over a quarter of the countries in the sample (47) got their lowest score yet on the index, including Austria (67), Bangladesh (23), Brazil (34), Cuba (41), France (67), Germany (75), Haiti (16), Hungary (41), Iran (23), Mexico (26), Russia (22), South Sudan (8), Switzerland (81), the United States (65) and Venezuela (10).Over the past five years, seven countries have significantly improved their scores in the index: These include Cote d'Ivoire (45), the Dominican Republic (36), Kosovo (44), Kuwait (46), the Maldives (38), Moldova (43) and Zambia (39).The global average on the index remained unchanged at 43, highlighting the need for urgent action against corruption and warning of a critical global obstacle to implementing successful climate action.",Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024.

Pakistani lawyers stage protest against high-level meeting of constitutional body to pick eight SC judges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-lawyers-stage-protest-against-high-level-meeting-of-constitutional-body-to-pick-eight-sc-judges/articleshow/118118105.cms,"Representative image (Image credits: ANI)

ISLAMABAD: Hundreds of lawyers on Monday staged protests in Pakistan's national capital against a high-level meeting of a constitutional body with the agenda to appoint at least eight judges of the supreme court. The judicial commission of Pakistan (JCP) meeting was being held despite opposition by four apex court judges, the legal fraternity, resistance by opposition the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and controversy over the recent transfer of judges to the Islamabad high court (IHC), which was opposed by five IHC judges.The JCP, a top body empowered to approve judicial appointments, will finalise appointments for eight vacant supreme court judges.Lawyers gathered at various locations in Islamabad, with the lawyers' action committee staging a protest near D-Chowk. But police responded by closing several key entry points to the Red Zone, which houses key buildings, including the supreme court.Dozens of protestors gathered at Serena Chowk as they were stopped from going to the supreme court due to the closure of the Red Zone. They chanted ""Azaadi"" (freedom) and ""Lawyers' unity zindabad"" (long live lawyers' unity). They were also holding a banner written in Urdu and reading "" 26th constitutional amendment unacceptable"".Clashes were also reported between lawyers and police when they tried to enter the Red Zone. However, there was no report of any arrest or injury during the protest.The protest led to the suspension of metro bus services on multiple routes between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, causing significant inconvenience for commuters. The closure of the Red Zone has caused traffic disruptions, leading to heavy congestion on different roads in the capital.Earlier, the legal fraternity in the country was already expressing concerns against the new appointments and transfers following the controversial 26th constitutional amendment passed last year.The lawyers' representatives had held a convention at the Islamabad district courts, opposing the 26th amendment and demanding the cancellation of the JCP meeting.They also announced on February 3 to protest against the transfer of three high court judges to the IHC but it could not elicit a widespread response. The Karachi bar association had supported the strike call by staying away.Last month, the Lahore high court bar association (LHCBA) moved an application before the apex court through advocate Muhammad Waqar Rana, seeking postponement of the JCP meeting.The JCP earlier this month asked all high courts to send a list of five senior judges from each for consideration for the appointment of eight of them to the supreme court.Initially, the IHC had forwarded the names of three judges - chief justice Aamer Farooq, justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb - to the JCP because justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Babar Sattar did not meet the minimum requirement of five years of service.However, as justice Sarfraz Dogar was made the IHC senior puisne judge following his transfer there from the Lahore high court, his name has also been sent to the JCP.Days before justice Dogar's name was added, five judges of the IHC approached chief justice Yahya Afridi and IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq to reclaim their seniority.Separately, four SC judges, senior puisne judge justice Mansoor Ali Shah, justice Munib Akhtar, justice Ayesha Malik and justice Athar Minallah, in a letter to the chief justice showed concerns last week and are also seeking the postponement of today's JCP session until a decision is made on the petitions against the 26th Amendment.The opposition PTI party in a letter to the chief justice on Sunday asked to postpone the commission's meeting.The 13-member JCP is led by the chief justice and includes four judges of the apex court, as well as parliamentarians from both the treasury and opposition and others.The lawyers and opposition allege that the government was trying to 'pack' the top judiciary with hand-picked judges to influence the fate of political cases, a concern rejected by the government.","Hundreds of lawyers stage protests in Islamabad against high-level meeting of constitutional body.

NEW YORK: A week after a Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur bought an artwork composed of a fresh banana stuck to a wall with duct tape for $6.2 million at auction, the man, Justin Sun , announced a grand gesture on X. He said he planned on purchasing 100,000 bananas - or $25,000 worth of the produce - from the Manhattan stand where the original fruit was sold for 25 cents.But at the fruit stand, outside the doors of the Sotheby's where the conceptual artwork was sold, the offer landed with a thud against the realities of the life of a New York City street vendor . It would cost thousands of dollars to procure that many bananas from a Bronx wholesale market, said Shah Alam, the 74-year-old employee from Bangladesh who sold the original banana used in ""Comedian"", an absurdist commentary on the art world by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan . And, it wouldn't be easy to move that many bananas, which come in boxes of about 100.And then there is the math: The net profit from the purchase of 100,000 bananas by Sun - who once bought a nonfungible token of a pet rock for more than $600,000 - would be about $6,000. ""There's not any profit in selling bananas,"" Alam said. Plus, as an employee who makes $12 an hour during 12-hour shifts, Alam pointed out that any money would by rights belong to the fruit stand's owner, not him. The stand's owner, Mohammad Islam, 53, said he would split any profit between himself, Alam and the six other people he employs at his two fruit stands.Working in the rain on Thanksgiving Day, Islam's brother, Mohammad Alam Badsha (not related to Alam) said he would welcome the bulk purchase. But it would have little tangible impact to fruit vendors, Badsha said. ""It's definitely an inequality,"" he said in Bengali. He added a Bangladeshi idiom: It was the difference between heaven and hell.","Justin Sun, a Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur bought an artwork composed of a fresh banana stuck to a wall with duct tape for $6.2 million at auction.

Did Biden's border policies cost Democrats the White House? Party members blame ‘political malpractice',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-bidens-border-policies-cost-democrats-the-white-house-party-members-blame-political-malpractice/articleshow/115825001.cms,"'Political malpractice'

How did Biden's policies backfire?

Border crisis

What led to Trump’s victory?

After US President-elect Donald Trump ’s sweeping victory, Democrats spent Thanksgiving reflecting on what went wrong, with many admitting that President Biden’s handling of the border crisis alienated voters and handed Republicans control of the White House, New York Post reports.Party insiders have privately acknowledged that their failure to address concerns about illegal immigration hurt vice president Kamala Harris ’ campaign.“We destroyed ourselves on the immigration issue in ways that were entirely predictable and entirely manageable,” a Democratic senator told The Hill, acknowledging the party's role in their election loss. “We utterly mismanaged that issue, including our Democratic caucus here. That’s political malpractice,” they added.A source close to New York City mayor Eric Adams said his warnings about the effects of a porous border on cities and working-class voters were ignored. “For two years, [he] warned, and they did not listen.""One House Democrat said the party needed to simplify its message to win voter support saying, “We need to admit to the American people, ‘crime and illegal immigration are bad.’”Many Blue party members blamed Joe Biden ’s border policies for the Democrats’ defeat. These included halting the construction of Trump’s border wall, ending the “Remain in Mexico” policy, and pausing deportations.“Why would you do that? Who are you trying to play to?” another Democratic senator told The Hill, voicing confusion and frustration over Biden's policies.In January 2023, Eric Adams had warned Biden’s campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, that working-class voters were angry about the growing number of low-skilled asylum seekers. Instead of heeding the warning, Chavez dismissed Adams, accusing him of using Republican talking points.“Now Democrats are paying the price,” an official close to Adams said.The border crisis hit a record high last December with over 302,000 crossings in a single month. Critics accused him of hiding the problem by funnelling migrants through legal entry points.Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in January that over 85% of illegal border crossers were released into the US, up from 71% the previous October.These policies fuelled Republican attacks, leaving Democrats vulnerable on an issue that mattered deeply to voters.Trump’s campaign focused on immigration and crime. He pledged to deport criminals and proposed economic reforms like eliminating taxes on overtime pay and tips, which appealed to working-class voters.His message connected with voters in Hispanic areas of South Texas and South Florida, where he gained strong support. Exit polls showed Trump won most Hispanic male voters and grew his support among black men in key swing states.Immigration, alongside inflation and crime, ranked among voters’ top concerns, helping Trump reclaim the presidency.","Democrats privately admit their failure to address concerns about illegal immigration hurt vice president Kamala Harris’ campaign. “We utterly mismanaged that issue, including our Democratic caucus here.

A Polish bride’s dream honeymoon in Miami ended in heartbreak when she was found dead in the street just 23 days after her wedding.Aleksandra Leczycka , 26, and her husband, Dawid Leczycki, had travelled from their hometown of Siedlce, Poland, to celebrate their marriage in Florida. But their dream trip took a devastating turn.On August 29, 2022, the newlyweds were discovered unconscious on a street in Miami. Aleksandra tragically did not survive, while Dawid regained consciousness. Both were found without cash or jewellery, leading local authorities to initially suspect they had been drugged and robbed .However, a two-year re-investigation by Polish prosecutors revealed a different picture.According to the Siedlce District Prosecutor’s Office , Aleksandra’s death was likely caused by the voluntary consumption of psychoactive substances , which may have led to either an overdose or a severe allergic reaction.Prosecutor Krystyna Golabek explained, “Extensive investigative measures were carried out, including a request for legal assistance from the American side, which provided materials from their investigation. Expert opinions in the fields of computer science and toxicology were also obtained.”While the investigators did not entirely rule out the possibility that the couple had been involuntarily drugged, Golabek emphasized that none of the evidence supported the initial hypothesis of forced intoxication.In the hours before her death, Aleksandra shared joyful photos online, sipping cocktails and enjoying the Miami beaches with her husband. These images, posted just before the tragedy, now serve as poignant reminders of the couple’s brief time together after their August 6, 2022, wedding.The re-investigation, which concluded on October 23, 2024, brought clarity to the mysterious circumstances surrounding Aleksandra’s death but left lingering questions about how the psychoactive substances came into their possession.Aleksandra’s husband, Dawid, has remained silent on the events leading to her untimely passing.","Aleksandra Leczycka, 26, was found dead in Miami on August 29, 2022.

Is Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez planning for 2028 US presidential bid?

Speculation about Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) running for president in 2028 gained momentum after The Hill published a report naming her among potential Democratic candidates.The article highlighted her strong appeal to grassroots voters and her ability to connect with people in a way that sets her apart from many in Washington. A Democratic strategist quoted in the piece praised her authenticity, describing her as someone who “cuts through the noise and doesn’t talk like Washington.”However, another strategist expressed skepticism, arguing that her progressive approach and push for rapid change might alienate traditional Democrats. “She and the 'Squad' started pushing too hard, too fast. DC doesn’t work that way,” the strategist noted.The speculation ignited a storm of reactions online, particularly from conservatives. Former Congressman Matt Gaetz claimed that AOC has been eyeing a presidential bid since 2019.One critic on X remarked, “I didn’t think there could be a more stupid person than Kamala as the Democrat nominee... until now.”Another user joked, “Somewhere in America, JD Vance is enjoying breakfast and laughing at the thought of AOC running for president in 2028.”Republican Representative Tim Burchett weighed in, warning against dismissing her potential as a serious contender. “Quit underestimating our opponents. That’s how we got Carter, Clinton, Obama, and Biden,” he wrote.Despite the criticism, some social media users acknowledged her potential impact. A commentator noted that while AOC’s policies are divisive, her authenticity resonates with voters, making her a formidable candidate who could challenge expectations even if her chances of winning remain uncertain.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, commonly known as AOC, represents New York’s 14th Congressional District. She first gained prominence in 2018 by unseating a veteran incumbent in a primary upset, becoming one of the youngest women elected to Congress at age 29. Known for her progressive stances, AOC has championed initiatives like the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, and economic reforms aimed at reducing inequality.Her rapid rise to political fame has positioned her as a leading figure within the Democratic Party’s progressive wing and a polarizing figure across the political spectrum.While AOC has not publicly confirmed any plans for a 2028 run, the discussions sparked by this report reflect growing curiosity about her future in US politics.","Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, commonly known as AOC, represents New York’s 14th Congressional District.

Pakistani authorities are seeking to arrest Bushra Bibi, the wife of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan , for failing to appear in court in an alleged corruption case involving 190 million pounds.Authorities attempted to arrest Bibi at her residence in Peshawar on November 23, but the attempt was unsuccessful as she was not present when the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) team and police arrived, according to a PTI report.An accountability court issued non-bailable warrants for Bibi on November 22 after she missed eight court hearings. The warrants led the NAB to dispatch a team to arrest her. Bibi currently resides in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where Khan's political party, PTI, holds power.Both Khan and Bibi face accusations of misusing 50 billion Pakistani Rupees (190 million pounds). These funds, originally returned to Pakistan by the UK's national crime agency in a settlement with a property tycoon, were allegedly meant for the national treasury. Instead, authorities claim they were used for the personal benefit of the businessman who helped Bibi and Khan establish a university.Bibi, a trustee of the Al-Qadir Trust , is accused of benefiting from the settlement and acquiring 458 kanals of land for Al-Qadir University in Jhelum. Last month, she was granted bail after nine months in custody related to a separate case known as the Toshakhana case .","Pakistani authorities are seeking to arrest Bushra Bibi, the wife of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan.

As India criticized Bangladesh over the arrest of Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das , Dhaka reaffirmed its commitment to communal harmony and pledged to protect all citizens, regardless of their religious background.Bangladesh's ministry of foreign in a statement said that Das was arrested on “specific charges” and dismissed allegations of religious discrimination.It criticised statements and reactions surrounding the arrest of Das, calling them “misconstrued” and harmful to the spirit of friendship between Dhaka and New Delhi.“It is with utter dismay and deep sense of hurt that the Government of Bangladesh notes that the arrest of Sri Chinmoy Krishna Das has been misconstrued by certain quarters since Sri Chinmoy Krishna Das has been arrested on specific charges,” the ministry said.""The Government of Bangladesh maintains that such unfounded statements not only misrepresent facts but also stand contrary to the spirit of friendship and understanding between the two neighboring countries,"" the statement added.The priest’s detention has sparked significant backlash, with thousands of his followers staging protests in Chattogram.

Donald Trump: Watch: Embarrassed Barron Trump reacts to Trump and Musk groove to YMCA at Thanksgiving in Mar-a-Lago,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-embarrassed-barron-trump-reacts-to-trump-and-musk-groove-to-ymca-at-thanksgiving-in-mar-a-lago/articleshow/115810858.cms,"YMCA: The Soundtrack of Trump’s Campaigns



Barron Trump: The Quiet Campaign Strategist



Elon Musk: From Tech Visionary to Trump Confidant



A Thanksgiving Moment That Stole the Spotlight



The Thanksgiving gathering at Mar-a-Lago this year had all the elements of a viral spectacle: Donald Trump and Elon Musk dancing—if awkwardly—to YMCA , a soundtrack synonymous with Trump’s campaign rallies, while Barron Trump , the president-elect’s 18-year-old son, watched on, visibly embarrassed. Yet amidst the table-smacking, shoulder-tapping antics of Trump and Musk, Barron has quietly become an unsung hero of Trump’s campaign success, earning praise for his strategic contributions behind the scenes.As YMCA played, Trump belted out his signature “bam, bam, bam” while urging Musk, who was initially content with subtle head nods, to throw his arms into the air in time with the beat. Musk reluctantly obliged, eliciting a beaming grin from Trump. Meanwhile, Barron, seated between his mother, Melania, and Musk, offered a hesitant smile, his discomfort palpable. His body language spoke volumes, capturing the universal plight of teenagers mortified by their parents’ public antics.The Village People’s YMCA has become an unlikely yet enduring anthem of Trump’s political rallies, a high-energy song that brings nostalgic levity to his events. Though its disco roots and LGBTQ+ associations might seem at odds with Trump’s base, the song’s universal appeal and infectious beat have made it a campaign staple. For Trump, YMCA represents more than just a crowd-pleaser—it’s a unifying moment that embodies his ability to turn political events into dynamic, entertainment-filled experiences.At the Thanksgiving table, however, the song’s significance took a backseat to the camaraderie between Trump and Musk, who has become a fixture at Mar-a-Lago since Trump’s election win. Yet, while the president-elect relished the moment, his youngest son seemed less enthused, his reaction quickly going viral on social media. One user joked, “Barron’s thinking, ‘Okay, have we had enough of this song yet, Father?’” Another added, “The poor kid is stuck between his dad and Elon Musk—let him leave the table!”While Barron’s Thanksgiving discomfort may have stolen the internet’s attention, insiders know that the youngest Trump has been instrumental in crafting key elements of his father’s campaign. Barron has earned praise for spearheading the strategy behind Trump’s podcast outreach—a medium that played a pivotal role in swaying undecided male voters.Recognizing the growing influence of long-form audio content among young and middle-aged men, Barron reportedly helped design a podcasting strategy that positioned Trump as relatable and engaging to this critical demographic. With a focus on Trump’s storytelling and direct, unscripted style, the podcast series resonated with voters who appreciated an unfiltered perspective amidst a crowded media landscape. This effort helped Trump close the gap with undecided voters in battleground states, underscoring Barron’s keen understanding of emerging communication platforms.Elon Musk’s presence at Mar-a-Lago has evolved from occasional visits to near-constant companionship, earning him the moniker “First Buddy” in political circles. As Trump’s confidant and incoming head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has seamlessly integrated into Trump’s world, joining phone calls with foreign leaders and even appearing at campaign events. His willingness to join in Trump’s YMCA antics—albeit reluctantly—underscored Musk’s growing comfort in this unconventional political environment.The Thanksgiving gathering at Mar-a-Lago was quintessential Trump: a blend of family warmth, political theater , and viral-ready moments. While Trump and Musk reveled in their impromptu dance, Barron’s expression of embarrassment and restraint became the internet’s focal point, cementing his reputation as the most relatable member of the Trump family.Yet beneath the surface of teenage awkwardness lies a budding political strategist. Barron’s contributions to his father’s campaign highlight his growing influence within the Trump orbit, proving that even as he avoids the spotlight, he is far from a passive observer.","The Thanksgiving gathering at Mar-a-Lago was quintessential Trump: a blend of family warmth, political theater, and viral-ready moments.

Meghan will now fully focus on her career but her jam brand American Riviera Orchard could not procure a trademark because of some issues with the filing. Meghan was given three months to address the errors in the application in August.

The boat sank in the River Niger while traveling from Kogi State to Niger State.Most of those missing are women, officials reported.The passengers were en route to a food market when the boat capsized early Friday morning, said Ibrahim Audu, spokesman for Niger state emergency management agency .Eight fatalities have been confirmed at the scene, according to eyewitness accounts reported by Channels Television. Local divers are working to rescue any survivors, local media added.The cause of the sinking remains unclear, though reports suggest the boat, carrying over 200 passengers, may have been overloaded. Overcrowding is a common issue in Nigeria's remote regions, where poor road infrastructure limits travel options.Kogi officials are still determining the exact location of the incident and seeking assistance from other agencies, said Justin Uwazuruonye, head of Nigeria’s national emergency management agency operations in the state.","At least 100 people are missing, and eight have died after a boat capsized in northern Nigeria.

Trump promised federal recognition for the Lumbee Tribe. Will he follow through?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-promised-federal-recognition-for-the-lumbee-tribe-will-he-follow-through/articleshow/115827343.cms,"AP file photo

OKLAHOMA CITY: When Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigned in North Carolina, both candidates courted a state-recognized tribe there whose 55,000 members could have helped tip the swing state.Trump in September promised that he would sign legislation to grant federal recognition to the Lumbee Tribe, a distinction that would unlock access to federal funds. He ultimately won North Carolina by more than 3 percentage points, in part due to continued support from Lumbee voters.Now, as Trump prepares to return to the White House in January, the promise will be put to the test. He has Republican allies in Congress on the issue, and now the Lumbee, as well as tribal nations across the country, are watching closely to see what comes next.Tribal nations typically receive federal recognition through an application with the Department of the Interior, but the Lumbee have been trying for many years to circumvent that process by going through Congress. Chairman John Lowery called Interior's application process ""flawed"" and overly lengthy and said it should be up to Congress to right what he calls a historic wrong.""It's just crazy that we're sitting here fighting this battle, and I have to tell you that I am real in 2024,"" Lowery said.Following the presidential election, the Lumbee hope there will be momentum behind their cause, but they face deep-rooted opposition from tribal nations across the country.There are questions about Trump's next move Several tribes, including the only one that is federally recognized in North Carolina, argue that if the Lumbee Tribe wants federal acknowledgment, it should go through the formal process in the Department of the Interior. One person familiar with Trump's thinking said the president-elect will require the Lumbee Tribe to do just that, and he won't sign a Lumbee recognition bill. The person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly speak about Trump's views.Trump's spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, said ""no policy should be deemed official unless it comes directly from President Trump.""Federal recognition is of enormous importance, as it comes with access to resources like health care through Indian Health Services and the ability to create a land base such as reservations through the land-to-trust process. But before that happens, a tribal nation has to file a successful application with the Office of Federal Acknowledgement, a department within the Interior.The Lumbee Tribe was denied the ability to apply for federal recognition in 1987, based on the interpretation of a 1956 congressional act that acknowledged the Lumbee but stopped short of granting them federal recognition.In 2016, the Interior reversed that decision, allowing the Lumbee Tribe to apply, but the Lumbee have opted for the congressional route.The Lumbee's approach to gain recognition through legislation has stoked a simmering debate in both Indian Country and Congress about Indigenous identity and tribal nationhood.The Lumbee have received support from members of both parties Members of Congress from both parties have supported recognizing the Lumbee through legislation, including Oklahoma Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a member of the Cherokee Nation who campaigned for Trump in North Carolina and backed the legislation.But perhaps the state-recognized tribe's most ardent ally in Congress is North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis , who is up for reelection in 2026.Tillis introduced the Lumbee Fairness Act last year and has been a vocal supporter of the Lumbee. In interviews with The Associated Press, several tribal leaders, lobbyists, and advocates said they were told by Tillis directly or by his staff that the senator is currently and will continue to block certain bills backed by tribal nations unless the leaders of those tribes support the Lumbee.One of the bills he's promised to block, according to those interviewed by the AP, is a land transfer that would allow the Tennessee Valley Authority to return 70 acres of land to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, the only federally recognized tribal nation in Tillis's state. It would allow the tribe to put the land in Monroe County, Tennessee into trust. The plot is part of the tribal nation's homelands and contains the birthplace of Sequoyah.""It's appalling to me. It's disgraceful,"" Principal Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Michell Hicks said. He said that Tillis told him earlier this year that he would stop any legislation dealing with the Eastern Band unless Hicks pledged his support.Hicks is among the tribal leaders who question the validity of the Lumbee's historical claims, and he said that is out of the question. At one point about a century ago, the Lumbee were known as the Cherokee Indians of Robeson County, and for many years now all three Cherokee tribes - the Eastern Band, the Cherokee Nation, and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians - have denounced this and been vocal opponents of granting the Lumbee federal recognition.Representatives for Tillis declined to comment.Tillis held up legislation last week that would have allowed for the preservation of the site of the Wounded Knee massacre. While doing so, he singled out the heads of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, who have backed the preservation measure, for not supporting his efforts to federally recognize the Lumbee.""This is not about you,"" Tillis said to the two tribal nations, who he acknowledged had been trying for a century to preserve the site of the massacre. ""But you need to know that your leadership is playing a game that will ultimately force me to take a position.""Tillis suggested it was a ""casino cartel"" in part driven by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and an Osage attorney named Wilson Pipestem working for the tribe, that is trying to keep the Lumbee from gaining recognition, which could one day lead to the Lumbee opening their own casinos. Tillis threatened to continue publicly naming tribal leaders and their employees who he felt were standing in the way of his bill.In a statement to the AP, Pipestem said Tillis should ""apologize to the Tribal leaders for his false allegations and unscrupulous tactics.""Lowery acknowledged that Tillis has held up both pieces of legislation, but he said that Tillis has not done so at the direction of the Lumbee.""If he's put a hold on the bill it's because he reached out to tribal leaders to see where they stand on his bill, and they apparently have told him that they're not in support,"" Lowery said. ""So, he said 'well, if you can't be supportive of my bill, I can't be supportive of your bill.'""","Tribal nations typically receive federal recognition through an application with the Department of the Interior.

Crypto boss who bought a $6 million banana offers to buy 100k more,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/crypto-boss-who-bought-a-6-million-banana-offers-to-buy-100k-more/articleshow/115827114.cms,"NEW YORK: A week after a Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur bought an artwork composed of a fresh banana stuck to a wall with duct tape for $6.2 million at auction, the man, Justin Sun , announced a grand gesture on X. He said he planned on purchasing 100,000 bananas - or $25,000 worth of the produce - from the Manhattan stand where the original fruit was sold for 25 cents.But at the fruit stand, outside the doors of the Sotheby's where the conceptual artwork was sold, the offer landed with a thud against the realities of the life of a New York City street vendor. It would cost thousands of dollars to procure that many bananas from a Bronx wholesale market, said Shah Alam, the 74-year-old employee from Bangladesh who sold the original banana used in ""Comedian"", an absurdist commentary on the art world by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan . And, it wouldn't be easy to move that many bananas, which come in boxes of about 100.And then there is the math: The net profit from the purchase of 100,000 bananas by Sun - who once bought a nonfungible token of a pet rock for more than $600,000 - would be about $6,000. ""There's not any profit in selling bananas,"" Alam said. Plus, as an employee who makes $12 an hour during 12-hour shifts, Alam pointed out that any money would by rights belong to the fruit stand's owner, not him. The stand's owner, Mohammad Islam, 53, said he would split any profit between himself, Alam and the six other people he employs at his two fruit stands.Working in the rain on Thanksgiving Day, Islam's brother, Mohammad Alam Badsha (not related to Alam) said he would welcome the bulk purchase. But it would have little tangible impact to fruit vendors, Badsha said. ""It's definitely an inequality,"" he said in Bengali. He added a Bangladeshi idiom: It was the difference between heaven and hell.","Justin Sun, a Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur, bought an artwork composed of a fresh banana stuck to a wall with duct tape for $6.2 million at auction.

Joe Rogan hints at Mar-a-Lago podcast episode with Trump

Podcast host Joe Rogan has expressed openness to recording an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience from Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, The New York Post reported.During his 13th sit-down with comedians Ari Shaffir, Mark Normand, and Shane Gillis on Thursday, Rogan discussed the possibility, saying, “Yeah, we have to. We helped Trump get elected.” The conversation came after Shaffir suggested recording an episode at Mar-a-Lago on January 14, coinciding with the release of his Netflix special, America’s Sweetheart. Rogan also revealed he had spoken with Donald Trump Jr., who said he could “make that happen.”Rogan's podcast previously hosted Trump in a nearly three-hour episode during the final stretch of the 2024 campaign. The episode drew massive traffic, amassing over 20 million views within the first 20 hours of its release.In that episode, Trump discussed his policies, his first term, and expectations for his second term. On Election Day eve, Rogan endorsed Trump and praised Elon Musk for transforming Twitter into X and backing the former president. “If it wasn’t for Musk, we’d be f**ked,” Rogan said, calling Musk’s support for Trump “the most compelling case.”While Rogan welcomed Trump and running mate JD Vance to Austin for recordings, he refused to travel to interview Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign. Harris had sought an hour-long podcast session while campaigning in Texas, but Rogan insisted on hosting her in his Austin studio for a longer interview.Critics were divided over Rogan’s refusal to accommodate Harris, with some calling it a missed opportunity and others praising his consistency.Harris campaign adviser Stefanie Cutter later stated that scheduling conflicts prevented the appearance, while internal disagreements within Harris’s campaign over the podcast’s controversial reputation also played a role.Rogan’s podcast, known for its marathon episodes and uncensored format, has faced criticism in the past for hosting controversial figures and allegedly spreading misinformation. Despite this, Rogan remains a dominant media figure, with his Spotify deal reportedly valued at $200 million.","Rogan's podcast previously hosted Trump in a nearly three-hour episode during the final stretch of the 2024 campaign.

SunFed , a US-based produce company, has announced the recall of bulk shipments of whole fresh cucumbers after they were potentially contaminated with salmonella.The recall affects cucumbers distributed across 26 US states and five Canadian provinces.The affected cucumbers were sold between October 12 and November 26, 2024, and were packaged in bulk cardboard containers, generic white boxes, or black plastic crates.According to CBS News, these containers are labelled with the “SunFed” brand or a sticker indicating the grower’s name, “Agrotato, SVA de C”.The recall was initiated after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notified SunFed about the possible contamination. Although the exact number of illnesses linked to the cucumbers has not been confirmed, it was reported that people had become sick after consuming the product between October 12 and November 15.The company, in its statement, urged consumers to check any cucumbers they may have purchased to ensure they are not part of the recall. Recalled products should not be consumed, sold, or distributed, and should be destroyed or returned to the place of purchase, the statement added.Salmonella, a bacteria that causes foodborne illness , can lead to severe symptoms such as fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea.In some cases, it can result in more serious conditions, such as bloodstream infections or even death, particularly in vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, and individuals with weakened immune systems.Symptoms typically appear between six hours and six days after consuming contaminated food, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.","SunFed, a US-based produce company, has announced the recall of whole fresh cucumbers after they were potentially contaminated with salmonella.

A series of AI-generated videos depicting US Vice President Kamala Harris in unflattering scenarios has sparked widespread attention online.In one viral clip, Harris is shown tearfully smoking and drinking, while a news announcement in the background declares Donald Trump as the 47th President of the United States.Another AI-manipulated video portrays Harris sitting while drinking alcohol and acting weird.These clips have gained significant traction online, with some claiming these fabricated visuals reflect her state after a recent election loss.The buzz around these doctored videos came after Harris’s recent public appearance, where she addressed supporters in a sombre tone after conceding the election.In her speech, she acknowledged the challenging period, saying, “I know this is an uncertain time. I'm clear-eyed about that. I know you're clear-eyed about it, and it feels heavy.” She urged her supporters to stay resilient, adding, “Don’t you ever let anybody take your power from you. You have the same power, purpose, and ability to engage and inspire.”However, her speech was met with ridicule from Republicans, who criticised her dishevelled appearance and questioned how the video was approved for release. Many netizens believed that she was speaking under the influence.Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC) mocked Harris, writing on X, “The dial-up modem sound played on an infinite loop is more bearable than 28 seconds of whatever this is.”Similarly, GOP staffer Ben Williamson remarked, “I’d read a 5,000-word article on how this got approved for release.”"," AI-generated videos depict US Vice President Kamala Harris in unflattering scenarios.

Podcasters take centre stage

New era of political messaging

Harris and the missed opportunity

Role of Rogan and others

Donald Trump’s podcast venture, a key element of his outreach during the 2024 campaign, has drawn significant attention for its effectiveness in connecting with undecided male voters.What many didn’t expect, however, was the pivotal role played by Barron Trump in shaping this strategy.The youngest Trump scion has earned widespread praise for spearheading an approach that capitalised on the rising popularity of long-form audio content among young and middle-aged men. Barron’s vision emphasised a relatable, unscripted format that showcased Trump’s storytelling skills and direct communication style, cutting through a saturated media environment.Due to Barron's podcast strategy, Trump harnessed the power of alternative media to reach untapped audiences.As a result, the historic campaign helped Trump secure his return to the White House.The strategy proved to be a game-changer, appealing to young men and independent voters, key demographics in his 2024 victory. This shift from traditional media channels to digital platforms showcased the evolving landscape of political communication.On election night, UFC CEO Dana White gave a surprising nod to Trump’s podcast allies, thanking names like the Nelk Boys, Adin Ross, Theo Von, Bussin’ With The Boys, and Joe Rogan . White described these influencers as instrumental in connecting Trump with younger voters.Notably, Trump’s interviews on these platforms were a stark departure from traditional political interviews. Instead of adversarial questioning, these podcasts allowed for informal, often personal conversations, aligning with Trump’s unfiltered, conversational style.As per The Conversation, Trump’s appearances on over 14 major podcasts, including ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" and ""Full Send,"" amassed millions of views across platforms. By forgoing mainstream networks, Trump not only avoided hostile press but also cemented his influence among the predominantly male audience of these shows.One standout initiative, Send the Vote, spearheaded by the Nelk Boys, showcased the political potential of influencer-led campaigns . With a $20 million budget, this nonpartisan effort targeted inactive male voters aged 18-34, reaching millions through social media, podcasts, and even campus events.According to Fox News Digital, over 210,000 first-time voters were reportedly inspired to cast their ballots.Trump’s podcast strategy also aligned with the broader shift in media consumption habits.According to The Conversation, the format’s friendly tone and extended run times allowed candidates to delve into personal stories, resonating deeply with listeners. In one notable interview, Trump joined Theo Von in a candid discussion on personal struggles, reflecting a level of empathy rarely seen in traditional interviews.In contrast, Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, took a more cautious approach. While she appeared on prominent podcasts such as Call Her Daddy and Club Shay Shay, her team avoided platforms like Joe Rogan’s, fearing potential backlash. This reluctance arguably left an opening for Trump to dominate the podcasting sphere.Harris’s strategy lacked the same direct connection to politically diverse audiences, a gap that Trump capitalised on effectively.Joe Rogan’s endorsement of Trump ahead of the election was a pivotal moment. Hosting the former president for a three-hour interview, Rogan’s platform amplified Trump’s message to his 14.5 million Spotify followers. The endorsement not only boosted Trump’s standing but also showcased the growing influence of podcasts in shaping public opinion.Harris’s decision to decline an appearance on Rogan’s show, coupled with her limited engagement with other influential podcasts, left her campaign vulnerable.Engaging with diverse media platforms could have added depth to her outreach, potentially narrowing the gap with younger male voters.Trump’s 2024 campaign marked a turning point in political communication, with podcasts emerging as a dominant medium. While critics caution against the lack of scrutiny in such interviews, their reach and impact are undeniable.","Donald Trump’s podcast venture was a key element of his outreach during the 2024 campaign.

Why liberals are angry about pro-Trump Scott Jennings joining LA Times editorial board,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/liberal-pro-trump-harris-scott-jennings/articleshow/115813547.cms,"The Los Angeles Times’ decision to appoint Scott Jennings—a vocal conservative commentator and former adviser to President George W. Bush—to its editorial board has ignited a firestorm of controversy. The backlash, especially from liberal voices within the media and the Times newsroom, has been swift and intense, highlighting the deeply polarized reaction to including a prominent pro-Trump voice in the ranks of a traditionally left-leaning institution.For years, Jennings has been a lightning rod for debate, known for his blunt and often humorous critiques of the Democratic Party. His viral CNN appearances during the 2024 election cycle, where he frequently skewered President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and other Democratic figures, solidified his reputation as a fearless conservative voice. From likening Biden to Colonel Sanders with the quip, “His face is on the bucket, but he’s not making the chicken anymore,” to labeling Harris’s campaign as “the most manufactured presidential campaign ever,” Jennings has never been one to shy away from controversy.His appointment to the Times editorial board has been framed by the paper's owner, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, as an effort to include diverse perspectives and “thoughtful voices” in shaping the paper’s opinion pages. However, for many in the newsroom and beyond, this move is seen as a betrayal of journalistic integrity. Critics argue that Jennings’ unapologetic pro-Trump stance and his critiques of the Democratic establishment amount to platforming partisanship under the guise of editorial balance.The backlash within the Times itself has reportedly been severe, with staff members expressing outrage at what they view as a sharp pivot away from the paper’s traditional values. Internal sources suggest that many journalists are “pissed off” by the appointment, feeling it undermines the institution’s credibility and its commitment to holding powerful figures accountable.Oliver Darcy, a media critic and founder of the newsletter Status, called the decision emblematic of a broader dilemma in legacy media: how to include voices that appeal to Trump supporters without compromising journalistic standards. Darcy criticized Soon-Shiong’s defense of Jennings, arguing that the media mogul seemed dismissive of concerns about factual integrity and the potential for amplifying misleading narratives.Soon-Shiong, however, has defended the appointment, emphasizing the need for robust debate and a diversity of opinions. “The new editorial board will represent all voices,” he stated, calling Jennings a “critical thinker” whose opinions are rooted in facts.Despite the internal uproar, Jennings himself has remained unapologetic. In typical fashion, he shrugged off the controversy, tweeting: “Honored to join the LA Times. Diversity of thought makes us stronger. Looking forward to adding my perspective to the conversation!”For Jennings’ supporters, this move is a long-overdue step toward ideological balance in media. They argue that the outrage over his appointment reflects an unwillingness among some on the left to tolerate dissenting views. Others see it as an essential corrective for a paper perceived by some as entrenched in liberal orthodoxy.But for critics, the controversy isn’t merely about politics—it’s about the role of facts in shaping public discourse. Many fear that Jennings’ appointment is a sign of a growing trend to normalize misinformation under the guise of editorial balance.As the fallout continues, the broader debate over how media institutions handle ideological diversity in an era of extreme polarization remains unresolved. One thing, however, is clear: Scott Jennings’ voice on the Times editorial board ensures that the paper will be at the center of America’s cultural and political debates for the foreseeable future.","The Los Angeles Times appointed conservative commentator Scott Jennings to its editorial board.

Aurora activity peaks during the

solar cycle

Skywatchers across the northern United States might be in for a treat tonight as the northern lights , or aurora borealis , could dazzle the skies on Black Friday .The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) has issued a G2 (moderate) geomagnetic storm watch for Friday, signalling the potential for vibrant auroral displays across several states.The geomagnetic storm could bring radiant displays of green, red, and purple hues to states including Washington, Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Maine. Northern areas of New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Idaho may also catch glimpses of the celestial show.The best time for viewing is in the hours just before and after midnight, and NOAA advises heading to locations away from city lights for a clearer view.Cloud cover may obstruct the view in parts of the Northeast and Great Lakes regions, but clear skies elsewhere offer promising conditions for skywatchers. For those capturing the auroras, smartphone cameras may reveal colours that are not easily visible to the naked eye.The northern lights have been more frequent this year as the sun approaches the peak of its 11-year solar cycle, known as the solar maximum . This heightened solar activity is expected to continue through 2025, increasing the likelihood of more auroral displays across the United States.","The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has issued a G2 (moderate) geomagnetic storm watch for Friday.

Video: Security forces brutally push praying protester from container in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/video-security-forces-brutally-push-praying-protester-from-container-in-pakistan/articleshow/115811502.cms,"NEW DELHI: A protester was allegedly pushed off a towering stack of shipping containers by security forces during a demonstration calling for the release of former Prime Minister Imran Khan The dramatic moment, captured on video, quickly spread across social media, igniting outrage and raising concerns over the treatment of demonstrators in Pakistan.The footage shows the protester praying atop a container as armed officers approached. Moments later, the man was pushed from the container and was seen clinging to the container's edge before plummeting approximately 25 feet to the ground.According to a report by BBC, the incident reportedly occurred at the intersection of Jinnah and Ataturk Avenues, the epicenter of the protests. The condition of the man remains unknown.The protests were sparked by the arrest of Imran Khan , who has been in prison since August 2023 on corruption charges. Thousands of his supporters, many traveling from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, marched to Islamabad to demand his release. Among them was Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi, who led the demonstration alongside Ali Amin Gandapur, chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.However, the demonstrations quickly descended into chaos. The government reported that four paramilitary rangers and two policemen were killed in clashes late Monday, with over 100 security personnel injured.

ISLAMABAD: A well-known Pakistani journalist, Matiullah Jan, investigating civilian deaths in a recent assault launched by security forces against supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, has been booked in terrorism and narcotics cases in Islamabad on Thursday.Jan was picked up by unknown individuals along with another journalist, Saqib Bashir, late Wednesday night. His family said he was abducted from the parking of a hospital in Islamabad at around 11pm by “unmarked abductors in an unmarked vehicle”. Bashir, who was later released, said they were collecting data from the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) on the casualties after the march when they were taken.The incident took place amid rising tensions in the capital following Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party’s claims that more than 200 of its workers had been killed by security forces during a late Tuesday night operation to disperse Imran’s supporters in the capital. The protesters had gathered to demand the release from jail of Imran Khan and other politicians and workers of his party.On Thursday afternoon, Islamabad police booked Jan with charges related to terrorism, drug-peddling and attacking police. “It is no less than a joke.

(Reuters)

ISLAMABAD: At least eight supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) were killed and dozens of others injured in Islamabad following what the party said was a sweeping crackdown overnight by security forces to disperse protesters demanding the release of jailed former prime minister and PTI chief Imran Khan Following the crackdown, Imran’s party ended its agitation but Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur addressed a press conference in his province on Wednesday saying the protest would go on. “Until Imran Khan’s call, this sit-in will go on,” he said without elaborating where it would be held. PTI has been in govt in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Thousands of demonstrators, led by Imran’s wife Bushra Bibi, and Gandapur, had gathered in the capital on Tuesday vowing to stage a sit-in until their demands were met, including the release of political prisoners. Khan and many other PTI leaders and workers have been in jail for over a year on charges that they claim are politically motivated.Security forces launched a massive crackdown before midnight Tuesday after failing to stop protesters from marching to D-Chowk, a public square in Islamabad’s high-security red zone. In the evening authorities forced surrounding stores, cafes and markets to shut and then plunged the protest venue into darkness by switching off streetlights. Eyewitnesses said indiscriminate firing and teargas shelling, which started after 11pm and continued for about two hours, forced the PTI supporters, mostly Pashtuns from the northwest, to retreat.PTI claimed eight of its supporters had died in the late-night clashes and “hundreds” more were feared to have been killed. The govt stated three paramilitary troops and one policeman had died since the PTI launched its protest on Sunday. Islamabad’s police chief told media more than 900 people had been arrested in Tuesday’s raid, in which there were dozens of Afghan nationals.Sources at Islamabad’s two public hospitals said five civilians had died of gunshot wounds and dozens had been injured. According to PTI workers, they had picked up three bodies from the protest site.Information minister Attaullah Tarar said the protesters had fled in disarray, leaving behind vehicles, and even their shoes and clothes.PTI said in a post on social media that a “massacre has unfolded in Pakistan at the hands of security forces”. It accused the armed security forces of launching a violent assault on peaceful PTI protesters, firing live rounds with the intent to kill as many people as possible. It went on to compare last night’s clashes to the violence in the then East Pakistan in 1971. “The rulers have learned nothing from history and are prepared to destroy the country to cling to their illegitimate power,” the post stated. “With hundreds dead and countless injured, the interior minister’s threat to kill, and then the declaration of ‘victory’ over slaughtered innocents is enough evidence of the regime’s inhumanity,” it added.On Wednesday morning, the heavily fortified red zone was empty of protesters but dozens of smashed vehicles, including the charred remains of a truck from which Imran’s wife had been leading the protest, portrayed a grim picture.",At least eight supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) were killed and dozens of others injured in Islamabad.

Bushra Bibi , the wife of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan , is leading protests demanding his release from jail. At least five people have died in the resulting violence.Khan supporters, led by Bushra Bibi, marched in various locations, including D-Chowk in Islamabad. A planned rally on November 24 was prevented by an Islamabad High Court order citing the visit of Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko and a new public order law. Protests also occurred globally.Speaking to PTI workers, Bibi said, ""This is not just about my husband; it is about this country and its leader."" Addressing a rally, she added, ""Until Imran Khan is with us, we will not end this protest. I will remain here until my last breath, and I ask all of you to stand by us. This isn’t just about my husband. It’s about the future of our country and the leadership we deserve.""Khan was ousted in a no-trust motion in 2022 and has been imprisoned since.

She alleged attempts to poison her food while incarcerated. She and Khan were jailed and fined $2 million each in a corruption case related to state gifts. Khan and Bibi face approximately 200 legal cases following his removal from office.Bibi’s ex-husband, Khawar Maneka, is pursuing a case against her related to their divorce.

Prior to marrying Khan, Bibi was married to Maneka and was known as Bushra Maneka. She is a follower of Sufism and a devotee of the Sufi mystic poet Baba Farid.Khan stated in 2018 that he did not see Bibi’s face until after their marriage. “In a rare, and till then the only TV interview in October 2018, she dismissed this as bunkum,” regarrumors that she had foreseen Khan’s prime ministership in a dream.","Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, is leading protests demanding his release from jail.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan deployed its army within the nation's capital on Tuesday with orders to shoot protesters if necessary, as deadly clashes escalated between the police and supporters of former PM Imran Khan.The govt said four paramilitary rangers and two policemen were killed late Monday and over 100 security personnel injured in the violence, as thousands of protesters marched to Islamabad to demand Khan's release from prison. PM Shehbaz Sharif blamed the protesters for the soldiers' deaths, accusing them of ramming the paramilitary troops with a convoy of vehicles. ""It is not a peaceful protest. It is extremism,"" he said in a statement, aimed at achieving ""evil political designs"".Zulfikar Bukhari, spokesman for Khan's party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), denied Sharif's accusation and claimed that two protesters had been killed and 30 more injured in the clashes, the worst political violence seen in months in the nation of 241 million people. One of the protesters was shot dead and the other was run over by a vehicle, Bukhari said. Authorities did not reply to a query seeking to confirm the deaths.Meanwhile, Amnesty International said the govt must fully protect the rights of protesters and rescind ""shoot-on-sight"" orders that it said gave undue and excessive powers to military.Khan's supporters dismantled roadblocks that had been put in place to stop them while patriotic songs blared from vehicles. Some danced in front of the slow-moving convoy, some chanting, ""Revolution! Revolution!"" When they reached the square late afternoon, some chanted ""Prisoner Number 804"" - a reference to Khan - while others climbed atop shipping containers that had been set up to block their advance.PTI workers, many of them brandishing slingshots and sticks, engaged security personnel in combat as they attempted to make way to D-Chowk, a central square in front of parliament located close to key govt buildings such as the presidency, the PM office, and the supreme court. The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.Khan called for the demonstration over the weekend. Pakistan's military-backed civilian govt put the capital on lockdown, blocking major highways and suspending cellular and internet services in several areas. But protesters managed to enter the city Monday night.Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, was leading the protest with Ali Amin Gandapur, CM of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where PTI is in govt, accompanying her. Upon reaching Islamabad, Bibi vowed from atop a container truck: ""I promise that I will be the last woman here, I will not leave D-Chowk without him (Imran). You also promise me that you will not leave until Khan comes out. If anyone tells you otherwise, it is a lie.""In a post on X from jail, Khan, 72, said.

Imran Khan's supporters arrive near Pakistan parliament; govt calls in army,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-khans-supporters-arrive-near-pakistan-parliament-govt-calls-in-army/articleshow/115708656.cms,"A supporters of imprisoned former premier Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party

ISLAMABAD: Thousands of protesters demanding the release of former prime minister Imran Khan arrived at the heart of Pakistan’s heavily fortified capital, Islamabad, on Tuesday amid intense teargas shelling and use of rubber bullets by security forces, even as the govt invoked Article 245 of the constitution, which allows a civilian govt to call in the army to help it implement law and order.At least four security personnel and two civilians were killed in overnight clashes between security forces and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters. Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said three Rangers (paramilitary force) personnel and one police constable were killed by miscreants. The Imran-Khan-led PTI denied the allegations, saying security officials were crushed by police and Rangers’ vehicles speeding away from protesters.“Under Article 245, the Pakistan army has been called in, and orders have been issued to deal with the miscreants with an iron hand,” the state-run Radio Pakistan reported. “Clear orders have also been issued to shoot miscreants and troublemakers on sight,” it added.On Tuesday, PTI workers, many of them brandishing slingshots and sticks, engaged security personnel in combat as they attempted to make their way to D-Chowk (Democracy Chowk), a central square in front of parliament.Imran’s wife, Bushra Bibi, was leading the protest with Ali Amin Gandapur, CM of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where PTI is in govt, accompanying her. Upon reaching Islamabad, Bibi vowed from atop a container truck: “I promise that I will be the last woman here, I will not leave D-Chowk without him (Imran). You also promise me that you will not leave until Khan comes out. If anyone tells you otherwise, it is a lie.”Gandapur urged protesters to camp at D-Chowk and not advance further into the Red Zone, housing important places, including the diplomatic enclave.Convoys of protesters had started making their way to Islamabad on Sunday from different parts of the country. Khan’s wife was leading the main convoy from the party’s stronghold of Peshawar. Islamabad has been in security lockdown since Sunday, with authorities closing all schools in the capital and the adjacent garrison city of Rawalpindi. Mobile and internet services have also been partially suspended in the twin cities.All roads and highways from nearby cities to the federal capital, as well as all routes that connect Islamabad and Rawalpindi, have been shut since last weekend.The PTI has been protesting for the release of political prisoners, including Khan. Its second demand is the reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment passed by parliament in Oct. The legislation has radically altered the judiciary by setting a fixed term of three years for the Supreme Court’s chief justice, who will now be selected by a parliamentary committee. It has also weakened the powers of the apex court, with constitutional cases and those involving fundamental rights to be heard by constitutional benches that will be constituted by panels dominated by govt representatives. The PTI’s last demand is for the return of its allegedly stolen Feb 8 general election mandate.","At least four security personnel and two civilians were killed in overnight clashes between security forces and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters.

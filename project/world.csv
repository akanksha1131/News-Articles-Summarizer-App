Implications for the future of space colonisation

As the ambition for interplanetary colonization grows, fueled by the need to safeguard humanity from existential threats, one of the most intriguing questions has emerged: can humans reproduce in space? Despite significant advancements in space exploration, the biological complexities of reproduction in the unique environments of microgravity and heightened radiation have remained largely unexplored. Now, a groundbreaking experiment led by Japanese researchers is stepping into this uncharted territory, seeking to uncover how space conditions may affect mammalian reproduction and provide insights into the future of human life beyond Earth .Professor Teruhiko Wakayama, from the Advanced Biotechnology Centre at the University of Yamanashi, is spearheading a pivotal study to understand the effects of space on mammalian reproduction. The experiment involves freeze-dried mouse sperm stored on the International Space Station (ISS) in a specially designed radiation-protected box. This sperm will return to Earth in 2025 for extensive analysis.The study aims to determine whether this genetic material can produce healthy offspring after exposure to space conditions. If successful, the findings could pave the way for understanding how mammals, including humans, might reproduce in extraterrestrial environments. Wakayama’s broader vision is ambitious: creating a permanent genetic repository on extraterrestrial bodies such as the moon. This ""backup of life"" could enable the revival of species in the event of catastrophic disasters on Earth.The mouse sperm experiment builds on decades of reproductive studies in space. Past research has examined the effects of microgravity on various species, including:Professor Virginia Wotring of the International Space University observes that these studies have highlighted the challenges of reproduction in space , particularly in more complex organisms like mammals. Moving to mammalian studies is a critical and logical next step.Reproduction in space presents numerous obstacles. The lack of gravity may interfere with embryonic development, impacting processes like organ formation, nervous system growth, and limb differentiation. Additionally, the high levels of cosmic radiation encountered in space can damage DNA in both sperm and eggs, increasing the risk of genetic mutations and abnormalities.As Wotring explains, reproduction is just one of the many health-related challenges facing astronauts. Understanding how to protect human health in space is a top priority for ensuring the success of long-term space missions.Beyond the current mouse sperm experiment, Wakayama is developing innovative techniques to advance reproduction research in space. One such initiative involves creating a device for conducting in vitro fertilization (IVF) in microgravity, which could be operational aboard the ISS within two years. If these experiments prove successful, they would mark a significant milestone in ensuring the survival and reproduction of humans and other species in extraterrestrial environments.Wakayama reflects on the importance of this research:“In science fiction, people live on other planets and have babies, but we don’t yet know if that’s possible. If reproduction works in space, it will reassure humanity. If it doesn’t, we need solutions.”As space agencies like NASA and private companies such as SpaceX accelerate plans for human settlements on the moon and Mars, the ability to reproduce in space is a critical puzzle piece. Sustaining human populations and preserving Earth's biodiversity beyond our planet requires a clear understanding of the biological, technological, and ethical challenges involved.Experiments like Wakayama’s are vital for shaping humanity's future. With missions such as NASA's Artemis program and SpaceX’s Mars expeditions on the horizon, the ability to reproduce in space will determine whether humanity can truly thrive in the cosmos. These pioneering studies are not just about biology—they are about survival, legacy, and our collective ambition to explore and inhabit worlds beyond Earth.","Mouse sperm will be stored on the International Space Station (ISS) in a specially designed radiation-protected box.

'They charge a lot': Donald Trump threatens reciprocal tariffs against India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-charge-a-lot-donald-trump-threatens-reciprocal-tariffs-against-india/articleshow/116417313.cms,"US President-elect Donald Trump (File)

US president-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday reiterated his intentions to impose reciprocal taxes on India. Trump, who had once described India as ""tariff king"" accused New Delhi of charging ""high tariffs"" on American made products.""Reciprocal. If they tax us, we tax them the same amount. They tax us. We tax them. And they tax us. Almost in all cases, they're taxing us, and we haven't been taxing them,"" the president-elect said at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago.""The word reciprocal is important because if somebody charges us - India, we don't have to talk about our own - if India charges us 100 per cent, do we charge them nothing for the same? You know, they send in a bicycle and we send them a bicycle. They charge us 100 and 200. India charges a lot. Brazil charges a lot. If they want to charge us, that's fine, but we're going to charge them the same thing,"" he added.Earlier, the US president-elect had also warned Canada, of 25% tariffs on his first day of administration if they fail to stop flow of drugs and illegal immigrants into US.Donald Trump, who once described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as ""a friend of mine"" and visited India during his first term. At a rally before his re-election, Trump remarked, “India is a very big charger. We have a great relationship with India. But they probably charge as much.”""India is a very big charger. We have a great relationship with India. I did. And especially the leader, Modi. He's a great leader. Great man. Really is a great man. He's brought it together. He's done a great job. But they probably charge as much,"" Trump had said.During his first term, Trump imposed higher tariffs on Indian steel and aluminium, prompting retaliatory Indian duties on American products like almonds and apples. Experts believe that similar trade tensions could arise if Trump targets India again.Ajay Srivastava from the Global Trade Research Initiative had told TOI that sectors such as automobiles, textiles, and pharmaceuticals could face higher tariffs under Trump’s “reciprocal trade” policy.However, there may be a silver lining. As Trump focuses primarily on China, India could benefit by filling gaps in sectors like textiles and manufacturing, provided it scales production.India could benefit from significant export opportunities due to potential trade disruptions caused by US Trump’s proposed tariff policies, according to a Shriram Mutual Fund analysis. Trump's planned tariffs on major trading partners like China, Mexico, and Canada may redirect trade flows, creating opportunities for India.The report noted that Trump’s tariff plans, including 10% additional tariffs on China and 25% on Canada and Mexico, could disrupt existing trade patterns, potentially allowing Indian exporters to gain access to these markets.","US president-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday reiterated his intentions to impose reciprocal taxes on India.

Des Moines register's reaction to the lawsuit

Previous lawsuits

US President-elect Donald Trump has sued Des Moines Register , its parent company Gannett, and pollster J Ann Selzer over a pre-election poll. The poll, published shortly before the election, showed Trump trailing Vice President Kamala Harris in Iowa by three points. However, Trump won Iowa by a significant margin.The lawsuit , filed Monday in Polk County, Iowa, alleges ""brazen election interference"" and a violation of the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act , which prohibits deceptive practices in sales or advertising.Trump previewed the lawsuit during a Monday news conference in Florida, saying, ""I have to do it. We have to straighten out the press.""The Des Moines survey, carried out by the recently retired pollster J Ann Selzer, was seen as unexpected, as it revealed that Trump’s previous lead in the Republican-leaning state of Iowa had disappeared. In the actual election, Trump won Iowa by more than 13 percentage points.“There was a perfectly good reason nobody saw this coming: because a three-point lead for Harris in deep-red Iowa was not reality,” the lawsuit said. “It was election-interfering fiction.”Trump argued that the poll boosted enthusiasm among Democrats, forced Republicans to divert campaign time and resources to areas where they were already ahead, and misled the public into believing Democrats were performing better than they truly were.The Register, however, has defended its reporting. “We stand by our reporting on the matter and believe a lawsuit would be without merit,” Lark-Marie Anton, Des Moines Register spokeswoman, said.Anton said that the newspaper admitted the pre-election poll did not accurately reflect the results and has since published the full data and a technical explanation of the poll. Anton said they will ""vigorously defend"" their ""First Amendment rights.""Selzer has not yet commented on the lawsuit, but in an interview with PBS in Iowa last week, she said, ""It's not my ethic"" to design a poll to produce a particular outcome. She expressed confusion over what motivation people might believe she had.“To suggest without a single shred of evidence that I was in cahoots with somebody, I was being paid by somebody, it's all just kind of, it's hard to pay too much attention to it except that they are accusing me of a crime,” she said.This lawsuit follows a pattern of legal actions by Trump against media outlets. He recently settled a defamation case with ABC News for $15 million.A professor at the University of Iowa College of Law, Samantha Barbas, commented on Trump’s legal strategy, saying, as quoted by New York Times, ""It's clear that Trump is waging war on the press. Trump and his lawyers are going to use any legal claim that they think has a chance of sticking. They'll cast a wide net to carry out this vendetta."" Barbas also noted the lawsuits “are not so much geared toward winning as much as threatening.”Another lawsuit filed by Trump against CBS News in October also alleges deceptive trade practices related to an interview with Harris. Trump has frequently criticized the press and stated his desire for ""fair"" treatment.","US President-elect Donald Trump has sued Des Moines Register, its parent company Gannett, and pollster J Ann Selzer over a pre-election poll.

How Dominique Pelicot organised the mass rape of his wife,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/how-dominique-pelicot-organised-the-mass-rape-of-his-wife/articleshow/116415051.cms,"Courtroom sketch of Dominique Pelicot (Picture credit: Reuters)

Arranging the assault:



In a chilling case that sent shockwaves not just in France but also all around the world, a 72 year old man, Dominique Pelicot , was convicted for using an online dating platform to solicit and conduct the repeated rape of his wife, Gisele.Pelicot orchestrated all the plans, through which Gisele was raped by 70 men over 200 times.He admitted to recruiting men online to sexual abuse his wife, who was raped at their home during the decade-long period that the abuse occurred in the small village of Mazan. The app allowed him to access a large number of men from many walks of life, including firefighters, journalists, and nurses.Pelicot first drugged Gisele, leaving her unconscious, and invited the men-these were often groups of several men-into their home.According to her police reports quoted by new agency CNN, he actively communicated with these men through the Internet, first in chat rooms and subsequently by way of explicit forums like Coco.fr .Pelicot would first meet the men online in chatrooms and then shift the conversations to Skype, where he would show them his unconscious wife and share her explicit images and videos.Through these online exchanges, Pelicot created a network of men who were encouraged to take part in the ongoing abuse.Despite Gisele’s complete lack of awareness of her husband’s actions, the physical and emotional toll upon her was immense. She often sought medical help, complaining of memory loss and pelvic pain which indicated the prolonged abuse.It was only when Pelicot was arrested in 2020 for a separate offence, filming upskirts of women in a supermarket, that the full extent of his crimes came to light.The discovery of Pelicot’s disturbing online activities has opened a much larger conversation about digital spaces that enable and encourage sexual violence.While the website Coco.fr has been shut down, the case serves as a sober remainder of the disturbing reality that continues to thrive on similar platforms, fostering misogynistic and violent discourse.Gisele’s decision to waive her anonymity and testify publicly against the men who participated in her abuse has made this trial a landmark case in France. With the verdict expected on December 19, the trial has sparked widespread debate about the need for stronger regulations on digital platforms and more stringent laws around consent.Dominique Pelicot, along with several co-defendent, has pleaded guilty to the charges of rape, while others argue that they did not view the abuse as a crime, claiming that a husband’s consent was enough. Pelicot himself has expressed no remorse, stating that the responsibility for the crimes lies with all of the men involved.","Dominique Pelicot, 72, was convicted for using an online dating platform to solicit and conduct the repeated rape of his wife, Gisele.

Police said that ""multiple factors"" may have motivated the shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison , Wisconsin, which tragically left three dead and six injured. The suspect, 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow , reportedly took her own life after the incident.According to Madison police chief Shon Barnes, a ""combination of factors"" may have led to the shooting, and investigators are interviewing Rupnow's classmates ""to understand whether bullying was one of those multiple factors.""Following the tragedy, a document titled ""War Against Humanity"" has surfaced, allegedly authored by Rupnow. This manifesto, along with her social media posts and personal writings, offers insight into her motivations, mental state, and the warning signs that went unnoticed before the attack.“We are working to authenticate the document that you see online that some are referring to as a manifesto,” Barnes said, as quoted by USA Today, urging people not to share the document until its authenticity is confirmed. He also requested that anyone with knowledge of Rupnow's state of mind prior to the shooting contact the police.Authorities are investigating how Rupnow obtained the handgun used in the shooting and are working with the ATF to trace the weapon. Barnes noted they are also examining potential parental negligence.“We also want to look at if the parents may have been negligent. And that’s a question that we’ll have to answer with our district attorney’s office,” Barnes told CNN. “But at this time, that does not appear to be the case.”Madison mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway declined to provide additional details about the victims, stressing the need for respect and privacy. “It is absolutely none of y’all's business who was harmed in this incident,” she stated. “Just have some human decency, folks. Leave them alone. Let them grieve. Let them recover. Let them heal,” she said. “Don’t feed off their pain. We’ll share what we can when we can and not before that. Thank you.”The shooting at Abundant Life Christian School on Monday left three people dead, including the suspected shooter, and six others injured. Police identified the suspect as 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow , also known as Samantha, a student at the school. Rupnow reportedly opened fire inside a classroom at the K-12 institution, which serves approximately 400 students.According to Barnes, Rupnow died from a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound while being transported to a local hospital.Among the victims, two students remain in critical condition. Three other students and one teacher were injured, with two already discharged from the hospital.Community members have set up a makeshift memorial of candles and flowers outside the school. Two local school bus drivers, Megan Mojica and Kamila Reynolds, visited the memorial to pray. Reynolds expressed her shock at the violence. “(Madison) is a good town,” she said, as quoted by USA Today. “And for something to happen like this ... it’s surprising.”Mojica, whose son experienced a school shooting in 2019, shared words of support, saying, as quoted by USA Today, “Surround yourself with family and friends, because with time, you will be able to overcome.”","Shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, left three dead and six injured.

Next Steps



A tragic school shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, on Monday claimed the lives of a teacher and a student, leaving two other students critically injured and sparking renewed debates on school safety and gun violence . Police identified 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow , a student at the private Christian academy, as the shooter. Rupnow, who also went by the name Samantha, was found incapacitated when officers arrived just minutes after the 10:57 a.m. 911 call. She was later pronounced dead at a hospital from what authorities suspect was a self-inflicted gunshot wound, though the medical examiner has not confirmed the official cause of death.The violence also resulted in non-life-threatening injuries to three additional students and another teacher, adding to the devastating toll on the tight-knit school community of approximately 420 students. Authorities are actively investigating Rupnow’s background, searching her home, and reviewing her digital footprint for clues to a motive.Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers called the event “heartbreaking,” while President Joe Biden described the shooting as “shocking and unconscionable,” renewing calls for action against the country’s epidemic of school gun violence. With the school days away from its Christmas break, the tragedy has left a community shattered and grappling with unanswered questions.At a December 16 news conference, police identified 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow as the shooter responsible for the fatal attack at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin.Posts and comments from social media accounts linked to Rupnow and her father, Jeff Rupnow, provide a glimpse into her life leading up to the shooting.Jeff Rupnow’s Facebook account includes photos of Natalie as a baby, a smiling child, and participating in activities such as karate competitions, reflecting a seemingly normal upbringing.A notable post from August shows Natalie at a shooting range, wearing protective gear and handling a firearm. When a commenter asked, “Is that kiddo?”, Jeff responded enthusiastically:The NBSC likely refers to the North Bristol Sportsman’s Club, a shooting range in Wisconsin.Natalie Rupnow’s personal social media profiles have been deactivated or set to private. Before their removal, an image from her X (formerly Twitter) account depicted someone wearing combat boots and making the “OK” hand gesture — a symbol often debated for its varied interpretations.Reports of a manifesto allegedly written by Rupnow have been circulating online, but authorities have not confirmed its existence or authenticity. Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes addressed these claims directly:“A document about this shooting is circulating on social media, but we have not verified its authenticity.”Rupnow’s social media presence, including posts of firearm use and controversial imagery, raises questions about:Authorities are actively examining Rupnow’s digital footprint, family background, and social relationships as part of their investigation. With her accounts now offline, investigators will rely on archived activity, communications, and input from family and friends to uncover potential motivations. Further developments are expected in the coming days.","Police identified 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow as the shooter responsible for the fatal attack at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin.

Tech consultant Nima Momeni was convicted of second-degree murder for stabbing Bob Lee , the founder of Cash App, to death by a San Francisco jury on Tuesday. Momeni will a prison sentence of 16 years to life, District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said, quoted by The San Francisco Standard.According to the prosecutors, Momeni had planned the attack after a heated disagreement involving his younger sister. They alleged that Momeni was furious with Lee for introducing his sister to a drug dealer who reportedly gave her GHB, a drug often linked to sexual assault, and assaulted her. It was also claimed that Momeni drove Lee to a secluded area under the Bay Bridge in the early hours of the morning and stabbed him three times with a knife taken from his sister’s kitchen.CCTV footage presented in court showed Lee and Momeni leaving Lee’s hotel around 2 am and getting into Momeni’s BMW. The car was then seen heading to a dark and isolated spot. Prosecutors said Momeni left Lee behind, bleeding, as he drove away at high speed.Momeni’s legal team argued that the stabbing was an act of self-defence during a physical altercation. ABC news quoted Paula Canny, his lawyer, who claimed there was no premeditation, suggesting that Lee, who was intoxicated at the time, attacked Momeni in anger over a joke. Momeni testified that he teased Lee about preferring to spend his last night in town with his family rather than going to a strip club, which escalated the situation.The jury, however, sided with the prosecution, rejecting the self-defence claim. The case has raised broader discussions around personal safety and the sometimes turbulent world of Silicon Valley.Nima Momeni is the owner of a California-based company called Expand IT.Digital wallet Cash App founder Bob Lee, a 43-year-old and highly regarded tech executive, was attacked on 4 April 2023.

"Hush money case: 'No immunity for unofficial acts,' Judge rejects Donald Trump’s bid to dismiss conviction",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hush-money-case-no-immunity-for-unofficial-acts-judge-rejects-donald-trumps-bid-to-dismiss-conviction/articleshow/116383520.cms,"'This lawless case should be immediately dismissed,' Trump’s team reacts as immunity defense is denied

The hush money case

A New York judge ruled on Tuesday against a bid by US President-elect Donald Trump to have his hush money conviction thrown out, rejecting his argument that a recent Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity applied to the case.Judge Juan Merchan ruled that the immunity granted to presidents for official acts did not extend to the conduct involved in Trump’s conviction, which related to ""entirely unofficial conduct entitled to no immunity protections.""“Defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment and vacate the jury verdict... is denied,” Merchan stated, meaning that Trump’s conviction stands.Trump had sought to have the case moved to federal court, arguing that his position as president-elect warranted the dismissal of the conviction. His lawyers also presented arguments based on a July Supreme Court decision that grants presidents immunity from prosecution for actions taken during their presidency. They claimed that certain evidence presented at trial, including Trump’s financial disclosure form, social media posts, and testimony from White House aides, should have been excluded. However, Judge Merchan disagreed, ruling that even if some of the evidence related to official acts, it did not affect the case, which focused on falsifying business records .Trump’s conviction stems from a $130,000 payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016, which prosecutors say was intended to cover up an alleged affair with Trump during the presidential campaign. The payments were aimed at protecting Trump’s election chances, prosecutors argued. Trump, however, has denied the affair and any wrongdoing.The ruling brings Trump closer to becoming the first president to enter the White House with a felony conviction, pending an appeal. His legal team has vowed to continue challenging the verdict, including raising issues of potential juror misconduct.As Trump faces the prospect of returning to office next month, the case is likely to continue as a source of legal and political controversy. Trump's communications director, Steven Cheung, slammed the case, saying, “This lawless case should have never been brought, and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed.”Prosecutors have argued that Trump’s bid to dismiss the case went too far, with their office stating, ""Multiple accommodations well short of dismissal... would satisfy that objective, including a stay of proceedings during his term in office.""The case continues to unfold as Trump navigates his legal challenges, with the potential for further legal battles as he prepares to take office once again.","Donald Trump's bid to have his hush money conviction thrown out was denied on Tuesday.

Liberal MPs call emergency meeting

Freeland’s resignation rocks Trudeau’s cabinet

What is Prorogation?

Growing criticism and party divisions

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is reportedly considering stepping down amid growing speculation over his political future and a deepening crisis within the Liberal Party. According to trading platform Polymarket, there is now an 80% chance Trudeau will resign before April, as calls for his departure intensify among Canadian leaders and his own party.Besides, according to the sources by CTV News, Trudeau is weighing his options, including resignation or proroguing Parliament, with an announcement expected soon.Trudeau reportedly informed his cabinet and MPs about his intentions to address the situation, following the abrupt resignation of finance minister Chrystia Freeland, which has deepened the instability within his administration.Freeland accused the Prime Minister of engaging in ""costly political gimmicks"" for personal benefit rather than addressing Canada’s mounting economic challenges.On Monday night, Liberal MPs called an emergency caucus meeting, boarding up the room to keep proceedings behind closed doors. Trudeau was seen attending the meeting, according to CTV News. The Prime Minister has yet to publicly comment on Freeland’s resignation or the mounting pressure to step aside.The dramatic events follow weeks of criticism from opposition parties and within Trudeau’s own ranks. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre intensified his attacks, calling Trudeau’s leadership “out of control.” Poilievre’s remarks resonate as Trudeau lags 20 points behind the Conservatives in national polls.Dalhousie University professor Lori Turnbull described the situation as “a total disaster” for the Liberal Party. “It makes it much harder for Trudeau to continue as prime minister,” she added.Chrystia Freeland, Canada's deputy prime minister and finance minister, announced her resignation, citing irreconcilable differences with Trudeau on the country’s future. In her resignation letter, Freeland revealed that Trudeau had expressed intentions to replace her and offered another cabinet role, which she declined.“Upon reflection, I have concluded that the only honest and viable path is for me to resign,” Freeland stated. She pointed to weeks of disagreements and a lack of alignment with Trudeau on critical policy issues.Freeland's resignation comes amid Trudeau's declining popularity and growing dissent within the Liberal Party. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre seized the moment, declaring that “Canada is out of control” under Trudeau’s leadership.Prorogation, a procedural tool in parliamentary systems, terminates a session of Parliament at the recommendation of the Prime Minister. This measure essentially “resets” legislative proceedings, halting all pending bills and committee activities until a new session begins. While often used to refocus government priorities, it can also serve as a political strategy during periods of instability.Freeland’s resignation underscores the mounting challenges Trudeau faces, including internal divisions and external crises like a trade war with the United States. In her resignation, Freeland warned of looming fiscal challenges and criticized “costly political gimmicks” aimed at boosting the Liberals’ waning fortunes.Party leader Jagmeet Singh had earlier been less equivocal when asked about bringing down Trudeau, whom he insisted should resign.Lori Turnbull, a professor at Dalhousie University, described Freeland’s exit as “a total disaster” for Trudeau. “It shows a crisis of confidence in his leadership,” she said, adding that the cabinet’s unity is now in question.Despite calls for a reset, Trudeau’s office dismissed rumors of his resignation, stating they are “absolutely not accurate.” However, with Finance Minister Sean Fraser also resigning and growing opposition from both his party and rivals, Trudeau’s path forward remains uncertain.The political landscape remains volatile, with the next parliamentary election expected by October 2025. Freeland has announced her intention to run, while Trudeau has maintained his plan to lead the Liberals into the next election.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is reportedly considering stepping down amid growing speculation over his political future.

Wisconsin School Shooting: Why gender debate overshadowed tragedy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wisconsin-school-shooting-why-gender-debate-overshadowed-tragedy/articleshow/116405491.cms,"“She, He, or They”: Chief Barnes’ Comments Ignite Outrage



Social Media Divides Over Barnes’ Neutral Stance



Supporters Defend Chief Barnes’ Approach



The Real Tragedy: Gun Violence and Its Victims



A Broader Divide: Identity Politics vs. Action



Moving Forward: Tragedy Amid Polarization



A devastating shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, left two dead and six injured, shocking the nation. In the aftermath of the violence, an unexpected controversy erupted—not about the shooter’s actions, but over their gender identity.The shooter, identified as 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow , who was also known as Samantha, opened fire in a study hall before taking their own life. During a press conference shortly after the tragedy, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes addressed questions about the shooter’s gender, sparking widespread debate on social media.When asked directly whether Rupnow was transgender, Chief Barnes replied: ""I don’t know whether the shooter was transgender or not. I don’t think that whatever happened today has anything to do with how she or he or they may have wanted to identify. And I wish people would leave their personal biases out of this.""He added: ""Whether or not she was, he was, or they were transgender is something that may come out later. But right now, eight hours after a mass shooting in a Madison school, it is of no consequence.""While Barnes’ comments appeared aimed at steering attention away from identity and toward the tragedy itself, they instead triggered fierce criticism. Many accused him of evading the question and prioritizing political correctness.Social media quickly erupted with outrage. Critics argued that Barnes’ choice to use multiple pronouns muddled the conversation.“Even in the middle of a tragedy, they’re prioritizing political correctness over facts. This is what’s wrong with society today,” one user wrote. “Why dodge the question? Understanding the shooter’s identity could help explain their motives,” another added.“The woke brigade strikes again. It’s a mass shooting, and the police chief sounds like he’s leading a sensitivity workshop,” mocked one commenter. Some users speculated that the hesitation to clarify Rupnow’s gender identity reflected a broader agenda. “They always delay when the shooter might be transgender,” one commenter claimed, citing other shootings that faced similar scrutiny.Amid the backlash, others defended Barnes, arguing that his comments had been taken out of context or constrained by legal protocols for handling minors. “He’s just following the law. You can’t release details about minors unless they’re being charged as adults,” one user explained. “Barnes didn’t say all those pronouns to confuse anyone. He meant it doesn’t matter right now, and critics are twisting his words,” another countered. Defenders also argued that focusing on gender identity detracted from the more pressing issue: the lives lost and the need for meaningful action on gun violence .As debates about pronouns intensified, the tragic reality of the shooting risked being overshadowed. The attack claimed the lives of a teacher and a student, leaving six others injured. Chaos unfolded as students sheltered in place, with a second grader reportedly placing the 911 call that brought first responders to the scene.President Joe Biden addressed the nation following the tragedy, renewing calls for stricter gun laws: ""It is unacceptable that we are unable to protect our children from the scourge of gun violence. We cannot continue to accept this as normal.""The gender identity controversy has once again exposed the deep political and cultural divides in the United States. For some, the debate symbolizes an erosion of clarity and trust.“Why do they try so hard to confuse people? It immediately makes me question their transparency,” one frustrated user remarked.Others pushed back, arguing that identity discussions served as a distraction: “The outrage over pronouns is misplaced. Children and teachers were shot—why are we talking about anything else?”The Wisconsin shooting highlights how even moments of profound grief can become entangled in divisive debates. While families mourn, the focus has shifted from addressing the root causes of gun violence to cultural conflicts over identity and language. The challenge remains: how can communities and leaders focus on solutions to prevent mass violence while avoiding polarizing debates that distract from meaningful action? As the investigation continues, Chief Barnes’ response serves as a reminder of the ongoing tension between clarity, sensitivity, and public expectations in the face of tragedy.",Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes' response to questions about the shooter's gender sparked widespread debate on social media. Critics accused him of evading the question and prioritizing political correctness.

It means they can be used and repurposed without permission or payment to copyright holders.Popeye the Sailor, with his bulging forearms, mealy-mouthed speech, and propensity for fistfights, was created by E C Segar and made his first appearance in the newspaper strip ""Thimble Theater"" in 1929. The supposed one-off appearance became permanent, and the strip would be renamed ""Popeye"".But as with Mickey Mouse last year and Winnie the Pooh in 2022, only the earliest version is free for reuse. The spinach that gave the sailor his super-strength was not there from the start, and is the kind of character element that could spawn legal disputes. And the animated shorts featuring his distinctive mumbly voice didn't begin until 1933 and remain under copyright. As does 1980 film starring Robin Williams.That movie was tepidly received initially. So was director Steven Spielberg's ""Adventures of Tintin"" in 2011. But the comics about the boy reporter that inspired it, the creation of Belgian artist Herge, were among the most popular in Europe for much of the 20th century.The simply drawn teen with dots for eyes and bangs like an ocean wave first appeared in a supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingtieme Siecle, and became a weekly feature. The comic also first appeared in the US in 1929. Its signature bright colours - including Tintin's red hair - didn't appear until years later, and could, like Popeye's spinach, be the subject of legal disputes. And in much of the world, Tintin won't become public property until 70 years after the 1983 death of his creator.The books becoming public this year read like syllabus for an American literature seminar. William Faulkner's ""The Sound and the Fury"", Ernest Hemingway's ""A Farewell to Arms"" and John Steinbeck's first novel ""A Cup of Gold"" will also enter the public domain.","Popeye and Tintin are among the intellectual properties becoming public domain in the US on Jan 1.

A 73-year-old woman from Seattle, US, was deceived into sending at least $20,000 to a scammer pretending to be Ari Melber, an Emmy-winning MSNBC news anchor, the New York Post reported.The incident began earlier this year when the woman, Patricia Taylor, a former Boeing employee, started communicating on Facebook with someone posing as Melber.The scammer convinced Taylor that they were in a relationship. They asked her to send money and gift cards, claiming it was to treat a sick dog named Penny. The fraudster also sent Taylor an engagement ring to make her believe they were getting married.By November 1, Taylor had sent the scammer at least $20,000. On Monday, she attempted to fly to New York to meet the person she believed was Melber. Her daughter, Meri Taylor, intercepted her during a layover in Portland by tracking her phone. Meri feared that if her mother had reached New York, the scammer might have taken her hostage and demanded ransom.When Patricia Taylor began suspecting she was being scammed, the fraudster texted her saying, ""When did Ari Melber turn into a scammer?"" They also used an AI-generated voice message to imitate the MSNBC host, saying, ""You're reading my messages and not responding. I'd never (scam) you.

What’s next

Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been allowed to review heart tissue and fluid samples from George Floyd ’s autopsy. This decision, issued by US district judge Paul Magnuson, is part of Chauvin’s effort to appeal his federal civil rights conviction . His legal team argues that Floyd’s death was caused by a pre-existing heart condition rather than the actions of the former officer.Lawyers for Derek Chauvin, the disgraced Minneapolis police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd back in 2020, have won the rights and are allowed to review heart tissue and fluid samples from his autopsy.In 2020, Chauvin was found as the murderer of convicted George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man. According to a video, the former officer was seen pressing his knee to the detained African-American man's neck.This decision, issued by US district judge Paul Magnuson, is part of Chauvin’s effort to appeal his federal civil rights conviction. His legal team argues that Floyd’s death was caused by a pre-existing heart condition rather than the actions of the former officer.“Given the significant nature of the criminal case that Mr. Chauvin was convicted of, and given that the discovery that Mr Chauvin seeks could support Dr Schaetzel’s opinion of how Mr Floyd died, the Court finds that there is good cause to allow Mr Chauvin to take the discovery that he seeks,” Magnuson stated, quoted by news agency Gazettextra.Floyd, 46, died on 25 May 2020 after Chauvin, who is white, knelt on Floyd’s neck for over nine minutes during an arrest.The video of the incident showed Floyd repeatedly stating that he couldn’t breathe. His death led to global protests demanding an end to police brutality and racial injustice.The Hennepin County medical examiner ruled Floyd’s death a homicide, citing “cardiopulmonary arrest” due to “restraint and neck compression” compounded by pre-existing heart conditions, including severe atherosclerosis and hypertension.Despite this, Chauvin’s defence contends that Floyd’s death may have been due to a heart condition known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy, triggered by stress rather than Chauvin’s actions.Chauvin, sentenced to 22 and a half years in state prison for second-degree murder, also pleaded guilty to federal charges of violating Floyd’s civil rights, resulting in a 21-year federal prison sentence to be served concurrently.Now, his legal team is challenging his federal conviction alleging lack of counsel assistance.According to court filings it was alleged that Chauvin’s original defence attorney, Eric Nelson, failed to pursue evidence from Dr. William Schaetzel, a forensic pathologist, who believed that Chauvin’s actions did not directly result in Floyd’s death.Judge Magnuson ruled that Chauvin’s team could access histology slides, tissue samples, and photographs from Floyd’s autopsy to examine if there is evidence supporting the claim of an undiagnosed heart condition.Chauvin’s convictions were a significant step in holding police accountable for the deaths of unarmed individuals. Prosecutors argue that the claims of ineffective counsel are invalid, calling Schaetzel’s opinion unnecessary and repetitive.Ben Crump, the attorney for George Floyd’s family, said ""A judge ruled that Derek Chauvin's lawyers may test preserved samples of George Floyd's heart, challenging his federal conviction. Nothing changes what we all watched: His knee on George Floyd's neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds.""As Chauvin’s team proceeds with its examination of the autopsy materials, the legal process continues. Chauvin would still serve the remainder of his state sentence, even if his federal conviction is overturned, with his earliest possible release a decade later in 2037 according to US Bureau of Prisons, quoted by news agency Newsweek.","Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been allowed to review heart tissue and fluid samples from George Floyd ’s autopsy.

Attempts for lower electricity prices

World Bank goals

The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions within the time limit. The required conditions included revising the purchase power agreement in relation to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , according to The Express Tribune.The Washington-based international lender also declared that it would not be sanctioning any new budget supporting loans to the country during the current fiscal year which has sent a shock to the Pakistani economy as the country has almost exhausted its loan quota.""No budget support is planned for the current fiscal year, which ends in June 2025,"" the World Bank spokesperson stated.For this fiscal year, the IMF has identified a $2.5 billion external financing gap that needs to be addressed through new loans.The World Bank has canceled a loan of $500 to $600 million meant for Pakistan under the Affordable and Clean Energy Program (PACE-II), government sources revealed. Initially set at $500 million, the loan amount was later raised to $600 million to help address Pakistan's external financing gap, quoted news agency ANI.The PACE program was approved by the World Bank in June 2021, with the first tranche of USD 400 million already released. The second installment depended on meeting several conditions, such as holding talks with all Independent Power Producers (IPPs), especially the Chinese power plants built under CPEC. It was discovered that no progress had been made in renegotiating agreements with CPEC-related power plants as China has consistently refused to revisit these deals or restructure the energy debt, which amounts to approximately $16 billion.To reduce electricity costs, the government is renegotiating energy agreements with power plants set up under the 1994 and 2002 policies. The Chinese-owned power plants, along with several government-run plants, including four LNG-based and two nuclear plants, fall under the 2015 energy policy. Though the government has tried negotiating over 22 energy contracts yet, no significant reductions have been made in electricity prices which linger from 65 Pakistani Rupees (PKR) to 70 PKR.A spokesperson for the World Bank confirmed that ""slower-than-expected progress led to a shift in strategy in our support for reform"" in Pakistan's energy sector. The spokesperson further elaborated that the lender has been supporting power sector reforms through the PACE initiative.Even though slower progress led the World Bank to revise its lending strategy, the World Bank has continued its support by directly financing low-cost hydropower projects, including an additional $1 billion for the Dasu Hydropower project.Furthermore, the Bank has also continued working with all stakeholders to expedite the implementation of the Electricity Distribution Efficiency Improvement Project, aimed at improving efficiency in the power distribution sector. It has also offered technical assistance to promote private sector involvement in power distribution companies (DISCOs).For the ongoing fiscal year, Pakistan anticipated $2 billion in loans from the World Bank.However, by the end of the July-October period, only $349 million, 18 per cent of the planned amount, had been disbursed.Under the PACE-II program, Pakistan was expected to tackle inefficiencies in power distribution companies and reduce the growth of circular debt. However, the government has been unable to achieve either of these objectives. The government had approved a roadmap under PACE-I to encourage private sector involvement in the distribution sector, but it remained far from implementation.The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) recently reported that inefficiencies in power distribution companies led to losses of PKR 660 billion in the last fiscal year. During the same period, circular debt surged to PKR 2.393 trillion, far exceeding the targets set in agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.The successful implementation of this roadmap was essential for evaluating the progress of the power sector reform program, but it was not carried out.",The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions.

Among the detainees, the army initiated military trials against 103 accused on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military. Though Khan was released after three days, he was rearrested two months later in another corruption case and has been in jail since. There have been widespread reports that the military also plans to prosecute him under the same charges. He, however, has already been indicted by an anti-terrorism court over charges linked to the May 9 riots.The seven-member SC constitution bench was formed as a result of a controversial amendment to the constitution in Oct this year.“The final judgment of 85 persons who are under custody and facing trial before the military courts be announced and remissions admissible to the said persons be granted, and persons who can be released after remissions they be released forthwith, and persons who have to yet undergo the sentence awarded to them, their custody be handed over to the concerned jail authorities,” Friday’s court order read.The Pakistan Army Act of 1952 had established military courts, which function under a separate legal system, primarily for trial of military personnel or enemies of the state.The decision to use military courts for civilians was taken by Imran’sadversary, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during his first term in office, and was backed by the powerful military establishment.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in May 9 riots.

Respiratory illnesses soar in Pakistan as dust pollution and poverty worsen health crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/respiratory-illnesses-soar-in-pakistan-as-dust-pollution-and-poverty-worsen-health-crisis/articleshow/116262633.cms,"KARACHI: As winter sets in, there has been a noticeable rise in Pakistcitizens respiratory illnesses over the past few weeks.Experts suggest that this year's case numbers are considerably higher compared to previous years. They attribute the increase to deteriorating air quality, particularly due to severe dust pollution affecting nearly all city roads, compounded by the significant loss of green spaces as reported by Dawn.Experts also connected the rise in respiratory illnesses to the increasing poverty levels, driven by an unprecedented surge in the prices of essential food and medicine, which has significantly heightened people's susceptibility to illness and disability.Dr. Javaid Ahmed Khan, a senior professor and consultant pulmonologist at Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), explained to Dawn, ""While respiratory disease cases typically rise with the onset of winter, due to colder and drier air trapping more pollutants, this year the numbers have nearly doubled. This applies to both inpatients and outpatients.""According to the Dawn report, Dr. Khan attributed the rise in respiratory diseases to heavy dust pollution, stating, ""I believe air quality has deteriorated significantly. There is extensive roadwork throughout the city, trees are being cut down, and people continue to burn waste on the streets. There is no regulation of vehicles emitting toxic fumes.""He further explained that poor air quality heightens the risk of bronchitis by exposing individuals to pollutants such as dust, fumes, traffic emissions, and chemicals. This pollution weakens the immune system, making people more susceptible to lung infections and other illnesses.""Any type of pollution impacts the immune system, a fact supported by numerous studies. People living in polluted environments are more prone to pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections, allergic rhinitis, and even tuberculosis.""Dr. Khan explained that irritants, including particulate matter 2.5, damage the respiratory system's immune defences, which normally protect against various germs.When the immune system is compromised, the body becomes highly susceptible to infections and diseases, including cancer. He pointed out that the average diameter of human hair is about 70 micrometres, while particulate matter 2.5 consists of fine particles that are 2.5 micrometres or smaller. Additionally, Dr. Khan noted that research has linked poor air quality to a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, as these tiny particles enter the bloodstream and can block arteries.Supporting Dr. Khan's view, Dr. Abdul Ghafoor Shoro, a senior general physician practicing in Keamari, reported a 50 per cent increase in respiratory illnesses, including asthma, bronchitis, flu, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia in recent weeks.He stated, ""From Malir, Quaidabad, and Korangi to Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Mauripur, Keamari, Orangi, and Saddar, heavy dust pollution is widespread due to roadwork and construction activities. There's no way for the public to escape the pollution.""Dr. Sajjad Siddiqui, a senior general physician, emphasised that the rise in diseases is also linked to people's declining purchasing power. ""The public is living under extreme hardship, forced to drink contaminated water in areas lacking gas, with people relying on costly cylinders to cook just enough food to survive. When they fall ill, they can't afford the necessary medicines,"" he lamented.Dr. Liaquat Ali Halo, Additional Medical Superintendent at Dr. Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, reported a 25 to 30 per cent increase in respiratory illnesses, particularly among children, at the hospital's chest department.""We are seeing children with pneumonia and adults with COPD and asthma. Often, COPD patients are individuals who work in polluted environments or are smokers.""Experts recommend that people wear high-quality face masks or use cloth coverings (or helmets for those riding bikes) when outdoors, although these measures cannot fully protect against toxic air. ""Indoor air quality is just as crucial,"" emphasised Dr. Halo.""It's important to ensure proper ventilation in homes, even during winter. People should avoid burning mosquito coils and incense, as there are increasing concerns about their harmful health effects."" He also noted that using gas stoves in poorly ventilated kitchens can further degrade air quality.","There has been a noticeable rise in Pakistcitizens respiratory illnesses over the past few weeks.

Bin Laden, Tehran and the Taliban



'Murdered my dreams'



PARACHINAR: Once again, Ali Ghulam receives mourners at his home -- his brother and nephew killed 40 years apart in the same sectarian conflict that was reignited this year in northwest Pakistan, claiming 200 lives since July alone.Thousands of residents are stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, as the government struggles to end clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stemming from decades-old tensions over farmland.""Our generations yearn for peace,"" 72-year-old Ghulam told AFP at his home in Parachinar, the main town and a Shiite bastion of the restive district.The latest flare-up of violence has ""reopened wounds"" he said, recalling how his brother was killed in an attack in 1987 that also wounded another three of his brothers.Kurram, known as the ""Parrot's Beak"" for its protrusion into neighbouring Afghanistan, is bounded by dizzyingly high mountains, the northern flank of which includes the Tora Bora caves where Al Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden once hid.Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for various militant groups, with militants and weapons able to flow largely unchecked in and out of Afghanistan.""I have never experienced peace in my life and have no hope my coming generations will live free of fear,"" Ghulam said.Tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan.But they can be particularly protracted and violent in the mountainous tribal northwest, where communities live by traditional codes of honour and revenge.The latest round of violence in Kurram erupted in May and intensified in July, when gunmen opened fire on a council of elders attempting to settle the latest round of disagreements over land.Various truces announced since then have held for only weeks or days at a time.More than 300 shops and over 200 homes in Sunni areas have been destroyed, often by fire, and hundreds of families have fled.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country with Shiites making up 10 to 15 percent of the population, or at least 25 million people.Members of the two sects have periodically clashed in Kurram, where Shiites are particularly vulnerable as they must pass through Sunni-majority neighbourhoods to access essential services.Kurram's location on the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan put it at the heart of the religious and political upheavals of the last five decades.In 1979, Shiites led a revolution in Iran and later that year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, prompting Sunni hardliners there to rise up against them.Pakistan's military ruler Zia-ul-Haq aligned with them, funnelling thousands of Sunni militants into Afghanistan through Kurram.""It became a hub for arms supply to Afghanistan, including landmines, mortar shells, and weapons of all kinds. Every household in Kurram had a stockpile of weapons,"" Malik Attaullah Khan, a local tribal elder told AFP.Khan, who signed a 2007 agreement aimed at bringing peace to Kurram, criticised the government for failing to ""fulfil in its responsibilities"" in enforcing land settlements.The ethnic Pashtun heartland was merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, but the Pakistani state maintains limited control in the merged districts.In rural areas of Pakistan, villages often bypass the formal justice system and men-only ""jirgas"" or councils made up of respected village elders resolve disputes, sometimes in the form of fines or land reallocation.Ghulam's nephew was killed along with at least 42 others last month, when Sunni gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Shiites being escorted by the police to their homes.In retaliation, a market in a Sunni-dominated area was set on fire.Syed Ghani Shah told AFP his cousin was burned to death inside his shop.""When we buried him, he was so unrecognisable that we couldn't even let his parents see his face,"" Shah said.""Can we ever make peace after all this? Never, if we ever get the chance, we will surely avenge our blood,"" he warned.Authorities have enforced curfews and road closures to reduce the chances of violence breaking out, providing escorts through high-risk areas and using helicopters to deliver supplies.But Akbar Khan, a representative of Pakistan's independent Human Rights Commission told AFP that the state needs to do more to resolve the issue.""In the past, jirgas were successful because they had the full support of the state. Now, the authorities don't even provide the expenses needed to hold a jirga,"" he said.Fatima Ahmed's husband was killed last month while travelling to Islamabad to arrange her admission to medical college.""I don't want to live a life without him. I've lost my will to exist,"" the 21-year-old told AFP.""They haven't just martyred my husband -- they've also murdered my dreams with him,"" she said, bursting into tears.",Violence in northwest Pakistan has killed 200 people since July. Clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stem from decades-old tensions over farmland. Residents stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world in Oct, revealed data shared by Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index on Monday.Since Mid-July, internet users in Pakistan have reported frequent slowdowns and persistent connectivity challenges in the country, causing widespread disruptions to browsing and media sharing.The global index placed Pakistan at 100 out of 111 countries in mobile internet speeds, and 141 out of 158 countries in broadband speeds.The country’s regular internet interruptions were accompanied by reports of restricted access to virtual private networks (VPNs), which many Pakistanis use to access X and other restricted websites.According to the World Population Review, which analysed data from Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index and Cable, Pakistan’s average download speed was 7.85 MBPS, with a median mobile download speed of 19.59 MBPS and a median broadband download speed of 15.52 MBPS.Internet service providers and the business community blamed the slump in services on the govt’s installation of a Chinese-built national internet firewall, a combination of hardware and software used by authorities to control and monitor internet traffic, acting as a digital gatekeeper that decides what data to allow or block.The national firewall, also being installed on servers of major internet providers, has the capability to detect and slow digital communication between individual users.Last month, Pakistan home ministry had sought a ban on unregulated use of VPNs, citing their use by terrorists to “facilitate violent activities” and to “access pornographic and blasphemous content”.“VPNs are increasingly being exploited by terrorists to facilitate violent activities and financial transactions in Pakistan,” the ministry said in a letter to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).","Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world.

"Pakistan's ISI pushes drug addicts as terror couriers in Indian jails, say officials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-isi-pushes-drug-addicts-as-terror-couriers-in-indian-jails-say-officials/articleshow/116116037.cms,"During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India to utilise them to deliver critical messages to hardcore terrorists incarcerated in the country's prisons. Officials said that more than 10 such cases have been reported since July this year in which Pakistani nationals have entered India from their country and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Many of them have been sent to prisons in Jammu, Punjab and Rajasthan.The officials said security agencies suspect these individuals are Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) couriers tasked with relaying important communication to the jailed terrorists wherever possible.Interrogation of these individuals typically shows that they have been trained in resistance techniques to withstand questioning by security personnel.The behaviour displayed by those apprehended has raised suspicions among officials, who suggest that their superficial details and evasive responses indicate a potentially larger agenda behind their infiltration, possibly stemming from the fear of repercussions from their handlers.They explained that the use of mobile phones and the internet leaves behind electronic footprints that could expose the plans of both state and non-state actors operating across the border. As a result, the ISI has adopted this new modus operandi.The infiltration strategy reportedly includes women and minors, who may also serve as couriers. In a notable incident in July, a minor from Pakistan's Attock was intercepted in Punjab.During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said.The ISI's infiltration tactics have been linked to drug smuggling operations. In one case from Bijnour village in Rajasthan, a Pakistani national posing as mentally disturbed finally spilled the beans during intense questioning that he had been hired by two drug lords in Pakistan -- Sarfaraz Johiya and Nawaz -- to facilitate narcotics trafficking into India and gather information on the deployment of Border Security Force (BSF) troops.In another recent incident, a Pakistani youth named Mohammed Asad from Lahore drove to the zero line on his motorcycle and seemingly awaited arrest by the BSF. During interrogation, he claimed to have had a family dispute over his girlfriend.The officials noted that Asad, who was subsequently moved to prison, may have been acting as a courier. Security agencies have requested additional custody for extended interrogation.In October, a 31-year-old man who identified himself as Shahid Imran entered India through the Jammu sector, claiming that he wanted to visit a Kali temple to get married.The officials explained that such infiltrators are generally booked under the Foreigners Act and Passports Act, for which the punishment ranges from two years to eight years in prison and following this, they are deported.They said that in the late-1990s and early-2000s, ISI exploited the Samjhauta Express, the rail link between India and Pakistan, for covert courier operations, employing individuals known as ""sawari operators"".This service continued until February 2019, when the train service was halted.The ""sawari operators"" played a crucial role in smuggling drugs and transporting funds intended to finance terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, as well as Punjab.However, following a significant crackdown by authorities, these operations were effectively curtailed, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of numerous individuals involved in such activities.Recent developments suggest that the ISI's current method of sending couriers mirrors these past tactics.The officials said that the infiltration strategies being employed now are reminiscent of the past, as the agency seeks new ways to bypass law enforcement and deliver crucial communication and resources across the border.","Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India. Officials said that more than 10 such cases have been reported since July this year. Many of them have been sent to prisons in Jammu, Punjab and Rajasthan. Security agencies suspect these individuals are Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) couriers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116116033,imgsize-891192,width-400,resizemode-4/116116033.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries.

Article 106 says: ""If at any time it appears to the President that a question of law has arisen, or is likely to arise, which is of such a nature and of such public importance that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of the Supreme Court upon it, he may refer the question to the appellate division for consideration and the division may, after such hearing as it thinks fit, report its opinion thereon to the President.""The HC ruled that abolishing the non-party caretaker govt system was unconstitutional and void as it undermined democracy, free and fair elections, and judicial independence - fundamental pillars of the constitution's basic structure. The court remarked that restoration of the caretaker govt system will pave the way for holding elections under a non-partisan govt.Tuesday's verdict scrapped the parts of the 15th Amendment Act, which scrapped the 13th amendment that had introduced the non-party caretaker govt system in 1996, and brought significant changes to the charter.

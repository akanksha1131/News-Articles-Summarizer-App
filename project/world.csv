Iran ‘talking to us’: Trump



Tehran warns against attack







US President Donald Trump has warned Canada of a “very substantial” American response if it proceeds with a trade agreement with China, while at the same time signalling a softer stance towards Iran by saying Tehran was “talking to” Washington even as US military deployments in the region continued.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday (local time), Trump said the US would act decisively if Ottawa followed through on the deal it has negotiated with Beijing.“If they do a deal with China, yeah, we’ll do something very substantial,” Trump said. “We don’t want China to take over Canada. And if they make the deal that he’s looking to make, China will take over Canada,” according to Reuters.Trump last week had threatened to impose 100 per cent tariffs on Canada if it went ahead with the proposed agreement with China.Responding to which Canadian PM Mark Carney said, Canada has “no intention” of going forward with a deal with China.Separately, Trump said Iran was negotiating with the United States, hinting at the possibility of a deal even as tensions remained high.“(Iran is) talking to us, and we’ll see if we can do something, otherwise we’ll see what happens… We have a big fleet heading out there,” Trump told Fox News, adding: “They are negotiating,” according to AFP.He said US allies in the region were not being briefed on possible military plans for security reasons.“Well, we can’t tell them the plan. If I told them the plan, it would be almost as bad as telling you the plan – it could be worse, actually,” Trump said.Washington has deployed a naval strike group led by the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln off Iran’s shores, a move that has raised fears of a direct confrontation.Iran, meanwhile, has issued warnings against any military action. Army chief Amir Hatami said Iranian forces were at “full defensive and military readiness” and warned that any attack would endanger regional security, according to state news agency IRNA.Iranian officials have also indicated openness to talks. Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran’s supreme national security council, said “the formation of a structure for negotiations is progressing,” following talks in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said a broader conflict would harm both sides, adding that Iran had never sought war and did not believe it would serve the interests of Iran, the US or the region.Qatar has also stepped in diplomatically, with its prime minister holding talks in Tehran on Saturday to push for de-escalation, the Gulf state’s foreign ministry said.","US President Donald Trump warns Canada of a “very substantial” response if it proceeds with a trade agreement with China.

TOI correspondent from Washington

Trump To Pull Out ICE From Minnesota? Panic Hits White House After Fiery Backlash From MAGA Voters





: In a move that underscores the MAGA v Moderate Republican politics in the US heartland, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Wednesday announced a sweeping investigation into alleged abuse of the federal H-1B visa program, targeting what his office described as fraudulent schemes that disadvantage U.S. workers.Paxton said his office issued Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) to the three North Texas companies requiring them to turn over records related to their operations, employees, and visa sponsorship practices. The businesses, which are purportedly run by Indians according to local media reports, are suspected of creating “sham companies” and maintaining “ghost offices” in order to improperly obtain H-1B visas for foreign workers.According to the attorney general’s office, some entities allegedly used misleading websites advertising products or services that do not exist, with the sole purpose of justifying visa sponsorships. “Any criminal who attempts to scam the H-1B visa program and use ‘ghost offices’ or other fraudulent ploys should be prepared to face the full force of the law,” Paxton said in a statement, arguing that such abuse “strips jobs and opportunities away from Texans.” His office also launched a public tip portal to solicit information on potential violations.As of this week, no charges have been filed, and the companies under investigation – which Paxton did not name – have not publicly responded. Local reports named two of the companies: Qubitz Tech Systems LLC, which reportedly has 13 approved H-1B visa employees; and 3BEES Technologies, with 27 H-1B visas approved between 2022 and 2025.Industry insiders say Paxton and the MAGA media are mischaracterizing a standard business model in the IT consulting world, where a ""bodyshop"" often has a small administrative footprint (sometimes a home office) because its workers are physically located at the offices of major clients (like banks or telecom giants). Several Indian IT companies, including TCS, Infosys, and Wipro, have large operations in Texas, employing thousands of workers, including native-born Americans.But Paxton’s investigation seeks to prove some of the smaller, so-called ""body shops"" are not legitimate consulting firms but ""sham"" operations that exist to charge fees for visa sponsorship and offer “bench” services to clients while collecting part of the workers’ wages.The H-1B program allows US employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations such as technology, engineering, and medicine. While widely used by major employers, the program has long drawn criticism from labor advocates and immigration skeptics who argue it can be exploited to undercut domestic wages or replace US workers. Texas ranks second only to California in the number of H-1B approvals, heightening the local political and economic stakes.Paxton’s move follows an executive directive issued by Governor Greg Abbott one day earlier, ordering state agencies and public higher education institutions to freeze new H-1B visa petitions until May 31, 2027. Affected agencies must report details on current visa holders to the Texas Workforce Commission by March 27, including job roles, countries of origin, visa expiration dates, and efforts to recruit Texans first.The state actions mirror heightened federal scrutiny of the program. In September 2025, US Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Department of Labor launched coordinated fraud investigations, including the Labor Department’s “Project Firewall,” aimed at ensuring employers prioritize American workers and comply with wage and recruitment rules.While framed as an enforcement effort, Paxton’s investigation also unfolds against the backdrop of his Senate campaign. Paxton is challenging John Cornyn, a four-term senator and former GOP whip, in the March 3, 2026, Republican primary. Paxton has cast himself as a hardline conservative aligned with “America First” priorities, repeatedly criticizing Cornyn as too moderate on issues such as US aid to Ukraine and immigration.Recent polling shows Paxton and Cornyn effectively tied, and with a third candidate, Congressman Wesley Hunt also in the field, there is the possibility of a May runoff if no candidate gets 50 per cent vote. President Trump is yet to weigh in on the race.Taken together, the investigation and the Senate race underscore a broader struggle within the Texas Republican Party between MAGA-aligned insurgents and more traditional conservatives. The outcome could shape not only the party’s direction on immigration policy, but also Texas’s influence in national debates over labor, work visas, enforcement, and economic growth.","Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced a sweeping investigation into alleged abuse of the federal H-1B visa program.

A brief change on Saudi Arabia’s Qiwa platform triggered uncertainty among expatriate workers and employers, but officials have now moved to clear the air. The platform has confirmed that non-Saudis can still be appointed as general managers, provided they meet specific regulatory conditions, According to Saudi Gazette.Qiwa, which operates under the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development, said the role of “general manager” is not restricted to Saudi nationals and does not fall under mandatory Saudization requirements. The clarification came after users noticed that the job title had been removed from the list of profession-change options available to expatriates, leading to confusion about eligibility.According to Qiwa, appointing a non-Saudi to the position remains permissible as long as the job title is officially recorded in the company’s commercial registration using the same designation. This step is required to ensure consistency between employment contracts and the company’s registered business details, and to keep labour records aligned with official documentation.The platform stressed that while expatriates can no longer submit open requests to change their profession to “general manager” through the system, the title itself has not been abolished for non-Saudis. Instead, it continues to be available to those who satisfy the approved regulatory requirements, reinforcing that the recent change was procedural rather than a policy shift.","Qiwa platform confirms non-Saudis can still be appointed as general managers.

Rain turns Sharjah roads into a backdrop for reckless stunts

Penalties reflect tough stance on road safety in Sharjah



Part of a broader safety push across the UAE



Community cooperation urged to preserve safety in Sharjah



Looking ahead: Road safety culture and enforcement in Sharjah







Sharjah Police have launched a decisive legal crackdown on motorists caught performing dangerous driving stunts during rainfall, seizing multiple vehicles and initiating action against eight drivers whose reckless behaviour risked lives on public roads. The incident, which went viral on social media as footage circulated of cars skidding and spinning on wet tarmac, underscores a growing focus by UAE law enforcement on combating reckless behaviour and enhancing road safety across the emirate.Last week, heavy rain in Sharjah brought a wave of unusual behaviour from some motorists who turned the slick roads into an impromptu playground for dangerous stunts. Sharjah Police, upon reviewing visual evidence and footage shared online, took action against eight drivers who were filmed pushing the limits of control in their vehicles, not only endangering their own lives but also threatening the safety of fellow road users.Authorities emphasised that such conduct is not a harmless thrill but a serious violation of federal traffic laws due to the inherently dangerous conditions rain creates, where reduced tire grip and increased stopping distances heighten the risk of loss of control and collisions. The Traffic and Patrols Directorate warned that what may start as a fun stunt can “turn moments of enjoyment into life-threatening scenarios,” especially when vehicles slide unpredictably on wet surfaces.Under the UAE’s Federal Traffic Law, the drivers apprehended face multiple penalties. For driving in a manner that endangers life and public safety, each offender will be fined AED 2,000 and receive 23 black points on their licence, along with vehicle impoundment of up to 60 days under Article 1(A). An additional offence, operating a vehicle on the road without licence plates, carries AED 3,000 in fines, an additional 23 black points and up to 90 days of impoundment under Article 4.Police noted that accumulating the yearly limit of 24 black points can lead to licence suspension and court proceedings, ensuring that repeated offenders may face even harsher consequences. This strong enforcement action reflects broader efforts to deter dangerous driving behaviour, particularly in challenging weather conditions when the margin for error is smaller and the potential cost in human life is higher.The Sharjah crackdown fits into a larger pattern of enforcement and public safety messaging across the UAE. In recent months, law enforcement agencies in other emirates have also taken firm action against reckless behaviour behind the wheel. For example, Dubai Police impounded a high-performance vehicle and took legal action after a driver posted clips of dangerous stunts online, highlighting risks posed by showboating on public streets.Similarly, Abu Dhabi Police arrested a driver livestreaming while weaving through traffic, emphasising that reaching for social media views should never come at the cost of road safety. These combined efforts echo steadfast guidance from traffic authorities that dangerous driving, whether fuelled by weather spectacle, social media or thrill-seeking, will not be tolerated.Sharjah’s current enforcement also reflects how authorities are applying existing traffic law provisions to changing behaviour patterns. According to a driving regulation guide issued by the Sharjah Police, violations such as driving dangerously or operating a vehicle without proper documentation attract significant fines, black points and vehicle confiscation periods, all designed to serve as strong deterrents.Police have not only punished the eight drivers but also appealed to the public to play an active role in monitoring and reporting unsafe driving practices. Members of the community were urged to report serious traffic violations immediately by dialling 999 for emergencies or 901 for non-emergency cases, reinforcing the idea that road safety is a shared responsibility between authorities and residents alike.The emphasis on such public participation reflects a broader traffic safety strategy in the UAE; one where enforcement, awareness and community vigilance work in tandem. Authorities contend that encouraging responsible driving habits is as important as penalising reckless conduct, especially during adverse conditions like rain, which already elevate risk levels.Weather-related road incidents, even when not involving stunts, are known to heighten risk. Rain reduces tire traction, increases braking distances and can dramatically change a vehicle’s handling characteristics. While many drivers adapt to these conditions with caution, others misjudge their vehicle’s capabilities or overestimate their own skills. What might appear to be fun (such as spinning tires or drifting on wet roads) can quickly turn into serious crashes with injuries or fatalities.Traffic authorities have repeatedly stressed that rain is not an invitation to test driving limits but a time for heightened caution. In wet conditions, even routine manoeuvres require slower speeds, longer following distances and mindful steering, lessons often reinforced by accident statistics and public safety campaigns.While the legal action against the eight drivers has made headlines, it also serves as a cautionary tale for drivers across the UAE. As authorities step up enforcement and penalties remain stringent, motorists are reminded that public roadways are shared spaces where individual choices can have far-reaching consequences.Reckless behaviour of whether performing stunts, livestreaming while driving or ignoring hazardous conditions, does not only risk fines and impoundment. It can lead to serious injuries, loss of life and long-term legal consequences such as licence suspension and court appearances. Sharjah Police’s message is clear: enjoying weather and scenic conditions should never come at the cost of safety. The emirate’s legal action underscores a firm commitment to preserving lives, reducing road accidents and fostering a culture of responsible driving that protects all road users.","Sharjah Police have launched a legal crackdown on motorists caught performing dangerous driving stunts during rainfall.

Biggest Tech Layoffs of 2025: Job Cuts at TCS, Intel, Microsoft, Google and more





A company might lay people off for any number of reasons: It didn’t meet financial targets. It overhired. It was rocked by tariffs, or the loss of a big client. But lately, many companies are highlighting a new factor: artificial intelligence. Executives, saying they anticipate huge changes from the technology, are making cuts now.AI was cited in the announcements of more than 50,000 layoffs in 2025, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a research firm. Amazon said Wednesday that it was cutting 16,000 corporate jobs, in addition to the 14,000 it announced in the fall. In a June blog post, Andrew Jassy, the CEO, said, “As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” adding that “in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total workforce.” He later walked back the connection between layoffs and AI.Pinterest said last month it would cut about 15% of its workforce, partly because it would be “reallocating resources to AI-focused roles.”And Hewlett-Packard’s CEO, Enrique Lores, said on a Nov investor call, “We see a significant opportunity to embed AI into HP,” which would lead to as many as 6,000 job cuts in the coming years.Investors may applaud such preemptive moves. But some skeptics suggest that corporations are disingenuously blaming AI for layoffs, or “AI-washing.”As market research firm Forrester put it in a Jan report: “Many companies announcing AI-related layoffs do not have mature, vetted AI applications ready to fill those roles, highlighting a trend of ‘AI-washing’ — attributing financially motivated cuts to future AI implementation.”The term echoes popular descriptors of misleading marketing practices, such as greenwashing and ethics washing. It started bubbling up a few years ago, mostly to call out companies that claimed to be using AI when they weren’t. But lately, it has been used more broadly to gesture at companies emphasizing AI to explain things like layoffs when the picture may be more complex.Of course, AI may well end up transforming the job market, in tech and beyond. But a recent study Kinder worked on for the Yale Budget Lab found that artificial intelligence has not yet meaningfully shifted the overall market.nyt","Amazon, Pinterest and Hewlett-Packard have announced job cuts linked to artificial intelligence.

'Trump's Domestic Army On The Loose': Bernie Sanders Pushes To Shift ICE's $75 Bn To Medicaid





A federal judge on Saturday ordered the release of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, Adrian Conejo Arias, from a Texas detention centre by Tuesday, sharply criticising the Trump administration’s immigration policies. The ruling came after the pair were detained by immigration officers in Minnesota on January 20 and moved to a facility in Dilley, Texas.Images of Liam wearing a bunny hat and Spider-Man backpack surrounded by ICE officers drew national attention and outrage. US District Judge Fred Biery, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, said the case reflected “the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatising children.”Neighbors and school officials claimed immigration officers used Liam to lure his mother to the door, though the Department of Homeland Security denied this. Arias entered the US illegally from Ecuador in December 2024, but his lawyer said he has a pending asylum claim.Biery referenced the Declaration of Independence and Bible verses in his ruling, including “Jesus said, ‘Let the little children come to me…’” and “Jesus wept.” He highlighted the trauma caused to children and families under the current enforcement approach.","5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father were detained by immigration officers in Minnesota on January 20.

Schumer DARES Trump On ICE After Rare Deal Stripping DHS Funding To Halt Shutdown: ‘No Vote Unless…’





US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he has instructed the Department of Homeland Security not to get involved in protests in Democratic-led cities unless local authorities request federal assistance or federal property is under threat.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said cities must protect their own state and local property. “Under no circumstances are we going to participate unless, and until, they ask us for help,” he wrote. He added that ICE and Border Patrol personnel would continue to guard federal buildings and would do so “very powerfully”.The statement came a day after thousands of people protested in Minneapolis and other US cities, calling for federal immigration agencies to leave Minnesota.The protests followed the fatal shootings of two US citizens and the deployment of around 3,000 federal officers to the Minneapolis area as part of a crackdown on illegal immigration.Trump also said federal forces would not tolerate attacks on officers or government property. “We will not allow our courthouses, federal buildings, or anything else under our protection, to be damaged,” he wrote, warning of “equal, or more, consequence” for violence.",US President Donald Trump said he has instructed the Department of Homeland Security not to get involved in protests in Democratic-led cities.

She said there was evidence of a “profound and even heartbreaking” effect on communities, including claims of racial profiling and excessive force by federal agents.","US District Judge Katherine Menendez denied a request for a preliminary injunction filed by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and the mayors of Minneapolis and St Paul.

Who is Katherine Menendez?

ICE operations in Minnesota





A federal judge on Saturday rejected an attempt by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to block a major surge of federal immigration enforcement under President Trump, ruling that the state is unlikely to succeed in its constitutional challenge.In a 30-page decision, US District Judge Katherine Menendez declined to issue an injunction that would have halted “Operation Metro Surge,” a large-scale deployment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel across Minnesota.“Plaintiffs ask the Court to extend existing precedent to a new context where its application is less direct,” Menendez wrote, referring to the state’s 10th Amendment claim.“None of the cases on which they rely have even come close.”Menendez acknowledged that the lawsuit raised serious concerns, at one point suggesting federal agents may have engaged in racial profiling or used excessive force, but said the legal standard for sweeping preliminary relief had not been met.She also ruled that stopping the operation would significantly harm the federal government’s immigration enforcement efforts.“If that injunction went too far, then the one at issue here — halting the entire operation — certainly would,” she added, referencing a separate ICE-related case recently paused by an appeals court.Katherine Marie Menendez (born 1971) is a US district judge for the District of Minnesota, a position she has held since 2021 after being appointed by former President Joe Biden.Before joining the federal bench, Menendez spent much of her legal career as a public defender. She became an assistant federal defender in 1999 and served in the Office of the Federal Public Defender for the District of Minnesota until 2016, representing defendants in complex federal criminal cases.On January 26, 2026, Menendez heard oral arguments in Minnesota’s lawsuit against the federal government, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, a case that has intensified scrutiny of ICE operations in the state.Minnesota has emerged as a flashpoint in Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown. First announced in December, “Operation Metro Surge” has brought nearly 3,000 ICE and CBP personnel into the state, particularly targeting Minneapolis and St. Paul.Public anger escalated after the January 24 killing of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, during a protest on Nicollet Avenue in south Minneapolis. Federal officials claimed Pretti posed a threat, but video footage shows he was not pointing a weapon and appeared to have been disarmed before being shot.Earlier this month, Renee Good, a mother of three, was also killed during a separate federal enforcement incident. The deaths have sparked nationwide protests and renewed scrutiny of ICE, which recorded 32 deaths in custody in 2025, its deadliest year in two decades.Despite Saturday’s ruling, Minnesota officials say the lawsuit will continue as the case moves forward.","US District Judge Katherine Menendez declined to issue an injunction that would have halted “Operation Metro Surge,’ a large-scale deployment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel across Minnesota.

Recently, Madhu Gottumukkala, the Indian-origin acting director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), came under fire after uploading sensitive government contracting documents into the AI model ChatGPT.The documents were marked “for official use only” and were not meant for public release. They were not classified, but the incident triggered internal security alerts, which led to a review by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).Following this news, a self-described 'Christian nationalist' and MAGA-supporting X user responded with a post blaming Indians in tech for incompetence. He said that while working in a tech company, “everything is P1 urgent priority” is typical Indian behavior.According to him, Indian colleagues would demand tasks be prioritized immediately, without providing facts or reasons, and would use threats and yelling to get their way. He linked this behavior to explain Gottumukkala’s actions, which were considered xenophobic and generalizing by social media users.In response, a US-based software engineer pushed back against these stereotypes and defended Indians. He took the example of his own experience working with Indian colleagues.His team lead, his boss, and their CTO are all Indian, and they are competent, professional, and easy to work with, he said.

Victims were instructed to make payments in unusual forms, including gold bars, cryptocurrency, and large amounts of cash.Court documents detail how one woman in Toledo was deceived into handing over more than $40,000 in cash after the suspects falsely claimed they were representatives of the Federal Trade Commission.Federal authorities said the money laundering operation was tied to a bigger network involved in moving and concealing funds obtained through fraud.The investigation was led by the FBI’s Cleveland Division Cyber Squad, which focuses on computer-related and financial crimes.According to a criminal complaint note, Bhatt is a student at the University of Toledo. Both men appeared in federal court on Friday, where they waived their preliminary hearings.Patel is scheduled to return to court on February 6 for a detention hearing.

Trump's plans for America's 250th





Washington D.C. is all set to be revamped by August 2026 as a race track covering the city's monuments will be created for the upcoming 250th anniversary of America. In a newly signed executive order on Friday, President Trump announced an IndyCar Grand Prix race titled 'Freedom 250 Grand Prix' which will include a motor race held for the first time in the nation's capital.“This race, the first motor race ever to be held in our Nation’s capital near the National Mall, will showcase the majesty of our great city as drivers navigate a track around our iconic national monuments in celebration of America’s 250th birthday,” the executive order reads.The route of the esteemed race is yet to be determined, said the order. The event will be held from August 21-23 as per a news release from the Department of Transportation.The order demanded that within two weeks, Doug Burgum and Sean P. Duffy, Secretaries of the Interior and Transportation, respectively should determine a suitable route through the nation's capital. Additionally, the government may need to take steps to ensure that drones and other forms of aerial photography can be used around the events without compromising government facilities nearby. According to Mayor Muriel E.Bowser, the event ""could attract a lot of visitors to the District.""“Like the sport of racing itself, this administration, under President Donald J. Trump, is moving at record speed to make life better for all Americans and ensure that the United States marks its 250th birthday with the celebration that it deserves,” added IndyCar owner Roger Penske.Considering the ongoing unrest among civilians in America due to the ICE brutalities and the fatal shooting of two Minneapolis citizens, the arrival of an order announcing celebration planning has not gone well with netizens.""With everything going on in this country rn do they really think it’s a good idea to have a race in the capital"" asked one on X.""I wonder how many protesters will be blocking the course?"" another person questioned.""Ya know- I remember when they did this in Phoenix and it was cool… but it sort of feels like a waste of money? Imagine the security expenses and road work alone!"" added another.""To distract the population, Ancient Rome relied on corn votes and games, lots of games,"" one pointed out.The centrepiece of the upcoming celebrations on July 4th, 2026, will be the 'Triumphal Arch' being built on the other end of a bridge leading to Arlington National Ceremony.Along with this, the Trump administration has also organised a UFC match at the White House on June 14th, whose contenders are being picked by UFC President Dana White. The event coincides with Flag Day and the president's 80th birthday.The President also launched a new organisation, 'Freedom 250', which would work with states, companies and organisations across the country for the events being organised.The schedule includes what Trump has called the ""Patriot Games"" a four-day athletic competition for high schoolers from each state. Also expected, is a ""Spirit of America"" parade on Memorial Day, a Great American State Fair held on the National Mall and a national prayer event as well.","IndyCar Grand Prix race to be held in Washington D.C. on August 21-23, 2026.

Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir As Pakistan Buys Global Influence





Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif revealed that both he and field marshal Asim Munir were forced to 'beg' billions in loans from friendly nations to bridge the country’s external financing gap.Speaking to leading exporters and business leaders at an event in Islamabad, Sharif said Pakistan’s growing dependence on foreign loans is humiliating and often forces officials to agree to unjustifiable demands.""We feel ashamed when Field Marshal Asim Munir and I go around the world begging for money,” he said, reported ANI citing local news.“Taking loans is a huge burden on our self-respect. Our heads bow down in shame. We cannot say NO to many things they want us to do,” Sharif added.Sharif praised Pakistan’s key allies—China, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar—for standing by Islamabad through difficult times, calling China the country’s “all-weather friend.”This is not the first time the premier has expressed discomfort over seeking loans. In January 2023, he said it embarrassed him to ask for further loans, despite acknowledging Saudi Arabia’s financial support.He has repeatedly stressed the need for Pakistan to achieve self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on IMF programmes.Notably, Pakistan is currently facing a severe debt crisis, with total public debt exceeding Rs 76,000 billion as of March 2025, nearly doubling in just four years. The nation relies heavily on IMF bailouts and loans from China--particularly for China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects--to manage debt servicing and avoid default.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at strengthening economic stability and climate resilience.","Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir.

Imran Khan Tagged ‘Security Threat’ As Pakistan Army Launches Fiercest Public Attack In Years





The Pakistani government is doubling down on its legal offensive against jailed former prime minister Imran Khan and prominent activists, framing the measures as essential for “national security. ” However, as prison doors remain barred to visitors and human rights lawyers face decade-long sentences, critics warn that the country’s democratic space is vanishing under the shadow of military influence.Officials say restrictions placed on Khan, including the suspension of prison visits, were imposed after he violated jail rules that prohibit political activity and the dissemination of what authorities describe as anti-state narratives. The government and military deny claims that the measures amount to illegal isolation or an attempt to silence him.Interior minister Talal Chaudhry has rejected allegations of mistreatment, calling Khan “the most privileged prisoner in Pakistan” and citing access to facilities such as gym equipment and a personal cook. He said the restrictions were lawful and in line with prison regulations.The government also dismisses accusations that the military is driving political decisions.“The civilian government is [taking] decisions. We are all working hand in glove,” Chaudhry said, praising the chief of defence forces as “doing a marvellous job,"" as quoted by BBC. Security sources insist the military operates strictly within constitutional and legal limits.Military spokespersons have argued that certain political narratives pose a growing threat to national security, particularly when a convicted politician is accused of using prison meetings to mobilise public opinion against state institutions. Officials say such actions cross the boundary from political expression into matters of national defence.Authorities stress that legal action against politicians, activists and lawyers is based on violations of existing laws, including the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), rather than an effort to suppress dissent. “Attempts to frame law-breaking as democracy or human rights are entirely misplaced,” Chaudhry said.The same legal rationale underpinned the recent conviction of human rights lawyer Imaan Mazari and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha. The couple were sentenced to 10 years in prison after being found guilty of sharing what the state described as anti-state content on social media.According to prosecutors and the court ruling, their online activity involved “disseminating and propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups” and undermined state institutions. Defending the verdict, information minister Attaullah Tarar said it reflected the proper application of the law, posting on X: “As you sow, so you shall reap!”The government maintains that these measures are necessary to prevent destabilisation and ensure accountability, regardless of an individual’s political profile or public standing.Critics, however, argue that the cases of Khan and Mazari show that he is not the only one being silenced, and warn that the space for dissent in Pakistan is narrowing as the military’s influence continues to loom large over civilian life.",Pakistani government doubles down on legal offensive against jailed former PM Imran Khan. Officials say restrictions imposed after he violated jail rules that prohibit political activity. The government and military deny claims that the measures amount to illegal isolation.

Imran Khan Tagged ‘Security Threat’ As Pakistan Army Launches Fiercest Public Attack In Years





Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister Imran Khan . The party stated that credible reports suggest that he is suffering from a serious eye condition that could lead to permanent vision loss if not treated urgently.In a statement posted on social media, the party said that Imran had reportedly been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion in his right eye, describing it as a dangerous blockage of the retinal vein that requires immediate and specialised medical care.PTI demanded that Imran be allowed an “unrestricted meeting” with his family and be shifted to a hospital of his choice for treatment, news agency ANI repeorted citing Dawn.According to the party, medical experts who examined Imran inside Adiala jail warned that the condition was extremely sensitive and carried a high risk of permanent damage if not treated promptly.PTI alleged that despite this advice, jail authorities were insisting on providing treatment within the prison, even though the specialist reportedly said such care required an operation theatre and advanced medical facilities.Calling the approach “reckless”, the party said Imran’s eyesight and overall health were in “grave danger”. It also claimed that Imran last met his personal physician in October 2024 and that no further examination had been allowed since then, despite directives from the Islamabad High Court. PTI added that a petition seeking regular medical check-ups had been pending since August 2025.“This is a blatant violation of court orders and a gross breach of fundamental human rights,” the party said, alleging that the government was prioritising political vendetta over a prisoner’s health.PTI warned that if Imran suffered permanent damage to his eyesight, the government and the Adiala jail administration would be held responsible for obstructing his treatment despite medical advice and court orders.The party appealed to the judiciary to treat the issue as one of health and human life rather than politics and demanded that Imran be allowed to undergo treatment at Shaukat Khanum Hospital or any other reputable hospital of his choice.Shaukat Khanum Hospital, founded by Imran Khan, also voiced concern, stating that it was “gravely concerned” about his condition.While expressing confidence in the doctors currently attending to him, the hospital requested that its medical team be allowed immediate access to examine Imran and participate in his care to reassure those concerned about his welfare.Meanwhile, Imran Khan’s sisters questioned the authenticity of reports about his eye condition, saying they had received no official information from jail authorities. Speaking to reporters outside Adiala jail, Noreen Khanum said the family had not been informed of any such diagnosis.“If this is true, we should have been informed so that we could have taken him to the hospital for treatment,” she said, alleging that rumours were being spread to mislead and distress people. She maintained that Imran was healthy and warned against any harm being caused to him.Another sister, Aleema Khanum, said that the jail administration was not sharing updates with the family or legal team and questioned how such information could be leaked without official involvement.“We have just one demand: release Imran Khan,” she said, adding that he had remained incarcerated for over two-and-a-half years because he refused to seek release through a deal.Uzma Khanum said that she last met Imran on December 2 last year and that he did not mention any eyesight issues during that meeting, according to Dawn.However, she recalled that during an earlier visit he had complained of an infection in his right eye and was only given eye drops. “At present, we don’t know anything about the condition of his eye as we are not allowed to meet him,” she said.PTI later claimed that Aleema Khanum was stopped by the police while returning from Adiala jail. The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan alleged that Imran’s sisters were “wrongfully confined” and described it as another misuse of state power.The alliance demanded access for Imran’s family, respect for the right to peaceful assembly and movement, and action against those responsible.Separately, PTI lawmakers arrived at the Islamabad High Court to file a fresh petition seeking permission to meet Imran. PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said Tuesdays were designated for meetings but repeated requests had gone unanswered. He stressed that meeting a prisoner was a legal right and expressed concern over the health of both Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister Imran Khan.

Is a wider terror alliance forming? Pakistan's Lashkar commander admits links to Hamas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/is-a-wider-terror-alliance-forming-pakistans-lashkar-commander-admits-links-to-hamas/articleshow/127690725.cms,"(IANS photo)

Hamas Seeks To Place 10,000 Police In New US-Backed Gaza Authority Ahead Of Disarmament Talks





Is a bigger terror nexus in the making? A senior Lashkar-e-Taiba commander operating from Pakistan has openly acknowledged links with Hamas, a Middle East-based group often at violent odds with Israel. The two US-designated terrorist organisations have held meetings to discuss expanding their scale and cooperation.This development comes against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump 's proposal to send Pakistani troops to Gaza as part of his ‘Board of Peace’ initiative, aimed at promoting stability and peace in the war-torn region.The proposal was signed and accepted by Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif .While, in a video, a commander of the Pakistani Markazi Muslim League, regarded as the political front of LeT, admitted that he met with Hamas leadership in Doha in 2024.According to a report by the US-based Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), the well-documented nexus between Hamas and terror groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad operating openly on Pakistani soil could undermine international counterterrorism efforts, endangering both regional stability and Western security interests. On January 15, 2026, the US-led intergovernmental organisation Board of Peace, whose stated purpose is to “promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict” in Gaza, was established.On January 18, US President Donald Trump, acting as chair of the organisation, invited Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to join it. However, Pakistan allows Hamas representatives to operate freely on its soil, participate in public events, and forge alliances with local militant groups. This conduct undermines Western efforts to diplomatically isolate Hamas and raises serious questions about whether the United States should continue to regard Pakistan as a 'major non-Nato ally'.The partnership between Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hamas is emerging as a new terror nexus, which could draw the attention of countries like India, Israel, and the United States.The world focuses on demilitarising Hamas in Gaza, ignoring Pakistan’s increasing role as a potential safe haven could allow the group to regroup and strengthen after its Middle East operations.Months ago, Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar suffered a major setback in India’s Operation Sindoor , when precision strikes destroyed its headquarters in Muridke. The organisation may now seek a base farther from India.The recent confession by LeT commander Faisal Nadeem indicates the formation of a front that could engage the attention of nations such as India. Pakistan has a long history of cultivating terror groups that target India, while Hamas continues similar operations against Israel.The MEMRI report also highlighted videos and images from recent events in Pakistan, including the January 2026 LeT-linked gathering in Gujranwala, featuring senior Hamas representative Naji Zaheer alongside LeT operative Rashid Ali Sandhu. These developments underline the growing nexus between Hamas and Pakistan-based terrorist groups. The mastermind of the Pahalgam terror attack in April 2025, Saifullah Kesari, was also reportedly with Nadeem in Doha, a fact the commander confirmed.",A senior Lashkar-e-Taiba commander operating from Pakistan has openly acknowledged links with Hamas.

NEW DELHI: India advised Pakistan to ""introspect"" on some of its recent moves, including the 27th Amendment that gave ""life-time immunity to its chief of defence forces” Asim Munir ""It could start by asking itself how it has let its armed forces engineer a constitutional coup through the 27th amendment and giving life-time immunity to its Chief of Defence Forces,” said India’s permanent representative to the UN, ambassador Parvathaneni Harish on Tuesday.Further, he said that Pakistan is ""well advised to introspect about the rule of law.""Pakistan’s Parliament passed the 27th Constitutional Amendment in November last year under its Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government, granting lifelong legal immunity to field marshal Asim Munir. The amendment provides protection from prosecution for actions taken during his tenure, drawing sharp criticism from opposition parties and civil society groups over concerns of accountability and constitutional overreach.Harish strongly criticised Pakistan for raising the Kashmir issue again at the UN and said that the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir ""has been, is, and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India"".Speaking on the Indus Waters Treaty , Harish said that Pakistan has ""violated the spirit of the Treaty by inflicting three wars and thousands of terror attacks on India"".“Throughout these six and a half decades, Pakistan has violated the spirit of the Treaty by inflicting three wars and thousands of terror attacks on India.Thousands of Indian lives have been lost in Pakistan-sponsored terror attacks,” he said.In the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack, he said India was “compelled to finally announce that the Treaty will be held in abeyance until Pakistan, a global epicentre of terror, credibly and irrevocably ends its support for cross-border and all other forms of terrorism.”","Pakistan's Parliament passed the 27th Constitutional Amendment in November last year under its Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government.

A wedding celebration turned into a scene of devastation in Pakistan’s north-west after a suicide bomber blew himself up among guests, killing at least seven people and injuring around 25 others, officials said. The attack took place on Friday night in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Police said the blast occurred at the home of Noor Alam Mehsud, a pro-government peace committee leader, where a marriage ceremony was under way. Witnesses said guests had been dancing to the beat of drums when the attacker struck, detonating an explosive vest inside a crowded room.District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada confirmed it was a suicide bombing. The force of the explosion caused part of the roof to collapse, trapping several people under debris and complicating rescue efforts. An emergency was declared at the District Headquarters Hospital as ambulances rushed casualties from the site.Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesperson for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122, said multiple ambulances, along with fire and disaster response vehicles, were deployed. Rescue teams worked through the rubble to pull out victims, with some of the wounded reported to be in critical condition.No group immediately claimed responsibility. However, suspicion is likely to fall on Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban, which has carried out frequent attacks in the region. The group is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban and has grown more active since the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Many TTP fighters are believed to operate from across the border.Authorities sealed off the area and launched an investigation. Initial reports suggested that Waheedullah Mehsud, also known as Jigri Mehsud, was among those killed.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi condemned the attack and sought a report from the provincial police chief, saying those responsible would be brought to justice. Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also expressed grief and ordered that the injured receive full medical support.","Attack took place in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Bar leaders allege violence, warn of protests

What was the case?





Pakistan’s prominent human rights lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad. The incident triggered strong condemnation from legal bodies and rights activists over what they described as unconstitutional move.The lawyer couple was on its way to the Additional District and Sessions Court to appear in a case linked to controversial social media posts when police intercepted their vehicle. Arrest warrants had been issued against them on January 16 after the court cancelled their interim bail, news agency PTI reported.The arrest was confirmed by Imaan’s mother, Dr Shireen Mazari, a former federal human rights minister in the Imran Khan government, who said the couple was detained without explanation and taken to undisclosed locations.In a post on X, Mazari said that her daughter and son-in-law “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations,” adding that no arrest warrant or formal document was shown to them at the time, according to Dawn.Calling the incident a sign of repression, she wrote: “Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!”Mazari also shared videos on social media showing police vehicles following the lawyers’ car before blocking it on the road. In the footage, officers were seen opening the car doors, surrounding the vehicle and attempting to pull the occupants out. Another clip showed shattered car windows, which Mazari alleged were broken by the police during the arrest.In a separate post, she claimed that police had used force not only against the couple but also against senior members of the legal fraternity who were accompanying them.“Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari wrote, alleging that the arrest was carried out to prevent further embarrassment to authorities during court proceedings.Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) president Wajid Ali Gilani, who was present at the scene, said the arrest violated assurances given by authorities that the lawyers would be allowed safe passage to court.In a video message shared by Mazari, Gilani said the police attacked the convoy near Serena Chowk, broke car windows, forcibly removed the couple and pushed Imaan into a police vehicle. He also alleged that police officials assaulted IHCBA secretary Manzoor Jajja during the incident.“The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani warned, referring to the mass protests that once challenged military rule in Pakistan.The Islamabad High Court Bar Association, Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrests, calling them illegal and unconstitutional.The IHCBA and IBA announced a strike on Friday, while the IBC called for a nationwide lawyers’ strike on Saturday. The bar councils demanded the immediate release of the couple and an independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved.In a statement, the IBA said the arrest violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Pakistan’s Constitution, stressing that “every citizen has the right to defend themselves in court without fear.”Human Rights Commission of Pakistan strongly condemned the arrest of both lawyers. In a post on X, the organzation wrote: ""HRCP demands immediate disclosure of their whereabouts and holds the authorities fully responsible for any harm. Ms Mazari-Hazir and Mr Chattha must be released immediately.""The primary case against Mazari-Hazir and Chattha stems from a complaint filed in August 2025 with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), accusing Mazari of spreading content allegedly aligned with banned organisations. Her husband was implicated for reposting some of the content.They were indicted in October last year, and arrest warrants were issued after repeated non-appearances led to the cancellation of their interim bail.Additional cases linked to protests and an alleged scuffle outside the Islamabad High Court have also been filed against them, some of which are still under judicial review.","Iaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad.

Dozens feared missing



Compensation announced for victims’ families







The death toll from a devastating fire at a major shopping plaza in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, has risen to 26, with authorities warning that the number could climb further as search operations continue, as reported by Geo TV. The blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.Rescue teams gained fuller access to the building nearly 24 hours later, after firefighters managed to bring the inferno under control. Officials said smoke was still rising from the structure on Monday, complicating efforts to locate missing people.Rescue 1122 Sindh spokesperson Hassan Khan said 21 bodies had been recovered so far, adding that search operations were still under way. “The search will continue,” he said, as concerns remain over possible structural collapses inside the severely damaged building.Mohammed Shah, part of the Pakistan Navy’s rescue team, described the incident as a “deep-seated fire”, noting that smoke continued to emanate from the debris despite the flames being largely extinguished. Firefighters said the blaze had been brought 95 per cent under control, with cooling operations now in progress.Officials warned that the weakened structure posed serious dangers. Portions of the building’s front and back façades have collapsed, while cracks have been detected inside.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said authorities were still trying to establish the final death toll. Speaking at a press conference, he said around 65 people who were reported to have visited Gul Plaza remain unaccounted for, raising fears that casualties could rise sharply.“I cannot give a final number as of yet,” he said. “There has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident.”South DIG Syed Asad Raza said more areas of the plaza were yet to be cleared, and warned the number of fatalities could increase as debris is removed.The Sindh government has announced Rs10 million (£28,000) in compensation for the family of each person killed. “There can be no price tag on a life,” the chief minister said, adding that the compensation process would begin immediately.He also confirmed that one firefighter was among those who lost their lives.The cause of the fire has not yet been confirmed. Officials initially suspect an electrical short circuit, though a forensic investigation has been ordered. Police said samples had been collected for DNA matching to help identify victims.Authorities revealed that although the plaza had 16 gates, only three exits were open at the time of the fire, raising serious questions over safety compliance.Karachi has witnessed repeated fatal fires, often linked to poor safety standards, illegal construction and inadequate fire prevention systems. A government audit in 2024 found that the vast majority of commercial buildings in the city lacked proper fire safety measures.","Blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.

Multiple cases have been registered against him since then.PTI further said that Khan has been held in solitary confinement, adding that “prolonged solitary confinement is viewed under international law as harmful and potentially constituting cruel, inhuman” treatment when imposed without clear justification or safeguards.The party added that Khan has been completely isolated in a cell and “even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been denied to him.”PTI criticised the government for failing to explain why Khan has not been able to meet his lawyers, a constitutional right for any prisoner, let alone a former prime minister.

Karachi Gul Plaza Fire Claims At Least 10 Lives, Dozens Missing As Rescue Operations Continue





The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan’s Karachi has risen to 14 after rescue teams recovered eight more bodies from the debris, officials said on Monday.The blaze broke out late Saturday night at Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market on MA Jinnah Road in the city’s Saddar area. The fire was brought under control by Sunday night, but rescue operations continued as large parts of the building suffered severe structural damage.Six bodies were found soon after the fire erupted, with officials saying the victims likely died of suffocation. Dozens of injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals. As the fire spread rapidly, thick smoke and intense heat initially prevented rescue teams from entering the building.“Once the fire was doused, we didn’t wait for the cooling period and forcibly went in to rescue trapped people and we found eight more bodies, some badly charred,” Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Abid Jalal told PTI.Jalal said the fire had almost completely damaged the building, with both the front and rear portions collapsing due to weakened pillars.“The structure has become extremely unsafe, and we are still searching as there is a risk of further collapses,” he said.Gul Plaza, built in the early 1980s, houses around 1,200 shops spread across a basement, mezzanine and three upper floors. It has long been a prominent commercial hub in Karachi.Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site on Monday, said authorities feared that dozens of people could still be trapped inside. “We are extremely concerned and alarmed. Efforts are going on to find them but this is a national tragedy,” he told reporters.South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza said the casualty count could rise as large sections of the building were yet to be searched. Officials suspect an electrical short circuit may have caused the fire, though the exact cause will be confirmed after a full investigation.The incident has once again highlighted serious fire safety concerns in Karachi. In recent years, several commercial buildings in the city have caught fire due to poor safety measures, faulty electrical systems and illegal construction.A government audit in 2024 found that most shopping malls lacked proper fire safety systems, emergency exits and compliant wiring.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, while the Sindh government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.","The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan's Karachi has risen to 14.

On Friday, the White House announced appointments to the board, which will oversee phase two of Trump’s 20-point peace plan to end the Gaza conflict.According to a White House statement, the appointees include US secretary of state Marco Rubio, former British prime minister Tony Blair, Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, World Bank president Ajay Banga, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.The panel also includes Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan and US deputy national security adviser Robert Gabriel.“Executive Board members will oversee defined portfolios critical to Gaza's stabilisation and long-term success, including, but not limited to, governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment attraction, large-scale funding, and capital mobilisation,” the White House said.Trump will serve as chairman of the Board of Peace and has appointed Aryeh Lightstone and Josh Gruenbaum as senior advisers to oversee daily strategy and operations.

Pakistan and Bangladesh on Thursday resumed direct air connectivity after a 14-year suspension, marking a move towards improving bilateral ties as Biman Bangladesh Airlines operated its inaugural Dhaka–Karachi flight.The flight, BG341, landed at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport at 11.03 pm after departing Dhaka’s Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 8.15 pm, according to flight tracking data cited by Dawn. The aircraft received a traditional water cannon salute on arrival, the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) said in a statement .Speaking to reporters at the airport, Sindh governor Kamran Tessori said cooperation between the two countries would extend beyond aviation to other sectors.Earlier in the day, Pakistan’s high commission in Dhaka said the “fully packed” inaugural flight was seen off by Bangladesh’s civil aviation and tourism adviser Sheikh Bashiruddin, Pakistan high commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider, and other officials .Addressing the ceremony in Dhaka, Sheikh Bashiruddin said the Dhaka–Karachi route aimed at “enhancing connectivity, promoting tourism and strengthening people-to-people links”.He added, “Bangladesh Airlines will gradually increase flight frequency and reduce airfares to make travel more affordable for the people” .Pakistan’s high commissioner referred to discussions between Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus and prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on restoring air links.“In view of the vision of the leadership and aspirations of the people of our two countries… both sides agreed to take immediate measures for the resumption of direct flights,” he said, referring to talks held during deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar’s visit to Dhaka in August last year .Direct flights between the two countries had been suspended since 2012, forcing travellers to rely on connecting routes via Gulf hubs such as Dubai and Doha. The two nations, once part of a single country before the 1971 war, are geographically separated by about 1,500 km of Indian territory .Biman Bangladesh Airlines said the twice-weekly flights would “play a significant role in promoting trade and commerce, expanding educational exchanges, and fostering cultural ties between the two countries” .Mohammad Shahid, one of the 150 passengers on the inaugural Karachi-bound flight, said the resumption would make travel easier. “We had been waiting for such an opportunity because we travel continuously,” he told AFP. “There are so many people waiting in Pakistan to come here, and some waiting here to go there” .Bilateral ties have shown signs of improvement since the change of government in Bangladesh in 2024, even as Dhaka’s relations with India have cooled. Cargo shipping between Karachi and Chittagong resumed in November 2024, alongside increased trade, cultural exchanges and medical travel, AFP reported .","Pakistan and Bangladesh resume direct air connectivity after a 14-year suspension.

Awami League Escalates Bangladesh Crisis With ‘No Boat No Vote’ Boycott Call Against Yunus Polls





Bangladesh on Wednesday said that there was no security situation that justified India recalling the family members of its diplomats from Dhaka. This comes after New Delhi cited precautionary safety concerns amid rising extremist activity ahead of the country’s general elections.Bangladesh’s foreign affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain said that there was “no reason” for such a move and maintained that foreign diplomats and their families were not facing any threat in the country.Addressing a media briefing at the foreign ministry, Hossain said, “There is no situation here that would indicate danger (for Indian diplomats).” He added that Bangladesh had not received any formal communication from India flagging specific security concerns.Calling the decision an internal matter of India, Hossain said, “It is entirely their internal matter. They (India) can ask their officials or families to leave at any time.” He added that Bangladesh had no objection if Indian diplomats chose to send their family members back. “If they want to do so, there is nothing we can do about it,” he said.Hossain, who has earlier served as Bangladesh’s deputy high commissioner in India, said he could not identify a clear reason behind the move.“Perhaps (India) they have some apprehension or want to convey a message, but I cannot identify any clear reason,” he said.India last week advised the families of its diplomats and officials posted in Bangladesh to return home, weeks before the February 12 elections, citing security concerns following increased activities of extremist elements.India has its High Commission in Dhaka and diplomatic posts in Khulna, Chattogram, Rajshahi and Sylhet.Despite the recall of family members, the five Indian diplomatic missions in Bangladesh continue to function normally. The Indian High Commission in Dhaka also hosted a reception to mark India’s Republic Day, officials said.Earlier, Indian government sources said the decision to advise dependents of mission and post officials to return to India was taken as a precautionary measure.“Given the security situation, as a precautionary measure, we have advised the dependents of mission and post officials to return to India. The mission and all posts in Bangladesh continue to remain open and operational,” an official source said, adding that the Indian mission was functioning at full strength.According to sources, the move followed recent anti-India protests that were feared could escalate. “It’s for the time being and will be reviewed later,” an official said on condition of anonymity.In India’s neighbourhood, Afghanistan remains the only posting where Indian officials are not accompanied by their families. While diplomats in Pakistan are technically allowed to take their families, they generally avoid doing so following past security advisories.","India last week advised the families of its diplomats and officials posted in Bangladesh to return home, weeks before the February 12 elections.

Ex-PM Hasina Calls Yunus “Murderous Fascist,” Warns Bangladesh at Edge of Abyss





A Bangladesh court on Monday sentenced Dhaka’s fugitive former police chief and two senior officers to death for crimes against humanity over the killing of six protesters during the July 2024 mass uprising that led to the overthrow of then prime minister Sheikh Hasina.The International Crimes Tribunal-1 (ICT-1) handed the death penalty to former Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) commissioner Habibur Rahman, former joint commissioner Sudip Kumar Chakrabort and former additional deputy commissioner (Ramna zone) Shah Alam Mohammad Akhtarul Islam. All three were tried in absentia and their whereabouts remain unknown, as reported by Dhaka Tribune.The verdict comes ahead of Bangladesh’s February 12 elections, the first polls since Hasina was ousted in August 2024 following weeks of mass protests.Five other former police officials were sentenced to varying prison terms. Former assistant commissioner of Ramna zone Mohammad Imrul was jailed for six years; former Shahbagh Police Station inspector (operations) Md Arshad Hossain received four years; while constables Md Sujan Mia, Md Imaz Hossain Emon and Md Nasirul Islam were sentenced to three years each. Arshad, Sujan, Imaz and Nasirul are currently in custody.The case relates to the killing of six protesters in Dhaka’s Chankharpul area on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fled to India as demonstrators stormed her official residence.The verdict was delivered by a three-member bench of ICT-1 comprising Justice Mozumder, Justice Md Shafiul Alam Mahmud and Judge Md Mohitul Hoque Anam Chowdhury.Reading out the verdict, tribunal chairman Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder said that the evidence proved that police opened fire with lethal weapons on protesters.“The police forces… opened fire with lethal weapons… causing death to the aforesaid six persons,” the judge told the court.The tribunal heard that Habibur Rahman sent messages to police units ordering them to use lethal force to crush the protests.Chief Prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam said that he was satisfied with the death sentences but expressed disappointment over the prison terms handed to the other five accused, according to the Dailystar.“The court said their crimes have been proved and they committed crimes against humanity,” Islam told reporters, adding that he would appeal for harsher punishment for those given jail terms.Families of the victims, however, expressed dissatisfaction with the judgment. Sanjida Khan, the mother of slain protester Shahriar Khan Anas, broke down inside the courtroom.“We can never be satisfied with this verdict. We did not get Insaaf (justice),” she said, questioning the prosecution over the sentences.Similarly, Shahid Ahmed, uncle of another victim, Md Yakub, said the lighter sentences posed a threat.“We wanted death sentence for all. Instead, some of them got three to four years’ imprisonment. After completing their terms, they will come out and might threaten us,” he said.This is the second verdict delivered by the tribunal over crimes against humanity committed during the July uprising.In November last year, the same court sentenced Sheikh Hasina and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal to death in absentia in a separate case.Former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, who confessed and turned state witness, was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment in that case.The Chankharpul investigation report was submitted on April 21, 2025, the first filed before the reconstituted tribunal with formal charges framed on July 14.After examining 26 witnesses over 23 working days, the tribunal concluded that the police firing was carried out on direct orders from senior officials, warranting the maximum punishment.","The International Crimes Tribunal-1 handed the death penalty to former Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) commissioner Habibur Rahman, former joint commissioner Sudip Kumar Chakrabort and former additional deputy commissioner Shah Alam Mohammad Akhtarul Islam.

Awami League Escalates Bangladesh Crisis With ‘No Boat No Vote’ Boycott Call Against Yunus Polls





Bangladesh will hold Sheikh Hasina and her banned Awami League responsible for incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the Feb 12 Bangladesh parliamentary elections and on the election day, the Muhammad Yunus-led govt said Sunday, days after the former PM accused Yunus of pushing Bangladesh into an “era of terror, lawlessness and democratic exile”.The Bangladesh foreign ministry said it was “surprised and shocked” that Hasina, who has been convicted (and given death sentence) by the Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal for “crimes against humanity”, was allowed to make a statement at a public event in New Delhi last Friday.“Bangladesh is deeply aggrieved that while India is yet to act on its obligations to hand Hasina over to Bangladesh under the bilateral extradition agreement despite repeated requests, she has instead been allowed to make such inciteful pronouncements from its own soil,” the ministry said in a statement.In her first address — via audio message — to a gathering in Delhi since leaving Bangladesh in 2024, Hasina attacked Nobel laureate Yunus, accusing him of running an “illegal, violent” regime. She had said the political crisis in Bangladesh was an existential battle for the country’s sovereignty and constitution, and called on her supporters to rise up to “overthrow the foreign-serving puppet regime”.“She has openly called for the removal of the Govt of Bangladesh and issued blatant incitements to her party loyalists and general public to carry out acts of terror in order to derail the upcoming general elections in Bangladesh,” the statement said.“The unabashed incitements by Awami League’s leadership yet again demonstrated why the interim govt had to ban its activities,” it said.Bangladesh said it would hold this “outfit” responsible for committing incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the elections and on the election day, and will take appropriate actions to foil its evil conspiracies. It also said allowing the event to take place in the Indian capital and letting “mass murderer” Hasina to openly deliver her hate speech are contrary to the norms of inter-State relations.","Bangladesh will hold Sheikh Hasina and her banned Awami League responsible for incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the parliamentary elections and on the election day, the Muhammad Yunus-led govt said Sunday.

Christmas market attack: Suspect was 'Saudi atheist' with 'Islamophobic' views,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/germany-christmas-market-attack-suspect-was-saudi-atheist-held-islamophobic-views-/articleshow/116554779.cms,"Saudi physician suspected in Germany' scar ramming attack on Christmas market was an atheist who held strong anti-Islam views and was angry with Germany's migrant and asylum policy, officials said on Saturday.Various German news sources identified the suspect as Taleb al-Abdulmohsen who appeared in a number of media interviews in 2019 reporting on his activist work helping Saudi Arabians who had turned their back on Islam to flee to Europe.The suspect has resided in Germany for approximately 20 years, working as a doctor in Bernburg, situated about 40 kilometres from Magdeburg.In an interview in July 2019, Taleb spoke about founding the platform wearesaudis.net after he became an atheist and claimed asylum in Germany.He is a fierce critic of Islam in his past interviews, telling Germany's FAZ newspaper: ""There is no good Islam.""Interior minister Nancy Fraser said he held ""Islamophobic"" views. And a prosecutor said that ""the background to the crime... could have been disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany"".Taha Al-Hajji of the Berlin-based European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights told AFP Abdulmohsen was ""a psychologically disturbed person with an exaggerated sense of self-importance"".Meanwhile, the death toll in the attack in Germany's Magdeburg has risen to five people, and more than 200 have been seriously injured, as per Saxony-Anhalt's Governor Reiner Haseloff.Surveillance video footage of the attack showed a black BMW racing straight through the crowd, scattering bodies amid the festive stalls that were selling traditional handicrafts, snacks and mulled wine.""As things stand, he is a lone perpetrator, so that as far as we know there is no further danger to the city. Every human life that has fallen victim to this attack is a terrible tragedy and one human life too many,"" Saxony-Anhalt's governor Reiner Haseloff said.Germany has been hit by multiple deadly jihadist attacks, but evidence gathered by investigators and his past online posts painted a different picture of Abdulmohsen, a 50-year-old doctor of psychiatry.On Saturday, Chancellor Scholz and Interior Minister Nancy Faeser visited Magdeburg, with a memorial service scheduled at the city cathedral that evening. Faeser directed federal buildings nationwide to lower their flags to half-staff.","Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, 50, is suspected of driving a BMW into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, killing five and injuring more than 200.

Is Princess Kate preparing for the throne after a 'devastating year' ?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/is-princess-kate-preparing-for-the-throne-after-a-devastating-year-/articleshow/116542848.cms,"Prince William & Kate Middleton

Prince William and Princess Kate, along with their children kicked off their Christmas celebrations early this year at their Norfolk country home, Anmer Hall.The family skipped the traditional festive lunch at Buckingham Palace on Thursday, which King Charles and the extended royal family attended and opted for a quieter celebration after what a family friend described as “an incredibly difficult time.”Prince William called the past year “brutal,” as Kate’s battle with cancer kept her largely out of the public eye, sparking intense public speculation. The Princess of Wales, 42, recently completed chemotherapy, marking a significant step in her recovery, although friends say she is “not out of the woods yet.”“No one could have expected what this year has brought for the Prince and Princess of Wales,” said a family friend. “Family is so important to them, and the children are the center of their universe.”“They wanted to start celebrating early. They’re focused this Christmas [season] on being with the family at home and then joining the rest of the Windsor family on Christmas Day. The Prince of Wales has said this has been the hardest year of his life.”Royal historian Hugo Vickers highlighted the toll Kate’s illness has taken on the family, describing it as “absolutely devastating and very difficult.”The consequences of the past year are significant, especially as William and Kate live with the knowledge that, as the Prince and Princess of Wales, they are just a heartbeat away from the throne. This is especially poignant as the 76 year old King Charles is also undergoing treatment for cancer.Charles, who recently returned from a nine-day trip to Australia and Samoa with Queen Camilla, has had to pause his treatment at times to fulfil royal duties. Page Six quoted sources which reporting that King Charles was “exhausted” following the end of trip, “He looks quite knackered up close and red around the eyes and thinner.”“Especially for someone who normally looks so vigorous, but I suppose it’s only to be expected after 10 months of cancer treatment.The source further added that King’s health is moving in a positive direction and is said to return to a full program of public duties next year.Charles, in fact, joked that he was “still alive” as he gave high-fives during a final engagement before Christmas on Friday in north London with Camilla as per Page Six.For William, the year has been a deeply personal struggle. Reflecting on the challenges, he said, “Honestly, it’s been dreadful. It’s probably been the hardest year in my life,” adding, “But I’m so proud of my wife, I’m proud of my father, for handling the things that they have done. But from a personal family point of view, it’s been, yeah, it’s been brutal.”Kate, who has been on a “phased return” to royal duties, has made a few public appearances, including hosting the annual carol service, “Together at Christmas,” at Westminster Abbey earlier this month.The princess was also seen privately at Windsor with her children, attending school events and spending time outdoors at Home Park.Kate’s appearance in casual attire during a March video announcing her diagnosis offered a rare glimpse into her private life. “Those are the kinds of clothes you wear when going through something so personal,” said Bethan Holt, fashion director at The Telegraph.The casual outfit showed Kate as, “Who she really is as a person, away from all the royal fanfare and the pomp.”The family’s Christmas card, released on Thursday, also reflected this personal touch. The photograph, taken from a video announcing Kate’s completed treatment in September, showed the family casually dressed and smiling.Royal watchers note the symbolic importance of the family’s appearance during the annual Christmas walk to church at Sandringham. Kate’s choice of jewellery, including a pearl choker and diamond earrings previously worn by the late Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Diana, underscores her readiness to embrace her role as future queen.The Prince and Princess of Wales have also leaned on their extended family, inviting younger royals such as Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie, and Zara Tindall to co-host events like a garden party earlier this year. Sources suggest the couple may undertake a significant trip to the US in 2026 for the World Cup and the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.Despite the challenges, William and Kate are focused on moving forward. “There is no big reset button to go back to where they were before,” said a friend. “But they’ve shown resilience and authenticity, which resonates deeply with the public. The long game is ahead, and they are embracing it step by step.”","Prince William and Princess Kate kicked off their Christmas celebrations early this year at their Norfolk country home, Anmer Hall.

Condemnation and reactions from global leaders

A chilling and deadly attack on a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, has been linked to a 50-year-old Saudi doctor identified as Taleb al-Abdulmohsen. Authorities are investigating the incident as a suspected terror attack, with reports revealing a dark history of anti-Islam activism and right-wing extremist views behind the driver’s motive.Taleb A, a refugee from Saudi Arabia, was granted asylum in Germany in 2016, after fleeing his home country years earlier. He sought refuge from what he perceived as an oppressive Islamic government, reported Daily Mail.Upon settling in Bernburg, Germany, Taleb A worked as a psychiatrist and psychotherapist, living a relatively quiet life until his views began to take a more disturbing turn.According to The Guardian, Taleb became a prominent figure within the Saudi expatriate community in Germany, using his platform to express vehement opposition to Islam and advocate for women’s rights. His personal website and social media channels were heavily focused on critiquing what he believed was the dangerous tolerance of radical Islam by the German government.Previous media reports suggest he had worked to help ex-Muslims, particularly women, to flee Saudi Arabia after turning their backs on the religion.In one particularly inflammatory post, he warned potential refugees against coming to Germany, claiming that the country was too lenient toward Islam. Taleb A’s radical views extended to pro-Israel sentiments, which he posted following the deadly October 7th terror attack.Analysis of his social media reveals tweets in support of Germany's anti-immigration party AfD, while he has also made comments supporting Elon Musk, far-right activist Tommy Robinson, and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.Reports from the New York Post indicate that his online activity intensified days before the attack, with social media posts railing against the German government for promoting what he called the ""Islamization"" of Europe. He also claimed that authorities were suppressing his free speech due to his controversial opinions.The account's bio reads: 'Saudi Military Opposition. Germany chases female Saudi asylum seekers, inside and outside Germany, to destroy their lives. Germany wants to islamize Europe.'Posts include retweets of graphic videos, including one of a young Muslim woman purportedly being stoned to death 'because she had an affair with a young man outside of marriage.'Another was a retweet of a post that simply read: ""Can you find one positive thing about Islam?""In videos posted hours before the attack, he claimed that German authorities were opening his mail and stealing items including a USB stick.""I consider the Germans, as citizens, responsible for the persecution I am facing,"" he said in one video.""Currently in this country, the nation that is actively criminally chasing Islam critics is the German nation"", he said in another.He also appears to be a fan of AfD. In June, he retweeted party leader Alice Weidel, writing with typos: ""The left are crazy. We need the AfD to protect the police from them.""He also retweeted the right-wing extremist AfD activist Naomi Seibt with the following quote: ""Tyranny is based on the docility of cowards. I choose to be brave.""Reports from Saudi and UAE sources have further complicated the narrative, suggesting that Taleb A was a fugitive from Saudi Arabia, accused of treason. German officials had reportedly rejected extradition requests from Riyadh, citing human rights concerns.This refusal to extradite him has led to public outcry, with critics claiming that the act of granting asylum in exchange for future violence represents a devastating failure in European immigration policy.At least two people, including a young child, were killed and dozens more injured when Taleb A drove his black BMW at high speed through a Christmas market in Magdeburg, striking innocent bystanders in a harrowing rampage.The car was driven at least 400 meters (1,300 feet) through the Christmas market, as reported by Bild. Emergency services, including around 100 firefighters and 50 rescue personnel, were immediately dispatched to the scene.Shocked eyewitnesses described the scene as turning into ""war-like conditions,"" with people fleeing in all directions to avoid being struck by the vehicle. Videos from eyewitnesses showed the car speeding through the crowded market, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.As police raced to the scene, Taleb A was quickly apprehended, his arrest captured in distressing footage circulating online. A police officer is seen aiming a drawn weapon at the suspect, who lay motionless on the ground, near the wrecked vehicle. Shocked bystanders watched as authorities took him into custody.German authorities have said that they suspect the attack was a deliberate act. Authorities in Magdeburg, including spokespersons Matthias Schuppe and Michael Reif, indicated that they are working on piecing together the details of the event.The local police also confirmed that an explosive device was found in the vehicle, reported Daily Mail. Regional security measures have been tightened, and hospitals in nearby cities, including Halle, have been prepared for potential additional casualties.The attack, occurring just one day after the anniversary of the 2016 Berlin Christmas market attack — which claimed 12 lives — has sparked renewed fears of terrorist acts in Germany. The suspect’s background as an outspoken critic of Islam and his affiliation with right-wing causes have raised concerns over the possible political motives behind the attack.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed his concern in a post to social media, saying: ""The reports from Magdeburg suggest something bad. My thoughts are with the victims and their families."" Germany's Interior Minister also condemned the attack, offering thoughts for the victims while vowing that authorities would continue to investigate the background of the attack.Saudi Arabia, where the attacker was from, condemned the incident and expressed solidarity with Germany. The UK's Foreign Office has also expressed its concern, offering condolences to the victims and stating that they are closely monitoring the situation.","Taleb A, a refugee from Saudi Arabia, was granted asylum in Germany in 2016, after fleeing his home country years earlier.

US judge rules Israel's NSO Group liable for hacking WhatsApp using Pegasus spyware,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-judge-rules-israels-nso-group-liable-for-hacking-whatsapp-using-pegasus-spyware/articleshow/116552454.cms,"WhatsApp and NSO Group (Picture credit: Agencies)

The judgment

WhatsApp's reaction

NSO's defence

'Landmark ruling'

The lawsuit

A US judge ruled against Israel's NSO Group on Friday, holding it responsible for hacking WhatsApp and breaching its contract. The lawsuit accused NSO of exploiting a flaw in WhatsApp to install spyware called Pegasus. The case will now proceed to trial to determine the damages NSO must pay.WhatsApp filed the lawsuit in 2019, claiming the company accessed its servers without permission to install Pegasus on approximately 1,400 devices. These devices belonged to journalists, human rights activists, and others.In a summary judgment, US district judge Phyllis Hamilton in Oakland, California, held Israeli surveillance company NSO Group Technologies, also known as Q Cyber Technologies, responsible for hacking Meta's WhatsApp using its advanced military-grade spyware, Pegasus.The court found that NSO violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act by sending malicious messages through WhatsApp servers to compromise user devices. Additionally, it ruled that NSO breached its contract by violating WhatsApp's Terms of Service.The summary judgment dated December 20 states, as quoted by Live Law:""Thus, the Court grants summary judgment in plaintiffs' favour on the CFAA claim under both section (a)(2) and (a)(4), on theory that defendants exceeded their authorisation. Defendants appear to fully acknowledge that the WIS sent messages through WhatsApp servers that caused Pegasus to be installed on target users' devices and that the WIS was then able to obtain protected information by having it sent from the target users, through the WhatsApp servers, and back to the WIS... defendants argue that Pegasus was operated by their clients, and thus defendants did not collect any information. Defendants further argue that terms such as 'illegal,' 'unauthorised,' and 'harmful' as used in terms of service are vague and ambiguous. Finally, the defendants argue that plaintiffs waived those contractual provisions by failing to enforce them against any other users. The Court finds no merit in the arguments raised by the defendants.""""We spent five years presenting our case because we firmly believe that spyware companies could not hide behind immunity or avoid accountability for their unlawful actions,"" said Will Cathcart, head of WhatsApp. ""Surveillance companies should be on notice that illegal spying will not be tolerated,"" he added.A WhatsApp spokesperson expressed gratitude for the decision, stating, ""We’re proud to have stood up against NSO and thankful to the many organizations that were supportive of this case. WhatsApp will never stop working to protect people’s private communication.""NSO argued that its software is used by law enforcement and intelligence agencies to combat crime and terrorism.The company appealed a trial judge's 2020 decision denying it ""conduct-based immunity,"" a legal doctrine shielding foreign officials acting in their official capacity.In 2021, the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling, describing it as an ""easy case"" since NSO's licensing of Pegasus and provision of technical support did not exempt it from liability under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which overruled common law.The US Supreme Court declined to hear NSO's appeal last year, allowing the lawsuit to proceed.John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher with Citizen Lab, described the ruling as a landmark decision with ""huge implications for the spyware industry."" He stated, ""The entire industry has hidden behind the claim that whatever their customers do with their hacking tools, it's not their responsibility. Today's ruling makes it clear that NSO Group is in fact responsible for breaking numerous laws."" Citizen Lab was the first to expose NSO's Pegasus spyware in 2016.The case originated in 2019 when WhatsApp filed a lawsuit against NSO Group, accusing it of violating federal anti-hacking laws. The lawsuit alleged that NSO's flagship spyware, Pegasus, was used in a widespread attack targeting 1,400 individuals, including human rights advocates and journalists.","A US judge ruled against Israel's NSO Group on Friday, holding it responsible for hacking WhatsApp and breaching its contract.

It added that the claims were ""unfounded"" and warned that such allegations could damage the positive relationship that has existed between Pakistan and the US since 1954.The foreign office stressed that Pakistan has ""never had any ill-intention towards the US"" and that this reality remains unchanged. It further pointed out that Pakistan has made significant sacrifices for this relationship and continues to suffer the consequences of US policies in the region.It also expressed regret that the US official had seemingly equated Pakistan with adversarial nations, and addressed concerns over Pakistan’s missile capabilities, which it said were being raised ""at the behest of others"" to destabilise the already fragile strategic balance in the region. In a veiled reference to India’s missile programme, the statement highlighted the discrepancy in US concerns over Pakistan’s capabilities, which are intended solely for the defence of the country’s sovereignty and regional peace.The office reaffirmed Pakistan's right to develop its strategic capabilities to maintain credible minimum deterrence and respond to evolving threats. ""Pakistan will not tolerate any intrusion into its missile programme,"" the statement said, stressing that there is strong national consensus on this issue.Despite these concerns, Pakistan reiterated its willingness to engage constructively with the US on all matters, including security and regional stability, building on the longstanding history of cooperation between the two nations.","US Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer accused Pakistan of developing long-range ballistic missile capabilities.

"Luigi Mangione: After Luigi Mangione spectacle, Eric Adams' rival says he'd ban perp walk",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/after-luigi-mangione-spectacle-eric-adams-rival-says-hed-ban-perp-walk/articleshow/116547811.cms,"Luigi Mangione's perp walk raised several questions and also mayor Eric Adams' interest in creating the spectacle.

As New York mayor Eric Adams faces flak for ""orchestrating"" the pero walk of Luigi Mangione , his rival Jim Walden said if he's elected he would ban the practise in NYC as it serves no purpose. The mayor's office shut down the criticism and said people can tweet whatever they want but the mayor was present there showing support to the law enforcement.New York Democrat Ritchie Torres said the criminal justice system is not treating Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old accused killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, like other assassins. Case in point: the perp walk of Mangione after he reached New York. ""The dramatic perp walk of Luigi Mangione, accompanied by a heavily armed police presence, strikes me as law enforcement theater. Why the need for so much spectacle at so much taxpayer expense?"" the Democratic leader said.""The criminal justice system should treat Luigi Mangione as it would any assassin. Elevating Mangione to a mythical status only serves to deepen his delusions of grandeur,"" he added.Torres said what many social media users spoke about with shock as a huge number of police personnel were deployed when New York City received Luigi Mangione from Pennsylvania. Mayor Eric Adams was also present. Perp walk is to make an example out of a person who is led to the police station or a courthouse in full public display.But Luigi Mangione's perp walk drew shock as social media users questioned the need for it. Some observers pointed out that it was absolutely counter-productive as instead of making an example out of Luigi Mangione, they made him a hero as they paraded Luigi Mangione who was seen in a new shaven look.Eric Adams walked behind wearing a navy blue overcoat while it is not usual for mayors to oversee the handling of people in federal custody. Did Eric Adams stage the perop walk? Adams said in a television interview that aired on Friday that the shooting had traumatized people who work in the health care field and he wanted to show that he was “leading from the front.”“I wanted to look him in the eye and say you carried out this terroristic act in my city — the city that the people of New York love, and I wanted to be there to show the symbolism of that,” Adams said in a television interview with WPIX news.New York Times observed that the high-profile perp walk also provided an opportunity for Mr. Adams, a former police captain, to project an image of toughness on public safety and to change the subject after a difficult week for the politically weakened mayor.Some legal experts and elected officials said the choreographed scene and the mayor’s appearance at the perp walk was a blatant and unnecessary attempt at self-promotion.Jim Walden, a former prosecutor who is running for mayor against Adams, said that perp walks encourage police officers and mayors “to peacock” and he would ban the practice as mayor. “It undermines due process,” he said on social media. “It serves no purpose except tainting potential jurors.”Kayla Mamelak, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said in a statement on Friday that Mangione had “infused terror on the streets of New York City for days” and that his “coldblooded assassination” had been “sickeningly glorified, shining a spotlight on the darkest corners of the internet.”“Critics can tweet all they want, but showing up to support our law enforcement as they extradited a brutal killer and sending the message to New Yorkers that violence and vitriol have no place in our city is who Mayor Eric Adams is to his core,” she said.","New York Democrat Ritchie Torres said the criminal justice system is not treating Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old accused killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, like other assassins.

Party City, the once-thriving retail giant known for its party supplies, is closing its doors after nearly 40 years in business. CEO Barry Litwin announced during a video conference on Friday that the company is ""winding down"" operations immediately. Corporate employees were informed that the meeting marked their final day at work, according to""This is without question the most difficult message I’ve ever had to deliver,"" Litwin said during the emotional meeting. He explained that despite the company’s best efforts to address its financial woes, they were unable to overcome the challenges that ultimately led to this decision.Litwin assured employees that every possible measure had been taken to avoid shutting down, “It’s really important for you to know that we’ve done everything possible that we could to try to avoid this outcome.”""Unfortunately, it’s necessary to commence a wind-down process immediately,"" he added.Employees across Party City’s retail stores received a formal letter confirming that all locations would shut down by 28 February 2025, with all staff contracts terminated, as per the The Mirror US.The letter acknowledged the difficult decision, stating, “Although Party City believes these closings are in the best interest of the company, we regret that we have had to take this step and thank you for your valued contributions and service to the company.”He also shared about his decision on a LinkedIn post, ""main priority is to strengthen our financial health, and there is work ahead of us.""Litwin, who joined as CEO just four months ago, had previously expressed optimism about strengthening the company’s financial health. However, the New Jersey-based retailer, which exited bankruptcy in January 2023, struggled to manage its remaining $800 million debt.In 2022, the company had already closed 80 stores as part of its restructuring, which saw $1 billion of its $1.8 billion debt wiped out. Despite these efforts, Party City’s financial troubles proved insurmountable.A former corporate employee revealed that staff had been caught off guard by the closure. The product development team was abruptly recalled from an annual trip two weeks prior, and all corporate employees were sent home on 10 December when office doors were locked without warning.With this announcement, thousands of Party City workers are now facing unemployment, marking a grim end to what was once a celebrated retail success story.","Party City, the once-thriving retail giant known for its party supplies, is closing its doors.

Who is Yaoning ""Mike"" Sun?



Yaoning Sun is a Chinese national residing in Chino Hills , California, and has been charged with acting as an unregistered foreign agent.

, which is registered under the ownership of the unnamed councilperson in California. The outlet appears to have been used as a vehicle to support pro-China narratives and to bolster the political status of elected officials in the United States and China.



Sun served as the campaign manager for an unnamed city council candidate who was elected to office in Southern California in 2022.



Records suggest Sun had close ties to the politician, funding some of their travel expenses and collaborating on political strategy. His role extended beyond campaign management, allegedly working to elevate the councilperson’s status with Chinese officials and facilitate their interactions with Beijing’s diplomats.



Prosecutors allege that Sun conspired with Chen Jun to interfere in US elections. Sun is accused of writing a report for Chinese officials recounting his role in the councilperson's election, describing them as a ""new political star"" and seeking additional funding for pro-Beijing activities in the US.



He also allegedly worked to set up meetings between the councilperson and high-ranking Chinese diplomats in Los Angeles.



US Attorney Martin Estrada noted that Sun appeared to be ideologically committed to furthering the Chinese government’s goals in America. Sun previously served in the Chinese military, which underscores his longstanding ties to China.



noted that Sun appeared to be ideologically committed to furthering the Chinese government’s goals in America. Sun previously served in the Chinese military, which underscores his longstanding ties to China. Sun faces charges of acting as an illegal agent of a foreign government and conspiracy to commit an offence against the United States. If convicted, he could face up to 15 years in federal prison.

The arrest of Yaoning ""Mike"" Sun, a 64-year-old Chinese national, has intensified concerns about Beijing’s alleged interference in US politics. Sun was apprehended on Thursday on charges of acting as an illegal agent for the Chinese government and conspiring to influence a local election in Southern California to advance China’s foreign policy interests.Authorities allege Sun collaborated with Chinese officials to support a politician sympathetic to Beijing’s agenda. The arrest comes amid growing concerns over China's alleged efforts to influence local US elections by backing candidates supportive of Beijing’s interests. Prosecutors claim Sun conspired with Chen Jun , a fellow Chinese national who was sentenced last month to 20 months in prison for acting as an illegal agent of the Chinese government.Chen, 71, previously pleaded guilty to bribing federal agents to target the anti-Beijing group Falun Gong. Court documents reveal that Chen also collaborated with Sun to meddle in local elections.The case is part of a broader trend of scrutiny toward Beijing's efforts to influence US governance through local channels, including covert operations and influence campaigns targeting local and state politicians.Sun's arrest follows the conviction of Chen Jun, another Chinese national, who was sentenced to 20 months in prison for acting as an illegal agent of the Chinese government. Authorities have highlighted the involvement of both men in promoting pro-Beijing agendas and influencing elected officials, particularly on sensitive topics like Taiwan.","Yaoning Sun is a Chinese national residing in Chino Hills, California, and has been charged with acting as an unregistered foreign agent.

Biden napped as military families waited for bodies; White House says 'never happened',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-napped-as-military-families-waited-for-bodies-white-house-says-never-happened/articleshow/116544910.cms,"US President Joe Biden has been facing severe backlash from the grieving families of US Marines killed in the Kabul bombing. The families allege that they were kept waiting for hours while the President took a nap on Air Force One.On 26 August, 13 American soldiers and more than 170 Afghans were killed in a devastating attack at Kabul's Abbey Gate during the chaotic final days of the American pullout from Afghanistan.The families were waiting for the ""dignified transfer"" ceremony at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, where President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden were expected to receive the caskets of the fallen soldiers. However, relatives allege that they were forced to wait for an additional three hours before the bodies of their loved ones were returned.They also claim that during the whole time, President Biden was asleep on the plane instead of greeting them as per the New York Post.Roice McCollum, whose brother Rylee was killed in the bombing, said that Biden’s decision to nap was an insult to the memory of their fallen family members and that a military officer informed her of the President’s rest.“Made us wait an extra three hours to receive the bodies of our dead family members because he couldn’t pull it together,” McCollum told the Daily Mail.This account was confirmed by other families, including Darin Hoover, the father of staff sergeant Taylor Hoover, and Christy Shamblin, the mother-in-law of Marine sergeant Nicole Gee. Both soldiers were among those killed in the Kabul attack.Hoover expressed his frustration, saying, “We sat in that office for what seemed like an eternity waiting on the doddering old fool.”The widely criticised US withdrawal from Afghanistan, which marked a low point in Biden’s presidency, had already sparked anger among military families, particularly after footage emerged showing the President checking his watch during the dignified transfer ceremony at Dover.Despite the backlash, White House allies and a spokesperson have denied the claims, insisting that the reports of Biden’s nap were untrue and never happened.“That claim is untrue. As President Biden said on the 4th anniversary of the tragic attack on Abbey Gate and in the letters he wrote to family members after meeting with them in Dover, ‘these 13 Americans — and the many more that were wounded — were patriots in the highest sense’ and ‘we owe them and their families a sacred debt we will never be able to fully repay, but will never cease working to fulfill,” a White House spokesman stated.However, for the families of the fallen, the incident has added to their grief, leaving many feeling their loved ones' sacrifice was not properly honoured.",Families of US Marines killed in the Kabul bombing allege that they were kept waiting for hours while the President took a nap on Air Force One. 13 American soldiers and more than 170 Afghans were killed in a devastating attack at Kabul's Abbey Gate during the chaotic final days of the American pullout from Afghanistan.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116545041,imgsize-139026,width-400,resizemode-4/116545041.jpg"

She claims this campaign has harmed her business and caused her family ""severe emotional distress.""It Ends With Us, a domestic violence drama based on Colleen Hoover's bestselling novel, was released in theatres this year. At the time, rumours of a rift between Lively and Baldoni spread, with both declining to appear together for the film's promotional events.Lively also faced a wave of bad publicity, including being dubbed a ""mean girl"" after a journalist claimed an uncomfortable interview with her led to her quitting her job as per the New York Post.Baldoni’s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, has vehemently denied Lively’s allegations, telling TMZ that the lawsuit was an attempt to ""fix her negative reputation."" He labelled the claims ""false, outrageous, and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt,"" and accused Lively of being a ""nightmare"" on set.However, Lively’s lawsuit paints a different picture, alleging that Baldoni's actions created an untenable working environment during filming. She claims that things got so bad that an ""all-hands-on-deck meeting"" was called to address what she describes as a hostile work environment.Her husband, Ryan Reynolds, attended this tense meeting, where Lively and Reynolds made several demands. These included no more showing nude videos or images of women to Lively, no further mention of Baldoni’s alleged previous ""pornography addiction,"" and no more discussions about sexual conquests in her presence.They also insisted that Baldoni should not make any inquiries about Lively’s weight or mention her late father.Lively also demanded that no more sex scenes, oral sex, or on-camera climaxing are to be added beyond the scope of the script she had initially approved. As per the lawsuit, these demands were approved by Sony, the studio behind the film.Lively and Baldoni later clashed over how the movie should be marketed. Lively wanted a more positive pitch highlighting her character's resilience, whereas Baldoni pushed for a focus on domestic violence.Lively claims that Baldoni and his allies engaged in a ""social manipulation"" campaign to ""destroy"" her reputation. As evidence, she includes texts from Baldoni’s publicist to a studio publicist, in which it was stated that the actor ""wants to feel like [Ms. Lively] can be buried.""Ironically, the rumours surrounding the Lively and Baldoni feud only fueled interest in the film, which opened in the US in August. The tension between them helped garner publicity, contributing to the film’s success. It went on to gross more than $350 million worldwide, making it a box-office smash.","Blake Lively has filed a lawsuit against her co-star Justin Baldoni.

"1,566 terror attacks killed 924 in Pakistan over past 10 months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/1566-terror-attacks-killed-924-in-pakistan-over-past-10-months/articleshow/116551393.cms,"KARACHI: Ten years have passed since Ajoon Khan's son died in a ghastly attack by the Pakistani Taliban that killed about 150 people, mostly children, at a military-run school in Peshawar, in northwestern Pakistan. But the pain of loss is unrelenting - it grows only deeper with time. Khan, a lawyer, said he could never forget the parents sobbing and pleading outside the school gates.The brutal assault on the school in Peshawar led to rare political unity in support of a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy for Pakistan and a vast military operation in the country's former tribal areas near Afghanistan. The efforts forced militants to retreat across the border and brought a degree of relative peace to Pakistan. Large-scale terrorist attacks were significantly reduced, with fatalities dropping from 2,451 across 1,717 attacks in 2013 to 220 in 146 attacks in 2020. But the hard-won gains are now in jeopardy.Over the past few years, violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan. Experts attribute the increase to the Afghan Taliban's seizure of power in neighbouring Afghanistan in Aug 2021.Last week, the interior ministry reported that 924 people, including civilians and law enforcement personnel, had been killed in 1,566 terrorist attacks across the country over the past 10 months. It said 341 terrorists had been killed during the period.Early on Saturday, sixteen soldiers were killed in northwest Pakistan in an attack by Islamist militants, a senior police official in the South Waziristan region said. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack, giving a higher figure for the number of personnel killed, Reuters reported.Experts and security officials have identified a range of challenges impeding Pakistan's progress against terrorism: political instability, weak governance, dwindling public support, economic constraints and reduced US counterterrorism assistance after the end of the 20-year war in Afghanistan.""The greatest challenge lies in mobilising the necessary financial resources and manpower for operations across such vast regions,"" said Muhammad Amir Rana, director of the Pak Institute for Peace Studies, a security think tank in Islamabad. The source of the problem for Pakistan, experts say, is found across the border, in Afghanistan.The Taliban administration in Kabul, the Afghan capital, denies accusations of harbouring militants from TTP. But Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace, said the TTP had been given ""a permissive safe haven in Afghanistan,"" which had allowed it to become ""resilient and lethal.""Pakistani security officials privately acknowledged that they had misjudged how the new Taliban rulers of Afghanistan would handle TTP. The officials had anticipated that the Taliban leaders would help curb the TTP in return for the covert support that Pakistan had provided them during the US-led war. Instead, the Taliban in Kabul have provided the TTP with resources and advanced American-made weapons and equipment seized after the collapse of the US-supported Afghan govt, according to a senior security official in Islamabad who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The TTP has gone on to unleash a wave of attacks inside Pakistan as it wages a campaign whose aim is to overthrow the govt. Among them was a suicide bombing in January 2023 that killed over 100 people at a mosque in Peshawar.Pakistani security forces have also been locked in a conflict with ethnic separatist groups in Balochistan, an arid province bordering Afghanistan and Iran that is home to the Chinese-run port Gwadar. nyt","Violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan.

Pakistan’s military announced Saturday that 25 civilians have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their alleged involvement in violent protests following the arrest of former PM Imran Khan on May 9 last year, which resulted in the death of at least eight people.Khan’s supporters stormed govt buildings and military installations. The military’s statement detailed that the convictions relate primarily to attacks on key military sites, including Jinnah House (the Lahore corps commander’s residence), General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, and a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) base in Mianwali.The sentences were issued by Field General Court Martial as part of the first phase of trials. Supreme Court had earlier conditionally allowed military courts to pronounce verdicts for 85 civilians detained in connection with the riots.The military statement highlighted that the convicts have the right to appeal and other legal recourses as guaranteed by law.The May 9 violence led to the arrest of many politicians and supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party. PTI has denied involvement in the violence. However, govt and military maintain that the attacks were meticulously planned and executed by PTI brass.Khan and his party have called for a judicial probe into the May 9 events, claiming the violence was a “false flag” operation intended to suppress PTI.PTI condemned the military court’s decision. National Assembly leader of opposition Omar Ayub wrote on X: “Military court sentences against civilians rejected. The detainees are civilians and cannot be tried by military courts.” He labelled the process as “kangaroo courts”.PTI’s US chapter criticised the rulings. “Colonels and majors, acting as judges, have sentenced civilians it tried in military courts. These civilians were held for over a year in harsh conditions, with many tortured into giving false confessions,” it posted on X.Amnesty International also denounced the military court’s decision, describing it as “an intimidation tactic, designed to crack down on dissent”.Army’s media wing Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) referred to the protests as “politically provoked violence and arson”. ISPR said further sentences for the remaining accused will be announced once the legal process is completed.",25 civilians have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years.

This activism has come at great personal cost, including harassment, persecution, and numerous terrorism charges.""Mahrang Baloch shared the painful story of her father's forced disappearance in 2009 and his subsequent killing in 2011, events that deeply influenced her activism, The Balochistan Post reported. She claimed that Pakistani intelligence agencies abducted her father and later killed him. In 2017, her brother was also taken. At that moment, she vowed to speak out and ensure that other girls like her would not suffer silently. She further added that her brother was eventually released.She further stated that her activism has increased restrictions on her freedom. After attending the World Expression Forum (WEXFO) and PEN Norway in May 2024, where she was a speaker, she became the target of what she referred to as a ""coordinated propaganda campaign.""After returning to Pakistan, Mahrang Baloch encountered further obstacles, including being added to a no-fly list in October. She recounted an incident on October 7 when she was prevented from boarding a flight to New York, where she was scheduled to attend a Time Magazine event, The Balochistan Post reported.She also revealed that her name was added to the Exit Control List (ECL) and later to the Fourth Schedule, a local anti-terror watchlist. She explained that this designation imposes strict restrictions, such as freezing bank accounts, blocking financial support, and prohibiting employment clearances. She also mentioned that her brother had also been placed on the Fourth Schedule.Despite facing these difficulties, Mahrang Baloch reiterated her steadfast commitment to her activism. Acknowledging the serious risks to her safety, she emphasized her resolve. ""The threats to my life are real, but our fight is for the basic right to live peacefully,"" she said.

Sixteen Pakistani soldiers were killed and five critically injured on Saturday after militants attacked an army post near the Afghan border.The attack happened overnight in the Makeen area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, roughly 40 kms (24 miles) from the border.More than 30 militants assaulted the post, according to two intelligence officials who spoke to AFP (anonymously). The attack lasted two hours. “The militants set fire to the wireless communication equipment, documents and other items present at the checkpoint,” one official said. The militants then retreated.The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility, stating the attack was “in retaliation for the martyrdom of our senior commanders.”The militants reported getting hold of significant military equipment, including machine guns and night vision technology.Meanwhile, in connection to another attack on Pakistan military in May last year, 25 people have been sentenced to periods of two to 10 years of ""rigorous imprisonment"", the military's media wing announced on Saturday.

Driving the news

Speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, US deputy national security adviser Jon Finer described Pakistan’s missile advancements as a troubling shift in the country’s strategic posture.

described Pakistan’s missile advancements as a troubling shift in the country’s strategic posture. “Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology, from long-range ballistic missile systems to equipment that would enable the testing of significantly larger rocket motors,” Finer said.

“If these trends continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.”

This revelation comes on the heels of Washington imposing a fresh wave of sanctions on Pakistan’s missile program. For the first time, the measures target Pakistan’s state-run National Development Complex, alongside three private Karachi-based companies accused of supporting missile development.

Why it matters

Finer’s revelation marks a stark turning point in US-Pakistan relations, underscoring a broader erosion of trust since the 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Historically viewed as a key partner in counterterrorism, Pakistan’s ballistic missile advancements are now seen as a direct challenge to US security.

The move also raises critical questions about whether Pakistan’s missile program, long designed as a counter to India, is shifting toward broader ambitions with potentially global consequences.

Two senior US officials, speaking anonymously, revealed that Washington has repeatedly pressed Islamabad to explain the development of more powerful rocket engines but received evasive responses. “They don’t acknowledge our concerns. They tell us we are biased,” said one official.

This development places Pakistan alongside nations like Russia, North Korea, and China—states identified by the US as adversaries with nuclear weapons and missile systems capable of reaching American soil.

The strain in US-Pakistan relations reflects a broader geopolitical realignment in South Asia. Pakistan continues to cultivate strong ties with China while voicing concerns about US defense cooperation with India, including technology transfers and joint missile projects.

Zoom in: Eroding US-Pakistan ties

The tensions over Pakistan’s missile program reflect a larger deterioration in the once-robust US-Pakistan partnership.

Historical context: Pakistan was a key ally during the Cold War and a central partner in the US-led war on terror, particularly after the 9/11 attacks. However, relations have soured over the years due to Pakistan’s alleged support for Taliban factions and its increasingly close ties with China.

India factor: The US-India defense relationship has grown stronger in recent years, underpinned by agreements like the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) and the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA). Washington has facilitated India’s acquisition of advanced missile systems, which has drawn criticism from Islamabad for allegedly undermining regional stability.

What it means for India

India’s strategic reassessment:

Proxy conflicts:

Strengthening India-US ties

What’s next

The US administration is expected to maintain pressure on Pakistan through diplomatic channels and additional sanctions, while continuing to bolster ties with India.

The US appears to view Pakistan’s missile development as a broader shift in its strategic posture. Finer emphasized that Pakistan’s actions raise “real questions” about its intentions, particularly given its long-standing partnership with the US in security and counterterrorism.

Washington is also likely to encourage other countries to scrutinize Pakistan’s missile program as part of broader non-proliferation efforts.

Pakistan, however, is expected to deepen its reliance on China, which has historically supported its missile program and nuclear ambitions.

The United States has expressed alarm over Pakistan’s ongoing development of long-range ballistic missiles, a move Washington sees as an emerging security threat.Meanwhile, Washington’s public condemnation of Pakistan’s missile program could fuel further regional instability.The US State Department sanctioned Pakistan’s NDC for its involvement in developing long-range missile systems. This marks the first time a Pakistani state-owned enterprise has faced direct sanctions tied to missile production. Three Karachi-based companies—Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, Affiliates International, and Rockside Enterprise—were also sanctioned for supporting the program.Islamabad has dismissed the US sanctions as “discriminatory” and warned that such actions could upset the region’s strategic balance. Its Foreign Office defended the missile program as “defensive in nature,” aimed solely at countering Indian aggression and preserving peace in South Asia.Pakistani officials argue that their missile program is not intended to target the US. Diplomatic sources in Islamabad insist the program is designed to counter perceived threats from India, with whom Pakistan has fought three wars since 1947, a Reuters report said.In a strongly worded statement, the Pakistani Foreign Office accused the US of “double standards.” It criticized Washington for imposing sanctions on Pakistani entities while granting India waivers for advanced military technology. “Such policies have dangerous implications for the strategic stability of our region and beyond,” the statement read.Pakistan's development of long-range missiles may prompt India to fast-track its missile initiatives, particularly the Agni series, and enhance its Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) systems.Pakistan’s expanded missile range could push India to reevaluate its nuclear policies, potentially reconsidering its no-first-use stance or enhancing second-strike capabilities.Pakistan’s growing confidence, potentially bolstered by Chinese support, might lead to more aggressive postures, including cross-border skirmishes.The growing political instability in Pakistan increases the risk of its nuclear assets falling into the hands of radical groups, posing a significant threat to India and the world.: Pakistan's missile advancements could lead to closer India-US defense cooperation, including technology transfers and intelligence sharing.(With inputs from agencies)","US deputy national security adviser Jon Finer described Pakistan's missile advancements as a troubling shift in the country's strategic posture.

Pakistan developing missiles that could eventually hit US: Official,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-developing-missiles-that-could-eventually-hit-us-official/articleshow/116486852.cms,"White House flags Pakistan's missile advances

A senior White House official on Thursday said that Pakistan's development of sophisticated missile technology, including long range ballistic missiles , represents an emerging threat to the United States.The statement comes in the wake of sanctions imposed on four Pakistani entities, including the state-owned national development complex (NDC), for their role in advancing Pakistan's missile program.Principal deputy national security advisor Jon Finer, speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on Thursday, outlined the Biden administration’s growing concerns over Pakistan's missile development activities.“Simply put, we are going to keep the pressure on Pakistan regarding its long-range missile program, even as we also continue to seek diplomatic resolutions to address our concerns,” Finer said.The sanctions announced Wednesday target the NDC, based in Islamabad, which oversees Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, as well as three Karachi-based entities: Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, Affiliates International, and Rockside Enterprise.These entities were identified as contributors to the program, prompting what Finer called “necessary measures to curb these advancements.”Finer pointed out the significance of the sanctions. “This is the first time we have sanctioned a Pakistani state-owned enterprise tied to missile development,” he said.According to Finer, Pakistan’s recent advancements include the development of long-range ballistic missile systems and technologies that enable testing of larger rocket motors. “If these trend lines continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States, raising real questions about Pakistan's intentions,” he added.The official pointed out that only a small group of nations—Russia, North Korea, and China—possess nuclear weapons and missile capabilities capable of directly reaching the US, making Pakistan's actions particularly concerning. “It is hard for us to see Pakistan's actions as anything other than an emerging threat to the United States,” Finer said.Despite longstanding ties between the US and Pakistan in areas such as counter-terrorism and development, Finer expressed frustration over Islamabad's apparent disregard for American concerns. “We have provided support to Islamabad during difficult times and continue to desire a cooperative relationship in areas of shared interest,” he said. “That makes us question even more why Pakistan would be motivated to develop a capability that could be used against us.”The Biden administration has already implemented three rounds of sanctions over the past year targeting non-Pakistani entities supporting Pakistan’s ballistic missile program.Finer stressed that the US would not tolerate the continued development of capabilities perceived as a direct threat. “The United States cannot, will not simply sit back and watch the development of this capability that we believe could pose a threat ultimately down the road,” he stated.“This is of such great concern because it raises fundamental questions about Pakistan's intentions, and we are determined to ensure our security and that of our allies,” he added further.","White House official: Pakistan's development of missile technology represents an emerging threat to the United States.

Pakistan criticised the US Thursday for imposing more sanctions on its missile programme, saying it reflected Washington’s double standards and discriminatory practices.The response came hours after the US announced the additional sanctions on four entities in Pakistan, claiming they were contributing to proliferation and delivery systems of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).The US State Department identified the firms as Islamabad-based National Development Complex (NDC) and three companies in the southern port city of Karachi: Affiliates International, Akhtar and Sons Private Ltd, and Rockside Enterprise.State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the measures were imposed under an executive order that “targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.” “The US will continue to act against proliferation and associated procurement activities of concern,” Miller said.In its reaction, Pakistan’s foreign ministry termed the decision “unfortunate and biased”, insisting that its strategic capabilities were meant to defend its sovereignty and preserve peace and stability in South Asia. According to the ministry, the sanctions defied the “objective of peace and security by aiming to accentuate military asymmetries,” an apparent reference to Pakistan’s rivalry with nuclear-armed India. “Such policies have dangerous implications for the strategic stability of our region and beyond,” the ministry said.The US had also imposed sanctions on Pakistani firms and a Chinese research institute in the past over alleged support and involvement in proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. “Similar listings of commercial entities in the past were based on mere doubts and suspicion without any evidence whatsoever. While claiming strict adherence to non-proliferation norms, licensing requirements for advanced military technology to other countries have been waived off in the past,” the ministry said.“Such double standards and discriminatory practices not only undermine the credibility of non-proliferation regimes but also endanger regional and international peace and security,” it added.According to the State Department, Islamabad-based NDC had sought to obtain components for the country’s long-range ballistic-missile program and missile-testing equipment. It said the NDC “is responsible for the development of Pakistan’s ballistic missiles,” including the Shaheen family of missiles.The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a media outlet aimed to reduce man-made threats to human existence, said the Shaheen series of missiles is nuclear-capable. The Bulletin estimates Pakistan’s arsenal at about 170 warheads.In Sept this year, the US had imposed sanctions on a Chinese research institute and several companies involved in assisting Pakistan’s missile programme.

The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions within the time limit. The required conditions included revising the purchase power agreement in relation to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , according to The Express Tribune.The Washington-based international lender also declared that it would not be sanctioning any new budget supporting loans to the country during the current fiscal year which has sent a shock to the Pakistani economy as the country has almost exhausted its loan quota.""No budget support is planned for the current fiscal year, which ends in June 2025,"" the World Bank spokesperson stated.For this fiscal year, the IMF has identified a $2.5 billion external financing gap that needs to be addressed through new loans.The World Bank has canceled a loan of $500 to $600 million meant for Pakistan under the Affordable and Clean Energy Program (PACE-II), government sources revealed. Initially set at $500 million, the loan amount was later raised to $600 million to help address Pakistan's external financing gap, quoted news agency ANI.The PACE program was approved by the World Bank in June 2021, with the first tranche of USD 400 million already released. The second installment depended on meeting several conditions, such as holding talks with all Independent Power Producers (IPPs), especially the Chinese power plants built under CPEC. It was discovered that no progress had been made in renegotiating agreements with CPEC-related power plants as China has consistently refused to revisit these deals or restructure the energy debt, which amounts to approximately $16 billion.To reduce electricity costs, the government is renegotiating energy agreements with power plants set up under the 1994 and 2002 policies. The Chinese-owned power plants, along with several government-run plants, including four LNG-based and two nuclear plants, fall under the 2015 energy policy. Though the government has tried negotiating over 22 energy contracts yet, no significant reductions have been made in electricity prices which linger from 65 Pakistani Rupees (PKR) to 70 PKR.A spokesperson for the World Bank confirmed that ""slower-than-expected progress led to a shift in strategy in our support for reform"" in Pakistan's energy sector. The spokesperson further elaborated that the lender has been supporting power sector reforms through the PACE initiative.Even though slower progress led the World Bank to revise its lending strategy, the World Bank has continued its support by directly financing low-cost hydropower projects, including an additional $1 billion for the Dasu Hydropower project.Furthermore, the Bank has also continued working with all stakeholders to expedite the implementation of the Electricity Distribution Efficiency Improvement Project, aimed at improving efficiency in the power distribution sector. It has also offered technical assistance to promote private sector involvement in power distribution companies (DISCOs).For the ongoing fiscal year, Pakistan anticipated $2 billion in loans from the World Bank.However, by the end of the July-October period, only $349 million, 18 per cent of the planned amount, had been disbursed.Under the PACE-II program, Pakistan was expected to tackle inefficiencies in power distribution companies and reduce the growth of circular debt. However, the government has been unable to achieve either of these objectives. The government had approved a roadmap under PACE-I to encourage private sector involvement in the distribution sector, but it remained far from implementation.The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) recently reported that inefficiencies in power distribution companies led to losses of PKR 660 billion in the last fiscal year. During the same period, circular debt surged to PKR 2.393 trillion, far exceeding the targets set in agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.The successful implementation of this roadmap was essential for evaluating the progress of the power sector reform program, but it was not carried out.",The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions. The required conditions included revising the purchase power agreement in relation to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The Washington-based international lender also declared that it would not be sanctioning any new budget supporting loans to the country during the current fiscal year.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116317008,imgsize-20566,width-400,resizemode-4/116317008.jpg"

A rebel army in Myanmar announced the capture of a major military headquarters in the South Asian country's western Rakhine state , dealing a major blow to the ruling. The Arakan Army (AA), part of the anti-junta resistance movement, claimed that it seized the western military command on Friday after two weeks on intense fighting.""This marks a turning point in the conflict,"" the Arakan Army said in a statement late Friday night. Myanmar’s military government has not commented on the development.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military overthrew an elected civilian government in early 2021, sparking protests that escalated into a nationwide armed rebellion.The Arakan Army, a member of the Three Brotherhood Alliance , has been instrumental in the resistance. The alliance launched an offensive in October 2023, achieving several key victories, including the historic seizure of Lashio in August, the first time a regional military command has fallen to rebel forces.Rakhine, a coastal state bordering Bangladesh and the Bay of Bengal, is one of Myanmar’s most impoverished regions despite its offshore natural gas reserves and a proposed economic zone in Kyauk Pyu, which hosts pipelines carrying oil and gas to China.Fighting in Rakhine resumed last November after a ceasefire between the Arakan Army and the junta collapsed. Since then, the AA has made major territorial gains.However, some Rohingya activists accuse the group of targeting their community during its offensive in northern Rakhine, forcing tens of thousands to flee to Bangladesh.","Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military overthrew an elected civilian government in early 2021.

Bangladesh reduces ULFA leader's death sentence in weapons smuggling case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-reduces-ulfa-leaders-death-sentence-in-weapons-smuggling-case/articleshow/116442037.cms,"Representative image/Agencies

NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh high court on Wednesday reduced the death sentence of ULFA leader Paresh Baruah to life imprisonment in a 2004 case involving the attempted smuggling of weapons to the separatist United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA).The court also acquitted a former junior minister and five others. Baruah, reportedly residing in China, had been sentenced to death in absentia in 2014. His name appears on India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) ""most wanted"" list.In 2011, ULFA split into two factions. The pro-talk group, led by Arabinda Rajkhowa, chose to return to Assam from ""abroad"" and engage in peace negotiations. In contrast, the other faction, ULFA (Independent), led by commander Paresh Baruah, rejected the idea of negotiations.The case dates back to April 1, 2004, when authorities in Chattogram (then called Chittagong) seized ten truckloads of weapons from the premises of the Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Limited (CUFL) jetty. The consignment was reportedly intended to be transported through Bangladesh to ULFA hideouts across the border in India.The seized weapons included over 27,000 grenades, 150 rocket launchers, 1,100 submachine guns, 11.41 million bullets, and over 11 lakh rounds of ammunition.The high court bench of Justice Mostafa Zaman Islam and Justice Nasrin Akhtar commuted Baruah's death sentence to life imprisonment. The bench also acquitted Bangladesh's former state minister for home affairs Lutfuzzaman Babar and six others, who had earlier received capital punishment.The acquitted individuals include former DGFI (a defence intelligence agency of Bangladesh) director-general retired major general Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury, former managing director of Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Limited (CUFL) Mohsin Talukder, its general manager Enamul Hoque, former industries ministry additional secretary Nurul Amin, and Jamaat-e-Islami leader Motiur Rahman Nizami.The weapons were reportedly intended for ULFA and were being moved through a jetty managed by CUFL, a state-run fertilizer plant. Among those previously sentenced to death was Abdur Rahim, a former DGFI director and retired brigadier general, who passed away in prison before his appeal could be heard. Nizami, also a former minister, was executed several years ago for crimes against humanity committed during Bangladesh’s 1971 Liberation War.Babar’s lawyer, Shishir Manir, argued that Babar had been falsely implicated in the case for political reasons, and the prosecution failed to present credible evidence or reliable witnesses. Babar was also sentenced in a separate case involving a 2004 grenade attack targeting Sheikh Hasina, who was then the opposition leader. However, a high court bench acquitted him in that case earlier this month.The arms haul case remained dormant for years during the BNP-led government, where Jamaat-e-Islami was a coalition partner. Reports suggested that police officers involved in the seizure faced harassment, and efforts were made to suppress the investigation. The military-backed interim government in 2008 ordered a re-investigation amid these allegations. The extended probe revealed that officials from the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) and the National Security Intelligence (NSI) oversaw the arms shipment. Chinese firm NORINCO was identified as the manufacturer of the weapons, though investigators could not trace the ship that transported the consignment to Bangladesh.In 2014, a special tribunal in Chattogram convicted 14 people, including Baruah, Babar, and Nizami, sentencing them to death. The court ruled that the consignment was part of an elaborate plan to arm ULFA militants.",Bangladesh high court reduces death sentence of ULFA leader Paresh Baruah to life imprisonment.

Sri Lanka wins agreement with IMF for tax relief: President Dissanayake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sri-lanka-wins-agreement-with-imf-for-tax-relief-president-dissanayake/articleshow/116436701.cms,"COLOMBO: President Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Wednesday announced that Sri Lanka has achieved flexibility with the IMF on its rigid state revenue tax regime, something that was part of his election promise. Also, import of private cars -- banned from 2020 -- would be allowed from February 2025, Dissanayake, who is also the Minister of Finance, told the parliament.Speaking about the agreements reached with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during its third review of the USD 2.9 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF), the president said his government has been able to raise the tax threshold.""We have been able to raise the tax threshold of pay as you earn (PAYE tax) so that those who have bigger incomes pay more while those who earn pay less,"" Dissanayake said, adding there would be other VAT exemptions and withholding tax on interest incomes for the retired.""An income of Rs 1,50,000 per month will be tax free,"" Dissanayake said referring to the current free amount upto only Rs 1,00,000.Fresh from his return from an official visit to India, Dissanayake said the ban on vehicle imports would be gradually lifted.""From December 14, we have allowed the importation of the first category - vehicles for passenger transport and cars for special purposes.""From February 2025 all imports of private cars would be allowed.Sri Lanka had stopped vehicle imports from 2020 during the Covid19 outbreak due to the dwindling foreign reserves.With the economic recovery through the IMF bail out since 2023, the IMF had allowed vehicle imports by preventing any adverse impact on the need to build forex reserves.He said all such proposals would be incorporated in the 2025 budget to be presented in mid-February.There will be concessions to improve the small and medium scale industries for whom there will be debt restructuring relief based on a cap of the loan amounts.Dissanayake's government has just concluded its third review of the IMF bail out and is awaiting the fourth tranche of the nearly USD 3 billion facility.Sri Lanka had on November 26 announced that it has ratified the agreement for debt restructuring for USD 14.2 billion, compulsory to maintain debt sustainability by the IMF through an exchange of new bonds for the existing bonds.A week prior to it, the National People's Power (NPP) government got the IMF approval for a staff-level agreement to secure the fourth tranche of the nearly USD 3 billion bailout package, something that President Dissanayake backed despite his pre-presidential election rhetoric to renegotiate with the global lender to water down tough conditions.The NPP was highly critical of the cost recovery based utility tariffs and high taxes, which came conditional to the bail out.The debt restructuring agreement was reached in the last week of the then President Ranil Wickremesinghe's regime in September, days before the presidential polls.He highlighted that the exchange would provide substantial debt relief, free resources for development and ensure long-term fiscal stability.Sri Lanka had plunged into an economic crisis when the island nation declared sovereign default in mid-April of 2022, its first since gaining independence from Britain in 1948. Almost civil-war-like conditions and months of public protests led to the fleeing of the then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa.Wickremesinghe took over and the negotiations with the IMF began soon after. His government then clinched the bailout a year later in March 2023.As of July 2024, Sri Lanka's external debt stood at a total of USD 37 billion, which includes USD 10.6 billion in bilateral credit and USD 11.7 billion in multilateral credit. The commercial debt was USD 14.7 billion, of which USD 12.5 billion is in sovereign bonds.","Sri Lanka has achieved flexibility with the IMF on its rigid state revenue tax regime.

A total of 10 truckloads of weapons were seized in April 2004 despite alleged efforts of certain ""influential quarters"" for its safe passage to United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) hideouts in northeastern India through Chattogram, which was then spelled as 'Chittagong'.The seized weapons included over 27,000 grenades, 150 rocket launchers, over 11 lakh ammunition, 1,100 sub machine guns and 11.41 million bullets.The two-member High Court bench commuted the punishment of ULFA leader Paresh Barua, who was sentenced to death after a trial in absentia --- now assumed to be living in China --- and sentenced him to life imprisonment, said a government attorney at the bench.The High Court bench comprising Justice Mostafa Zaman Islam and Justice Nasrin Akhtar acquitted former state minister for home Lutfuzzaman Babar and six others, who were handed down capital punishment following the death reference hearing, he added.The five others to escape the gallows are former director general of forces Intelligence (DGFI) retired major general Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury, former managing director of a state-run fertilizer plant (CUFL) Mohsin Talukder, its general manager Enamul Hoque, former additional secretary of industries ministry Nurul Amin and Jamaat-e-Islami leader Motiur Rahman Nizami.The plant site was said to have been used for trans-shipment of weapons for ULFA.Former chief of Bangladesh 's National Security Intelligence ex-brigadier general Abdur Rahim, a former DGFI director as well, was also sentenced to death but he died a normal death in prison as the appeal and death hearing process was underway.Nizami, a former minister in the past Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-Jamaat alliance government, however, was hanged several years ago on charges of crimes against humanity during Bangladesh's 1971 Liberation War siding with the Pakistani troops while his party was opposed to the country's independence.Babar's lawyer Shishir Manir earlier told the bench that his client had been falsely implicated in the case for political reasons and the prosecution could not produce any credible evidence or trustworthy witness in support of the charges brought against him.The former junior minister was also sentenced over a 2004 grenade attack on the now deposed prime minister and the then opposition leader Sheikh Hasina and her top party leaders when 24 people were killed and hundreds wounded but another High Court bench acquitted him after death reference hearing on December 1.Earlier on January 30, 2014, a special tribunal in the northeastern port city of Chattogram handed down the death penalty to 14 people, including two former ministers of the past BNP government, two ex-army generals and a top ULFA leader in the arms haul case.The trial or lower court verdict had come nearly a decade after the accidental seizure of 10 truck loads of smuggled-in weapons destined to the ULFA hideouts in northeastern India through Bangladesh territory.The two politicians to get the capital punishment were Babar and Nizami, the former Jamaat ameer and then industries minister in the same cabinet, while ULFA's fugitive military wing chief Barua was one of the convicts to be awarded the death penalty.But the case was shelved for years during the past BNP-led four-party government with Jamaat being the key-ally while police officers who seized the weapons were allegedly exposed to professional harassment.The subsequent military-backed interim regime in 2008 ordered the re-investigation amid allegations that there was a deliberate attempt on the part of the then administration to suppress facts to weaken the case.The supplementary chargesheet said the weapons were brought for ULFA under the supervision of some DGFI and NSI officials while the consignment was unloaded at a government jetty in Chittagong to be reloaded in trucks destined for northeastern frontiers.Officials familiar with the investigation said their extended probe found Chinese firm NORINCO to have produced the weapons but they could not identify the ship that carried the illegal consignment to Bangladesh territory.","A Bangladeshi High Court on Wednesday commuted the death sentence of ULFA leader Paresh Barua to life imprisonment.

DHAKA: The Bangladesh HC scrapped on Tuesday a section of 15th Amendment Act of the Constitution, which had abolished the non-party caretaker govt system, even as it clarified that current Yunus-led interim govt does not fall in this category, reports Ahsan Tasnim. The HC also reinstated the provision for holding referendums on constitutional amendments.Giving Yunus's interim govt legal validity, the HC said it is ""totally different"" as it was formed by the president after he sought the opinion of the appellate division of the Supreme Court.The Bangladesh high court scrapped on Tuesday a section of the 15th Amendment Act of the constitution, which had abolished the non-party caretaker govt system, even as it clarified that the current Yunus-led interim govt does not fall in this category.Also, in a significant step, the court revived the provision of holding referendums in case of bringing any amendment to the constitution.Giving Yunus's interim govt legal validity, the HC said it is ""totally different"" as it was formed by the president after he sought the opinion of the appellate division of the Supreme Court under Article 106 of Bangladesh's constitution. Article 106 says: ""If at any time it appears to the President that a question of law has arisen, or is likely to arise, which is of such a nature and of such public importance that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of the Supreme Court upon it, he may refer the question to the appellate division for consideration and the division may, after such hearing as it thinks fit, report its opinion thereon to the President.""The HC ruled that abolishing the non-party caretaker govt system was unconstitutional and void as it undermined democracy, free and fair elections, and judicial independence - fundamental pillars of the constitution's basic structure. The court remarked that restoration of the caretaker govt system will pave the way for holding elections under a non-partisan govt.Tuesday's verdict scrapped the parts of the 15th Amendment Act, which scrapped the 13th amendment that had introduced the non-party caretaker govt system in 1996, and brought significant changes to the charter. The court, however, did not interfere with the provisions of the 15th Amendment Act that deal with state principles, including secularism, socialism, state region, nationalism, Father of the Nation, and number of reserved seats for women in parliament, saying that future govts will take decisions on these issues.BNP said the restoration of the caretaker govt system fulfilled people's expectations. The party alleged Hasina had scrapped the system to serve her party's interests, paving the way for ""one-party rule"".","Bangladesh HC scrapped section of 15th Amendment Act of the Constitution.

'I was honest with him': Josh Shapiro recalls meeting Joe Biden; delivered 'bad news' to then-president,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/it-wasnt-going-well-josh-shapiro-recalls-meeting-joe-biden-delivering-bad-news/articleshow/124650910.cms,"Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro (File photo/AP)





Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro has recalled how he once tried to deliver “bad news” to then-President and fellow Democrat Joe Biden ahead of last year’s election — well before Biden decided not to seek a second term.“I went directly to the president and spoke to him about what I saw were his challenges in Pennsylvania. I was really honest with him,” Shapiro said in an interview with The Breakfast Club, as reported by Fox News.He recalled meeting Biden at a coffee shop in Harrisburg. “He said, ‘How’s it going?’” Shapiro recounted. “I was very clear — polls were showing it wasn’t going well. I told him I didn’t think he was handling the cost issue properly. Rising costs were a major concern in the campaign, especially in Pennsylvania.”The 52-year-old governor added that he also told Biden that many voters “didn’t think he was up to the job.”""Look, maybe it's old school, but I believe that if you got something to say, you say it directly to that person's face, and he's the president of the United States. I respected him, still respect him, and I respect him enough to say it directly to his face,"" the Missouri-born leader remarked.Asked how his feedback was received, Shapiro replied, “I think he heard it. He told me that their poll numbers were different, and he seemed committed to continuing forward.”Biden had faced mounting pressure to step aside following a poor showing in a June 2024 presidential debate against Republican rival Donald Trump, a rematch of the 2020 contest. After resisting calls for about a month, the Democrat ultimately announced he would not seek re-election.Then-Vice President Kamala Harris was later chosen as Trump’s Democratic challenger for the November election and had considered Shapiro as her running mate, before ultimately selecting Minnesota governor Tim Walz. The Democratic ticket was defeated by the Republican team of Trump—who won a second term after losing the 2020 election as the sitting president—and JD Vance.Trump carried all seven key swing states, including Pennsylvania.","Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro recalled how he once tried to deliver ""bad news"" to then-President and fellow Democrat Joe Biden ahead of last year's election.

Who is George Santos?





US President Donald Trump on Friday announced that he has commuted the prison sentence of ex-congressman George Santos, who is serving more than seven years in federal prison after pleading guilty to fraud and identity theft charges.“I just signed a commutation releasing George Santos from prison, immediately,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social. “George Santos was somewhat of a rogue, but there are many rogues throughout our country that aren’t forced to serve seven years in prison,” he added.Santos, a Republican from New York, admitted last year that he deceived donors and stole the identities of 11 people — including members of his own family — to make fraudulent campaign donations. He began serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey, on July 25, and had been housed in a minimum-security camp with fewer than 50 inmates.Following the announcement, Andrew Mancilla, one of Santos’s attorneys, welcomed the decision, calling it “the right thing to do.”""Very, very happy with the decision. The defence team applauds President Trump for doing the right thing.The sentence was far too long,"" Mancilla told The Associated Press.However, the timing of the 37-year-old's release remains unclear.The move comes just days after Santos sent a handwritten letter from prison appealing directly to Trump for clemency. “Sir, I appeal to your sense of justice and humanity — the same qualities that have inspired millions of Americans to believe in you,” he wrote. “I humbly ask that you consider the unusual pain and hardship of this environment and allow me the opportunity to return to my family, my friends, and my community. ”The son of Brazilian immigrants, Santos made history in 2022 as the first openly gay Republican elected to Congress. However, his political career quickly collapsed after investigations revealed that he had fabricated much of his personal and professional background.In 2023, he was charged with stealing from donors, misusing campaign funds, collecting unemployment benefits fraudulently, and lying to Congress about his finances. He was expelled from the US House of Representatives later that year — only the sixth member in history to be ousted by colleagues.","George Santos, a Republican from New York, admitted last year that he deceived donors and stole the identities of 11 people to make fraudulent campaign donations.

Presidency and Immediate Priorities

A leader in context





Colonel Michael Randrianirina, once a relatively obscure military officer, is now Madagascar’s most powerful figure. Days after leading his elite CAPSAT unit into the streets of Antananarivo to join youth-led protests demanding President Andry Rajoelina’s resignation, Randrianirina was sworn in as the country’s leader. His ascent, coming after a brief imprisonment for an alleged mutiny, has transformed a soldier from the southernmost reaches of Madagascar into the head of state.Randrianirina was born in 1974 in Sevohipoty, a small village in the Androy region of southern Madagascar. Little is publicly known about his family, but his career path reflects a steady rise through the military ranks. He served as governor of Androy from 2016 to 2018 under former President Hery Rajaonarimampianina. Following that, he commanded an infantry battalion in Toliara until 2022, before being promoted to a senior leadership role in CAPSAT, Madagascar’s elite military unit that previously played a key role in bringing Rajoelina to power in 2009.Throughout his career, Randrianirina became known for discipline and pragmatism. He was also a vocal critic of Rajoelina, contrasting with the president’s return to power in 2018 after having initially seized control through a 2009 coup.This tension would later set the stage for his decisive role in the 2025 political upheaval.Randrianirina’s relationship with Rajoelina turned openly adversarial in 2023. In November of that year, he was imprisoned without trial for allegedly inciting a mutiny and planning a coup, according to Reuters. He spent most of his three-month detention at a military hospital, reflecting the authorities’ recognition of his prominence and influence within the armed forces. Student groups, fellow soldiers, and politicians decried his incarceration as politically motivated, framing it as retaliation against a rising critic. He was released in February 2024, stepping out of prison to a country where the lines between military authority and political power were already dangerously blurred.The immediate context of Randrianirina’s rise was the wave of protests organized by young Madagascans, primarily a Gen Z movement known as Gen Z Mada. Angry at persistent water and electricity shortages, as well as high living costs, corruption, and lack of opportunity, the youth-led demonstrations erupted across the capital in late September 2025.Last weekend, as the protests swelled, Randrianirina’s CAPSAT unit joined the demonstrators. According to Reuters, he drove with troops into the city centre and publicly announced that CAPSAT was taking control. The Constitutional Court quickly ratified the transition, installing him as president even as the ousted Rajoelina refused to concede. In a statement to the BBC just hours before his inauguration, Randrianirina described himself as a “servant” of the people, exuding confidence and calm without arrogance.On assuming office, Randrianirina traded his fatigues for a presidential suit, complete with official sash and star of office, symbolizing the transition from military command to political authority. “We are committed to breaking with the past,” he told the BBC, promising to address the systemic causes behind the protests, including chronic shortages of water and electricity. He immediately launched an investigation into the state-run electricity and water company, signaling a hands-on approach.He has pledged that the military will govern alongside a civilian administration for up to two years before elections are held. In interviews with The Associated Press, he framed the takeover as an act of patriotism: “From now on, we will restore the country to its former glory, fight against insecurity, and gradually try to solve the social problems that Malagasy people experience.”Randrianirina also signalled a cultural shift, refusing to respond in French when offered the chance, asserting the primacy of the Malagasy language: “Why can’t I speak my language, Malagasy?” His stance reflects a determination to distance his administration from colonial legacies while asserting national identity.Randrianirina’s sudden elevation from prisoner to president underscores both the fragility and volatility of Madagascar’s political landscape. While the African Union and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres have condemned the takeover as a coup, Constitutional Court president Florent Rakotoarisoa rejected this characterisation, arguing that structural constitutional flaws contributed to the crisis.Despite a minor clash with gendarmerie forces loyal to Rajoelina, during which a CAPSAT soldier was killed, Randrianirina’s troops were largely celebrated, and public support has been bolstered by youth who view him as the embodiment of their frustrations and aspirations. As Madagascar enters this transitional period, Randrianirina’s leadership will be defined by his ability to manage the balance between military authority, civilian governance, and international scrutiny.","Colonel Michael Randrianirina was born in 1974 in Sevohipoty, a small village in the Androy region of southern Madagascar.

VIDEO: Hamas Fighters Release Seven Israeli Hostages From Gaza Amid Loud Cheer From Palestinians





Hamas published a video on Monday showing eight blindfolded and kneeling men being executed in the streets, branding them ""collaborators and outlaws.""The footage surfaced amid armed clashes between Hamas security units and Palestinian clans, on the fifth day of a US-brokered truce between Israel and the militant group.Hamas proceeded to take control of Gaza on Tuesday, even as US President Donald Trump vowed to disarm the group under a recently brokered ceasefire.The Israeli military confirmed that the remains of four more hostages held in Gaza were handed to the Red Cross, following the release of four others and the safe return of 20 surviving captives.In northern Gaza, as Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza City, Hamas’s black-masked police resumed street patrols. Hamas’s Brigades helped control crowds when freed prisoners arrived in Gaza on Monday. A new Hamas security unit, called the Deterrence Force, has been targeting armed clans and gangs, some of which are said to have Israeli support.Hamas has dominated Gaza since 2007 after defeating rival faction Fatah. Israel insists Hamas must not play any role in a future Gaza government, hand back the remains of 24 deceased hostages, and eventually disarm.Trump has warned that those who refuse to surrender their weapons will be forcibly disarmed. The US-brokered 20-point peace plan, endorsed by world powers at a Trump-led summit in Egypt, demands a demilitarised Gaza and no leadership role for Hamas.Meanwhile, Israeli families continued pressing for the return of the remains of 24 hostages still held by Hamas.The Israeli army confirmed four more bodies were transferred to the Red Cross and on their way to custody. The military identified two victims as Guy Iluz, an Israeli national, and Bipin Joshi, an agriculture student from Nepal. Two others were later named as Yossi Sharabi and Daniel Peretz.Trump celebrated the ceasefire during a visit to Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and later joined regional leaders in Egypt to sign a declaration aimed at cementing the truce.","Hamas published a video showing eight blindfolded and kneeling men being executed in the streets, branding them ""collaborators and outlaws"" The footage surfaced amid armed clashes between Hamas security units and Palestinian clans, on the fifth day of a US-brokered truce between Israel and the militant group.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124561949,imgsize-395662,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
'New York should honour ICC warrant': Zohran Mamdani targets Benjamin Netanyahu; reiterates call to 'arrest' Israel's PM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-york-should-honour-zohran-mamdani-on-iccs-netanyahu-warrant-reiterates-call-to-arrest-israels-pm/articleshow/124594137.cms,"Benjamin Netanyahu; Zohran Mamdani





New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has reiterated his call for the city to “honour” the International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza.The Indian-origin politician has previously stated that, if elected mayor, he would “arrest” Netanyahu should the Israeli leader visit the city.""I’ve said that this is a city that believes international law, and this is a city that wants to uplift and uphold those beliefs,"" Mamdani told Fox News’ ""The Story"" show on Wednesday.Anchor Martha MacCallum noted that the US is not a signatory to the ICC, which Mamdani acknowledged. He stressed, however, that “The ICC… has issued a warrant for the arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu, as it has for Vladimir Putin (over alleged war crimes in Ukraine). I believe that we should uphold arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court and that we would… do so only in abiding with all of the laws in front of us. ”The Democratic candidate clarified that he would not create new legislation to arrest Netanyahu. “I can tell you that I’m going to exhaust every legal option in front of me, not to make new laws to do so,” he added, responding to a question about whether the NYPD would allow him to arrest the Israeli leader.During his recent US visit, Netanyahu avoided flying over countries that are ICC signatories and could have arrested him in their airspace.Mamdani, 33, who would become New York’s first Muslim mayor if elected and is a vocal critic of Donald Trump, also declined to credit the US president for last week’s ceasefire and hostage-prisoner swap between Israel and Hamas. “To any extent, credit or not, I think it's too early to say. But if it proves to be lasting and durable, then that’s where you give credit,” he said.He also avoided commenting directly on whether Hamas would “lay down their arms” in Gaza, emphasizing that his focus is on justice, safety, and adherence to international law. “Anything has to abide by international law, and that applies to Hamas, the Israeli military, anyone you could ask me about,” Mamdani remarked.The mayoral election in New York is scheduled for November 4. Mamdani faces Republican Curtis Silwa and former New York state governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent.","New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has reiterated his call for the city to ""honour"" the International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Billionaire investor Bill Ackman, a New York City native, has called on Curtis Sliwa to withdraw from the city’s November 4 mayoral race, warning that a vote for the Republican candidate would effectively be “a vote for Zohran Mamdani .”Mamdani, the Democratic Party candidate, is the odds-on favourite to succeed Eric Adams, the outgoing 110th mayor of New York City.“If Curtis Sliwa drops, Andrew Cuomo can win. If he doesn’t, we are toast,” Ackman said Friday in a post on X. Cuomo, the former governor of New York state, is running as an independent in the mayoral election.Ackman also shared polling agency PolyMarket's latest predictions, which show Mamdani with nearly 90 per cent support. Cuomo and Sliwa trailed with 9 per cent and less than 1 per cent, respectively.The predictions came following Thursday's first debate between the three contenders.“It was not Zohran Mamdani’s debate performance. It was Curtis Sliwa’s statement after the debate that he is not leaving that has tipped the odds to 90 percent for Mamdani,” Ackman added. He has been backing Cuomo’s independent bid.Sliwa had stated after the debate that he would remain in the race.“Billionaires aren’t going to decide the outcome — it’s the voters. It’s the people. Let the people decide,” Sliwa’s campaign team told Fox News Digital in an exclusive statement, referring to Ackman.“Cuomo lost the primary as a Democrat. He’s now running as an independent. Curtis is on a major party line just like Mamdani. If anything, Cuomo should drop out, not Curtis,” the statement added.Mamdani, who was born in Uganda and is of Indian origin, became a U.S. citizen in 2018.

Donald Trump's Critic John Bolton Charged, Former India Backer in Trouble After Slamming Tariff War

CHARGES AGAINST PERCEIVED ADVERSARIES





John Bolton, the national security hawk and former adviser to Donald Trump who has become one of the U.S. president's biggest critics, pleaded not guilty on Friday to charges of mishandling classified information.Bolton, who was indicted on Thursday , is the third of Trump's prominent critics to face prosecution in recent weeks, as the U.S. president dispenses with decades-long norms designed to insulate federal law enforcement from political pressures.Bolton, wearing a dark blue suit and maroon tie, did not speak with reporters as he arrived at the courthouse in Greenbelt, Maryland, to surrender.""Not guilty, your honor,"" Bolton, 76, said in court. He was released on his own recognizance and a hearing in the case is scheduled for November 21.The indictment alleges that Bolton shared sensitive information with two of his relatives for possible use in a book he was writing, including notes on intelligence briefings and meetings with senior government officials and foreign leaders.Bolton's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said Bolton did not unlawfully share or store any information.Trump, a Republican who campaigned for the presidency on a vow of retribution after facing a slew of legal woes once his first term in the White House ended in 2021, has actively pressured his attorney general, Pam Bondi, to bring charges against his perceived adversaries.That included pushing the Justice Department to bring charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, even driving out a prosecutor he deemed to be moving too slowly in doing so.Bolton served as White House national security adviser during Trump's first term, before emerging as one of the president's most vocal critics. Bolton, also a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, described Trump as unfit to be president in a memoir he released last year.The investigation of Bolton was opened in 2022, predating the Trump administration. Inside the Justice Department, the case is viewed as stronger than the prosecutions of Comey and James, according to a person familiar with the matter.The indictment of Bolton, filed in federal court in Maryland, charges him with eight counts of transmission of national defense information and 10 counts of retention of national defense information, all in violation of the Espionage Act.Each count is punishable by up to 10 years in prison, but any sentence would be determined by a judge based on a range of factors.In some of the chats described in the indictment, Bolton and his relatives - who are not identified - discussed using some of the material for a book. Bolton referred to the two people with whom he shared his daily notes as his ""editors,"" the indictment said.""Talking with (book publisher) because they have a right of first refusal!"" Bolton wrote in one message, according to the indictment.The two relatives referred to in the indictment are Bolton's wife and daughter, two people familiar with the matter said.Asked by reporters at the White House about the Bolton indictment on Thursday, Trump said: ""He's a bad guy.""",Bolton pleaded not guilty to charges of mishandling classified information.

Trump Flirts With ‘Putin Tunnel’ Idea, Zelensky’s Reaction Stuns All





President Donald Trump expressed interest Friday in an undersea tunnel connecting the US state of Alaska with Russia -- a project floated a day earlier by a senior Russian official to billionaire Elon Musk.""A tunnel from Russia to Alaska. That's...interesting,"" Trump said, when asked about the idea by White House reporters during his meeting with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky.Indicating he had just heard about the potential cross-border project, he asked Zelensky: ""What do you think of that, Mr. President?... How do you like that idea?""The Ukrainian leader -- who has been combating a full scale Russian invasion for over three years -- appeared less than thrilled.""I'm not happy with this,"" he said, eliciting a laugh from his host.Russian President Vladimir Putin's international economy envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, brought up the idea on Thursday on the Musk-owned media platform X.He claimed the idea of a ""peace bridge"" between Russia and Alaska dated back to the Cold War era, and posted a crude graphic showing a proposed tunnel route under the Bering Sea.""With modern @boringcompany technology this can become a Putin-Trump tunnel,"" a 70-mile (112-kilometer) link connecting Russia to the Americas for under $8 billion, Dmitriev posted.The Boring Company is yet another venture by Musk, the world's richest person and boss of Tesla and SpaceX, which aims to revolutionize urban transport through the construction of tunnels.Dmitriev, who heads Russia's sovereign wealth fund, said Musk's company could build the tunnel -- a project ""symbolizing unity"" -- in under eight years.Musk was one of the biggest donors to Trump's 2024 campaign. After Trump returned to the White House, Musk joined the Republican's administration, with the president tasking him with making dramatic cuts to the federal budget, including laying off thousands of government employees.Trump and Musk were close until the latter left the administration in May. They publicly fell out in June, with Musk launching fierce attacks over Trump's economic policies.The two nevertheless appeared side by side on September 21 during a ceremony honoring slain conservative influencer Charlie Kirk.",President Donald Trump expressed interest in an undersea tunnel connecting the US state of Alaska with Russia.

CEO killer Luigi Mangione’s lawyers claim Trump administration is 'using him as a pawn' to advance its own agenda,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ceo-killer-luigi-mangiones-lawyers-claim-trump-administration-is-using-him-as-a-pawn-to-advance-its-own-agenda/articleshow/124646009.cms,"Trump Memo Sparks Uproar: Luigi Mangione Alleges White House Smeared Him As ‘Antifa Killer’

Mangione fighting 'full force' of US government alone





UnitedHealthcare involved with Trump administration?









The defence attorneys argued in a new court filing that public comments and social media posts have denied him the right to a fair trial.The 27-year-old faces federal charges, including two counts of stalking, one count of murder through the use of a firearm, and one firearms offence in connection with the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan last December.In a letter submitted to a New York federal court on Friday, Mangione’s legal team said the government’s public statements are influencing public opinion and undermining the fairness of his case, reports NBC news.“Mr. Mangione is one young man, alleged to have acted alone, fighting for his life in three separate cases, against the full force and might of the entirety of the United States Government that is actively and persistently using him as a pawn to further its political agenda. This is the very definition of prejudicial where the consequence is death,"" the letter reads.The filing points to comments made by US President Donald Trump in a Fox News interview on September 18, in which Trump said Mangione “shot someone in the back as clear as you’re looking at me. He shot him right in the middle of the back — instantly dead. This is a sickness. This really has to be studied and investigated.” The next day, an X account affiliated with the White House, Rapid Response 47, and many more MAGA-based users posted a clip of the interview to millions of followers.Federal prosecutors told the court that the posts were removed once the matter was brought to their attention and that the officials involved are not part of Mangione’s prosecution team.Mangione’s attorneys also cited comments by Attorney General Pam Bondi in April, when she described the case as a clear death penalty scenario and said she had received threats over seeking the maximum punishment. “There can be no doubt that the Attorney General of the United States herself is 'associated' with Mr. Mangione’s case, as the Attorney General is the only individual in the DOJ authorised to seek the death penalty in any case,” the lawyers wrote.In addition, the defence has raised concerns over UnitedHealthcare’s interactions with the Trump administration, citing reports that the company increased lobbying efforts following Thompson’s death. “UnitedHealth’s continued financial viability depends upon maintaining the narrative that Mr. Mangione—rather than the company or its business practices—is the villain,” the filing states. The defence asked for information about these meetings to see if the White House and DOJ worked together in a way that could unfairly affect Mangione’s trial.Mangione was arrested at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania days after the murder, following a nationwide manhunt. Prosecutors allege he was the masked gunman seen on security footage fatally shooting Thompson. The CEO was killed hours before UnitedHealthcare’s annual investor conference. A diary allegedly carried by Mangione suggested a plot to target Thompson. Mangione pleads not guilty in both federal and state cases related to the shooting.","Luigi Mangione, 27, is accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last December.

ICE Protests Erupt In Chicago Suburb, Nine Arrested Amid Federal Police Clashes





The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area.The emergency request followed a judge’s order blocking the deployment of Guard members from Illinois and Texas to assist immigration enforcement for at least two weeks. A federal appeals court refused to suspend the judge’s order.The Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority, has repeatedly ruled in Trump’s favour in emergency appeals since he took office in January, often overturning lower court decisions and over the objections of the three liberal justices. The court has previously allowed Trump to ban transgender people from the military, recover billions in federal spending, take strong actions against immigrants, and remove presidentially appointed leaders from independent federal agencies.In the case of the Guard deployment, US District Judge April Perry said there was no clear evidence of a “danger of rebellion” in Illinois during the administration’s immigration crackdown.Trump’s top Supreme Court lawyer, Solicitor General D John Sauer, asked the justices to intervene immediately, saying Judge Perry’s order “impinges on the President’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.”Similar restrictions have been imposed elsewhere. A federal judge in Oregon temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops there, while Guard units from several states continue to patrol Washington, DC, and Memphis, Tennessee.In California, a judge ruled in September that the deployment was illegal. By then, only 300 of the thousands of troops sent remained, and the judge did not order their removal.","The emergency request followed a judge’s order blocking the deployment of Guard members from Illinois and Texas.

Who is Al-Muhtadi?









The FBI arrested a suspect in Louisiana who allegedly participated in Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.An affidavit accuses Mahmoud Amin Ya-qub Al-Muhtadi, a Gazan and a resident of Lafayette, Louisiana, of violating federal law by providing, attempting to provide, or conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organisation through his alleged involvement in the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel. He is also accused of fraud and misuse of visas, permits and other documents.Al-Muhtadi is expected to make an initial court appearance on Friday morning, according to The New York Times.“After hiding out in the United States, this monster has been found and charged with participating in the atrocities of October 7 — the single deadliest day for Jewish people since the Holocaust,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi.“While nothing can fully heal the scars left by Hamas’s brutal attack, this Department’s Joint Task Force October 7 is dedicated to finding and prosecuting those responsible for that horrific day, including the murder of dozens of American citizens. We will continue to stand by Jewish Americans and Jewish people around the world against anti-Semitism and terrorism in all its forms.”“As set forth in documents filed yesterday, on October 7, when Al-Muhtadi learned of the unfolding barbaric attack on Israel and civilians from multiple nations, including the United States, he sprang into action.He armed himself, recruited additional marauders, and then entered Israel, where there is evidence placing him near one of the worst-hit Israeli communities,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg.“Subsequently, Al-Muhtadi fraudulently obtained a visa to enter the United States where he hoped to remain undetected. This arrest is the first public step in bringing to justice those responsible for harming Americans on that day.”Court documents allege that Al-Muhtadi is an operative of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine’s (DFLP) military wing, the National Resistance Brigades (NRB, also called the Martyr Umar al-Qasim Forces), a Gaza-based paramilitary group involved in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks on Israel.According to the complaint, Al-Muhtadi armed himself and crossed into Israel on the morning of Oct. 7 to join Hamas’s assault. His phone was reportedly traced to a cell tower near Kibbutz Kfar Aza, the site of a massacre in which many civilians were killed, including at least four Americans.Al-Muhtadi is also accused of providing false information on his U.S. visa application regarding his paramilitary affiliation, ties to Hamas, training, and participation in the Oct. 7 attacks. Records indicate he entered the United States on Sept. 12, 2024.The case is being investigated by Joint Task Force October 7 (JTF 10-7) and the FBI New Orleans Field Office, with support from Israeli authorities including the Israeli Security Agency, Lahav 433, IDF, and the Israel National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing, as well as U.S. agencies such as Customs and Border Protection and Louisiana State Police.Prosecutors include Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Nickel and Zoe Bedell, along with Trial Attorneys from the National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section. JTF 10-7, established in February 2025 by Attorney General Pamela Bondi, was specifically created to investigate perpetrators of the Oct. 7 attacks, hold Hamas supporters accountable, and pursue justice for victims, including the 49 U.S. citizens killed and eight abducted.","Mahmoud Amin Ya-qub Al-Muhtadi, a Gazan and a resident of Lafayette, Louisiana, allegedly participated in Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.

‘Doesn’t Wanna F**k Around With U.S.’: Trump ‘EXPOSES’ Maduro After He Offers Venezuela’s Riches





US President Donald Trump on Friday said Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro had offered major concessions to avoid confrontation with Washington.Trump’s comments came amid a significant US military presence in the Caribbean, which Washington says targets drug cartels linked to Venezuela. Earlier this week, B-52 bombers circled the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast, while seven US Navy ships have been deployed as part of counter-narcotics operations. The build-up has raised fears in Caracas that the US may be seeking regime change.On Thursday, US forces struck a suspected drug-carrying submarine, leaving several people alive — the first survivors since the Trump administration began military strikes in the region last month. “We attacked a submarine, and that was a drug-carrying submarine built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs,” Trump said while hosting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio did not dispute the presence of survivors but said more details would be released later. The strike brought the death toll from the administration’s Caribbean operations to at least 28 and is believed to be the sixth strike off Venezuela since early September. The survivors are reportedly being held on a US Navy vessel.","US President Donald Trump said Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro had offered major concessions to avoid confrontation with Washington.

New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani took a jibe at former governor Andrew Cuomo on Thursday, accusing him of failing to engage with the Muslim community during his decade in office.“It took Andrew Cuomo being beaten by a Muslim candidate in the Democratic primary for him to set foot in a mosque,” Mamdani said during a heated mayoral debate at Rockefeller Center. “He had more than ten years and he couldn’t name a single mosque at the last debate we had that he visited.”Mamdani continued, “What Muslims want in this city is what every community wants and deserves. They want equality and they want respect, and it took me to get you to even see those Muslims as part of this city, and that frankly is something that is shameful and is why so many New Yorkers have lost faith in this politics.”Cuomo defended his record, saying, “Before you were ever here, before you were even in state government, I worked with the Muslim community. Imams presided over state of the states. We worked in religious working groups, tolerance groups, anti-Semitic groups, etcetera.”Mamdani pressed further and asked, “Name a single mosque you went to while you were the governor. Can you name a single mosque you went to in ten years?” Cuomo had campaigned at a mosque for the first time in his current race last month.Mamdani concluded, “You couldn’t visit a mosque.”The debate, which lasted two hours, also saw Mamdani and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa teaming up at points to challenge Cuomo. Candidates clashed on housing, Israel and Gaza, sex work, and the influence of US President Donald Trump.Polls suggest Mamdani had widened his lead to 46 per cent, while Cuomo stands at 33 per cent. Early voting is set to begin next week.The Democratic Party is closely watching whether New Yorkers choose an establishment figure in Cuomo, running as an independent, or the progressive Mamdani. Republicans are also tracking Curtis Sliwa’s campaign, particularly his focus on public safety, to see if he can expand his support as a Republican in a Blue city.",New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani took a jibe at former governor Andrew Cuomo on Thursday.

An 'almost sickly' Cuomo

A 'relaxed and friendly' Silwa







NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani tried to be tough during the first general-election mayoral debate on Thursday, in which he sparred with former governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, a body language expert has said.The body language expert analysed all three candidates, revealing what they were truly thinking, not just what they appeared to be on stage.Carole Lieberman, a psychiatrist and body language expert, told The New York Post that Mamdani “was, ironically or purposefully, dressed in black like a villain.” She explained, “He was either showing his true colours unconsciously or wanted viewers to see him as tough.”The Democratic socialist, whose mother is an Academy Award-nominated filmmaker and father a Columbia University professor, has previously joked about calling himself the ""nepo-babyy."" But during the debate, he appeared “smug” and “angry,” showing visible signs of tension.“He also perpetually wore a cat-that-ate-the-canary, smug smile, as if he was already thinking about how he would decorate the mayor’s mansion,” Lieberman said. “He seemed angry, as if annoyed that he still had to debate to prove he’s the best candidate. His tense anger was made visible by his clenched jaw, erratic hand gestures and squinting.”In contrast to Mamdani, the body language expert said Cuomo “looked bedraggled,” or dishevelled, noting that the campaign took a toll on him.“He could pass for a homeless person on a Central Park bench,” she said. “He looks almost sickly.” By the end of the two-hour debate, Cuomo “looked worried” and “feared he hadn’t gotten enough of an edge over Mamdani.”The red beret-wearing Sliwa was described as the “most relaxed and friendly” of the trio. The Republican candidate appeared calm and open. “His wide arms, on either side of the podium, indicated that he was also the most open,” Lieberman said. “He was a welcome island of calm, a respite for viewers from Cuomo and Mamdani, who made viewers nervous.”The debate itself turned fiery, with the three candidates clashing over issues ranging from sex work to housing.","NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani tried to be tough during the first general- election mayoral debate on Thursday, a body language expert has said.

'Love The Suit': Banter Erupts In Oval Over Zelensky's Black Formals; Trump Grins: 'All Dressed Up'

What to expect in today's meeting?









It seems that US President Donald Trump has started liking Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy 's dress look. Meeting after nearly two months in the same Oval Office where he once hated his dress, but slowly and gradually started liking his fashion sense.Trump on Friday praised Zelenskyy's dark suit as he arrived at the White House for the third time to talk on the Russia-Ukraine war, months after their August meeting.""And I think he looks beautiful in his jacket. I hope people notice. It's a good. It's actually very stylish.

Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif said on Thursday that Islamabad was ready to hold talks with Afghanistan to resolve their conflict, as a temporary ceasefire that halted days of fierce fighting between the former allies largely held. The neighbouring nations engaged in ground fighting and Pakistan launched airstrikes across the contested frontier, killing dozens and wounding hundreds before agreeing to a 48-hour truce from 6.30pm on Wednesday.Sharif told his cabinet in Islamabad that Pakistan had “retaliated” as it ran out of patience with Afghanistan following a series of militant attacks. “If they want to talk on our valid conditions and want to resolve through dialogue we are ready for that,” Sharif said. “This message has been given to them yesterday. Now the ball is in their court. If this ceasefire is done just to buy time, we will not accept it.”There was no response to his remarks from Kabul.A statement from the Afghaninterior ministry said interior minister Khalifa Sirajuddin Haqqani met Iranian officials and told them that Afghanistan seeks good relations with all countries. “Just as we respect the sovereignty and dignity of others, we expect the same goodwill and respect toward us,” the statement quoted Haqqani as saying.At least 18 civilians were killed and more than 360 wounded in Afghanistan as a result of the fighting since Oct 10, the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan said.",Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif says Islamabad is ready to hold talks with Afghanistan to resolve their conflict.

A new kind of threat







An uneasy ceasefire may have paused six days of fierce fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan, but the name haunting Islamabad remains the same: Noor Wali Mehsud, the militant cleric Pakistan blames for bringing the country to the brink.As Reuters reported, Pakistani forces believed they had their moment last week when an airstrike in Kabul targeted an armoured Toyota Land Cruiser thought to be carrying Mehsud, leader of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). But the strike failed. Militants and Pakistani officials said he survived, and soon after, the group released an audio message purportedly from him, proof, perhaps, that the TTP chief had once again slipped through Pakistan’s grasp.The strike, Pakistan's first in Kabul since the 2022 US drone killing of Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, was followed by deadly clashes along the Afghan border. For nearly a week, both sides exchanged artillery and drone fire, killing dozens and injuring hundreds. As Associated Press reported, Taliban officials accused Islamabad of carrying out two drone strikes in Kabul just hours before the truce took effect, while the UN urged both sides to end hostilities.Behind Pakistan’s anger lies a deeper grievance: Mehsud’s continued sanctuary in Afghanistan. Islamabad has repeatedly accused Kabul’s Taliban rulers of harbouring him and his lieutenants, an allegation the Afghan Taliban deny.According to Reuters, Mehsud, a 47-year-old cleric trained in Pakistan’s seminaries, revived the TTP after years of disarray. When he took over in 2018, the group was fractured and on the run, its leaders killed in US drone strikes. But Mehsud, described by analysts as both “a strategist and an ideologue,” united splinter factions, reorganised command, and shifted tactics.Unlike his predecessors, Mehsud curtailed attacks on civilians, a deliberate move to regain sympathy in Pakistan’s tribal belt after the horror of the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, which killed over 130 children. He ordered fighters to focus instead on the army and police, portraying Pakistan’s military as “anti-Islam” and accusing its generals of “hijacking the people of Pakistan for 78 years.”Under his leadership, the TTP renewed its insurgency. The UN’s Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee lists him for “financing, planning, and perpetrating” terrorist acts, noting the group’s claims of deadly strikes on Pakistani security forces in North Waziristan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2019. As of late 2022, UN records placed Mehsud in Afghanistan’s Paktika province, near the border.Born in 1978 in South Waziristan’s Machikhel village, Mehsud studied at multiple Islamic seminaries across Pakistan before joining jihadist ranks. As detailed by the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), he fought alongside the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s, later joining the TTP in 2003. He rose quickly first as a judge in TTP’s shadow courts, then as its Karachi chief, and finally as deputy to Maulana Fazlullah before taking command in 2018.What distinguishes Mehsud from other militants is his intellectual bent. He is the author of several books, including Inqilab-e-Mehsud (The Mehsud Revolution), a 700-page account linking his movement to anti-colonial resistance. In it, he even claimed responsibility for orchestrating the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, saying she planned to ally with the U.S. against the mujahideen.Analysts describe him as both “a battlefield commander and a theorist.” He views Pakistan’s military operations against militants as a “defensive jihad” retaliation against what he portrays as the army’s betrayal of tribal traditions by handing over foreign fighters to the U.S. His stated goals: preserving Mehsud tribal autonomy, defeating America in Afghanistan, and establishing a Taliban-style Islamic system.Since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, Mehsud’s TTP has enjoyed renewed momentum. Pakistan claims the group has used Afghan soil to launch near-daily attacks, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Efforts at negotiation have failed. According to Reuters, the TTP’s demands implementing Islamic law in border regions and the army’s withdrawal were flatly rejected by Islamabad.The failed airstrike in Kabul has made Mehsud an even more defiant figure. His survival has not only embarrassed Pakistan’s military but also underscored the fragility of its ties with Kabul. For now, an uneasy truce holds, but the man once dismissed as a fugitive cleric has managed to force Pakistan into one of its deadliest border crises in decades, a testament to the enduring power of Noor Wali Mehsud, the scholar-commander who turned ideology into insurgency.","Noor Wali Mehsud is the leader of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) Pakistani forces believed they had their moment last week when an airstrike in Kabul targeted an armoured Toyota Land Cruiser.

Afghanistan’s Taliban government on Thursday claimed that Pakistan carried out two drone strikes on Kabul on Wednesday, even as the two neighbours declared a 48-hour ceasefire following days of deadly cross-border clashes that killed dozens and injured hundreds.The strikes, according to Taliban officials, targeted a civilian house and a market in Kabul, with hospital sources reporting at least five killed and dozens injured.Emergency, an Italian NGO running a surgical centre in the city, said patients suffered shrapnel wounds, burns, and blunt trauma.Khalid Zadran, spokesman for the Kabul police chief, confirmed the attacks but did not provide exact casualty figures, as per the news agency AP Earlier, Taliban chief spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid initially described the incident as an oil tanker explosion.Pakistani officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the strikes were aimed at militant hideouts, reported AP.Cross-border violence had escalated since October 10, with both Islamabad and Kabul accusing each other of harbouring militants.On Wednesday, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) reported at least 17 civilians killed and 346 injured in Spin Boldak on the Afghan side of the border, while noting further casualties in previous clashes.The UN urged both countries to “bring a lasting end to hostilities to protect civilians”.The temporary truce, which came into effect at 6 pm Islamabad time on Wednesday, was aimed at halting bloodshed and creating a window for dialogue.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said ‘the ball is in the Afghan Taliban's court"" and the extension of the ceasefire depends on Kabul’s response. “If in 48 hours they want to resolve the issues and address our genuine demands, then we are ready for them,” he said, reiterating that Afghan territory should not be used to plan attacks by Pakistani Taliban militants.According to the news agency AFP, Spin Boldak residents were observed returning home, and shops were reopening under the fragile truce, while municipal workers in Kabul were repairing roads and buildings damaged by the Wednesday blasts.Blasts had also caused overnight blackouts in parts of the city. Emergency’s country director, Dejan Panic, said, “We started receiving ambulances filled with wounded people… Ten are in critical condition.”The 2,611-kilometre-long Durand Line, which Afghanistan does not formally recognise, remains a flashpoint as Pakistan continues to combat attacks from the Tehreek-e-Taliban ( TTP ) and other armed groups operating along the border.Islamabad has repeatedly accused Kabul of providing safe havens to militants, a charge denied by the Taliban.","Taliban claims Pakistan carried out two drone strikes on Kabul on Wednesday.

'Had detailed discussions with Taliban foreign minister'







NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Thursday sharply criticised Pakistan over its recent hostilities with Afghanistan, while emphasising India’s commitment to Afghanistan’s sovereignty.Speaking on the tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""Three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbours for its own internal failures. Three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories. India remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan. ""In recent weeks, Pakistan has carried out targeted strikes in Kabul and other Taliban-controlled areas following a series of violent attacks by the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Pakistani territory.The Taliban government had then launched the offensive in ""retaliation for air strikes carried out by the Pakistani army on Kabul.""The Taliban had carried out operations along parts of the border with Pakistan, prompting Islamabad to promise a strong response.A 48-hour ceasefire between Afghanistan and Pakistan took hold late on Wednesday.The Pakistan Taliban operates independently of Afghanistan’s Taliban, but the two groups share ideological alignment. Pakistan has accused Kabul of giving shelter to TTP leaders and other groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the ISIL affiliate in Khorasan Province (ISKP).TTP attacks have increased sharply since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, reflecting a growing trend in violence.During Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi's recent visit to India, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had announced that India will upgrade its technical mission in Afghanistan to a full embassy.When asked about the development and India’s stand on recognising Afghanistan’s Taliban government, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “We had detailed discussions with foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi covering humanitarian aid, development cooperation, and upgrading our embassy. We donated 20 ambulances and plan further work in Afghanistan’s health sector. The transition of our technical mission in Kabul into a full embassy will take place in the coming days.

Can Pakistan sustain new approach?







The recent deadly clashes between Pakistan and the Taliban along their shared border signal a major shift in Islamabad's approach towards a group that it had hoped would become an ally in its larger fight against India.Far from becoming a partner, the Taliban has now emerged as the single-biggest threat to Pakistan's security.With Pakistan launching strikes inside Taliban-held Afghan territory and the Taliban responding with attacks on Pakistani outposts and armored tanks, analysts suggest that Pakistan is attempting to establish a 'new normal' in its dealings with the Taliban.This evolving posture strikingly echoes India's decisive stance against Pakistan following Operation Sindoor earlier this year.In the past few weeks, Pakistan has carried out targeted strikes in Kabul and other Taliban-controlled areas after a series of violent attacks by the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) on Pakistani territory.The Pakistan Taliban is independent of Afghanistan's Taliban, but the two groups are ideologically aligned.Islamabad blames Kabul for giving sanctuary to TTP leaders, as well as other groups such as the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and ISIL (ISIS) affiliate in Khorasan Province, or ISKP.TTP attacks have increased sharply since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, and numbers highlight the increasing trend.Data show that the TTP engaged in at least 600 attacks against, or clashes with, security forces in the past year alone. Its activity in 2025 so far already exceeds that seen in all of 2024.The Centre for Research and Security Studies, an Islamabad-based think tank, put the number of deaths of Pakistan's security personnel at more than 2,400 in the first three quarters of this year, which is on track to become the deadliest year in a decade.The recent strikes by Pakistan mark a departure from its often ambivalent or covert stance toward Taliban activities.By crossing into Afghan soil to target militants, Pakistan appears intent on sending a clear warning: any future terrorist operations originating from Afghanistan targeting Pakistan will provoke direct retaliatory action.This approach seeks to establish a new baseline in Pakistan-Taliban relations — a 'new normal' where Pakistan asserts its sovereignty and security interests proactively and visibly.But analysts are perplexed over Pakistan's ultimate goal with this new hardline approach.Are the strikes meant to push the Afghan Taliban into action against the TTP? or is there a bigger plan?After the weekend clashes, Pakistan - for the first time - also questioned the legitimacy of the Taliban government, even though Islamabad was the movement's chief patron for a quarter of a century.Pakistan demanded ""concrete and verifiable actions against these terrorist elements by the Taliban regime"".Significantly, it declared: ""We also hope that one day, the Afghan people would be emancipated, and they would be governed by a true representative government.""This was the first major hint that Pakistan might be open to the idea of throwing its support behind anti-Taliban groups if the current regime continues to ignore Pakistan's security concerns.This escalating dynamic between Pakistan and the Taliban bears remarkable similarities to the India-Pakistan situation earlier in 2025.In April, in response to a spate of terrorist attacks orchestrated by Pakistan-based groups, India launched Operation Sindoor. This was a surgical counter-terrorism campaign targeting terror camps across the Line of Control and deeper inside Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir.After the operation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made it clear that cross-border terrorism would no longer be tolerated, signaling a shift from reactive to proactive and offensive counterterrorism measures.""Terrorism must be crushed at its roots,"" PM Modi emphasised in key speeches following the operation. He highlighted that India would no longer remain complacent or defensive but take the fight to terrorist safe havens across the border.This was a stark departure from previous policies that relied primarily on defensive postures and diplomatic protests.PM Modi's approach sought to create a deterrence framework, warning Pakistan that continued use of terror proxies would only invite more severe repercussions. The impact was significant, forcing Islamabad to recalibrate its own counterterrorism and diplomacy strategies, even if publicly denying Indian claims.The Centre stressed that India would not hesitate to undertake ""pre-emptive"" action if future terrorist activities were launched from Pakistani soil. The message to Islamabad was unequivocal: Pakistan must dismantle terror infrastructure or face decisive consequences.This tough stance surprised many, including Pakistan, which protested vehemently against what it termed India’s ""cross-border aggression"". Yet PM Modi's approach has widely been seen as a game-changer in South Asian security dynamics, raising the bar for how states respond to terrorism.Analysts now speculate that Pakistan may be adopting a similar playbook in its handling of the Taliban.For years, Pakistan's official policy towards the Taliban was one of implicit support or cautious engagement, given their ideological affinities and shared interests to some extent.However, the recent strikes suggest Pakistan is recalibrating toward a more hardline posture that prioritises national security over ideological sympathies.One key motivation behind this could be Pakistan's desire to secure its western border more effectively after years of instability and violent spillovers.With the Taliban in power, Islamabad may see the need to assert dominance and clearly demarcate boundaries that opponents must not cross, even if it means direct military action inside Afghanistan.This mirrors India's move to push back decisively against terrorism and assert territorial and security integrity.If Pakistan truly adopts a stance akin to India's Operation Sindoor doctrine, the implications for regional security could be profound.It indicates a shift from proxy or indirect conflicts toward more direct and overt military engagements aimed at deterrence. This may result in a recalibrated security architecture where Pakistan no longer tolerates Taliban aggression emanating from Afghan territory, just as India refuses to tolerate terrorism from Pakistan.However, this approach also risks escalating tensions further. The border clashes have already resulted in casualties on both sides and threaten to spiral into a wider conflict if not managed carefully.Whether Pakistan can sustain this new posture against the Taliban depends on several factors.Domestically, it will require strong military and political consensus to justify cross-border actions that risk escalating conflict. There are also challenges in controlling non-state actors within its own borders who may have sympathies with the Taliban or other militant groups.Externally, Pakistan's relationship with the Taliban is complex, given their historic ties, shared ethnic Pashtun links, and mutual geopolitical interests, including countering Indian influence.Moving toward a policy of strikes and retribution involves recalibrating these relationships and could alienate influential factions within Pakistan’s security establishment.The ongoing clashes and Pakistan’s direct strikes raise critical questions about the trajectory of Pakistan-Taliban relations and broader Afghanistan stability. Will this 'new normal' lead to a more disciplined, deterrence-based approach to cross-border militancy? Or will it trigger cyclical escalation?","Recent deadly clashes between Pakistan and the Taliban along their shared border signal a major shift in Islamabad's approach towards a group that it had hoped would become an ally. Far from becoming a partner, the Taliban has now emerged as the single-biggest threat to Pakistan's security. Pakistan appears intent on sending a clear warning: any future terrorist operations from Afghanistan targeting Pakistan will provoke direct retaliatory action.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124601085,imgsize-988950,width-400,resizemode-4/a-pakistani-tank-captured-by-taliban-fighters-during-the-recent-border-clashes-photo-credit-ap.jpg"

You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile… There are no ties, direct or indirect, as of today.” He also warned that hostilities could resume “at any time.”","Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to a 48-hour temporary ceasefire beginning Wednesday evening. The announcement came hours after Pakistan carried out precision strikes targeting key Taliban positions in Kandahar and Kabul. The escalation follows a string of border skirmishes beginning last weekend, including an attack in the Spin Boldak area of Balochistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124581740,imgsize-278487,width-400,resizemode-4/both-countries-declare-ceasefire.jpg"

Pakistan has secured a $1.2 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund . IMF on Tuesday said that it has reached a staff-level agreement with the South Asian country under its ongoing loan program, paving the way for Islamabad to access $1.2 billion pending approval from the Fund's Executive Board.According to the official statement issued by the IMF, Pakistan will receive $1 billion through the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and another $200 million under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), taking the total disbursements under both programs to about $3.3 billion.""The IMF team has reached a staff-level agreement with the Pakistani authorities on the second review of the 37-month Extended Arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the first review of the 28-month arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF). The staff-level agreement is subject to approval by the IMF Executive Board. Upon approval, Pakistan will have access to about US$1.0 billion (SDR 760 million) under the EFF and about US$200 million (SDR 154 million) under the RSF, bringing total disbursements under the two arrangements to about US$3.3 billion,"" the IMF said in an official statement.""Supported by the EFF, Pakistan's economic program is entrenching macroeconomic stability and rebuilding market confidence,"" the IMF said in its statement.The Fund noted that the country's recovery ""remains on track,"" citing contained inflation, stronger external buffers, and improving financial conditions reflected in narrowing sovereign spreads.IMF officials said the next tranche would be released once the board signs off on the review — a standard step in the Fund's lending framework, where loan disbursements follow successful periodic assessments.""The recovery remains on track, with the FY25 current account recording a surplus—the first in 14 years, the fiscal primary balance surpassing the program target, inflation remaining contained, external buffers strengthening, and financial conditions improving as sovereign spreads have narrowed significantly,"" it added.Pakistan has committed to maintaining a tight and data-dependent monetary policy and strengthening climate resilience — a key demand from the IMF after the floods devastated large parts of the country.""The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to the EFF- and RSF-supported programs, and to maintaining sound and prudent macroeconomic policies while advancing ongoing structural reforms,"" the statement added.Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said earlier in the day that Pakistan was close to finalising the agreement after an IMF team concluded its review visit last week. ""The staff-level deal marks a major step forward,"" he told reporters, according to Reuters, signalling renewed investor confidence.Aurangzeb also revealed that Pakistan plans to return to international capital markets, starting with its first-ever green bond denominated in Chinese yuan before the end of 2025.

Pakistan-Afghanistan Clashes: Heavy Fighting Along Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Border, Taliban Posts Damaged

Poll Should countries take stronger action to secure their borders against militant attacks? Yes, strict security is necessary No, dialogue and diplomacy are better





Pakistani troops engaged in heavy fighting with Afghan Taliban fighters on Tuesday night along the Kurram district border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The clashes came after the Taliban and militants linked to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan , called Fitna al-Khawarij by authorities, reportedly opened fire without warning.PTV News said several Taliban posts were heavily damaged, including at least one tank, and fighters fled their positions. Later reports added that additional posts and tank positions, including Shamsadar post, were destroyed, and a senior Fitna al-Khawarij commander was killed.Earlier, Pakistan’s foreign secretary Amna Baloch briefed resident ambassadors in Islamabad, stressing “Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns and its unwavering resolve to protect its territorial integrity and national security.”Over the weekend, Taliban forces allegedly attacked Pakistani border posts, killing 23 troops. Islamabad responded, claiming more than 200 Taliban and allied militants were killed. Kabul called the strike “retaliatory,” accusing Pakistan of air raids inside Afghan territory last week, which Pakistan has denied.","Pakistan-Afghanistan Clashes: Heavy Fighting Along Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Border, Taliban Posts Damaged.

India Spreading False Narratives About Hindu Attacks in Bangladesh: Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus





Dhaka: Twenty-five political parties, including former PM Khaleda Zia’s BNP and Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami, signed the July National Charter — a consensus on national reforms — on Friday, with chief adviser Muhammad Yunus saying it symbolises a “tune of unity” ahead of the national elections due in Feb.The charter, which terms the Awami League as “fascist”, marks the “July uprising” — that led to the Sheikh Hasna govt’s fall last year — but some of the movement’s main members and their National Citizen Party (NCP) — also a key JeI ally — boycotted the event claiming the document was signed without ensuring “legal basis”.“It’s a great day. It’s the beginning of New Bangladesh,” Yunus said after the event. He urged political leaders to have talks for a fair election.","Twenty-five political parties, including former PM Khaleda Zia's BNP and Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami, signed the July National Charter on Friday.

The Big Picture



What’s Happening



Why It Matters



The Background



What’s Next







It’s the kind of video you’d expect to stumble upon on a jihadist message board in 2004: three hooded hostages kneeling, their captors standing grim-faced behind them, Kalashnikovs poised like punctuation marks. The lighting is harsh, the script familiar — a finger jabs at the air, a threat is uttered, and you brace for the worst.Except this time, the script flips. The hood comes off, and instead of a terrified prisoner, there’s an American influencer with a movie-star grin and a cheery “Welcome to Afghanistan!” The scene cuts to pull-ups on tank barrels, selfies with Kalashnikovs, and tourists laughing in the shadow of a regime that once banned music and stoned women.This is not satire. It’s marketing — part of a growing trend in which a new breed of social-media provocateurs, dubbed “Talibros,” are repackaging Taliban-controlled Afghanistan as the ultimate offbeat travel destination. Their content straddles the line between shock humour and soft propaganda, turning a war-scarred theocracy into a backdrop for clout-chasing, contrarianism, and a very modern kind of ideological theatre.The Talibros are not journalists, historians, or analysts. They’re content creators — mostly men, mostly Western — who package Taliban-ruled Afghanistan as the ultimate contrarian experience. Their message is simple and seductive: everything you’ve heard is wrong.They insist that women aren’t oppressed because they’re visible in marketplaces. That Taliban fighters aren’t dangerous because they crack jokes on camera. That a country that banned female education past the age of twelve and removed women’s books from universities is simply “misunderstood.”The aesthetic is part Vice gonzo reporting, part frat-house vlog, and part soft-focus propaganda. And it works — because it flatters an audience exhausted by “mainstream narratives” and eager to believe that they, not the gullible masses, are finally seeing the “real story.”Aryubi’s video was just the start. Addison Pierre Maalouf, better known as Arab to his two million YouTube subscribers, shot to fame touring Afghanistan’s “women’s markets.” He mugs for the camera, pretending astonishment that women speak in public, while an overlay of a Western news headline flashes on screen: Taliban Bans Women from Speaking. The implication: media hysteria. The reality: women remain subject to draconian restrictions, their public presence tightly policed and their educational prospects gutted.Meanwhile, Kurt Caz, a South African travel vlogger, shifted from filming dangerous neighbourhoods in Venezuela and Kenya to walking the streets of Frankfurt with far-right activists, complaining about “illegal migrants” and dubbing the city “Crackfurt.” The pivot is revealing: the Talibros no longer just document “risk” abroad — they now weaponise it at home, warning young Western men that their cities will collapse too.It would be comforting to dismiss this as fringe stupidity — testosterone tourism with a side of irony. But the Talibros are playing a bigger game. They’ve mastered the algorithmic dark arts of the attention economy: weaponise distrust, monetise outrage, and flatten complexity into punchy, meme-able contrarianism.They know that traditional media is suffering a credibility crisis. Only a quarter of under-50s say they trust the news to report “fully and fairly.” Into that vacuum step the self-anointed truth-tellers, promising real insight while building parasocial empires on YouTube and Patreon. Once viewers stop trusting journalists, they don’t turn sceptical — they turn loyal. Loyal to them.The irony is that the Talibros aren’t selling reality at all. They’re selling a feeling — the dopamine hit of believing you’re in on a secret, that you’re smarter than the “sheeple.” And the deeper that feeling runs, the harder it is to shake.Travel content has always flirted with danger — explorers trekking through war zones, vloggers sneaking into North Korea, influencers chasing adrenaline in “forbidden” places. But the Talibros have twisted that instinct into something more ideological.They’re heirs to a lineage of online provocateurs — Andrew Tate, Sneako, and the wider “red pill” sphere — who discovered that contrarianism isn’t just viral, it’s profitable. And they’ve applied that playbook to geopolitics: destabilise consensus, cherry-pick anecdotes, mock expertise, and present yourself as the only reliable narrator.Political economist William Davies captured this shift in Nervous States: when objective truth collapses, intuition becomes king. Facts don’t matter; vibes do. And nobody manipulates vibes better than a charismatic man with a GoPro, a grievance, and a Taliban escort.The Talibros are unlikely to fade — if anything, they’re a preview of the future. As platforms reward outrage over nuance and audiences grow hungrier for “unfiltered” content, the algorithm will keep boosting their blend of irony and ideology. Mainstream influencers like the Nelk Boys and Jake Paul, once prank-peddlers, are already edging into similar territory.The danger isn’t that audiences will start idolising the Taliban. It’s subtler — and more corrosive. It’s that they’ll stop believing anyone but the provocateurs. That truth will become just another aesthetic choice. That everything — beheadings, misogyny, religious extremism — will be reduced to content.And once that happens, the Talibros won’t just be influencers with a gimmick. They’ll be architects of a new kind of ignorance — one that laughs as it rewrites history, monetises trauma, and sells a war-torn nation as the latest backdrop for a YouTube thumbnail.","A new breed of social-media provocateurs, dubbed ‘Talibros,’ are repackaging Taliban-controlled Afghanistan as the ultimate offbeat travel destination.

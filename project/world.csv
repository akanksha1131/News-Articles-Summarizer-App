How astronauts stuck in space end up with Santa hats for Christmas? Internet flooded with conspiracy theories; Nasa responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-astronauts-stuck-in-space-ended-up-with-santa-hats-for-christmas-internet-flooded-with-questions-and-conspiracy-theories/articleshow/116644960.cms,"So, what's the real story behind the Christmas cheer at 250 miles above Earth? Turns out, the explanation is much simpler—and a lot more festive than anyone imagined.

When astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams were photographed wearing Santa hats next to a tiny Christmas tree aboard the International Space Station (ISS), the internet went into overdrive. The photos, taken earlier this week, seemed like a delightful holiday treat—until the questions started flooding in.""Did they take Santa hats with them before they launched?"" one curious commenter mused on X (formerly Twitter). ""Or did they knit them while they're up there?"" Another asked: ""These the same guys who went up for an 8-day mission in June?"" Some couldn’t resist joking, “The Gilligan’s Island theme song is playing in the background.”But not everyone was amused. The festive scene sparked wild conspiracy theories, with one commenter claiming that the entire space mission was a hoax. ""It’s all one big show,"" they said. Another went even further, suggesting that the astronauts were floating in a Hollywood studio, not outer space.So, what's the real story behind the Christmas cheer at 250 miles above Earth? Turns out, the explanation is much simpler—and a lot more festive than anyone imagined.Nasa confirmed that the Santa hats, along with presents and a tiny Christmas tree, were part of a 3-ton resupply mission that SpaceX launched to the ISS in late November, reported the New York Post. As part of the shipment—designed to replenish food, scientific equipment, and mission supplies—Nasa decided to sprinkle in a little holiday magic for the astronauts.Along with the usual foodstuffs like ham, turkey, potatoes, and vegetables, there were pies, cookies, and a few surprise decorations. After all, who wouldn't want a bit of Christmas cheer when stranded in space for months?In a video message that accompanied the holiday decorations, Suni Williams shared her gratitude for the season. ""It’s a great time up here. We get to spend it with all of our 'family' on the International Space Station,"" she said, referring to the seven astronauts currently in orbit. ""One of the best things about Christmas is the preparation, the anticipation, and just getting ready for the holiday. It's the togetherness that makes it special.""This isn’t Williams' first Christmas in space. In 2006, she spent the holidays in orbit during a planned mission. But this year’s Christmas in space is a bittersweet one. She and Wilmore launched in June for what was supposed to be an eight-day mission aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule. But things didn’t go as planned. The capsule experienced multiple technical issues, including leaks and thruster malfunctions. After several months of delays and discussions with Boeing, Nasa made the tough decision to return the spacecraft unmanned in September.As a result, Wilmore and Williams have been stuck on the ISS for nearly seven months—way past their expected return date. They had hoped to come home by now, but their ride back aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, which was originally set to depart in February, has been delayed until late March.While the situation might seem tough, the astronauts have kept a positive attitude, assuring the public they’re healthy and in high spirits. “We’re feeling good, working out, eating right, and having fun up here,” Williams said earlier this year in a Nasa video. “People are worried about us. Really, don’t worry about us.”","Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams were photographed wearing Santa hats next to a tiny Christmas tree.

"Pakistan launches series of airstrikes on Afghanistan, at least 15 killed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-launches-series-of-airstrikes-on-afghanistan-at-least-15-killed/articleshow/116645120.cms,"Pakistan launched a series of airstrikes targeting Afghanistan’s Barmal district in Paktika province on the night of December 24, killing at least 15 people, including women and children. The death toll is expected to climb as rescue efforts continue, according to reports by Khaama Press.The strikes hit seven villages, including Laman, where five members of a single family lost their lives.According to reports, Pakistani jets were responsible for the bombings, with Murg Bazaar village bearing significant destruction.The Taliban’s ministry of defence condemned the airstrikes and vowed retaliation. “Defending our land and sovereignty is our legitimate right,” the ministry stated, adding that ""Waziristani refugees"" were among the victims.Official casualty figures have not yet been disclosed, but at least 15 bodies have reportedly been recovered.The airstrikes occur against a backdrop of escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, particularly over the presence of militants from Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghan territory. Pakistan has repeatedly accused the Afghan Taliban of providing shelter to TTP fighters, who have increased attacks on Pakistani forces in recent months. In response, the Afghan Taliban denies these allegations, asserting that civilians, not militants, were targeted in the latest strikes.“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan considers this a brutal act against all international principles and blatant aggression and strongly condemns it,” said the Afghan ministry of defence. “The Islamic Emirate will not leave this cowardly act unanswered but rather considers the defense of its territory to be its inalienable right.”Islamabad contends that many TTP leaders and fighters have fled to Afghanistan, finding refuge in border provinces under Taliban protection. Afghan officials, however, have refuted these claims, stating that the victims of the bombings were primarily displaced civilians.The strikes came just after Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan’s special representative for Afghanistan, visited Kabul for discussions on trade and bilateral relations. The timing has fueled speculation about a deterioration in diplomatic ties between the two neighbors.The TTP, which ended a ceasefire with the Pakistani government in November 2022, has intensified its attacks on Pakistani security forces. These attacks have killed and injured dozens of soldiers in recent months, heightening security concerns in Islamabad.","Pakistan launched a series of airstrikes targeting Afghanistan’s Barmal district on December 24.

A symbol of the nation since 1782

Preston Cook’s discovery sparks legislation

Legislation passes through Congress

US President Joe Biden on Tuesday officially declared the bald eagle the national bird of the United States . The legislation, passed by Congress and signed by the President, amends the US Code to formally recognize the bald eagle's status. The bald eagle, recognizable by its white head, yellow beak, and brown body, has been a symbol of the nation for over 240 years.This designation grants the bald eagle the same official status as the national mammal ( American bison ), national flower (rose), and national tree (oak).In 1782, the bald eagle became a central part of the Great Seal of the United States , used on official documents. The seal includes the eagle, an olive branch, arrows, a shield, the motto ""E Pluribus Unum,"" and a constellation of stars. Congress designated the bald eagle as the national emblem that same year. Its image appears on various official items, including the presidential flag, military insignia, US currency, and government documents, according to USA.gov. However, until now, it lacked the official designation as the national bird. The bald eagle is native to North America.Preston Cook, a collector of eagle memorabilia, discovered the lack of official designation while writing a book. ""It makes me feel like I’m levitating,"" Cook said, as quoted by The Jamestown Sun. ""I am thrilled this bill has passed the Senate and now the House to honor, after 240 years, our living symbol, the bald eagle. This bill gives the bald eagle the recognition it fully deserves.""The House passed the bill on December 16 to make the designation official by voice vote. The Senate unanimously approved the bill in July. The bill was introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Representative Brad Finstad (R-Minn.).""More than 240 years ago, the Founding Fathers identified the bald eagle as a symbol of the strength and independence promised in our new nation,"" Finstad said, as quoted by The Jamestown Sun. ""Since then, we have revered this majestic creature as the unquestionable icon of the United States. Today, we rightfully recognize the bald eagle as our official national bird — bestowing an honor that is long overdue.”Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), a co-sponsor of the Senate bill, said, ""There is nothing more American than a bald eagle soaring across the Wyoming sky. These majestic creatures have long been viewed as the official bird of this country and it is past time we made it official without costing taxpayers a single cent.”Minnesota, Finstad and Klobuchar’s home state, boasts a large bald eagle population","President Joe Biden officially declared the bald eagle the national bird of the United States.

Who is Valentina Gomez? MAGA activist’s 'migrant execution' video sparks outrage after NYC subway murder: 'They deserve to be ended',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-valentina-gomez-maga-activists-migrant-execution-video-sparks-outrage-after-nyc-subway-murder-they-deserve-to-be-ended/articleshow/116644720.cms,"Valentina Gomez shared a contentious video on X in which she called for the public execution of undocumented immigrants

Who is Valentina Gomez

The

execution video

and its aftermath

A history of controversial stances

The broader impact

Valentina Gomez , a Colombian-born American real estate investor and political activist, has ignited national outrage following the release of a graphic video depicting the simulated execution of a migrant. Known for her provocative statements and far-right rhetoric , Gomez’s latest stunt has drawn widespread condemnation and raised questions about the impact of extremist messaging in American politics.Her video comes after an illegal migrant was charged with the murder and arson after setting an unknown woman on fire while on the New York City subway.Born on May 8, 1999, in Medellín, Colombia, Gomez immigrated to the US with her family in 2009, settling in Jersey City, New Jersey. She first gained attention as a real estate investor, but it was her entrance into politics that made her a polarizing figure, reported the Daily Mail.In 2024, she ran for Missouri Secretary of State, where she made headlines for her controversial stances. Her campaign included inflammatory videos, such as one where she declared, ""Don't be weak and gay,"" while running through an LGBTQ+ neighborhood in St. Louis, and another where she burned LGBTQ+ books, calling them “grooming, indoctrinating, and sexualizing.” She finished sixth out of eight candidates in the Republican primary, securing only 7.4% of the vote.Despite this setback, Gomez has continued to push her controversial views, often through social media, where she has been banned multiple times for violating platform guidelines. Her videos, which often tackle culture war issues such as LGBTQ+ rights and gun control, have made her a significant figure in far-right circles.In her most recent viral video, Gomez posted footage of herself shooting a hooded dummy, tied to a chair, in the back of the head with a handgun. “Public executions for any illegal that rapes or kills an American. They don’t deserve deportation, they deserve to be ended,” she says in the video. The clip was quickly censored by X (formerly Twitter) due to its violent content but continued to spread widely across social media.While many decried the video as promoting violence and extremism, some of Gomez’s followers praised her, echoing her sentiments about tough justice for undocumented immigrants. “What is wrong with these people?” one commenter wrote, while others supported her call for harsher measures.After the video was restricted, Gomez took to her platform to defend her actions, saying, “My video being restricted & my account getting suspended shows all of you that I am the biggest threat to the establishment. I don’t need their money. Stay strapped.” She also added that similar treatment should apply to pedophiles, criticizing Congress for its perceived inaction on important issues, reported the Daily Mail.This is not the first time Gomez has courted controversy. In February, she filmed herself burning LGBTQ+ books, vowing to ban similar literature if elected. She has also made headlines for her inflammatory remarks against transgender people, including a public attack on transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, and her stance on the 2020 election, which she believes was stolen from Donald Trump.Gomez’s social media presence, marked by unapologetic declarations such as “Jesus is King. MAGA . America First,” has earned her both fervent supporters and staunch critics.In addition to her provocative social media antics, Gomez’s political ambitions are far from over. She recently announced plans to run for Congress in Texas, though she has yet to specify which incumbent Republican she will challenge.Gomez’s rise has sparked broader discussions about the role of social media in amplifying extremist views and the consequences of political figures using inflammatory rhetoric to gain attention. While her supporters argue she speaks truth to power, many fear her brand of politics is dangerously divisive, further polarizing the nation.Her actions have even had repercussions within her family. Her brother, Jonathan Gomez, was fired from his position as an aide to Jersey City’s mayor after it was revealed he had made donations to her campaign.","Valentina Gomez, a Colombian-born American real estate investor and political activist, has ignited national outrage following the release of a graphic video depicting the simulated execution of a migrant.

""On Saturday, I went on Fox & Friends and said, 'Democrats have a stench of loser hanging over them.' As soon as I said that, there were boycott campaigns against me—unblock, unfollow campaigns.""She reported losing a significant number of social media followers after voicing her opinions and supporting Republican Pete Hegseth.""I lost tens of thousands of followers because I dared to tell the truth,"" Li said. ""In a cult, you can't tell the truth or ask questions, but I'm done with that.""Li compared leaving the Democratic Party to ""leaving a cult,"" saying in the interview, ""It's like leaving a cult.""Li criticized Harris and Biden, questioning their leadership and political strategies.

The event featured virtual appearances by Hollywood stars like Jennifer Lopez and Meryl Streep, drawing hundreds of thousands of viewers.Li said that she had been accused of working as a ""communist spy,"" an allegation she found deeply offensive given her family history.""They're calling me a spy for the regime that killed my great-grandfather, and these are the people who call themselves the social justice warriors,"" she told Morgan. ""They're going headfirst into racism anytime someone dares to disagree with them. I want to be a part of the team that says men are men and women are women, and men shouldn't play in women's sports.""She criticized the Democratic Party, saying, ""All these so-called Democrats, the party of inclusion, the party of diversity, masks off. And it's even worse because they pretend to occupy the moral high ground. They pretend to be so loving and caring and embracing of diversity, but all of a sudden, when I dare to utter any criticisms of the goddess Kamala Harris, I get ostracized. Me, after having raised tens of millions of dollars for the party.""Li claimed that President-elect Donald Trump's allies have treated her more ""humanely"" than her former party.She expressed her intention to attend Trump's inauguration in January 2025 and work with organizations she considers to have ""common decency.""Li added, ""People on Trump's team have already reached out to me to see if I'd be willing to switch.

Which are the 5 longest caves in the world?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/which-are-the-5-longest-caves-in-the-world/articleshow/116627385.cms,"5 longest caves in the world

(259.5 miles)

Sac Actun

Jewel Cave

(220.5 miles)

Earth still possesses a lot of unknown treasures hidden underneath its surface, massive cave systems that remain not explored yet. Despite all those years of exploration, still each year, courageous cave explorers discover new tunnels and rooms underground and thereby stretch the known limits of the world's longest and biggest cave systems. From the vast labyrinths in France to the intricate networks in Vietnam, every discovery brings new secrets to the geology, history, and ecosystems of the planet. The allure of these subterranean realms is undeniable, with unique rock formations, underground rivers, and uncharted expanses. Yet, incredibly, even with all the advancements in exploration, there are still miles of caves that remain hidden, untouched by human eyes. These undiscovered caves are potential new frontiers, and new frontiers are a huge source of curiosity and adventures for the future of cave explorations, as well as many mysteries waiting to be unraveled beneath the earth.Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, USA, holds the record for the world's longest continuous cave system. It was first entered by humans 4,000 to 5,000 years ago, probably to mine gypsum and other minerals. The native explorers ventured nearly 20 miles into the cave using only torchlight.By the 19th century, Mammoth Cave was already a tourist destination, famous for its massive stalactites and vast chambers. In 1842, an enslaved cave guide named Stephen Bishop created the first map of the cave from memory. However, it wasn't until the 1950s that cavers began mapping its full extent.The break-through came in 1972 when explorers identified a passage linking Mammoth Cave with the adjacent Flint Ridge Cave System that more than doubled the cave's length to 144 miles. Mapping remains a long-term exercise as still to date new passages keep appearing. In recent years, more than half a million visit Mammoth Cave each year.Ox Bel Ha, located in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico, is one of the world's longest cave systems, spanning more than 308 miles. Its name, ""Three Paths of Water,"" comes from the Maya language and describes the labyrinth of underwater passageways that make up much of the cave system. The cave was first explored in the late 1990s, with significant discoveries being made by divers.What is more interesting about Ox Bel Ha is the extent of the underwater cave network, one of the longest and most complex in the world. The system is not just a natural wonder but is also of great archaeological importance due to the ancient Mayan relics and remnants of prehistoric life that it contains.It is a part of the huge subterranean water network called Gran Acuífero Maya, which supplies fresh water to the region. While Ox Bel Ha is large in scale, much of it has yet to be explored, with divers and cave explorers continually mapping and discovering its depths.Shuanghe Cave is another in China, covering the incredible 259.5 miles. It is known to be one of the longest cave systems in the world. A vast subterranean network in the Guizhou Province was discovered in 1980. The cave hosts enormous passageways as well as stalactites and stalagmites and presents a wide variety of very unique geological formations.Shuanghe Cave is remarkable for its immense scale, with some of the areas still unexplored. The cave system has attracted attention from scientists and adventurers in equal measure, as it would give a fascinating glimpse of the natural history of that region. Apart from these geological wonders, the cave also holds environmental importance, forming an integral part of the local ecosystem. Despite its vastness, the cave remains a very challenging environment to explore because it requires skilled cavers to navigate its tunnels and chambers.Sac Actun is one of the world's longest known cave systems. It is found in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico and stretches over 234 miles. The underwater cave is part of the highly complex Sistema Sac Actun, consisting of both dry and submerged passages. The cave system is renowned for its stunning limestone formations, crystal-clear waters, and archaeological significance.First discovered in the 1980s, Sac Actun is an active site of immense exploration which not only discovers the geological marvels but also ancient artefacts and human remains which reflect its utilization by early human civilizations as a ritual space. Divers and cavers also face a difficult situation because some parts of the cave remain flooded within the world's largest underwater cave system.Sac Actun forms part of Mexico's natural and cultural heritage, where on-going research continues to unearth the region's ancient history and geology. It still attracts scientists and adventure seekers.Jewel Cave is a cave located in the Black Hills of South Dakota, USA, which is the third-longest cave system in the world, covering a distance of 220.5 miles. This remarkable cave was discovered in 1900 and is characterized by an outstanding array of calcite crystals that give it its name. The cave contains a labyrinth of passageways, chambers, and unique geological formations, which have made it a very popular destination for researchers and tourists alike.Jewel Cave is known particularly for its delicate and ornate formations, such as large clumps of calcite crystals, delicate stalactites, and stalagmites. The cave also has rather rare formations, such as ""boxwork,"" composed of thin, lattice-like patterns that form on the sides of the cave. Much of the cave was explored, but it still reveals new passages and chambers, thus ongoing exploration.The cave forms part of the Jewel Cave National Monument, which is open for public viewing. Visitors can be guided through it for them to witness its underground magnificence.","Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, USA, holds the record for the world's longest continuous cave system. Ox Bel Ha, located in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico, is one of the world’s longest cave systems, spanning more than 308 miles. Shuanghe Cave is another in China, covering the incredible 259.5 miles. Sac Actun forms part of the Gran Acuífero Maya, which supplies fresh water to the region.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116627762,imgsize-38866,width-400,resizemode-4/116627762.jpg"
Removing H1B cap for Indians? David Sacks and Elon Musk back Sriram Krishnan's views on green cards,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/removing-h1b-cap-for-indians-david-sacks-and-elon-musk-back-sriram-krishnans-views-on-green-cards/articleshow/116631049.cms,"Laura Loomer's Critique



Accusations that Krishnan’s policies prioritize foreign workers over American STEM graduates.

Criticism of Trump for allowing individuals she deemed ""career leftists"" to hold positions in his administration.

The Controversy Around H-1B Policies



Defending Sriram Krishnan’s Policies



Highly skilled immigrants contribute significantly to the US economy, founding companies and creating jobs.

Immigration reforms that prioritize merit can strengthen America’s position as a leader in technology and entrepreneurship.

Krishnan’s proposals aim to address inefficiencies in the current system, not to undermine American workers.

Misinterpretations and Political Backlash



The Role of AI and Immigration in US Policy



Indians and the H-1B Visa



The appointment of Sriram Krishnan as Senior Policy Advisor for Artificial Intelligence at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has sparked a heated debate online. Laura Loomer , a far-right commentator, took to X (formerly Twitter) to express her disapproval, claiming Krishnan’s appointment was inconsistent with the ""America First"" agenda. She criticized his support for immigration reforms, including the removal of country-specific caps on green cards, as undermining American STEM graduates and the domestic job market.Loomer’s accusations prompted swift rebuttals from prominent figures like David Sacks and Elon Musk . Sacks clarified the nuances of Krishnan’s views, stating, ""Point of clarification: Sriram didn’t say he wants to remove all caps on green cards. He said he wants to remove country caps on green cards. Right now, every country in the world gets allocated the same number of green cards, no matter how many qualified applicants it has. So applicants from India have an 11-year wait, whereas applicants from many other countries have no wait at all. Sriram still supports skills-based criteria for receiving a green card, not making the program unlimited.""Elon Musk succinctly supported Sacks’ position, commenting, ""Makes sense.""Loomer’s original post expressed concerns about Krishnan’s alleged alignment with policies she described as harmful to American workers. She labeled his appointment a betrayal of Trump’s ""America First"" agenda and suggested that figures like Krishnan were attempting to enrich themselves through government contracts.Loomer’s claims included:The H-1B visa program, which allows US companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers in specialized fields, has long been a contentious issue. Critics argue that the program is often abused, with companies using it to undercut wages and displace American workers. Others view it as a vital tool for attracting global talent, especially in STEM fields.Krishnan’s advocacy for removing country-specific caps on green cards—not eliminating caps entirely—has been misinterpreted by detractors like Loomer. Current immigration laws allocate the same number of green cards to every country, regardless of demand. This creates significant delays for applicants from high-demand countries like India, who often wait over a decade for approval, while applicants from low-demand countries face no such delays. Krishnan’s position is that merit-based reforms would streamline the process for skilled workers, ensuring the U.S. remains competitive in the global tech economy.Supporters of Krishnan’s policies, including influential voices like Sacks and Musk, emphasize the importance of attracting skilled immigrants to foster innovation. They argue that:Loomer’s criticism reflects broader concerns among some conservatives about immigration policy and its impact on American workers. However, her framing of Krishnan as a ""career leftist"" and opponent of the ""America First"" agenda has been widely debunked. Krishnan’s track record includes notable achievements in the tech industry, investments in American companies, and a commitment to fostering innovation domestically.As Senior Policy Advisor for AI, Krishnan’s primary focus will be shaping the nation’s strategy on artificial intelligence. However, the debate surrounding his appointment underscores the intersection of technology, immigration, and politics. While some view his stance as progressive, others interpret it as a challenge to traditional conservative values. The ongoing discourse highlights the complexities of balancing economic growth, national security, and immigration reform in an increasingly competitive global landscape.The H-1B visa issue for Indians stems from systemic inefficiencies and outdated immigration policies in the US, particularly around green card allocation. The primary bottleneck lies in the per-country cap on employment-based green cards, which limits the number of green cards any single country can receive annually to 7% of the total pool. This cap applies uniformly, regardless of the size of a country’s population or the demand for visas from its citizens.India, with its large pool of highly skilled professionals, particularly in technology and STEM fields, produces a disproportionately high number of applicants for H-1B visas and green cards. Due to the 7% cap, Indian applicants face staggering delays—sometimes waiting over a decade for green card approval. In contrast, applicants from smaller countries with fewer applicants may experience little to no wait time.The H-1B program allows US companies to hire foreign workers in specialized fields, but these workers often aim to transition to permanent residency through green cards. The backlog disproportionately affects Indians, as the demand from this group far exceeds the allocated number of green cards. This leads to years of uncertainty for workers and their families, with challenges like visa renewals, restrictions on job mobility, and limitations on spousal employment.Advocates for reform, including figures like Sriram Krishnan, propose removing country-specific caps to prioritize merit and streamline the process for skilled workers. Critics argue that such reforms might disadvantage American workers by intensifying competition. However, supporters emphasize that highly skilled immigrants drive innovation, create jobs, and strengthen the US economy. Addressing this issue requires balancing global competitiveness with fairness in immigration policy to alleviate backlogs and retain top talent in the US.","Sriram Krishnan is the Senior Policy Advisor for Artificial Intelligence at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.

A Resignation Amid Scandal



A scathing report from the House Ethics Committee has laid bare shocking allegations against former Representative Matt Gaetz. The findings, published on December 23, 2024, reveal a pattern of alleged misconduct involving sexual activity, drug use, and abuse of power spanning several years. The report is based on testimony, financial records, and communications gathered during the investigation, which concluded despite Gaetz's resignation from Congress .The report alleges Gaetz paid women for sex from 2017 to 2020, including a 17-year-old girl in 2017. These payments were often made through apps like Venmo, with innocuous descriptions masking their purpose.Payments totaling tens of thousands of dollars were flagged as likely connected to sexual activities, with some witnesses describing the transactions as routine arrangements.The report details that Gaetz frequently used illegal drugs, including cocaine and ecstasy, during his interactions with women. Witnesses described instances where drugs were either brought by participants or supplied at Gaetz's request.Drugs were also reportedly present during a 2018 trip to the Bahamas, where Gaetz and others engaged in similar behavior.Gaetz allegedly abused his congressional position to provide favors for individuals with whom he had personal relationships. This includes aiding a woman in obtaining a passport under false pretenses.This act raises concerns about the misuse of official resources for personal benefit.The Committee found Gaetz deliberately obstructed its investigation, refusing to provide testimony, ignoring subpoenas, and publicly mischaracterizing the inquiry.Gaetz’s lack of cooperation and his public defiance delayed the investigation and complicated efforts to gather critical evidence.The report concludes Gaetz violated House rules, federal and state laws, and ethical standards, bringing significant discredit to Congress.While the Committee did not find sufficient evidence to pursue federal sex trafficking charges, the breadth of the allegations has cast a shadow over his legacy.Gaetz resigned from Congress on November 14, 2024, amid speculation over a potential appointment as Attorney General in the incoming administration. However, his withdrawal from consideration for the role following the report has left his political future in doubt.","The House Ethics Committee published a scathing report on December 23, 2024.

Social media is flooded with claims that the victim of the NYC subway horror was a 29-year-old woman Amelia Carter. A photo of the said Amelia Carter is also going viral. But police have not yet identified the victim who died after being set on fire by accused Sebastian Zapeta Calil who was arrested and has been charged with murder.Social media users said the media is trying to hide the victim's face and hence the name has not been revealed. One post said she was a Penn grad student and also shared a bio where it was written that she was working full-time toward a PhD in History and Sociology of Science at the University of Pennsylvania.Mystery over the identity of the victim deepens as it has not been revealed even two days after she turned to ashes inside a subway train. X has added community notes that Amelia Carter is a fabricated identity. The victim has not yet been identified. The false claims of some Amelia Carter being the victim of the subway horror started from a TikTok post.Going by the community notes, the photo was generated with artificial intelligence to create a cryptocurrency scam. There is no truth behind the name and the photo.On December 22, the unidentified woman's clothes were set on fire by Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, the illegal migrant from Guatemala who has been described by the authorities as a 'madman' who did not even know the victim. The woman was sleeping when her clothes were set on fire. She kept on burning and when the NYPD reached to douse the fire, it was too late to rescue her.A video has surfaced showing an NYPD officer walking by the station while the victim was burning inside the train drawing shock and criticism from social media users who also questioned why no one else helped the woman.The accused was arrested from a different station almost eight hours after the incident based on the tip-off of the local people.

The tragic scene

The 'Daniel Penny Factor'

The NYPD’s inaction

A question of accountability

Zapeta-Calil’s arrest

A broader conversation on public safety

In a horrifying incident that has left New Yorkers grappling with questions of responsibility and inaction, a woman was set on fire aboard a Brooklyn subway train—and no one stepped in to help. As the flames engulfed her body, shocking footage reveals a group of onlookers, including police officers, who either watched or walked past without offering aid. The incident, which unfolded on Sunday morning, December 22, at Stillwell Avenue station, has sparked outrage across the city, with many wondering: why didn’t anyone intervene?The woman, believed to be homeless, was reportedly asleep when Sebastian Zapeta-Calil , 33, an illegal Guatemalan immigrant who had sneaked back into the country after being deported, allegedly set her on fire. In a chilling video shared online, at least three bystanders can be seen looking on as the victim’s clothing is consumed by flames. One individual even filmed the horrific scene rather than offering help.Amid the chaos, a New York Police Department (NYPD) officer, stationed outside the subway car, seemingly did nothing as the fire spread. The flames eventually consumed the victim, who tragically died at the scene. In the video, another officer walks past the burning woman, raising his hands as if unsure of how to respond. Only Zapeta-Calil, the alleged perpetrator, is seen moving closer, fanning the flames with his shirt before being subdued by police hours later.The incident quickly gained national attention, with many speculating that the bystanders’ reluctance to intervene could be attributed to the ongoing public debate surrounding civilian involvement in dangerous situations. Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels and a longtime community activist, pointed to the high-profile case of Daniel Penny, the ex-Marine who was acquitted after choking Jordan Neely, a homeless man, to death on a subway train earlier this year. Sliwa argued that Penny’s legal ordeal, in which he faced charges for his actions, may have deterred others from stepping in to help during moments of crisis.“Nobody came to her aid,” Sliwa said. “People are frozen now. They think, ‘I don’t want to get jammed up like Penny.’” He believes the fear of legal repercussions is dissuading potential Good Samaritans from acting in emergencies.While the public’s response was one of shock and anger, so too was the reaction to the NYPD’s response. In a scathing critique, former NYPD Commissioner Bernard Kerik condemned the officers for their apparent indifference. “No one even attempted to help this woman. They watched like cowards,” Kerik said, echoing the sentiments of many who saw the officers passively observing the horror unfold.Pat Calvin, a former EMT, expressed his outrage, stating that both he and his father—who had worked for the NYPD—were appalled by the officers’ lack of action. “If I were there, I would have run to help her,” Calvin said. “The police were right there, and they did nothing.”New York residents and activists took to social media to voice their frustration. One user wrote, “The NYPD will shoot you down for jumping the turnstile, but they’ll walk past a woman on fire? Shameful.” Another criticized the officers for failing to intervene and lamented the lack of community responsibility, saying, “I hate that we have no sense of responsibility towards each other.”In the aftermath, questions abound: why did no one step in? Was it fear of legal consequences, or a growing apathy towards others’ suffering? Some critics pointed to a system that seems to foster hesitation in the face of crime or violence, citing the ‘revolving door justice’ that has become a concern for many New Yorkers. “There are a lot of people in the city who are afraid to act because they feel unsupported by the city’s elected officials,” said Gerard Kassar, chairman of the Conservative Party.Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch addressed the officers’ response, saying they were unaware that Zapeta-Calil, who was later arrested, was involved in the crime. Chief of Transit Joe Gulotta clarified that the officers were attempting to find a fire extinguisher while the tragedy unfolded. However, many critics argue that there was a greater failure at play—the failure to act when a life was in immediate danger.Zapeta-Calil was arrested hours after the attack, when a group of high school students on another train recognized him and alerted authorities. He was detained at Herald Square after officers tracked him down, wearing the same distinctive clothes he was seen in during the attack. The suspect has been charged with first- and second-degree murder and arson.Despite his claims that he was drunk and does not remember setting the woman on fire, Zapeta-Calil’s actions have been described as “depraved” by the NYPD. Police investigators believe the victim and the suspect did not know each other, raising the possibility of an unprovoked attack.This tragedy has sparked a broader conversation on public safety, legal responsibility, and the moral obligation to intervene in dangerous situations. Governor Kathy Hochul, who had previously made public statements praising the safety of the subway system, was swiftly criticized for her tone-deafness, as the news of the woman’s death broke shortly after she posted photos touting the safety improvements in the subway system.While Hochul has pledged to increase police presence and resources in the subway system, the public’s trust in the NYPD has been shaken. As one social media user put it, “Where are the Daniel Pennys when you need them?”","A woman was set on fire aboard a Brooklyn subway train, and no one stepped in to help.

US President elect Donald Trump's call to acquire Greenland has prompted the Danish government to announce a huge boost in defence spending for the Artic territory, according to news outlet BBC.Greenland’s Prime Minister, Mute Egede, firmly responded to former US President Donald Trump’s recent remarks by saying, “We are not for sale.” Danish defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen also addressed the situation, describing the timing of the remarks as an “irony of fate.”Poulsen revealed that a substantial defence investment, amounting to a “double-digit billion” figure, is being planned for Greenland.The defence package includes funding for two new inspection ships, two long-range drones, and two additional dog sled teams. It also aims to enhance staffing at Arctic Command in Nuuk, Greenland’s capital, and upgrade one of the island’s three primary civilian airports to accommodate F-35 supersonic fighter jets.Poulsen acknowledged past shortcomings, saying, “We have not invested enough in the Arctic for many years; now we are planning a stronger presence.”Trump’s comments, made on his social media platform Truth Social, touched on Greenland's strategic value to the United States, declaring that “ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity” for global security and freedom. This isn’t however the first time Trump has expressed interest in purchasing Greenland—he proposed a similar idea during his first term, which was promptly rejected by Danish and Greenland officials.The notion of US interest in acquiring Greenland dates back to the 1860s under President Andrew Johnson. Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, holds significant strategic importance, housing a large US space facility and sitting along the shortest route between North America and Europe. The island is also rich in mineral resources.","US President elect Donald Trump's call to acquire Greenland has prompted the Danish government to announce a huge boost in defence spending for the Artic territory.

Santa's work will not be affected by mystery drones: US Air Force,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/santas-work-will-not-be-affected-by-mystery-drones-us-air-force/articleshow/116645403.cms,"Interest goes global

US Air Force on Tuesday said the Santa Claus need not be concerned about recent mystery drone sighting over New Jersey as an annual tradition of ""tracking"" Saint Nick is in action.The US Air Force's reassurances came as the joint US-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad) reported that Santa and his reindeer were making stops in Russia and Iran after visiting countries further east including Japan, North Korea and Indonesia.According to the Norad Santa tracker , Santa is in Canada. Santa's journey this year comes after weeks of mysterious sightings of alleged drones in the US state of New Jersey, sparking worldwide curiosity even as many of the reported incidents were debunked.""Of course we are concerned about drones and anything else in the air,"" Norad commander Guillot told Fox News. ""But I don't foresee any difficulty at all with drones for Santa this year.""Norad’s Santa tracker originated in 1955 when a Colorado newspaper accidentally printed a hotline number for children to call Santa, which instead connected them to Norad's military operations center. Colonel Harry Shoup, then the director of operations, answered one such call and immediately recognized the mix-up.""But (he) didn't want to upset him. So he started talking to the young child and passed along information"" on Santa's location, Canadian Air Force Major-General William Radiff, Norad's current director of operations was quoted as telling news agency AFP.""And then afterwards, he talked to the rest of the staff there and said, 'please, we're going to get phone calls today... Let's start doing this.'""The Norad Santa tracker has gained worldwide popularity. Last year, the modernized website noradsanta.org, featuring a 3D map of Santa's real-time movements and a live count of delivered presents, received 20.6 million visits. Additionally, over 400,000 calls were made to the tracker’s toll-free hotline, according to Canadian Air Force Major-General William Radiff.“We receive calls from around the globe, with people eager to know Santa’s location,” Radiff was quoted as saying.Beyond its festive role, Norad is tasked with critical aerospace and maritime defense operations, including monitoring missile activity from North Korea—something Santa may have considered as he navigated over Pyongyang.In the holiday spirit, Norad uses its infrared-capable satellites to track Santa, with Rudolph’s glowing nose serving as a key indicator. “Rudolph’s nose emits a unique signature that helps us monitor Santa's journey across the world,” Radiff explained.Astronaut Buzz Aldrin commended Norad’s efforts on social media, praising their precise tracking of Santa's flight path. Continuing a cherished tradition, President Joe Biden joined Norad’s festivities this year by taking calls from children, as he did last Christmas.",US Air Force says Santa Claus need not be concerned about recent mystery drone sighting over New Jersey.

How so many people became obsessed with looking for drones in the sky,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-so-many-people-became-obsessed-with-looking-for-drones-in-the-sky/articleshow/116645480.cms,"File: A family that reported seeing multiple drones walks along the beach in Seaside Heights, N.J., Dec. 13, 2024. Many reported sightings are from people seeing the official drones up looking for supposed ""mystery"" drones.

'Out in the Ocean'

Airplanes and Stars

It was a dry and cool Wednesday evening outside the Army's Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey , a longtime military installation that once made the bombs and shells that led to victory in World War II. A contractor there knocked off work and decided to wait out rush-hour traffic. He picked up some takeout from Wawa , parked outside a nearby wildlife preserve and settled in to watch an episode of Joe Rogan's podcast on his phone. Then he saw a flash in the side mirror.A light rising straight up from the tree line and toward the arsenal. He started recording. Could it have been a plane?Or was it a drone?And so began what seems to be the origin story of the ongoing drone saga. The contractor called in his sighting to his superiors Nov. 13, and others followed quickly, first throughout the county, then the rest of New Jersey, then into neighboring states.Countless people have reported mysterious hovering objects dotting the night skies and posted blurred images -- a white light, a black background -- on social media. Every day, for weeks. Drones. Drones?Small drones. Drones big as vans. Blinking, stationary, speeding and zipping and buzzing.Jeffrey Parker first saw them outside his Vineland, New Jersey, apartment building. He was barefoot, checking the mail, and there they were: three lights flying low and slow.""I was like damn, that's not airplanes,"" said Parker, 65.Was it a foreign government? Our own government? Kids? Visitors from space?The story grew to consume police departments, sheriffs, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, a former reality TV star with a supposed inside line to NASA, mayors, governors, the White House and the president-elect.But now it appears increasingly likely that if there were any drones at all, it was very few, and that most of the drones people did see -- stay with this -- were up there looking for the drones people thought they were seeing.Mounting evidence, and lack thereof, suggests that perhaps the whole craze has been a sort of communal fever dream fueled by crowd mentality, confirmation bias and a general distrust in all things official.This explanation has been widely rejected by those sharing their personal drone experiences, leaving them feeling belittled and gaslit and creating the kind of hothouse where conspiracy theories take root, grow and thrive.Five days after the arsenal sighting, on Nov. 18, multiple drones were reported, there and elsewhere in surrounding Morris County. A Facebook page called Live Storm Chasers with 1.3 million followers posted a five-drone sighting.The Morris County Prosecutors Office issued a statement from sheriffs, police chiefs and emergency officials that simultaneously acknowledged and downplayed the sightings and urged people to ""be mindful that what they read online may not be accurate.""Still, a day later, the FBI quietly opened its own investigation into the drones. The agency would later announce a drone hotline and receive about 5,000 tips.And the Federal Aviation Administration posted temporary flight restrictions prohibiting drone flights over the arsenal and, shortly after, the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster.The owner of that club would weigh in soon enough.November turned to December, and without any new, proved evidence or data to frame what was happening, the story exploded. A lack of facts became pure oxygen on social media and, on its heels, mainstream media. Even people's Ring doorbells, equipped to alert users with messages from other Ring users, began to ping out drone sightings.Jessica Fiorentino , 33, a mother of two young children in Toms River, had heard about drones, but when she went to the beach one night, she couldn't believe what she saw.""All the way out in the ocean, drones,"" she said Friday in an interview. ""Some would stay above the ocean, and some would come onto the land."" She alerted her followers on TikTok , normally filled with mom posts, and kept going out, every night, sometimes to other beaches, always posting videos.""They are very low in Seaside Heights right now,"" she said in a video on a recent December night, pointing out two lights.""Part of me is starting to maybe think that red drone is someone's drone, like someone here, putting it up, like police,"" she reported. ""And the one above it is the unidentified drone."" The video was viewed more than 393,000 times.The federal government was widely seen as being slow to react and confusing in its messaging, which was essentially ""Don't panic, but be vigilant.""Then came Dec. 8 at Island Beach State Park, a narrow stripe of coastline in southern New Jersey. A State Park Police officer contacted the local Ocean County Sheriff's office with a frightening report right out of a summer blockbuster.""Fifty drones were coming from the ocean toward the mainland,"" Sheriff Michael Mastronardy told Fox News. He rushed to the beach and met the officer. ""She had legitimate information she provided,"" Mastronardy said in a recent interview.The next night, Mastronardy was joined by a Republican member of Congress, Rep. Chris Smith, who wanted a firsthand look.He said the drones ""have so far evaded identification, origin, mission or potential threat to Americans"" and criticized the Biden administration for not taking it seriously.Sen. Andy Kim , D-N.J., was frustrated by a lack of information, so he accompanied police officers Dec. 12 to three sites that had been flooded with drone calls.""They were kind of pointing out things that were flying,"" he said. ""Some, they were like, 'That's a drone.' These are police officers. They've been out there for weeks now.""He took videos and showed them to aviation experts, who convinced him that the objects were actually manned aircraft.""It kind of highlighted to me: This is the information that people need,"" he said.Other lawmakers have suggested that the drones should be shot out of the sky. Some people may have tried to heed that call, in a way. Plane and helicopter pilots reported dozens of incidents of lasers being pointed at them over New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in early December. Shining a laser at an aircraft can injure or blind the pilot, and is a federal crime. The FBI responded and urged people to stop.Fiorentino, her once-MomTok now a full-time DroneTok, was still recording every night, and growing more alarmed at what she was seeing.""There's stuff spraying out of them -- this is new to me,"" she said in a video Dec. 15. That video was viewed 485,000 times, and another she posted about spraying got 2.8 million views.Jennifer McDonald, 48, taking her 15-minute break outside a Walmart in Pennsville, still hadn't seen a drone well into December. Her husband kept asking her. Then she went outside and looked up.""Hot damn,"" she said. She called her husband on FaceTime and they spent her whole break watching the little lights in the sky together.By mid-December, after weeks of shrugs, the federal government stepped up its attempt to explain what was going on. In short, officials said: They're not drones.An FBI representative told reporters that of the 5,000 hotline tips it received, fewer than 100 leads had been generated and deemed worthy of further investigation.Four federal agencies quickly echoed that analysis, saying the bright lights floating or flying in the night sky above New Jersey were airplanes, helicopters, stars or drones that were not suspicious.The messaging did not appear to resonate among the people looking up. Kim, shopping with his two sons at a Lego Store in the Cherry Hill Mall recently, was approached with one question.""What is happening with the drones?""Bethenny Frankel, formerly of ""The Real Housewives of New York City,"" became another regular drone reporter on TikTok.""I know this guy whose father worked with the Pentagon and NASA and secret projects, and he has been messaging me that he will never forgive himself if he doesn't tell the people he knows,"" she began in a post last week. ""These drones are ours and quite possibly could be sniffing out something dangerous.""The next morning, the ""Good Day New York"" program on Fox reported her claim, ""and that it has something to do with radioactive material in New Jersey,"" Rosanna Scotto, the host, said on air.At a news conference Dec. 16, the same day the federal agencies said most reported drone sightings were not drones, President-elect Donald Trump was asked about the situation, and he chuckled.""The government knows what is happening,"" he said. ""For some reason, they don't want to comment."" He seemed to allude to the airspace restrictions over his club in Bedminster, where he said he had planned to go the next weekend.""I think maybe I won't spend the weekend in Bedminster,"" he said. ""I decided to cancel my trip.""By the end of the week, looking to literally clear the air, the FAA announced a ban on drone use in airspace above critical infrastructure in more than 90 communities in New Jersey and New York.And Kim said Friday that federal drone detecting devices that had been put in place in hot spots in recent weeks had not detected any drones.This will probably do little to calm a jittery public.In Toms River, Fiorentino said she'll keep posting TikTok videos. ""We have no answers,"" she said. ""They're still here. I hear more counties are getting them. More states are getting them.""And, if she's being honest, it's a nice diversion after a long day of work and kids. ""People are relying on me to go out there,"" she said. ""For me it was like, OK, I can take a break from the chaos inside.""At Picatinny Arsenal, where it all began weeks ago, the contractor who reported what he saw in his car's mirror has otherwise stayed quiet about the incident, telling just a few colleagues and an old college classmate. He is speaking out now on the condition that his name be withheld because he is not authorized to address the matter. As he has watched the drone frenzy spread across the country, he said he can't help but worry he's to blame.""I feel,"" he said, ""like I've caused mass hysteria.""","Many reported sightings are from people seeing the official drones up looking for supposed ""mystery"" drones. The story grew to consume police departments, sheriffs, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security. Mounting evidence suggests that perhaps the whole craze has been a communal fever dream.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116646433,imgsize-23932,width-400,resizemode-4/116646433.jpg"
Subway murder suspect Sebastian Zapeta's drunken rant goes viral: 'I don’t give a s**t about people',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/subway-murder-suspect-sebastian-zapetas-drunken-rant-goes-viral-i-dont-give-a-st-about-people/articleshow/116644718.cms,"Subway murder suspect Sebastian Zapeta’s drunken rant goes viral in shocking video.

What do we know about the case?

Details from a shelter roommate

The attack

The broader impact

A chilling new video has surfaced online, allegedly showing Sebastian Zapeta-Calil , the man accused of setting a woman on fire aboard a New York City subway, spewing a drunken rant about alcohol and locals.In the clip, the man can be heard talking about “drinking beer” and saying, “I don’t give a s**t about people.” While much of the footage is unintelligible, one user noted, “At the very beginning, he says ‘estas bien a verga loco,’ meaning he is very, very high.”The video, shared by a social media user who claimed it depicts Zapeta-Calil, comes in the aftermath of the horrific attack. Authorities have not yet confirmed the video’s authenticity, but the reaction online has been swift, with many users calling for harsh punishment. One commented, “He sat there and watched her. He’s a total sociopath.” Another added, “It’s unfortunate that New York does not have the death penalty.”Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, 33, a Guatemalan immigrant who had previously been deported in 2018, was arraigned on murder and arson charges on Tuesday. Federal immigration officials confirmed he re-entered the US illegally, though the timeline remains unclear.Authorities allege Zapeta calmly approached the victim aboard a stationary F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station on Sunday morning. He set her clothing ablaze and fanned the flames with a shirt as she burned to death.Zapeta was arrested hours after police released surveillance images. Three high schoolers recognized him and alerted officers, who found him wearing the same paint-splattered pants and tan boots seen in the footage. During interrogation, Assistant District Attorney Ari Rottenberg said Zapeta identified himself in images of the attack but claimed he didn’t know what happened, admitting to regular alcohol consumption.The woman has not yet been identified. Authorities said she was seated at the end of the train car when the attack occurred. NYPD Chief of Transit Joseph Gulotta stated that there was no prior interaction between the suspect and the victim.Sebastian Zapeta-Calil’s disturbing behavior reportedly escalated after using K2, a synthetic drug, and drinking heavily. “He smoked K2, drank, and bugged out,” said his shelter roommate Raymond Robinson, speaking to The New York Post. Robinson described Zapeta as erratic when high but otherwise coherent. “When he wasn’t high, he’d talk like we’re talking regular.”On the day of the attack, Robinson recalled Zapeta having a normal breakfast at the shelter and saying, “I am going out to make my normal run.” Hours later, police allege, he carried out the horrific act, leaving even his roommate stunned.The victim, yet to be identified, was sitting quietly on a stationary F train at the Coney Island station around 7:30 amon Sunday. Police say Zapeta approached her without a word, set her clothing on fire, and fanned the flames with a shirt. Video evidence reportedly shows him standing by as she burned to death.Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch called the crime “one of the most depraved crimes one person could possibly commit against another human being.” Online reactions echoed similar sentiments, with one user questioning, “When will the American people demand repercussions from those who funded and allowed the flood?”Violent subway incidents like this continue to draw national attention. Despite a 6% drop in overall subway crime this year compared to 2023, murders in the system have risen, with nine recorded so far in 2024 compared to five in the same period last year.New York Mayor Eric Adams acknowledged the impact of such incidents, saying, “When you have these incidents, it overshadows the success, and it plays on the psyche of New Yorkers.” He also pointed to the involvement of mental health issues in many high-profile crimes on the transit system.The next court hearing for Zapeta is scheduled for Friday as New Yorkers await further updates on the case.","Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, 33, is accused of setting a woman on fire aboard a New York City subway.

Luigi Mangione News Today: Real reason why Luigi Mangione got a shave in jail: 'Barbershop head went to him',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/real-reason-why-luigi-mangione-got-a-shave-in-jail-barbershop-head-went-to-him/articleshow/116641653.cms,"Luigi Mangione got a shave inside the Pennsylvania prison as he became a vigilante-type figure in the jail as well.

Karen Agnifilo praised for strong defense, Marc Agnifilo too joins Luigi's legal team

When Luigi Mangione was brought to New York from Pennsylvania, he appeared in a different shaven look triggering questions as to how he got a trim inside the jail. Now a Daily Mail report has revealed that it was an inside job as Luigi's fellow inmates arranged for his shaving as Luigi Mangione became a hero inside the jail as well. As long as Luigi remained in the Huntingdon correctional institute, it remained in the news with reporters swarming to the jail talking about its living conditions etc. All this gave a vigilante status to Luigi inside the jail as well -- getting him some privileges like a clean shave etc.The DailyMail report claimed that Mangione ""even shared the proceeds of his notoriety with his fellow inmates in Pennsylvania, who have also expressed support for him and might have even helped him get a 'glow up' before his extradition to New York City.The other prisoners in the Pennsylvania jail too had a 'weird fixation' about him and the barbershop head in the jail went to him to give him a trim while prisoners cannot get a haircut or facial inside jail. ""Prisoners of his caliber do not get special treatment inside prison...His glow-up was an inside job and this is due to the fact he has become a kind of vigilante of sorts,"" a source told DailyMail.""It was bizarre to guards and prison staff how he had become a hero in the inside and outside,' the source added.The adulation for Luigi Mangione translated into praises for Karen Agnigfilo who debated in the court on Monday that her client is innocent until proven guilty but statements issued by government officials like New York mayor Eric Adams do not have that scope and they are calling him a murderer and not an accused murderer.Karn Agnifilo's husband Marc Agnifilo who is representing Sean Diddy's case has also joined the legal team of Mangione.","Luigi Mangione became a vigilante-type figure in the jail as well.

Prisoners' viral chant on News Nation live



26-year-old Luigi Mangione , the accused killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is very much aware of the immense public support and his reaction to the public's ""bizarre fixation"" on him was initially that of shock. A source close to Mangione revealed to Daily Mail that Mangione is extremely aware of the massive fan base. He was ""shocked and really choked up"" when he saw the support he had received which gave him confidence and reassurance that he would be okay.The source told Daily Mail that Mangione was used to adulation from men and women but ""not to this level"".Mangione pleaded not guilty to the state murder and the terror charges Monday as his lawyer questioned the spectacle being created at the cost of her client. Karen Agnifilo asked why New York mayor Eric Adams was present to receive Mangione when he was transported from Pennsylvania to New York. She also questioned the necessity of the perp walk.The Mail Today report said that Mangione has even shared the funds he received with his fellow inmates in the Pennsylvania jail who have been supporting him.A bizarre thing happened when Luigi Mangione was in the Pennsylvania jail as the inmates replied to a NewsNation live indicating that they were listening to the coverage in the jail. The inmates responded to reporter Alex Caprariello and Ashleigh Banfield as they were reporting about the poor condition of the State Correction Institution Huntingdon in Pennsylvania. The prisoners answered 'no' listening to the broadcast and also yelled 'Free Luigi'.The social media thirst for Luigi has not receded as he is now in a Brooklyn jail. On his Monday hearing, several women were present inside the court while no one from his family was there. Luigi Mangione was first hailed for killing the CEO as many prominent personalities justified the murder of Brian Thompson saying that his company was the reason for many deaths. Then he became the fixture of public admiration because of his looks, his reading list, his Ivy League college background etc.","Mangione pleaded not guilty to the state murder and the terror charges Monday as his lawyer questioned the spectacle being created at the cost of her client.

Act of frenzy, no motive found, Zapeta says he has no memory



Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, the 33-year-old madman who set a sleeping woman on fire inside a train at NYC subway as others looked on, told his mates that he was going for his morning run. And the next thing his pals heard was that he was arrested for setting a woman on fire.Raymond Robinson, who slept next to the accused murderer, at a shelter house in East New York, said Zapeta started his Sunday with a breakfast of French toast, sausage and grits and went out, the New York Post reported.The illegal Guatemalan migrant was a heavy drinker who chain-smoked K2, his pals at the shelter house said. They confirmed that he used to act weird when he used to be high but he never harmed anybody being intoxicated.“He smoked K2, drank and bugged out,” Robinson said. “He would bug out and talk to himself when he was high, but he never harmed nobody or himself. When he wasn’t high he’d talk like we’re talking regular.”Sebastian Zapeta told the police that he had no memory of setting the woman on fire. However, surveillance footage showed that Zapeta walked toward the woman on an F train at the Coney Island station who was sitting motionless wrapped in her blanket -- probably sleeping and ignited her blanket and clothing. The woman did not react to it until the fire completely engulfed her and she was completely burned.Zapeta walked out of the station and saw the woman burning. An unverified video showed Zapeta before the alleged murder where he was giving a drunken ranting.Zapeta-Calil entered the US illegally sometime in the past six years after he was once deported in 2018. He has been charged with first- and second-degree murder and first-degree arson.“The depravity of this horrific crime is beyond comprehension, and my office is committed to bringing the perpetrator to justice. This gruesome and senseless act of violence against a vulnerable woman will be met with the most serious consequences,” Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said in a statement.","Sebastian Zapeta-Calil was a heavy drinker who chain-smoked K2, his pals at the shelter house in East New York said.

Donald Trump's former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci issued a veiled threat to Elon Musk and warned him to stick to his business instead of wielding his political power in Washington as he will be hurt, Scaramucci said. Elon Musk dismissed the threat and instead asked whether Scaramucci could do the fandango like in that Queen song -- much to the amusement of his fans.“Listen, he’s got a very powerful role. He‘s got a $44 billion megaphone. He‘s got over 200 plus million followers and, Wolf, he was instrumental in that election.

""I have had Potomac fever. I am speaking as a former patient,"" he said.“He’s just got to be very very careful because he’s making enemies that he doesn’t realize, and the incentives in Washington are totally different from those in business,"" he said adding that his advice to Elon Musk would be to lay off the gas on politics.“And I think the power that he‘s wielding right now, Washington has a great immunological system, and I think they‘ll find a way to rebut him. So I would say to Elon Musk, not that he would listen to me, but stick to business. You‘ve done great. You‘ve made a couple hundred billion dollars since the election. Uh, lay off the gas on politics a little bit because these people could hurt you. And there's no need for you to get hurt. You‘re doing so well in your life,"" Scaramucci said.The comments came as Elon Musk was called 'President Musk' as he took the lead in getting the bipartisan spending bill rejected by Congress.

Former US President Bill Clinton, 78, was discharged from Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington on Tuesday following treatment for the flu, according to his deputy chief of staff, Angel Urena.""He and his family are deeply grateful for the exceptional care provided by the team at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital and are touched by the kind messages and well wishes he received. He sends his warmest wishes for a happy and healthy holiday season to all,"" Ureña said in a statement.“President Clinton remains in good spirits and deeply appreciates the excellent care he received,” Urena added.Clinton had been admitted on Monday after experiencing a fever, Urena confirmed in a post on the social media platform X.Clinton was admitted for tests and observation after developing flu-like symptoms but was reportedly in stable condition throughout his stay. Urena stated that Clinton is expected to return home before Christmas, adding, “The president is fine.”This latest hospitalization is not Clinton's first health-related incident. Over the years, the former president has faced several health challenges, including a quadruple bypass surgery in 2004, surgery for a partially collapsed lung in 2005, placement of two coronary stents in 2010 and a six-day hospital stay in 2021 for anon-Covid-related urological infection that spread to his bloodstream.Clinton, who served as US president from 1993 to 2001, has adopted a predominantly vegan diet in recent years, resulting in significant weight loss and improved health.Despite his health challenges, Clinton has remained active in public life.Earlier this year, he spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago and campaigned for Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential bid.","Former US President Bill Clinton, 78, discharged from Georgetown University Medical Center.

The sanctions had frozen any US property owned by the targeted entities and barred US nationals from doing business with them.“Pakistan does not harbour any intention in which its nuclear system is aggressive, it is 100% in Pakistan’s defence. It is just intended for deterrence purposes and nothing else,” Sharif told cabinet members during a meeting.Noting that his foreign affairs ministry had given a “comprehensive response” to Washington on the matter, Sharif said, “This programme is not mine, nor any political party’s; it belongs to the 240 million people of this country, and it is dear to them. There will be no compromise on this programme, and the entire nation is united on this issue.”According to a US state department factsheet, the Islamabad-based NDC had sought to obtain components for Pakistan’s long-range ballistic-missile programme and missile-testing equipment. It stated the NDC “is responsible for the development of Pakistan’s ballistic missiles,” including the Shaheen family of missiles.The US sanctions were preceded by high-level military engagements between China and Pakistan. Last month, a top Chinese military official, General Zhang Youxia, visited Pakistan along with a high-ranking delegation. Youxia, who is vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the overall command of the Chinese military headed by President Xi Jinping, had held one-on-one talks with Pakistan army chief Gen Asim Munir during his visit.

Four former Pakistan international airlines (PIA) employees confessed to using fake degrees to secure employment or promotions within the organisation. Among them were two pilots, a stewardess, and a data entry operator. Their confessions came after an extensive Federal investigation agency (FIA) audit, conducted in 2022, revealed that 457 PIA employees had been recruited on fraudulent credentials.The accused, who initially denied the charges, later approached the court for pre-arrest bail, which was granted. However, during their indictment, they pleaded guilty and requested to record their confessional statements. Judge Tanveer Ahmad Sheikh ensured the accused understood the implications of their confessions, allowing them 30 minutes to reconsider before recording their statements.Nazia Naheed, a former stewardess from Karachi, admitted to using a fake BA degree to gain a promotion. Hired on a contract in 2001, she was terminated in 2014 when her forged credentials were discovered.

He retired in 2018 but was implicated in the FIA probe. Lastly, Kashan Aijaz Dodhy, a cadet pilot since 1995, confessed to submitting a fake BSc degree to show extra qualifications, leading to his termination in 2019.The court sentenced the four to imprisonment until the court’s rising and imposed fines.","Four former Pakistan international airlines (PIA) employees confessed to using fake degrees to secure employment or promotions.

Copying Cirus

MUMBAI: A little-known incident in the history of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme is a purported attempt made by the country in the early ’70s to copy the design of India’s Cirus reactor — a 40 MW thermal neutron research facility, which first achieved criticality at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Trombay, near Mumbai, on July 10, 1960. An acronym for Canada India Reactor Utility Services, Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million, according to news reports.Pakistan’s attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan , a man who played a role in the neighbouring country’s nuclear weapons programme. In his book “Eating Grass: The Making Of The Pakistani Bomb”, published in 2012 by the Stanford University Press, Feroz wrote, “Munir Ahmed Khan, later chairman of the PAEC [Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission], recalled that in October 1965 he had met Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto [the then Pakistan foreign minister] in Vienna. Munir explained to him that he had been to India’s Cirus facility at Trombay in 1964 and saw for himself that India was well on its way to making the [nuclear] bomb. Bhutto asked Munir to meet Ayub Khan in December during Ayub’s upcoming visits to the United Kingdom and the United States and try to convince the president of the urgency of a weapons programme.” The country eventually carried out its first nuclear weapons tests on May 28 and 30, 1998.Feroz’s disclosure, though now 12 years old, assumes immediate significance in the context of the US last week announcing fresh sanctions on Pakistan’smissile development programme. For the first time, the measures target Pakistan’s state-run National Development Complex, for its role in the country’s mission development programme. US deputy NSA Jon Finer has said, “Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology… If these trends continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.”Feroz’s writing about the Cirus reactor is important because the plutonium for India’s Smiling Buddha project — the country’s first nuclear weapons test at Pokhran on May 18, 1974 — was from this reactor.According to Feroz, “Pakistani leadership wanted the rights to copy technological designs for its indigenous programme without incurring penalties and while remaining on the ‘good side’ of the international system.” He recalled: “While work to commission KANUPP [Karachi Nuclear Power Complex] went on, Munir Ahmed Khan said that there would be a secret team headed by a nuclear official, Sardar Ali Khan, to work on replicating India’s Cirus reactor.The author quotes Pervez Butt, who was purportedly part of the secret “copying’’ team and was chairman of PAEC between 2001 and 2005, as telling him, “Our team worked tirelessly, I did the mechanical part. When we merged our work and presented, Munir Khan could not believe it.”Feroz, however, has questioned Pakistan’s decision to copy the design of the Cirus reactor because there were some fundamental differences between Cirus and Kanupp.The team had modified the basic Cirus design.","Pakistan's attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan. Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million. Pakistan eventually carried out its first nuclear weapons tests on May 28 and 30, 1998.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116608587,imgsize-760319,width-400,resizemode-4/116608587.jpg"

Meaningful dialogue based on positive intentions should be held,"" PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said.He stressed that the potential talks should have a defined timeframe, adding that the dialogue must progress positively considering the sensitivity of the situation.National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq had taken the lead by offering on Wednesday that he was ready to host the two sides and facilitate their parleys.He welcomed the newly constituted committee and invited the government and opposition for talks, saying ""the speaker's office is always open for members"", according to a statement issued by the NA Secretariat.The speaker called on members of both committees to meet on Monday morning, adding that he would meet them at his chambers in Parliament House.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram said his party accepted the speaker's invitation to meet. He said their committee will attend the meeting on Monday.Akram said the PTI founder will be informed about the progress of the meeting and he will decide whether to cancel the civil disobedience movement .The talks are being held after the PTI had threatened to give a call for civil disobedience.The party posted on X from the account of the jailed former prime minister regarding the call for civil disobedience movement, which was initially shared on December 19, stating that the campaign will be launched if the government doesn't make progress on the party's demands by Sunday.""I had presented two demands to the government, the release of under-trial political prisoners and the establishment of a judicial commission for a transparent investigation into the events of May 9, 2023 and November 26, 2024,"" the post quoted PTI founder Khan. It further stated that both of these demands ""are legitimate"".""If the government fails to take any action on them by Sunday, the first phase of the civil disobedience movement - 'remittance boycott' - will be launched,"" it said.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram also reiterated that the civil disobedience drive would be launched tomorrow (Monday) if the party's demands go unmet.However, the issue of civil disobedience has been apparently put on hold for some time while allowing the two sides to address the differences through political means.Khan, 72, on December 5 had warned of a civil disobedience movement from December 14 if his demands about the release of political prisoners facing trial and the formation of a judicial commission to probe the events of May 9, 2023, and November 26 this year were unmet.Meanwhile, Pakistan's military courts sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for attacking military installations during riots which erupted following the arrest of Khan in May last year, the Army announced on Saturday.On May 9, 2023, Khan's PTI supporters allegedly attacked several military installations, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and the ISI building in Faisalabad, to vent their anger against the arrest of their party founder in a corruption case.Hundreds of suspects were arrested in the countrywide swoop and at least 103 were handed over to the military authorities for trial due to their involvement in attacks on military installations.Khan's party has launched multiple protests through 2023 and 2024 demanding the release of their supreme leader, the latest being in November 2024.The former prime minister, currently lodged at the Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, was arrested in August last year and faces multiple cases since his government was toppled in April 2022.","The committee includes deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan.

"1,566 terror attacks killed 924 in Pakistan over past 10 months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/1566-terror-attacks-killed-924-in-pakistan-over-past-10-months/articleshow/116551393.cms,"KARACHI: Ten years have passed since Ajoon Khan's son died in a ghastly attack by the Pakistani Taliban that killed about 150 people, mostly children, at a military-run school in Peshawar, in northwestern Pakistan. But the pain of loss is unrelenting - it grows only deeper with time. Khan, a lawyer, said he could never forget the parents sobbing and pleading outside the school gates.The brutal assault on the school in Peshawar led to rare political unity in support of a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy for Pakistan and a vast military operation in the country's former tribal areas near Afghanistan. The efforts forced militants to retreat across the border and brought a degree of relative peace to Pakistan. Large-scale terrorist attacks were significantly reduced, with fatalities dropping from 2,451 across 1,717 attacks in 2013 to 220 in 146 attacks in 2020. But the hard-won gains are now in jeopardy.Over the past few years, violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan. Experts attribute the increase to the Afghan Taliban's seizure of power in neighbouring Afghanistan in Aug 2021.Last week, the interior ministry reported that 924 people, including civilians and law enforcement personnel, had been killed in 1,566 terrorist attacks across the country over the past 10 months. It said 341 terrorists had been killed during the period.Early on Saturday, sixteen soldiers were killed in northwest Pakistan in an attack by Islamist militants, a senior police official in the South Waziristan region said. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack, giving a higher figure for the number of personnel killed, Reuters reported.Experts and security officials have identified a range of challenges impeding Pakistan's progress against terrorism: political instability, weak governance, dwindling public support, economic constraints and reduced US counterterrorism assistance after the end of the 20-year war in Afghanistan.""The greatest challenge lies in mobilising the necessary financial resources and manpower for operations across such vast regions,"" said Muhammad Amir Rana, director of the Pak Institute for Peace Studies, a security think tank in Islamabad. The source of the problem for Pakistan, experts say, is found across the border, in Afghanistan.The Taliban administration in Kabul, the Afghan capital, denies accusations of harbouring militants from TTP. But Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace, said the TTP had been given ""a permissive safe haven in Afghanistan,"" which had allowed it to become ""resilient and lethal.""Pakistani security officials privately acknowledged that they had misjudged how the new Taliban rulers of Afghanistan would handle TTP. The officials had anticipated that the Taliban leaders would help curb the TTP in return for the covert support that Pakistan had provided them during the US-led war. Instead, the Taliban in Kabul have provided the TTP with resources and advanced American-made weapons and equipment seized after the collapse of the US-supported Afghan govt, according to a senior security official in Islamabad who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The TTP has gone on to unleash a wave of attacks inside Pakistan as it wages a campaign whose aim is to overthrow the govt. Among them was a suicide bombing in January 2023 that killed over 100 people at a mosque in Peshawar.Pakistani security forces have also been locked in a conflict with ethnic separatist groups in Balochistan, an arid province bordering Afghanistan and Iran that is home to the Chinese-run port Gwadar. nyt","Violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan.

Pakistan’s military announced Saturday that 25 civilians have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their alleged involvement in violent protests following the arrest of former PM Imran Khan on May 9 last year, which resulted in the death of at least eight people.Khan’s supporters stormed govt buildings and military installations. The military’s statement detailed that the convictions relate primarily to attacks on key military sites, including Jinnah House (the Lahore corps commander’s residence), General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, and a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) base in Mianwali.The sentences were issued by Field General Court Martial as part of the first phase of trials. Supreme Court had earlier conditionally allowed military courts to pronounce verdicts for 85 civilians detained in connection with the riots.The military statement highlighted that the convicts have the right to appeal and other legal recourses as guaranteed by law.The May 9 violence led to the arrest of many politicians and supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party. PTI has denied involvement in the violence. However, govt and military maintain that the attacks were meticulously planned and executed by PTI brass.Khan and his party have called for a judicial probe into the May 9 events, claiming the violence was a “false flag” operation intended to suppress PTI.PTI condemned the military court’s decision. National Assembly leader of opposition Omar Ayub wrote on X: “Military court sentences against civilians rejected. The detainees are civilians and cannot be tried by military courts.” He labelled the process as “kangaroo courts”.PTI’s US chapter criticised the rulings. “Colonels and majors, acting as judges, have sentenced civilians it tried in military courts. These civilians were held for over a year in harsh conditions, with many tortured into giving false confessions,” it posted on X.Amnesty International also denounced the military court’s decision, describing it as “an intimidation tactic, designed to crack down on dissent”.Army’s media wing Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) referred to the protests as “politically provoked violence and arson”. ISPR said further sentences for the remaining accused will be announced once the legal process is completed.",25 civilians have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years.

Sixteen Pakistani soldiers were killed and five critically injured on Saturday after militants attacked an army post near the Afghan border.The attack happened overnight in the Makeen area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, roughly 40 kms (24 miles) from the border.More than 30 militants assaulted the post, according to two intelligence officials who spoke to AFP (anonymously).

Driving the news

Speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, US deputy national security adviser Jon Finer described Pakistan’s missile advancements as a troubling shift in the country’s strategic posture.

described Pakistan’s missile advancements as a troubling shift in the country’s strategic posture. “Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology, from long-range ballistic missile systems to equipment that would enable the testing of significantly larger rocket motors,” Finer said.

“If these trends continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.”

This revelation comes on the heels of Washington imposing a fresh wave of sanctions on Pakistan’s missile program. For the first time, the measures target Pakistan’s state-run National Development Complex, alongside three private Karachi-based companies accused of supporting missile development.

Why it matters

Finer’s revelation marks a stark turning point in US-Pakistan relations, underscoring a broader erosion of trust since the 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Historically viewed as a key partner in counterterrorism, Pakistan’s ballistic missile advancements are now seen as a direct challenge to US security.

The move also raises critical questions about whether Pakistan’s missile program, long designed as a counter to India, is shifting toward broader ambitions with potentially global consequences.

Two senior US officials, speaking anonymously, revealed that Washington has repeatedly pressed Islamabad to explain the development of more powerful rocket engines but received evasive responses. “They don’t acknowledge our concerns. They tell us we are biased,” said one official.

This development places Pakistan alongside nations like Russia, North Korea, and China—states identified by the US as adversaries with nuclear weapons and missile systems capable of reaching American soil.

The strain in US-Pakistan relations reflects a broader geopolitical realignment in South Asia. Pakistan continues to cultivate strong ties with China while voicing concerns about US defense cooperation with India, including technology transfers and joint missile projects.

The big picture

Sanctions imposed:

The US has sanctioned Pakistan’s National Development Complex over proliferation-related concerns tied to ballistic missile development.This is a big deal; unlike recent rounds of US sanctions, this targets a government entity instead of just companies. Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Center’s South Asia Institute

Zoom in: Eroding US-Pakistan ties

The tensions over Pakistan’s missile program reflect a larger deterioration in the once-robust US-Pakistan partnership.

Historical context: Pakistan was a key ally during the Cold War and a central partner in the US-led war on terror, particularly after the 9/11 attacks. However, relations have soured over the years due to Pakistan’s alleged support for Taliban factions and its increasingly close ties with China.

India factor: The US-India defense relationship has grown stronger in recent years, underpinned by agreements like the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) and the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA). Washington has facilitated India’s acquisition of advanced missile systems, which has drawn criticism from Islamabad for allegedly undermining regional stability.

What it means for India

Accelerating India's missile programs:

India’s strategic reassessment:

Proxy conflicts:

Nuclear security risks:

Strengthening India-US ties

What’s next

The US administration is expected to maintain pressure on Pakistan through diplomatic channels and additional sanctions, while continuing to bolster ties with India.

The US appears to view Pakistan’s missile development as a broader shift in its strategic posture. Finer emphasized that Pakistan’s actions raise “real questions” about its intentions, particularly given its long-standing partnership with the US in security and counterterrorism.

Washington is also likely to encourage other countries to scrutinize Pakistan’s missile program as part of broader non-proliferation efforts.

Pakistan, however, is expected to deepen its reliance on China, which has historically supported its missile program and nuclear ambitions.

The United States has expressed alarm over Pakistan’s ongoing development of long-range ballistic missiles, a move Washington sees as an emerging security threat.Meanwhile, Washington’s public condemnation of Pakistan’s missile program could fuel further regional instability.The US State Department sanctioned Pakistan’s NDC for its involvement in developing long-range missile systems. This marks the first time a Pakistani state-owned enterprise has faced direct sanctions tied to missile production. Three Karachi-based companies—Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, Affiliates International, and Rockside Enterprise—were also sanctioned for supporting the program.Islamabad has dismissed the US sanctions as “discriminatory” and warned that such actions could upset the region’s strategic balance. Its Foreign Office defended the missile program as “defensive in nature,” aimed solely at countering Indian aggression and preserving peace in South Asia.Pakistani officials argue that their missile program is not intended to target the US. Diplomatic sources in Islamabad insist the program is designed to counter perceived threats from India, with whom Pakistan has fought three wars since 1947, a Reuters report said.In a strongly worded statement, the Pakistani Foreign Office accused the US of “double standards.” It criticized Washington for imposing sanctions on Pakistani entities while granting India waivers for advanced military technology. “Such policies have dangerous implications for the strategic stability of our region and beyond,” the statement read.Pakistan's development of long-range missiles may prompt India to fast-track its missile initiatives, particularly the Agni series, and enhance its Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) systems.Pakistan’s expanded missile range could push India to reevaluate its nuclear policies, potentially reconsidering its no-first-use stance or enhancing second-strike capabilities.Pakistan’s growing confidence, potentially bolstered by Chinese support, might lead to more aggressive postures, including cross-border skirmishes.The growing political instability in Pakistan increases the risk of its nuclear assets falling into the hands of radical groups, posing a significant threat to India and the world.: Pakistan's missile advancements could lead to closer India-US defense cooperation, including technology transfers and intelligence sharing.(With inputs from agencies)","US deputy national security adviser Jon Finer described Pakistan's missile advancements as a troubling shift in the country's strategic posture.

A senior White House official on Thursday said that Pakistan's development of sophisticated missile technology, including long range ballistic missiles , represents an emerging threat to the United States.The statement comes in the wake of sanctions imposed on four Pakistani entities, including the state-owned national development complex (NDC), for their role in advancing Pakistan's missile program.Principal deputy national security advisor Jon Finer, speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on Thursday, outlined the Biden administration’s growing concerns over Pakistan's missile development activities.“Simply put, we are going to keep the pressure on Pakistan regarding its long-range missile program, even as we also continue to seek diplomatic resolutions to address our concerns,” Finer said.The sanctions announced Wednesday target the NDC, based in Islamabad, which oversees Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, as well as three Karachi-based entities: Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, Affiliates International, and Rockside Enterprise.These entities were identified as contributors to the program, prompting what Finer called “necessary measures to curb these advancements.”Finer pointed out the significance of the sanctions. “This is the first time we have sanctioned a Pakistani state-owned enterprise tied to missile development,” he said.According to Finer, Pakistan’s recent advancements include the development of long-range ballistic missile systems and technologies that enable testing of larger rocket motors. “If these trend lines continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States, raising real questions about Pakistan's intentions,” he added.The official pointed out that only a small group of nations—Russia, North Korea, and China—possess nuclear weapons and missile capabilities capable of directly reaching the US, making Pakistan's actions particularly concerning. “It is hard for us to see Pakistan's actions as anything other than an emerging threat to the United States,” Finer said.Despite longstanding ties between the US and Pakistan in areas such as counter-terrorism and development, Finer expressed frustration over Islamabad's apparent disregard for American concerns. “We have provided support to Islamabad during difficult times and continue to desire a cooperative relationship in areas of shared interest,” he said. “That makes us question even more why Pakistan would be motivated to develop a capability that could be used against us.”The Biden administration has already implemented three rounds of sanctions over the past year targeting non-Pakistani entities supporting Pakistan’s ballistic missile program.Finer stressed that the US would not tolerate the continued development of capabilities perceived as a direct threat. “The United States cannot, will not simply sit back and watch the development of this capability that we believe could pose a threat ultimately down the road,” he stated.“This is of such great concern because it raises fundamental questions about Pakistan's intentions, and we are determined to ensure our security and that of our allies,” he added further.","White House official: Pakistan's development of missile technology represents an emerging threat to the United States.

US strongly takes up human rights issues with Bangladesh interim government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/us-strongly-takes-up-human-rights-issues-with-bangladesh-interim-government/articleshow/116644875.cms,"DHAKA: The US has strongly taken up human rights issues with the Bangladesh interim govt, amid its tensions with India over attacks on Hindus and other minorities, which Dhaka has constantly played down by dubbing them as ""media exaggeration"".During their talks over phone on Monday, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus expressed their commitment to respect and protect the human rights of all. Issues related to minorities came up broadly, a diplomatic source said.While the details of the conversation were not known, the divergence in the accounts of what had transpired engaged the attention of many. The White House in its statement stressed that that ""both leaders expressed their commitment to respecting and protecting the human rights of all people, regardless of religion"". In contrast, the one issued by Bangladesh did not mention anything about discussions on human rights issues.

Sorting fact from fiction as fear engulfs Hindus in B'desh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sorting-fact-from-fiction-as-fear-engulfs-hindus-in-bdesh/articleshow/116644844.cms,"CHATTOGRAM: The reports, often accompanied by grainy footage, are frequent: Hindu temples vandalised and set on fire in Bangladesh, minority Hindus targeted and killed.Many of the attacks are real, with the mob rage serving as a warning of how Bangladesh could spiral into violence in the vacuum opened by the overthrow of Sheikh Hasina last summer. Others are forgeries, pushed by supporters of the ousted PM to discredit Bangladesh's interim govt.Caught between the authentic and the exaggerated, Bangladesh's Hindus, who make up about 9% of a population that is overwhelmingly Muslim, are gripped with fear. ""Smiles are rare, and businesses are struggling,"" said S K Nath Shymal, president of Bangladesh National Hindu Grand Alliance in the coastal city of Chattogram, the centre of some of the worst recent tensions.The NYT visited the sites of many of the reported attacks in Dhaka and in Chattogram, the country's second-largest city. Hindu residents confirmed episodes of vandalism and mob violence, particularly after the arrest of a Hindu monk in Nov and the death of a Muslim lawyer during a protest by the monk's supporters. But they also said the cases of forged or exaggerated information had muddied the real threat to them. Shymal said that all sides were ""exploiting us"".Before now, Islamic extremists were pushed to the margins by Hasina's police state. With her gone and an unelected interim govt in place, extremists have returned more openly. In the political violence that followed her departure, hundreds of people, including several Hindus, were killed. Community leaders said the killings of the Hindus were largely related to their political affiliation, not their religion.But tensions have increased in recent weeks with the arrest of a Hindu monk, Chinmoy Das, who was accused of denigrating Bangladesh's flag as he protested for the protection of Hindus. The monk's supporters gathered at the court in Chattogram during his bail hearing, clashing with police. During the unrest, a Muslim lawyer was hacked to death in unclear circumstances. Since then, mobs have arrived in neighbourhoods where Hindus live, vandalising temples and targeting homes. In court, lawyers for the monk were heckled by other lawyers and stopped from defending him, his team said.On the outskirts of Dhaka, a family-run Hindu temple was vandalised and set on fire in the predawn hours of Dec 7. The owner, Ratan Kumar Ghosh, said the attackers had thrown flammable material into his house, which contains the temple, by removing part of its tin roof. Ghosh expressed regret that the local media had minimised the attack.In Chattogram, the premises of three temples were vandalised recently, their gates and windows smashed with rocks. At another temple in Chattogram, it was clear that a mob attack had taken place, but accounts of the unrest were conflicting. Proloy Chakraborty, a priest, said a mob had vandalised two lion statues outside the temple gate. Titu Das, a nearby shopkeeper, said the mob had also attacked shops. Hasina put out a statement saying a ""temple was burned in Chattogram."" But leaders of the Hindu community in Chattogram rejected those accounts.NYT","Many of the attacks are real, with the mob rage serving as a warning of how Bangladesh could spiral into violence.

Lawsuit against Jay-Z

Combs' lawyers denounce 'false claims'

'1-800-lawyer' controversy

An unidentified woman who accused rappers Jay-Z and Sean “Diddy” Combs of raping her when she was 13 has withdrawn her lawsuit against both men, according to court documents filed on Friday.Last December, the woman first sued Combs in a Manhattan federal court and later added Jay-Z (Shawn Carter) to the case.She alleged that in 2000, Combs' limousine driver offered her a ride to an MTV Video Music Awards after-party, where she was taken to a house and later raped.The court filing did not specify any reasons for dropping the caseJay-Z had strongly denied the allegations while actively seeking to be removed from the case and welcomed the withdrawal as a victory.""The frivolous, fictitious and appalling allegations have been dismissed,"" he said on social media. ""This civil suit was without merit and never going anywhere.""Combs, who remains in jail in New York facing federal sex trafficking charges , has also been accused in multiple sexual assault lawsuits. Many of these cases have been filed by Texas lawyer Tony Buzbee, who claims to represent over 150 people alleging abuse by the music mogul.The lawsuit filed in December stated that the alleged victim was dropped off at Radio City Music Hall, where she tried but failed to get a ticket. She then approached limousine drivers, hoping for access to the show or an after-party. One driver, who claimed to work for Combs, allegedly told her she ""fit what Diddy was looking for.""Later, the driver picked her up and took her to a white house with a U-shaped driveway. She was reportedly asked to sign what she believed was a nondisclosure agreement but was not given a copy. Inside, she claimed the house was filled with celebrities, along with people using marijuana and cocaine.After accepting a drink, she began to feel dizzy and needed to lie down. While resting in a room, she alleged that Combs and Jay-Z entered and asked, ""You ready to party?"" She then detailed the assault, accusing Jay-Z of raping her while Combs and another woman watched.Following the lawsuit's dismissal, Combs’ legal team suggested that other claims against him were equally baseless.""For months, we have seen case after case filed by individuals hiding behind anonymity, pushed forward by an attorney more focused on media headlines than legal merit. Just like this claim, the others will fall apart because there is no truth to them,"" they said in a statement.They further added that Combs ""has never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone – man or woman, adult or minor.""Both Jay-Z and Combs took a swipe at lawyer Tony Buzbee's firm, dismissively referring to it as the ""1-800-lawyer."" The phrase alludes to law firms that advertise heavily and handle a high volume of cases, often perceived as being more focused on publicity and financial gain than on justice.Jay-Z accused Buzbee, suggesting that the lawsuits were more about a money grab than legitimate claims.""When they quickly realise that the money grab is going to fail, they get to walk away with no repercussions,"" Jay-Z said.

"10,000 federal workers laid off amid Donald Trump & Elon Musk's push to reshape agencies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/10000-federal-workers-laid-off-amid-donald-trump-elon-musks-push-to-reshape-agencies/articleshow/118264078.cms,"President Donald Trump listens as Elon Musk speaks in the Oval Office at the White House, Tuesday, February 11, 2025, in Washington. (AP)

The campaign led by President Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk to reduce the size of the US bureaucracy resulted in the termination of more than 9,500 federal workers on Friday. The affected employees managed tasks such as federal land administration and veterans’ care.Workers at the departments of interior, energy, veterans affairs, agriculture, and health and human services were among those dismissed. The job cuts have primarily targeted probationary employees in their first year, who have fewer employment protections.Layoffs cascaded through the federal government Thursday after its human resources division advised agencies to terminate most of an estimated 200,000 workers on probation, a sharp escalation in the Trump administration's drive to overhaul and shrink the federal workforce.Some agencies have been largely shut down, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent watchdog. Workers on fixed-term contracts were also affected by the cuts.The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is expected to lay off thousands of employees next week, news agency Reuters reported, quoting sources.The job cuts, first reported by Reuters and other media outlets, follow an earlier buyout offer extended by Trump and Musk. Around 75,000 federal workers have voluntarily accepted the buyout, according to the White House. This accounts for about 3 per cent of the 2.3 million civilian federal workforce.Trump has said the federal government is too large and that significant amounts of money are lost due to waste and fraud. The federal government currently has a $36 trillion debt and recorded a $1.8 trillion deficit last year. While there is general agreement on the need for reform, congressional Democrats have argued that Trump is overstepping the legislature’s authority on federal spending. Most Republican lawmakers, who hold majorities in both chambers of Congress, have supported the changes.Critics have raised concerns over Musk’s role in the process. US treasury secretary Scott Bessent dismissed these concerns, saying, ""These are serious people, and they're going from agency to agency, doing an audit, looking for best practices,"" in an interview with Fox Business Network.","More than 9,500 federal workers were terminated on Friday.

These funds were earmarked for the administration of financial services, but were no longer needed,"" DOGE said in a post on X.HUD secretary Scott Turner worked alongside DOGE to rectify the issue, leading to the de-obligation of the funds, which have now been made available for other uses by the US Treasury.The announcement comes a day after Turner unveiled the formation of a DOGE task force within HUD to ensure greater financial oversight and efficiency.""We will be very detailed and deliberate about every dollar spent in serving tribal, rural, and urban communities across America,"" Turner said in a video posted on X. He also revealed that his team had already identified $260 million in savings just two days prior.DOGE has been actively investigating government spending and has flagged billions of dollars in questionable expenditures. Among its recent findings, environmental protection agency (EPA) administrator Lee Zeldin said that with DOGE's assistance, he had cancelled a Biden-era $50 million environmental justice grant awarded to an organization advocating that ""climate justice travels through a Free Palestine.""Zeldin further revealed that under the Biden administration, the EPA had sent $160 million to a Canadian electric bus manufacturer, which has since declared bankruptcy. The entire amount was provided upfront rather than being distributed as school buses were produced, raising concerns over financial mismanagement.The revelations underscore DOGE's role in uncovering and rectifying fiscal inefficiencies , as the agency continues its efforts to ensure responsible government spending.","$1.9 billion of HUD money was just recovered after being misplaced during the Biden administration due to a broken process.

Airbnb co-founder to take role in DOGE?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/airbnb-co-founder-to-take-role-in-doge/articleshow/118263855.cms,"Joe Gebbia

WASHINGTON: One of Elon Musk 's closest friends, a billionaire co-founder of Airbnb , is taking a role in President Trump's administration to help Musk carry out his drive to slash the federal bureaucracy, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.Joe Gebbia , the Airbnb co-founder, is a board member at Tesla who lives in Austin, Texas, where Musk, Tesla's CEO, keeps a large compound. He is planning to start shortly in the federal govt as part of Musk's DOGE team, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. It is not clear what precisely Gebbia will do or how formal his role will be.Many members of Musk's govt-overhaul effort float among agencies depending on the day's tasks. Many of them consider their centre of gravity to be the office of personnel management or the general services administration.Early Friday, Gebbia arrived at OPM's downtown Washington headquarters in a black SUV with a three-person security detail. He declined to comment as he was escorted inside by an OPM official and one of his bodyguards.Musk and his allies have taken over the US Digital Service, now renamed the United States DOGE Service. The agency was established in 2014 to fix the federal govt's online services. Many of his foot soldiers are young software engineers with no govt experience who have parachuted into federal agencies seeking to overhaul or even dismantle them.Gebbia was until recently a Democratic donor, spending more than $200,000 each to boost Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in the 2016 and 2020 general elections, and $20,000 to support Biden's reelection run.Gebbia has said his politics have shifted toward Republicans, in major part because of the advocacy of Robert F Kennedy Jr, whom Gebbia considers a political ally. Gebbia attended Kennedy's confirmation hearing last month, writing on the social platform X that morning that it was a ""big day ahead for the future of health in America.""Gebbia did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday evening.In a post on X the day before Trump's inauguration, Gebbia said he had voted for Democrats dating back to Al Gore in 2000 but acknowledged supporting Trump in Nov.","Joe Gebbia is a board member at Tesla who lives in Austin, Texas, where Musk, Tesla's CEO, keeps a large compound.

Hamas' shifting position on hostage releases

Hostage exchange under ceasefire agreement

73 hostages still held in Gaza

US President Donald Trump has warned of serious repercussions if Hamas fails to release all remaining hostages in Gaza by noon on Saturday.Speaking to reporters on Friday, he reiterated his demand, saying, ""let all hell break out"" if Hamas does not release the hostages, insisting they should be freed in full and not ""in drips and drabs.""""As far as I'm concerned, if all of the hostages aren't returned by Saturday at 12 o'clock – I think it's an appropriate time – I would say, cancel it and all bets are off, and let hell break out,"" Trump said, according to CNN.When asked about what might happen if Hamas fails to meet the deadline, Trump said, ""I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow at 12 o'clock. If it were up to me, I'd take a very hard stance. I can't tell you what Israel is going to do.""He also described the condition of the released hostages, saying they looked weak after their captivity in Gaza. ""One guy was a big, strong, healthy guy... He looks like he just came out of the Holocaust. It looks like a Holocaust picture,"" Trump said, criticising Hamas for its treatment of hostages.Earlier this week, Hamas stated that it would not release more hostages, citing Israel's violations of ceasefire negotiations, but later changed its stance.""They said, ‘We're not going to release any more hostages as we said we were.’ I said, ‘Good, you have till 12 o'clock on Saturday,’ which is tomorrow. And we didn't hear anything. Then, all of a sudden, two days ago, they said, ‘No, we've decided we're going to release the hostages,’"" Trump explained.He further added, ""I think they should release all of the hostages. As bad as they look, the ones that follow probably will look a lot worse. I think they're sending out their most healthy.""Meanwhile, Israel’s Prime Minister's Office confirmed receiving the names of three hostages—Sagui Dekel Chen, Sasha Troufanov, and Iair Horn—set to be freed by Hamas on Saturday. The release is part of the sixth hostage-prisoner exchange under the ongoing ceasefire agreement.Hamas had previously threatened to delay further hostage releases, accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire deal. However, with mediation from Egypt and Qatar, the group backed down from its threat and agreed to proceed with the release.Under the ceasefire agreement, Hamas has released 16 Israelis and five Thai hostages in exchange for Israel freeing around 2,000 Palestinian security prisoners, including hundreds serving life sentences for terror-related offences.Since the October 7 Hamas attacks, 251 people have been taken hostage. According to the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), 73 hostages remain in Gaza, including at least 35 confirmed dead.Trump has made it clear that he expects all remaining hostages to be freed immediately. ""Hamas will find out what I mean,"" he said, hinting at consequences if his deadline is not met. ""I'm speaking for myself. Israel can override it, but from myself, Saturday at 12 o'clock, and if they're not – they're not here, all hell is going to break out.""According to Gaza's health ministry, over 48,000 Palestinians have been killed since the October 2023 conflict between Israel and Hamas.","US President Donald Trump has warned of serious repercussions if Hamas fails to release all remaining hostages in Gaza by noon on Saturday.

He suggested that these efforts are part of a broader initiative to influence public opinion and destabilise governments.Benz said that ""celebrities who can be trained to spread desired messaging"" are actively recruited and used as ""network nodes."" He cited NATO-linked initiatives and USAID-backed music diplomacy programs as key drivers behind these efforts. ""Taylor Swift has worked in various things before that have been empirically shown to move the needle on government initiatives,"" he said, referring to her involvement in voter engagement and public health campaigns.He also pointed to the Pentagon’s involvement in the music industry, alleging that military funding has played a significant role in shaping cultural narratives. ""Look at who the biggest sponsor of South by Southwest is in Texas now. It’s the military. Go ahead and look up the scandal if you want about South by Southwest Pentagon funding. They've taken over the music industry because it’s hearts and minds work,"" Benz said.According to Benz, the US government has used similar tactics worldwide, particularly through USAID’s music diplomacy program. ""Just like they were giving Dua Lipa the awards, just like they’re working with Pussy Riot, just like they have 22... In fact, you can look this up if you want—the State Department Music Diplomacy Program. Twenty-two rappers. You’ll see again, these people become network nodes. They become assets to play with.""He further claimed that USAID has supported artists in various countries to promote anti-government sentiment. ""There’s evidence to suggest the same play around recruiting hip-hop artists in Cuba,"" Benz said. ""It was protest rock, it was protest rap. In Cuba, for that USAID operation, it was protest rap.""He referenced a report from The Grayzone, which allegedly revealed that US-backed programs in Bangladesh had commissioned rap songs designed to incite street protests and political reform. ""Those documents that The Grayzone published have two rap songs in Bangladesh with lines like they were designed to inspire anti-government sentiment and to promote street protests and political reform. I mean, literally writing rap albums to get people to take to the streets and pull off the exact riot that the State Department wants to destabilise the country.""In response to a video discussing these claims, Benz reiterated that the State Department had recruited 22 artists from various countries, including Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Cameroon, France, India, and South Africa, to train them in ""youth engagement and using art as activism."" The program involved bringing these musicians to Washington, DC, for an intensive training period.However, a community note on social media disputed Benz’s claims, stating that the only known connection between USAID and Dua Lipa was its funding for a music school in Kosovo. The note detailed how USAID supported the launch of Allegra School of Arts in Gjakova, aimed at providing formal musical education to Kosovan youth.Benz’s comments come amid heightened scrutiny of US foreign influence programs, particularly under the Trump administration. Recently, Elon Musk has also criticised USAID and other agencies, calling for their dismantling. Musk suggested that organisations like the National Endowment for Democracy have failed in their stated missions, asking, ""How much democracy have they achieved lately?""","Former US official Mike Benz claims USAID has trained musical artists to act as ""assets"" in spreading political narratives for statecraft purposes.

The specifics of security guarantees from the US or European nations would be determined during negotiations, according to Vance.He indicated that Trump might adjust negotiating terms based on how discussions progress.Vance elaborated on Trump's flexibility, suggesting items could be added or removed from negotiations depending on the parties' behaviour and Ukrainian priorities.Trump posted on Truth Social: ""[W]e want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine.""Later Thursday, Trump confirmed Ukraine's participation in Russian negotiations whilst expressing support for Russia's return to the G-7.","US Vice President JD Vance said the US might impose sanctions and consider military intervention if Russia's Vladimir Putin fails to conclude the ongoing Ukraine conflict.

Love was in the air — or at least on social media — as Barack and Michelle Obama shut down swirling divorce rumors with a heartfelt Valentine’s Day exchange, reminding the world that their romance is still going strong after 32 years.Barack, 63, kicked off the day with a flirty tribute to Michelle, posting a glowing selfie of the couple on X. “Thirty-two years together and you still take my breath away,” he wrote, adding, “Happy Valentine’s Day, @MichelleObama.”Not one to be outdone, Michelle, 61, responded with an equally swoon-worthy message. “If there’s one person I can always count on, it’s you, @BarackObama. You’re my rock. Always have been. Always will be.

ISLAMABAD: At least 10 people were killed and six injured a bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by in Harnai district of southwestern Balochistan province on Friday, officials said.Hazrat Wali Kakar, Harnai’s top civilian official, said the bomb was an improvised explosive device (IED). “Ten mining workers were killed in the attack,” Kakar said.Saleem Tareen, another local official, said most of the victims were from the country’s northwestern Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province. “The labourers were traveling to a market in Harnai,” he added. Harnai lies some 160 km east of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province.Authorities said they were investigating the attack, with officials saying evidence was being collected and that preliminary investigation showed the explosive material had been planted on the roadside.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet. But the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organisation fighting for independence, is active in the restive province that borders Afghanistan and Iran. The group usually targets security forces as well as Pakistanis from other provinces. Local media reported that most of the workers killed or injured came from KP’s Puran village.The BLA has also targeted Chinese projects in the region, arguing that foreigners are exploiting resource-rich Balochistan while the impoverished residents are left behind.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif responded to the incident by reaffirming his commitment to aggressively working to eradicate terrorism in the country.",A bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by.

The coalition argued that Musk's attempts to dismantle agencies, stop the payment of congressionally approved funds and have access to sensitive govt data exceeded his authority.DOGE, which is not an official department but an entity housed within the executive office of the president, has already faced numerous legal challenges over its attempts to overhaul govt agencies and cut spending. Since Trump's inauguration, Musk's team has inserted itself into at least 19 agencies, according to a tally by the New York Times.The White House and representatives of Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The 14 states argued that Trump had violated the appointments clause of the Constitution by granting sweeping powers to Musk, who has ""transformed a minor position that was formerly responsible for managing govt websites into a designated agent of chaos without limitation,"" according to the complaint, which was filed in the US district court for the District of Columbia.""Mr Musk's seemingly limitless and unchecked power to strip the govt of its work force and eliminate entire departments with the stroke of a pen or click of a mouse would have been shocking to those who won this country's independence,"" the complaint reads. ""The sweeping authority now vested in a single unelected and unconfirmed individual is antithetical to the nation's entire constitutional structure.""The states also asserted that Musk's actions could harm their residents by disrupting billions of dollars in federal funding for critical services like law enforcement, education and health care. They argued that, for instance, Musk's desire to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could require states to invest far more resources and personnel to ""protect their citizens.""The suit was filed by the attorneys general in New Mexico, Arizona, Michigan, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, Vermont.","Fourteen Democratic state attorneys general sued Elon Musk and President Donald Trump on Thursday to challenge what they called the ""unlawful delegation of executive power"" The lawsuit came on the same day that Musk and his team were sued by a group of govt employees.

'Alarming': AP denounces Trump administration's position on Gulf of America policy



After the Oval Office, the White House again barred Associated Press reporters from accessing Air Force One over the ""Gulf of America"" policy.White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich said that the new agency's ignorance towards changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America shows their commitment to misinformation.""The Associated Press continues to ignore the lawful geographic name change of the Gulf of America. This decision is not just divisive, but it also exposes the Associated Press' commitment to misinformation. While their right to irresponsible and dishonest reporting is protected by the First Amendment, it does not ensure their privilege of unfettered access to limited spaces, like the Oval Office and Air Force One,"" Budowich said.""Going forward, that space will now be opened up to the many thousands of reporters who have been barred from covering these intimate areas of the administration. Associate Press journalists and photographers will retain their credentials to the White House complex,"" he added.Since Tuesday, AP journalists have been prohibited from attending President Donald Trump's Oval Office events due to their non-compliance with his executive order regarding the Gulf's renaming.Earlier, President Donald Trump announced that February 9 would be the first ""Gulf of America Day,"" a move that came after an executive order that set in motion the process of changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico.In a January 23 guidance, AP said it would refer to the Gulf of Mexico “by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen.”""As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences,"" it added.The AP's refusal to follow the Gulf of America policy has irked the Trump administration.Julie Pace, AP's editor-in-chief, denounced the administration's position as an infringement of free speech rights and detrimental to AP's global audience seeking impartial news.""It is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism. Limiting our access to the Oval Office based on the content of AP’s speech not only severely impedes the public’s access to independent news, it plainly violates the First Amendment,"" Pace said in a statement.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the new designation on Wednesday, citing its official adoption by the interior secretary and implementation by Google and Apple on their maps.The White House Correspondents' Association condemned AP's exclusion as ""outrageous"", with president Eugene Daniels warning about potential restrictions on press freedom.Daniels emphasised this action contradicts both First Amendment principles and the president's own directive on speech freedom and federal censorship.Budowich confirmed that whilst AP staff would lose access to specific areas, they would maintain their general White House complex credentials.","White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich said that the new agency's ignorance towards changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico shows their commitment to misinformation.

Who is Hagan Scotten?

What is the case all about?



Another prosecutor of New York Mayor Eric Adams' corruption cases stepped down. As he stepped down the eyebrows raised on the future of this case.Assistant US attorney Hagan Scotten stepped down on Friday after receiving directives from the Trump's justice department to abandon the case, becoming the latest federal attorney to resign in protest of this unusual demand.""No system of liberty can allow the Government to use the carrot of dismissing charges, or the stick of threatening to bring them again, to induce an elected official to support its policy objectives,"" Scotten said.The Democratic mayor faced increasing calls to step down, while pressure grew for New York Governor Kathy Hochul to exercise her authority to remove him as the head of America's largest city, AFP News Agency reported.Danielle Sassoon, appointed by President Donald Trump as acting US attorney for the Southern District of New York, tendered her resignation to Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday, three days after receiving instructions to drop the Adams case.Bove, previously Trump's personal lawyer, requested the charges' dismissal, claiming Adams's prosecution hindered his ""ability to devote full attention and resources to illegal immigration and violent crime.""Scotten's email to Bove stated ""our laws and traditions do not allow using the prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials.""""If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion,"" he said. ""But it was never going to be me.""Scotten, a decorated US Army veteran and Harvard Law School graduate, previously clerked for conservative US Supreme Court Justice John Roberts, and Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee to the Supreme Court.Sassoon, who graduated from Yale Law School and belongs to the conservative Federalist Society, headed the notable 2023 prosecution of disgraced crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried.Several senior members of the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section in Washington, which handles corruption cases, have also submitted their resignations this week.Adams, the first sitting New York mayor to face criminal charges, entered a not guilty plea in September to fraud and bribery charges, claiming he was being targeted for criticising then-president Joe Biden's immigration policies.Refusing to resign, he intends to seek reelection in November.Trump supported Adams last year, stating he was being prosecuted ""for speaking out against open borders.""In an MSNBC interview on Thursday, Governor Hochul criticised the Justice Department's involvement in the Adams case as ""unbelievably unprecedented.""""The Bondi Administration in that Department of Justice is already showing they're corrupt,"" AFP news agency quoted her saying said.Regarding Adams's potential removal, Hochul stated: ""The allegations are extremely concerning and serious, but I cannot, as the Governor of this state, have a knee jerk, politically motivated reaction.""The Justice Department, which Trump claims has unfairly prosecuted him, has undergone extensive reorganisation since the Republican took office, with numerous high-ranking officials being dismissed, demoted or reassigned.The dismissals included members of special counsel Jack Smith's office, who had brought two now-abandoned criminal cases against Trump.","Assistant US attorney Hagan Scotten stepped down on Friday after receiving directives from the Trump's justice department to abandon the case.

Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House on Friday, April 17, 2020 in Washington, DC.""Current variants of the virus show reduced lethality, whilst vaccines demonstrate decreased effectiveness in preventing transmission.According to the National Academy for State Public Health, twenty-one states, including both Republican-led Texas and Florida, and Democratic-governed Arizona and Michigan, currently prohibit school-based coronavirus vaccine requirements.The financial implications of non-compliance by state and local officials remain uncertain.""Anti-vaccine activists hold signs in front of the Massachusetts State House during a protest against Governor Charlie Baker's mandate that all Massachusetts school students enrolled in child care, pre-school, K-12, and post-secondary institutions must receive the flu vaccine this year on August 30, 2020 in Boston, Massachusetts.""Federal education funding has historically served as a tool for Washington's involvement in local education matters.A historical example includes the Senate's 1994 proposed regulation, supported by then-Senator Joe Biden (D-Del.), to withhold federal funding from schools promoting homosexuality as a positive lifestyle choice. This proposal did not receive House approval.Since taking office on January 20, Trump has authorised Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) programme to reduce annual federal spending by up to $1 trillion through extensive staff and grant reductions, targeting organisations like USAID, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Education Department for eventual elimination.",US President Donald Trump will sign an order Friday prohibiting federal funds for educational institutions that mandate COVID-19 student vaccinations.

They also use dangerous land and sea routes to reach Europe in an effort to find jobs.Libya, which has borders with six nations and a long shore on the Mediterranean, was plunged into chaos following a Nato-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.

More than 21,700 migrants were intercepted and returned to the chaos-stricken country.In 2023, the IOM reported 962 migrants dead and 1,563 missing off Libya. Around 17,200 migrants were intercepted and returned to Libya that year, it said.Those who are returned are held in government-run detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture - practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to UN-commissioned investigators. The abuse often accompanies attempts to extort money from the families of the imprisoned migrants before releasing them or allowing them to leave Libya on traffickers' boats to Europe.","At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024 out of 180 countries, a media report said on Tuesday. The CPI ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption on a scale of zero (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean), Dawn.com reported.The CPI report is released annually by Transparency International Berlin.Transparency International Pakistan (TIP) has no role either in the collection of data or the calculation of the country's score, TIP explains.The score for Pakistan also reduced by two points from 29 in CPI 2023 to 27 in CPI 2024.According to a Transparency International document listing Pakistan's CPI ranking and scores from 1996 to 2024, which was seen by Dawn.com, the country's score in the past 10 years has ranged between 27 and 33 points (a higher score indicating less corruption).Since 2012, when the index changed to a scoring scale of 100 from 10, Pakistan's score rose from 27 to 33 in 2018 but declined consecutively back to 27 last year.Statistics from the past show that in 1996, Pakistan ranked only second-last out of 54 countries part of the index back then, with a score of 1/10.From 1997 to 2011, the country's score went back and forth, reaching as high as 2.7 in 1998 and dropping as low as 2.1 in 2004 and 2005.According to TIP chair Justice (retired) Zia Perwez, the scores of all countries in the region except Oman, China, Turkiye and Mongolia declined. The downslide for the region showed that Pakistan was one of the countries holding up against the overall trend in the region.Global corruption levels remained alarmingly high, with efforts to reduce them faltering, according to the CPI report, which exposed serious corruption levels across the globe, with more than two-thirds of countries scoring below 50 out of 100.Almost 6.8 billion people live in countries with CPI scores under 50 - equivalent to 85 per cent of the world population of 8 billion.For the seventh year in a row, Denmark obtained the highest score on the index (90) and was closely followed by Finland (88) and Singapore (84).Countries with the lowest scores were mostly fragile and conflict-affected ones like South Sudan (8), Somalia (9), Venezuela (10), Syria (12), Libya (13), Eritrea (13), Yemen (13) and Equatorial Guinea (13).While the CPI noted that the Middle East and North Africa's rising average score was a ""reason for optimism"", it pointed out that it was the first increase in over a decade and only by one point - to 39 out of 100.According to Transparency International, the top-scoring region was Western Europe and the European Union, but its score ""decreased overall for the second year in a row - many leaders are serving business interests rather than the common good and laws are often poorly enforced"".""While Asia Pacific does have a range of improving countries, its average score is decreasing, as vicious cycles of corruption and climate change impacts take their toll,"" it added.Over a quarter of the countries in the sample (47) got their lowest score yet on the index, including Austria (67), Bangladesh (23), Brazil (34), Cuba (41), France (67), Germany (75), Haiti (16), Hungary (41), Iran (23), Mexico (26), Russia (22), South Sudan (8), Switzerland (81), the United States (65) and Venezuela (10).Over the past five years, seven countries have significantly improved their scores in the index: These include Cote d'Ivoire (45), the Dominican Republic (36), Kosovo (44), Kuwait (46), the Maldives (38), Moldova (43) and Zambia (39).The global average on the index remained unchanged at 43, highlighting the need for urgent action against corruption and warning of a critical global obstacle to implementing successful climate action.",Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024.

BALOCHISTAN: Paank, the human rights department of the Baloch National Movement , has raised concerns regarding the forcible disappearance of 11 individuals from Pasni, Balochistan , between February 8 and February 10.Paank further said that these individuals have allegedly been abducted and unlawfully detained by Pakistan security forces.""Paank is deeply concerned by the enforced disappearances of 11 individuals from Pasni, #Balochistan, between February 8 and February 10, 2025.

Pakistani lawyers stage protest against high-level meeting of constitutional body to pick eight SC judges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-lawyers-stage-protest-against-high-level-meeting-of-constitutional-body-to-pick-eight-sc-judges/articleshow/118118105.cms,"Representative image (Image credits: ANI)

ISLAMABAD: Hundreds of lawyers on Monday staged protests in Pakistan's national capital against a high-level meeting of a constitutional body with the agenda to appoint at least eight judges of the supreme court. The judicial commission of Pakistan (JCP) meeting was being held despite opposition by four apex court judges, the legal fraternity, resistance by opposition the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and controversy over the recent transfer of judges to the Islamabad high court (IHC), which was opposed by five IHC judges.The JCP, a top body empowered to approve judicial appointments, will finalise appointments for eight vacant supreme court judges.Lawyers gathered at various locations in Islamabad, with the lawyers' action committee staging a protest near D-Chowk. But police responded by closing several key entry points to the Red Zone, which houses key buildings, including the supreme court.Dozens of protestors gathered at Serena Chowk as they were stopped from going to the supreme court due to the closure of the Red Zone. They chanted ""Azaadi"" (freedom) and ""Lawyers' unity zindabad"" (long live lawyers' unity). They were also holding a banner written in Urdu and reading "" 26th constitutional amendment unacceptable"".Clashes were also reported between lawyers and police when they tried to enter the Red Zone. However, there was no report of any arrest or injury during the protest.The protest led to the suspension of metro bus services on multiple routes between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, causing significant inconvenience for commuters. The closure of the Red Zone has caused traffic disruptions, leading to heavy congestion on different roads in the capital.Earlier, the legal fraternity in the country was already expressing concerns against the new appointments and transfers following the controversial 26th constitutional amendment passed last year.The lawyers' representatives had held a convention at the Islamabad district courts, opposing the 26th amendment and demanding the cancellation of the JCP meeting.They also announced on February 3 to protest against the transfer of three high court judges to the IHC but it could not elicit a widespread response. The Karachi bar association had supported the strike call by staying away.Last month, the Lahore high court bar association (LHCBA) moved an application before the apex court through advocate Muhammad Waqar Rana, seeking postponement of the JCP meeting.The JCP earlier this month asked all high courts to send a list of five senior judges from each for consideration for the appointment of eight of them to the supreme court.Initially, the IHC had forwarded the names of three judges - chief justice Aamer Farooq, justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb - to the JCP because justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Babar Sattar did not meet the minimum requirement of five years of service.However, as justice Sarfraz Dogar was made the IHC senior puisne judge following his transfer there from the Lahore high court, his name has also been sent to the JCP.Days before justice Dogar's name was added, five judges of the IHC approached chief justice Yahya Afridi and IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq to reclaim their seniority.Separately, four SC judges, senior puisne judge justice Mansoor Ali Shah, justice Munib Akhtar, justice Ayesha Malik and justice Athar Minallah, in a letter to the chief justice showed concerns last week and are also seeking the postponement of today's JCP session until a decision is made on the petitions against the 26th Amendment.The opposition PTI party in a letter to the chief justice on Sunday asked to postpone the commission's meeting.The 13-member JCP is led by the chief justice and includes four judges of the apex court, as well as parliamentarians from both the treasury and opposition and others.The lawyers and opposition allege that the government was trying to 'pack' the top judiciary with hand-picked judges to influence the fate of political cases, a concern rejected by the government.","Hundreds of lawyers stage protests in Islamabad against high-level meeting of constitutional body.

Policemen at the checkpost offered stiff resistance in an encounter which lasted two hours, following which the terrorists fled,” the provincial police said in a statement.Pakistan has experienced an escalation in militancy in KP, adjacent to Afghanistan, following the collapse of a tenuous truce between TTP and the state in Nov 2022.Pakistani authorities have linked the surge in militant violence to cross-border incursions from Afghanistan, alleging that the Kabul administration is facilitating TTP fighters, a claim Afghan authorities refute. Most of these assaults have been directed at security and law-enforcement personnel, although civilians and govt officials have also been impacted.In KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district last week, four soldiers were killed by gunfire and an improvised explosive device (IED) unleashed by terrorists.In Balochistan, another restive province in Pakistan’s south, 18 soldiers were killed in an attack by terrorists earlier this month.Islamabad think-tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) has described 2024 as the most lethal year for security forces in a decade, with a minimum of 685 military and police fatalities resulting from 444 terror attacks.Alongside such attacks, militants have stepped up targeted killings and kidnappings of officials in KP and Balochistan.","Nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

ISLAMABAD : The UN refugees and migration agencies on Wednesday expressed their concern over Pakistan 's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting relocation to the United States and elsewhere.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR , and the international organization for migration in a statement said they were seeking clarification from Pakistan, which said last week it would deport the refugees back to Afghanistan unless their cases were processed quickly by the countries that had agreed to take them in.About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the US under a program that helps people at risk because of their work with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. They were among tens of thousands of Afghans who fled to neighboring Pakistan after their country fell to the Taliban in 2021.However, they were left in limbo after President Donald Trump paused US refugee programs last month.""A UNHCR-issued non-return advisory has been in place since 2021, calling for a suspension of forced returns of Afghan nationals from any country regardless of their status,"" the joint UNHCR-IOM statement said.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif last week gave the green light to evict Afghans without papers from the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi before March 31, in preparation for deportation if they were not relocated to their host countries.UNHCR and IOM said they are especially concerned for Afghan nationals who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians and others.It said since January 1, 2025, an uptick in arrests of Afghan nationals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi has caused significant distress, with reports of Afghan nationals of various documentation statuses being rounded up.The Trump administration also announced the US refugee admissions program would be suspended from January 27 for at least three months. It has shocked Afghans who were hoping to travel to the United States soon.Afghans in Pakistan have been virtually living in hiding since 2023 when a crackdown began on foreigners who are in the country without proper documentation. An estimated 800,000 Afghans have either gone back voluntarily or been deported since despite criticism from UN agencies, rights groups and the Taliban.Besides thousands of Afghans who are living in Pakistan and awaiting travel to host countries, there are around 1.45 million Afghan nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees in Pakistan as well but their stay has been extended until June.In the statement, UNHCR and IOM urged ""Pakistan to implement any relocation measures with due consideration for human rights standards, including due process, and the legal status of proof of registration (POR) and afghan citizen card (ACC) holders, who have resided in Pakistan for an extended period of time"".""Pakistan has a proud tradition of hosting refugees, saving millions of lives.

DHAKA: The foreign ministry of Bangladesh on Thursday said the Yunus government will send a ""formal reminder"" to India regarding the extradition of deposed PM Sheikh Hasina when it deems the timing is appropriate. ""It (the reminder) will be sent when the political leadership feels it is the right time,"" ministry spokesperson Mohammad Rafiqul Alam told reporters. Pressed for details, he emphasised that the matter involves both political considerations and diplomatic procedures .Alam confirmed that Bangladesh had formally requested Hasina's extradition in Dec, submitting a set of relevant documents along with a diplomatic letter (note verbale) to India.On whether Bangladesh had provided an arrest warrant to facilitate the extradition, Alam said all required materials, received from the relevant ministries, had been included in the note verbale.

Taliban's security challenges

One killed and three others suffered injuries in a suicide attack on Afghan ministry of urban development and housing on Thursday.""The suicide attacker wanted to enter the ministry and one of the mujahideen (security forces) shot him and then in the result of the explosion another person near him was killed and three injured,"" interior ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani told AFP.Although violence in Afghanistan has significantly decreased since the Taliban reclaimed power in 2021, the Islamic State (IS) group continues to launch deadly attacks challenging their rule. IS has previously targeted Taliban officials, foreign diplomats, and civilians in Afghanistan.A doctor at Kabul's Emergency Hospital, speaking anonymously, said that ""five to six injured"" individuals had been brought to the facility for treatment. However, official casualty figures often differ from those reported by medical personnel on the ground.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Thursday's attack, but IS has a history of carrying out high-profile bombings in Afghanistan. In December, the group claimed responsibility for a suicide attack that killed Khalil Ur-Rahman Haqqani, the Taliban government's minister for refugees, inside his Kabul office. Just a day before Thursday's attack, IS also claimed responsibility for a deadly assault on a northern Afghan bank, which left eight people dead. The attack specifically targeted Taliban employees collecting their salaries.IS-Khorasan, the Afghan chapter of the Islamic State founded in 2015, has been behind some of the deadliest attacks in the country. The group gained global attention in August 2021 when it bombed Kabul airport during the chaotic US evacuation, killing around 170 Afghans and 13 American service members.Since taking power, the Taliban government has declared security its highest priority, claiming success in curbing IS activities through an extensive crackdown. However, IS remains a persistent threat, continuing to target government officials and civilians alike.Security forces frequently seal off attack sites, making independent verification of casualty figures difficult. The Taliban maintains that its counterterrorism measures have weakened IS, but Thursday's bombing highlights the ongoing security challenges the administration faces.","One killed and three others injured in suicide attack on Afghan ministry of urban development and housing.

DHAKA: A UN report released on Wednesday found that human rights abuses were inflicted on members of Bangladesh's Hindu, Ahmadiyya Muslim and indigenous communities during the anti-discrimination protests that led to Sheikh Hasina govt's fall and its aftermath in 204.While 100 arrests related to attacks on distinct religious & indigenous groups have reportedly been made, perpetrators of many other acts of revenge violence and targeted attacks on such groups still enjoy impunity, UN Human Rights Office said. After fall of the govt, ""widespread attacks were reported against Hindu homes, businesses and places of worship"", it said. The report validates India's repeated claims of targeted attacks on Hindus & temples.Widespread attacks were reported against Hindu homes, businesses, and places of worship, especially in rural and historically tense areas such as Thakurgaon, Lalmonirhat and Dinajpur, as well as other places such as Sylhet, Khulna, and Rangpur"", said the UN report titled 'Human Rights Violations and Abuses related to Protests of July and August 2024 in Bangladesh'.These destructions were especially prevalent in areas perceived to be sympathetic to the Awami League as Hindus have often been stereotypically associated with this political faction, it added. The report, based on the deaths reported by various credible sources, also estimated that as many as 1,400 people may have been killed during July 1-Aug 15 last year and thousands were injured, the vast majority of whom were shot by Bangladesh's security forces.""Bangladesh's former govt, security and intelligence services, alongside violent elements associated with Awami League, systematically engaged in a range of serious human rights violations during last year's student-led protests,"" it added.Former PM Sheikh Hasina left the country on Aug 5 and Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt began its journey three days later. The report released by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights documented ""troubling instances"" of retaliatory killings and revenge violence during the student-led protests. It stated that security and intelligence services ""systematically engaged"" in rights violations that could amount to crimes against humanity.UN Human Rights chief Volker Turk described the response as a ""calculated and well-coordinated strategy"" by the Hasina govt to retain power amid mass opposition. ""Hundreds of extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, detentions, and torture"" were carried out with political leadership's knowledge and coordination, he added.Director of Rights and Risks Analysis Group (RRAG) Suhas Chakma criticised the report for not identifying individual officers responsible for the carnage, citing the limitations of Yunus's interim govt, which restricted the investigation period from July 5 to Aug 15, 2024.The report also includes recommendations to reform Bangladesh's security and justice sectors. ""The interim govt must ensure that violent crimes targeting supporters of Awami League, police officers, or members of distinct religious and indigenous groups are promptly and independently investigated with due diligence and that identified perpetrators are brought to justice,"" it said.","UN reports rights abuses in B'desh 2024 protest response, estimates 1,400 killed. 100 arrests related to attacks on distinct religious & indigenous groups have reportedly been made. perpetrators of many other acts of revenge violence and targeted attacks on such groups still enjoy impunity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118196706,imgsize-566875,width-400,resizemode-4/118196706.jpg"

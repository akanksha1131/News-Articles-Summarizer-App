"St Pete-Clearwater International Airport: Florida’s St Pete-Clearwater International Airport receives bomb threat, forces evacuation of Allegiant flight",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/floridas-st-pete-clearwater-international-airport-receives-bomb-threat-forces-evacuation-of-allegiant-flight/articleshow/120635806.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: X/@LindsayH4)

Florida’s St Pete-Clearwater International Airport (PIE) received a bomb threat, after a note was discovered inside an Allegiant Air flight , prompting an evacuation and a temporary airport shutdown.After a thorough investigation, the airport returned to normal operations by Friday night.According to the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office (PCSO), the Allegiant plane had landed from Cincinnati around 5:30 pm (local time) and was scheduled to return to the same destination.As the aircraft taxied from the gate, a flight attendant opened the rear lavatory door and found a written bomb threat, prompting the pilot to stop the plane and evacuate the passengers immediately.“Everyone was safely deplaned and there were no injuries,” Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said during a news briefing. The PCSO confirmed that the threat was ""very broad"" and appeared to extend beyond a single aircraft. “It wasn't limited to the particular plane and included all Allegiant planes at the airport,” Gualtieri added, as reported by Fox 13.Authorities subsequently grounded all six Allegiant aircraft at the airport. Bomb-sniffing dogs were deployed to sweep the planes while passengers from each were safely disembarked. No explosives were found on any of the aircraft, and the airport reopened around 8 pm (local time), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed.The incident occurred shortly before Allegiant Flight 2006 was set to depart for Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport at 3:59 pm (local time), according to a statement released by Allegiant Air. “The safety of our passengers and crew is always our priority,” the airline said, adding that it is cooperating with law enforcement during the ongoing investigation.As per ABC Action News, all passengers aboard the affected flight are being interviewed, and investigators reportedly have some suspects. However, Sheriff Gualtieri did not elaborate on who might be responsible for the written threat.As per the news agency Associated Press, the threat has emerged at a time when fewer Americans report feeling safe about flying, based on recent polling by the AP-NORC Centre for Public Affairs Research.Travellers were advised to check with their airlines for updates regarding specific flights impacted during the closure.","Florida's St Pete-Clearwater International Airport received a bomb threat.

Former Indiana commissioner gets jail time for attempted assault on daughter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/former-indiana-commissioner-gets-jail-time-for-attempted-assault-on-daughter/articleshow/120634692.cms,"John Jessup , a former Hancock County commissioner in Indiana, was sentenced on Thursday to six to fifteen years in prison after pleading guilty to attempted sexual assault of his daughter during her 21st birthday trip to Las Vegas in January 2023.According to court documents, Jessup took his daughter Rachel Keesling to Harrah’s Las Vegas, where they drank and gambled. Prosecutors said Jessup encouraged her to continue drinking despite her feeling unwell and provided her with three Long Island iced teas. After taking her to a strip club, Keesling became so intoxicated that she had to be returned to the hotel in a wheelchair.Keesling later woke up in their hotel room to find her father sexually assaulting her. Jessup stopped when she began to move. He was initially charged with sexual assault but entered a plea agreement with the Clark County District Attorney ’s Office, reducing the charge to attempted sexual assault.As part of the plea deal, Jessup must serve a minimum of six years in prison, register as a sex offender, and is barred from contacting his daughter or other family members for life.“Since my biological father sexually assaulted me on January 26 last year, my life feels like it’s shattered,” Keesling said in court during her statement before sentencing. She said she publicly identified herself after Jessup was elected to the Hancock City Council despite the charges.“I’m processing a lot right now in all aspects,” she said after the decision, adding that she has changed her last name and continues to deal with the psychological impact of the assault.Jessup, 50, was still serving as county commissioner when the incident occurred and later ran for city council while the charges were pending. He has since resigned from his elected position. In court, he said, “I’m not the same man I was.”“Fathers are supposed to protect their children. They’re not supposed to violate them when they are vulnerable,” said Deputy District Attorney Morgan Thomas.","John Jessup, a former Hancock County commissioner in Indiana, was sentenced on Thursday to six to fifteen years in prison.

Virginia Giuffre , who became one of the most powerful voices against Jeffrey Epstein ’s global sex trafficking ring and accused Britain’s Prince Andrew of sexual abuse , has died by suicide at the age of 41, her family confirmed.She passed away at her farm in Neergabby , Western Australia.""It is with utterly broken hearts that we announce that Virginia passed away last night at her farm in Western Australia,"" her family said in a statement. “She lost her life to suicide, after being a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking”, the statement added.Giuffre, originally from Florida, was widely recognised as the face of the movement to bring Epstein and his enablers to justice.As per NBC News, she was one of the first survivors to publicly name Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell , providing critical information that aided multiple investigations, including the one that led to Maxwell’s 2021 conviction.""Virginia was a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking. She was the light that lifted so many survivors,"" her family said. ""In the end, the toll of abuse is so heavy that it became unbearable for Virginia to handle its weight"", her family added.In 2021, Giuffre filed a federal lawsuit against Prince Andrew, alleging that he sexually abused her when she was 17 after being trafficked to him by Epstein and Maxwell. The prince denied the allegations but settled the case out of court for an undisclosed sum in 2022, without admitting liability.Giuffre had earlier testified in Paris against Jean-Luc Brunel , the late French modelling agent who was accused of sexual abuse and also linked to Epstein. “I wanted Brunel to know that he no longer has the power over me,” she said after her 2021 testimony.Her brother, Danny Wilson , was quoted by NBC News as saying that Giuffre had been struggling with physical and mental pain. “She was in real physical pain — suffered from renal failure. But I think that the mental pain was worse,” he said.Her lawyer, Sigrid McCawley, described her as “a dear friend and an incredible champion for other victims,” while her representative, Dini von Mueffling, said she was “one of the most extraordinary human beings I have ever had the honour to know.”In her earlier appeals, Giuffre had urged authorities to listen. 'Take us serious, we matter"", she had told NBC’s Dateline.Epstein died by suicide in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial. Maxwell was convicted on five counts of sex trafficking in 2021. Brunel also died by suicide in prison in 2022.","Virginia Giuffre, 41, died at her farm in Neergabby, Western Australia.

'I had no control over Trump winning in US and Trudeau resigning'



NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said the possibility that the party may collapse in this election does not frustrate him as he has always put Canada before the party. In an interview with the Toronto Star, Jagmeet said he stood by his decision to not go for an early election last fall when support for Justin Trudeau's Liberals plummeted as he wanted to stop Pierre Poilievre 's seizure of power.“While we could have won lots of seats, it would have meant a Pierre Poilievre majority Conservative government, and I could not stomach that,” Singh said.“I love my party. I care deeply about it. I want us to win. I want us to up our seats. I know we’re good for people. But in that moment, I made a decision for the interest of the country ahead of my party. And that was a decision I made wide-eyed, and I stand by that decision.”Jagmeet Singh said he has zero regrets because the circumstances were out of his hands. “Really, I have no regrets,” Singh said during the virtual interview. “I couldn’t control the outcome of the fact that Donald Trump came in and Trudeau resigned. I had no control over those circumstances.”“The math is just not there for the Conservatives,” he said. “People have chosen and this the way it looks like they’re headed. And I’m saying don’t give (Carney) all the power. Mark Carney is going to do things that are really problematic, and his track record is one that’s very problematic.”Some polls suggested that the NDP may lose its official status in Parliament and the party is also going through an internal rift. Former NDP leader Tom Mulcair says Jagmeet Singh cannot continue leading the party if this happens. ""Mr Singh knows what the results are going to be. I think he’s serene in his understanding of what it might mean for him, and I’m not getting any indication that he’s intent of fighting to stay on,” Mulcair said.","'I had no control over Trump winning in US and Trudeau resigning' Jagmeet Singh said.

The FBI accused Dugan of allowing Eduardo Flores-Ruiz , a Mexican national facing domestic battery charges, to exit her courtroom through a non-public jury door on April 18, allegedly to avoid arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents waiting outside.FBI Director Kash Patel called Dugan an “increased danger to the public” in a social media post announcing the arrest. She was taken into custody en route to her courthouse office and later released following a brief appearance in federal court. Dugan has not issued a statement, with the chief judge noting judicial conduct rules prevent her from commenting on pending cases. Her court docket will be handled by another judge for now.According to an FBI affidavit, Flores-Ruiz, previously deported through Arizona over a decade ago, had returned without authorisation and was scheduled to appear in Dugan’s courtroom on three counts of misdemeanor domestic battery. After learning that ICE agents were waiting outside, the judge became “visibly angry,” allegedly diverted the agents, and directed Flores-Ruiz and his attorney through an exit typically off-limits to defendants.Flores-Ruiz was later apprehended by agents outside the courthouse after a brief foot pursuit.Dugan, 65, is a well-known civic figure, respected for her courtroom discipline and visible presence at interfaith and public events. Elected in 2016 after defeating a Republican appointee, she ran unopposed in 2022 and is serving a term that ends in 2028. She previously led Catholic Charities of Southeastern Wisconsin and served as president of the Milwaukee Bar Association. Her legal work has focused on civil rights, domestic abuse, elder law, and disability issues.Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson criticised the arrest as being “more about hype than community safety,” while the ACLU of Wisconsin warned the move could deter people from reporting crimes or emergencies. Meanwhile, state Republican leaders called the charges “deeply troubling” and said they undermine public trust in the judiciary.Dugan is due back in court on May 15, this time as a defendant.","Hannah Dugan, 65, is a well-known civic figure, respected for her courtroom discipline and visible presence at interfaith and public events.

Lawyers for Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil say they will argue that his deportation should be blocked after the Trump administration acknowledged he was arrested without a warrant. Govt said in a court filing Thursday ICE agents didn't have a warrant when they took Khalil, who led anti-Israel protests, into custody in March outside a university-owned apartment in New York. Justice department lawyers argued the ""warrantless"" arrest was justified because ICE agents who approached Khalil on the street thought he might try to flee after refusing to cooperate with them.","ICE agents didn't have a warrant when they took Khalil into custody in March outside a university-owned apartment in New York.

Milwaukee judge arrested by FBI for allegedly helping man evade immigration authorities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/milwaukee-judge-arrested-by-fbi-for-allegedly-helping-man-evade-immigration-authorities/articleshow/120633665.cms,"FBI agents on Friday (local time) arrested Milwaukee county circuit court judge Hannah Dugan , accusing her of helping a man evade federal immigration agents in a courthouse incident that has sparked fresh tensions between the judiciary and the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.Dugan was charged with concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest, and with obstructing a proceeding. Authorities allege she escorted 30-year-old Eduardo Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer through a restricted courthouse door to avoid arrest by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, who later detained Flores-Ruiz after a foot chase outside the courthouse.“Judge Dugan wholeheartedly regrets and protests her arrest. It was not made in the interest of public safety,"" said her attorney Craig Mastantuono during a brief court appearance following her arrest. Dugan was later released.The Trump administration has often accused local officials of obstructing federal immigration enforcement, and this arrest adds to an already fraught relationship between the executive branch and the judiciary. “The rule of law is very simple,"" said Attorney General Pam Bondi. ""It doesn't matter what line of work you're in. If you break the law, we will follow the facts and we will prosecute you.”Court documents reveal Dugan was alerted to the presence of ICE agents by her clerk. Witnesses said she appeared ""visibly angry,"" called the situation ""absurd,"" and led agents to the chief judge’s office before guiding Flores-Ruiz through a jury door into a non-public area of the courthouse. According to the FBI affidavit, the door was typically used only by juries, deputies, and in-custody defendants — not attorneys or un-detained individuals.Flores-Ruiz, who had previously been deported in 2013, was in court for a hearing on misdemeanor domestic battery charges . If convicted, he faces up to nine months in jail and a $10,000 fine for each of the three counts.Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers criticised the arrest, stating, “The Trump administration has repeatedly used dangerous rhetoric to attack and attempt to undermine our judiciary at every level.”Meanwhile, Senator Tammy Baldwin called the move a “gravely serious and drastic” action that could threaten the separation of powers . Civic leader Emilio De Torre, speaking at a protest outside the federal courthouse, said, “She was certainly trying to make sure that due process is not disrupted and that the sanctity of the courts is upheld.”The case draws parallels with the prosecution of a Massachusetts judge under the first Trump administration, which was ultimately dropped under President Biden.Judge Dugan, elected to the Milwaukee court in 2016, previously worked at Legal Action of Wisconsin and the Legal Aid Society.

And they've had that fight for 1,000 years in Kashmir,” he told reporters. “Kashmir has been going on for 1,000 years, probably longer than that. And it was a bad one yesterday, though, that was a bad one. Over 30 people.”The terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam on April 22 killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in what has been the worst attack in the Valley since Pulwama in 2019. Indian authorities have attributed the attack to The Resistance Front (TRF), believed to be a proxy of the banned Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).When asked if he planned to intervene, Trump said, “There have been tensions on that border for 1,500 years. So, you know, the same as it's been, but they'll get it figured out one way or the other. I'm sure… I know both leaders. There is great tension between Pakistan and India. But there always has been.”India responded to the attack by suspending the Indus Waters Treaty , withdrawing visas issued to Pakistani nationals, closing the Attari Integrated Check Post, and scaling down diplomatic presence in Islamabad.

"'Not only unlawful, but harmful': 19 states sue Trump administration over DEI programs in public schools",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-only-unlawful-but-harmful-19-states-sue-trump-administration-over-dei-programs-in-public-schools/articleshow/120629544.cms,"Donald Trump

In a move to challenge the Trump administration's efforts to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in public schools, 19 states filed a federal lawsuit on Friday.The lawsuit, filed in Massachusetts by Democratic attorneys general, seeks to block the Department of Education’s directive, issued on April 3, which threatened to cut federal funding if states did not comply with civil rights laws and reject what the federal government deemed ""illegal DEI practices.""The directive required states to certify their compliance by April 24, including gathering signatures from local school systems confirming their adherence. However, the plaintiffs, attorneys general from 19 states, argue that they will not abandon policies designed to ensure equal access to education and that their prior certifications of compliance with the law stand.“Diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives are legal efforts that help students feel safe, supported and respected. The Trump administration’s threats to withhold critical education funding due to the use of these initiatives are not only unlawful, but harmful to our children, families, and schools,” said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell.This new lawsuit follows a series of rulings against the Trump administration earlier this week. Judges in three states issued decisions blocking elements of the directive: a Maryland judge postponed the effective date of the February 14 memo, which instructed schools to end practices that differentiate people based on race; a judge in Washington, DC, granted a preliminary injunction against the April certification letter; and in New Hampshire, a judge ruled that the education department cannot enforce either directive against the plaintiffs, which include one of the nation's largest teachers' unions.All three cases argue that the guidance threatens academic freedom and is vague, leaving schools uncertain about what actions are permissible, such as whether voluntary student groups for minority students can continue.The new lawsuit warns that the administration’s directive could put more than $13.8 billion in federal funding at risk, money that supports students, including those with disabilities.“Plaintiffs are left with an impossible choice: either certify compliance with an ambiguous and unconstitutional federal directive -- threatening to chill policies, programs and speech -- or risk losing indispensable funds that serve their most vulnerable student populations,” the lawsuit states.The lawsuit is backed by the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.The education department has not yet responded to requests for comment. Linda McMahon, education secretary under President Donald Trump, had warned that states refusing to sign the certification forms could face funding cuts. In an interview on the Fox Business Network, McMahon stated that states that do not comply could “risk some defunding in their districts,” adding that the purpose of the form is “to make sure there’s no discrimination that’s happening in any of the schools.”","19 states filed a federal lawsuit on Friday against the Trump administration's efforts to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in public schools.

NEW DELHI: In his first public reaction to the recent terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, US President Donald Trump described the incident as “a bad one” and acknowledged the long-standing tensions between India and Pakistan.Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump reflected on the deep-rooted nature of the conflict in Kashmir and voiced hope that both nations would “figure it out.”“I’m very close to India and very close to Pakistan,” Trump said. “They’ve had that fight for a thousand years in Kashmir… that was a bad one yesterday—over 30 people,” he added, referencing the April 22 terror strike in the Valley, that claimed the lives of 25 Indian tourists and one Nepali citizen.When asked about his concerns over the escalating border tensions, Trump said that the India-Pakistan rivalry along the Line of Control has persisted for centuries. “Tensions on that border for 1,500 years… but I am sure they’ll get it figured out one way or the other,” he said, while reiterating his familiarity with both countries’ leadership.Following the deadly attack in Pahalgam, India swiftly introduced a range of diplomatic measures: suspending the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme for Pakistani nationals, closing the Integrated Check Post at Attari, issuing a 40-hour return deadline for Pakistani visitors, and reducing diplomatic staff in both countries' high commissions.India also halted its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty—a decades-old water-sharing agreement brokered by the World Bank in 1960 after nine years of negotiations. Recognised as one of the most durable international treaties, the Indus Waters Treaty allocates the three eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej) to India, while Pakistan receives rights over the three western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab). India is entitled to 20% of the Indus River System’s waters under the pact, with Pakistan receiving the remaining 80%.",US President Donald Trump described the recent terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam as ‘a bad one’ Trump reflected on the deep-rooted nature of the conflict in Kashmir and voiced hope that both nations would ‘figure it out’,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120629189,imgsize-960833,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-6.jpg"
"What did arrested Wisconsin judge Hannah Dugan do? Courtroom drama, escorting 'illegal migrant' to safety",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-did-arrested-wisconsin-judge-hannah-dugan-do-courtroom-drama-escorting-illegal-migrant-to-safety/articleshow/120629168.cms,"Milwaukee judge Hannah Dugan was arrested on Friday morning. She was released later.

What did the judge do?



Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested by the FBI on Friday on charges of obstruction and concealing an individual to prevent their arrest. FBI director Kash Patel announced the arrest and said the judge intentionally misdirected federal agents away from an illegal alien who was to be arrested. Though Patel deleted his first post, he made the same post later. Dugan appeared briefly in Milwaukee federal court Friday morning before being released after prosecutors said they would not ask for her detention before trial. Her arraignment has been set for May 15.The allegations stem from an incident on April 18 when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrived at her courtroom to arrest Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a Mexican national and undocumented immigrant wanted for deportation.After being informed of the agents’ presence, Dugan reportedly became visibly angry, called the situation “absurd,” and confronted the agents in a public hallway, demanding they leave and insisting they needed a different warrant to make the arrest. She directed them to speak with the chief judge.Investigators claimed Dugan escorted Flores-Ruiz and his attorney through a non-public jury door into a private area of the courthouse, allegedly to help him evade ICE agents.Patel stated that Dugan “intentionally misdirected” federal agents, allowing Flores-Ruiz to temporarily avoid arrest. Flores-Ruiz was later apprehended outside the courthouse.“These events were also unusual for two reasons,” the complaint states. “First, the courtroom deputy had previously heard Judge Dugan direct people not to sit in the jury box because it was exclusively for the jury’s use. Second, according to the courtroom deputy, only deputies, juries, court staff, and in-custody defendants being escorted by deputies used the back jury door. Defense attorneys and defendants who were not in custody never used the jury door.”Flores-Ruiz and his attorney made it out of the courthouse before the suspect was arrested by an FBI and DEA agent following a brief foot chase.Flores Ruiz had been arrested after police were called to a Milwaukee home for a reported fight March 12. In addition to repeatedly punching a person, the police report says he struck a woman who tried to break up the altercation.",Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested by the FBI on Friday on charges of obstruction and concealing an individual to prevent their arrest.

SEVIS is being quietly restored for international students across US: Indian students who were the most impacted can breathe easy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sevis-is-being-quietly-restored-for-international-students-across-us-indian-students-who-were-the-most-impacted-can-breathe-easy/articleshow/120628179.cms,"(AI image)

MUMBAI: International students will be able to breathe easy, at least for now, as the Trump administration appears to have backtracked on the abrupt, unlawful SEVIS termination of hundreds of international students.Immigration attorneys are reporting that since Thursday evening, Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records have been quietly reinstated for a large number of international students across the US, including those students who are not involved in lawsuits filed to challenge termination of their records.According to attorneys, news is pouring in from the international student community and from educational institutions of a terminated status suddenly becoming ‘active’. In many cases, Designated School Officers (DSOs) have informed students of the reactivation of their SEVIS records.For instance, ‘The Daily Californian’, an independent, student-run newspaper which covers the UC Berkeley campus and Berkeley city, has reported: “At UC Berkeley, 12 students have had their status restored today after 23 were terminated since April 4.”SEVIS is the web-based information system that the US agencies use to track and monitor international students during their duration of study. On abrupt termination of SEVIS – an exercise that began in mid-March, affected students were informed by DSOs to self-deport, resulting in several lawsuits being filed.Initially – as of Thursday, educational institutes were unaware for the reasons for reactivation. However, immigration attorneys state that some institutions have now been informed that Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) is developing a policy that will provide a framework for SEVIS record terminations. “Until such a policy is issued the SEVIS records will remain active/will be reactivated. ICE will not modify the SEVIS records solely based on the NCIC finding that resulted in the recent SEVIS terminations…,” states the communication. The National Crime Information Center (NCIC) is a central database for crime-related information in the US, maintained by the Criminal Justice Information Services Division (CJIS) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It provides access to virtually all law enforcement agencies nationwide and enables rapid exchange of information.The New York Times reports that “The Trump administration on Friday abruptly walked back its cancellation of more than 1,500 student visas held by international students, announcing a dramatic shift by ICE during a court hearing in Washington. Joseph F. Carilli, a Justice Department lawyer, said that immigration officials had begun work on a new system for reviewing and terminating visas for international students and that until the process was complete, agencies would not make additional changes or further revocations.” The paper also quotes him as saying that the government was prepared to file the policy change across other lawsuits, potentially providing some reprieve for students who had sued to have their visas reinstated and remain in the country through graduation ceremonies in the spring.The grounds on which action was taken against international students for F-1 visa revocation and/or SEVIS termination were arbitrary. Based on the recent statement by ICE, in many cases it was presumably based on NCIC data. As reported by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) and other advocacy groups, not all instances of termination related to campus activism. Some related to minor infractions with police such as not wearing a seatbelt, tickets for illegal parking, or speeding tickets or even instances of domestic violence where even the victim is taken into custody. In other cases, the international students had no run-in with the police at all.According to immigration attorneys, during the recent court hearings US agencies have not been able to offer any tangible explanation for the abrupt termination of SEVIS records, except to counter that it does not result in irreparable harm. With Indian students being the largest cohort, they were the most impacted by the abrupt SEVIS terminations. Hundreds of students have filed lawsuits with various district courts challenging their SEVIS termination – which made them vulnerable to devastating immigration outcomes such as detention and deportation, as well as irreparable harm. Many others are lining up to file individual lawsuits or join class action suits.Courts such as Georgia, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Washington and Wisconsin have granted temporary restraining orders. As reported by TOI recently, pursuant to an order of a district court (Northern District of Georgia) SEVIS records of all 133 students who were party to a lawsuit were reinstated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) retroactive to March 31.Jonathan Wasden, an immigration attorney, said, “We are seeing many SEVIS status being reactivated in cases of our clients who had obtained temporary restraining orders. It seems that the DHS is slowly working its way out of the hole it dug for itself. We are also hearing that DHS has been reactivating SEVIS in cases where these international students have not sued. The heavy lift may be done here and the agency may be backing off on this issue.”Some immigration attorneys are asking international students to approach their DSOs to check their SEVIS records, before planning any further course of action. On the other hand, due to the uncertainty involved, several students have decided to proceed with their plans of a lawsuit.IMMPact Litigation a joint venture of four law firms, is all set to file a class action suit in the coming week, as many questions still remain unanswered – including those relating to unlawful presence, OPT unemployment accrual (while the students could not work), or whether revoked visas will be reinstated again.","Immigration attorneys are reporting that since Thursday evening, Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records have been quietly reinstated for a large number of international students.

Former Republican lawmaker George Santos, 36, who was expelled from the US Congress for using stolen donor cash to bankroll a lavish lifestyle, was sentenced to seven years in prison Friday. Santos had faced at least two years in prison and a maximum of 22 years after pleading guilty to wire fraud and identity theft for his elaborate grifting while a lawmaker.""He admitted to engaging in a brazen crime spree that took place over a period of years. He stole personal identities and financial information from campaign contributors, made unauthorized transfers of money to his campaign, and to himself personally,"" said prosecutor John Durham. ""He went so far as to seek out elderly people with cognitive impairment and dementia.""Judge Joanna Seybert in Federal District Court in Central Islip sentenced Santos to seven years and three months. In August 2024 she had ordered Santos to pay more than $370,000 in restitution which prosecutors say has gone unpaid.Ahead of his sentencing, Santos suspended his Cameo account on which users had been able to pay to request custom videos.""I have disabled the ability to make new requests as I am unsure if I will be able to fulfill them in recent days,"" he wrote on X.He has said that he has no plans to request a pardon from US President Donald Trump and is resigned to prison. Despite his guilty plea, federal prosecutors have insisted that Santos's social media shows his claims of remorse ""ring hollow.""""As of this writing, despite years of actively courting media attention and capitalizing on his infamy, Santos has forfeited nothing of his ill-gotten gains and has not repaid one cent to any of the victims of his financial crimes,"" prosecutors wrote.Santos was elected to the US House of Representatives in 2022 and indicted the following year for stealing from campaign donors and engaging in credit card fraud, money laundering and identity theft. Santos used donor money for Botox treatments and the OnlyFans porn website, as well as luxury Italian goods and vacations to the Hamptons and Las Vegas, according to an investigation by a congressional ethics committee. He had been scheduled to go on trial on September 9 on some two dozen charges, but opted instead to enter a guilty plea to wire fraud and identity theft.(With agency inputs)","George Santos, 36, was expelled from the US Congress for using stolen donor cash to bankroll a lavish lifestyle.

"Public opinion moulded India’s response to terror, Pak’s ‘tit-for-tat’ came through generals",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/public-opinion-moulded-indias-response-to-terror-paks-tit-for-tat-came-through-generals/articleshow/120629321.cms,"Representative image

ISLAMABAD: The manner of Pakistan’s tit-for-tat response to punitive diplomatic measures by India over the April 22 terrorist attack on tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam highlights deeper structural differences between the neighbours.India’s decision to slap a series of retaliatory costs on Pakistan for cross-border terrorism was framed at a meeting of elected representatives led by PM Narendra Modi, reflecting democratic consensus amid a groundswell of public outrage over the killing of 26 people, all but one of them tourists.In contrast, Pakistan’s response came through the National Security Committee, dominated by military generals and underscoring the army’s outsized role in what would normally be an elected government’s prerogative. That this comes amid increasing political instability, with ex-PM Imran Khan of Tehreek-e-Insaf behind bars, adds to the dichotomy.By rejecting India’s allegations of involvement in the attack as “baseless”, Pakistan sought to deflect blame, emphasising its condemnation of the violence and extending condolences for the loss of lives.But foreign minister Ishaq Dar’s demand for evidence, while diplomatically sound, lacks credibility given Pakistan’s historical links with militant groups.Islamabad’s denial, coupled with its claim of a “false flag operation” by India, appears more rhetorical than substantive, as it fails to address Delhi’s security concerns or sway international opinion, with the US and EU condemning the attack and aligning with India.Pakistan’s suspension of the 1972 Simla Agreement, which established the Line of Control (LoC) and committed both nations to resolving disputes bilaterally, is a bold but risky move. It signals a rejection of the post-1971 status quo, potentially inviting international scrutiny over Kashmir, which Pakistan has long sought.However, this could backfire, as India’s stronger global diplomatic clout may overshadow Pakistan’s narrative, especially without concrete evidence to counter Delhi’s charge of sponsoring cross-border terrorism.Pakistan’s assertion that India’s suspension of the Indus Water Treaty was an “act of war” could be seen as highly escalatory, risking military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours. The statement’s bellicose tone apparently aims to deter India and rally domestic support, but limits diplomatic flexibility.The decision to suspend trade, close airspace and expel Indian diplomats mirrors India’s actions, signalling a desire to project strength domestically and internationally. However, these measures risk further isolating Pakistan economically, already strained by internal challenges.The closure of the Wagah border and suspension of train services disrupt minimal bilateral trade, disproportionately affecting Pakistan’s smaller economy. Similarly, barring Indian airlines from Pakistani airspace may inconvenience India, but also isolates Pakistan’s aviation sector, potentially deterring foreign investment.Pakistan’s response, while assertive, lacks strategic depth and risks escalating a crisis it is ill-equipped to sustain. By prioritising symbolic retaliation over diplomatic engagement, Pakistan has probably undermined its international credibility and economic stability.","India’s decision to slap a series of retaliatory costs on Pakistan for cross- border terrorism was framed at a meeting of elected representatives led by PM Narendra Modi.

The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) on Friday claimed responsibility for a deadly roadside bomb attack in Quetta that killed ten Pakistani military personnel and injured three others.The blast occurred in the Margat area on the outskirts of the Balochistan capital, targeting a vehicle reportedly belonging to a bomb disposal squad.According to The Balochistan Post, the device was a remote-controlled improvised explosive device (IED).Soon after the blast, the BLA released a video showing the attack in a remote and hilly area.While police at first reported four deaths, the BLA later said in a statement that ten soldiers were killed and the vehicle was completely destroyed.“Freedom fighters targeted a Pakistani Army convoy with a remote-controlled IED in Margat. The vehicle was destroyed, and all 10 soldiers on board were killed,” said BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch.This attack is part of a series of strikes by the BLA. In March, the group hijacked the Jaffar Express train, resulting in around 60 deaths, another major act in the long-running conflict between the Baloch insurgents and the Pakistani government.","The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for a deadly roadside bomb attack in Quetta that killed ten Pakistani military personnel and injured three others.

'Jung karni hai to...': How Pakistanis are trolling themselves on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/jung-karni-hai-to-how-pakistanis-are-trolling-themselves-on-social-media/articleshow/120622600.cms,"After the Pahalgam massacre—where terrorists from Pakistan crossed the border and executed 26 people in cold blood—the usual geopolitical script began to unfold. India condemned, Pakistan denied, and the West reached for its thesaurus of euphemisms : “gunmen,” “militants,” “insurgents.” But something unusual happened this time. The sharpest rebuke didn’t come from New Delhi or Washington. It came from within Pakistan itself.Not from TV anchors or ministers. But from everyday Pakistanis—with Wi-Fi in one hand, rage in the other, and no illusions left to break.Take this tweet: “Jung karni ho to 9 baje se pehle kar lena, 9:15 per gas chali jati hai hamari.”Translation: If you're planning a war, please do it before 9am—we run out of gas after that.It would be hilarious if it weren’t heartbreakingly accurate. Pakistan, a nuclear power, can’t guarantee a cup of tea in the morning.Another tweet offered mock-condolences: “People of Karachi, Faisalabad, Multan, Islamabad—we are sorry.”A citizen apologising not for terrorism—but for governance. Or the lack of it.This isn’t your everyday political frustration. This is something more profound. More fatalistic. What we're witnessing is post-collapse satire—not born from resistance, but from resignation. Not defiance, but detachment. Pakistanis aren’t mocking their military, politicians, or failing institutions because they’re angry. They're doing it because there's nothing left to do but laugh.The timing of this public self-roast is revealing. Pakistan has once again been implicated in a cross-border terrorist attack. The victims were targeted for their religion. The attackers were affiliated with Lashkar-e-Taiba ’s proxy, The Resistance Front. And while the world watched, Pakistanis didn’t take to the streets to support their “freedom fighters.” They didn’t protest Indian foreign policy. They turned inward—and began roasting the very state that enabled this tragedy.Not because they were suddenly overcome with guilt. But because they’ve understood what the world still struggles to say aloud:The real victim of Pakistan’s obsession with jihad isn’t India. It’s Pakistanis themselves.Their fuel. Their food. Their currency. Their safety. Their dignity.All sacrificed at the altar of “strategic depth.”While generals polish their medals and issue denials, the public boils with a mix of exhaustion and clarity. There’s no electricity. Gas is rationed like contraband. Inflation hovers at 30%. The rupee is in freefall. The government runs on loans. And when Pakistan was supposed to host the ICC Champions Trophy, India refused to show up—forcing Pakistan to play on neutral ground in Dubai. The punchline wrote itself: even Pakistan can’t host itself without a connecting flight.This level of civic self-awareness would have once been dangerous. A decade ago, a sarcastic tweet could get you disappeared. Today, the dam has broken. Not because the state has grown tolerant—but because the people have grown numb. The rot is no longer underground. It’s trending on X.If memes are the last resort of a powerless populace, then Pakistanis are now full-time philosophers. Their humour is bleak, their metaphors are postmodern, and their sarcasm is indistinguishable from sadness. This is not the comedy of rebellion. This is the comedy of collapse.After Pahalgam, the rest of the world looked at Pakistan with suspicion. But for once, Pakistanis looked inward—and they laughed. Not because they didn’t care. But because they’ve stopped pretending that anything will change. The state has lost the plot. The people have rewritten it as dark comedy.And so, in the aftermath of yet another tragedy, it wasn’t India that needed to respond. The loudest condemnation came from within Pakistan. Not through op-eds or diplomatic cables, but through memes, tweets, and deadpan jokes. The only thing that still functions on time in Pakistan today is the punchline.They mocked their inability to keep the lights on. Their dependence on bailouts. Their cricketing humiliations. Their rulers. Their uniforms.It was gallows humour in a gaslit republic.Albert Camus would’ve called it freedom—the moment you stop asking why and simply push the boulder again. That’s the Sisyphus Clause.India, despite all its flaws, still chases Jefferson’s promise of happiness—through growth, dissent, and democracy.Pakistan? It has stopped expecting anything. And in that quiet surrender, it has turned its citizens into jesters, philosophers, and unwilling realists.They don’t protest anymore. They don’t revolt. They meme. Because in Pakistan, even tragedy comes with load-shedding. And the only thing that ever arrives on time… is the joke.","After the Pahalgam massacre, Pakistanis turned inward and began roasting the very state that enabled this tragedy.

Any such visas issued earlier have been cancelled, and Pakistani nationals under SVES have 48 hours to leave.Additionally, the overall strength of both countries’ diplomatic missions will be capped at 30 personnel by May 1, down from 55. The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy outfit of the banned Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba , has claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack , in which most of the victims were civilians. Asif said Thursday’s National Security Committee meeting reflects the gravity of the moment, noting that such sessions are held “when issues related to national security are to be discussed.”India had last downgraded diplomatic ties in 2020 by reducing the mission strength to half of what it was earlier.In what is being described as the deadliest assault since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, at least 28 tourists were killed and many others injured on Tuesday.The attack occurred in Baisaran meadow, a scenic area approximately 7 km from the resort town of Pahalgam, popular among tourists for its natural beauty and serene environment.According to survivors, six foreign terrorists dressed in Army's fatigue uniform targeted their victims based on religion. The assailants reportedly asked individuals to identify themselves by name and recite Islamic verses before opening fire at point-blank range.The attack occurred around 1:30 pm as tourists relaxed in the picturesque meadow, surrounded by snow-capped mountains and pine forests. Despite a strong security presence in the region, including multiple checkpoints and armed patrols, the attackers managed to breach defenses and unleash chaos in what should have been a peaceful tourist haven.","India has suspended the 1960 Indus Water Treaty, shut the Integrated Check Post at Attari, and halted Pakistani access to travel under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES) Any such visas issued earlier have been cancelled, and Pakistani nationals under SVES have 48 hours to leave.

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.Hundreds, including Christian, Buddhist, Hindu and Islamic religious figures, attended a vigil Monday in memory of the victims at the church of St. Anthony, targeted in the attacks.Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, told the attendees Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, prefect of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints in the Vatican, has included the names of 167 catholics who died in the bombings in the churches of St. Anthony in Colombo and St. Sebastian in Negombo ""in the catalogue of the witnesses of the faith in its order book, considering the context of their heroism.""He said they were chosen ""due to violent opposition to their faith motivated by 'odium fidei,' the hate of the faith."" Ranjith also said seven victims of other faiths were ""respectfully remembered.""Witnesses of faith are those who sacrificed their lives for their belief. Pope Francis formalized in 2023 a new category of recognition by the church of people who lost their lives while professing the catholic faith and created a special Vatican commission to catalogue their cases. The commission, based in the Vatican's saint-making office, has gathered hundreds of cases, with a view to highlighting them alongside officially recognized martyrs of the church, who are on the path to possible beatification or sainthood.More than 260 people, including 42 foreigners, were killed in the near-simultaneous bombings during Easter Sunday at three tourist hotels and three churches, two Catholic and one Protestant, on April 21, 2019.The catholic church in Sri Lanka has demanded further probing in the attacks, particularly after British television Channel 4 interviewed a man who said that he arranged a meeting between a local IS-inspired group, National Thowheed Jamath, and a top state intelligence official to hatch a plot to create insecurity in Sri Lanka and enable former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to win the presidential election later that year.","Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.

A gunman opened fire at a church in Sri Lanka’s Manampitiya village on Friday evening, raising safety concerns just days ahead of the country’s Easter Monday commemorations for the victims of the 2019 Easter bombings.While no injuries were reported, the shooting damaged a church window, triggering a swift police investigation.The incident occurred around 7 pm (local time) at the Living Christ Church located at Ayurveda Place, Manampitiya, approximately 160 kilometres northeast of the capital, Colombo.As per a police statement cited by news agency AFP, “Initial investigations suggest that the suspect had targeted the church due to a personal enmity with the pastor.”The suspect, identified as a 38-year-old resident of Main Road, Manampitiya, was arrested after police received a tip-off and launched a search operation, reported Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.A locally-made firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was recovered from his possession.According to eyewitness accounts gathered during the preliminary investigation, the man approached the church gate, appearing to assess the area, then returned to the road and fired a single shot before fleeing.Police are continuing their probe into the incident.The attack comes as Sri Lanka remains on high alert during the Easter season. Armed police and military personnel have been deployed to nearly all churches across the island, especially with this year marking six years since the Easter Sunday bombings of 2019 that killed 279 people, including 45 foreigners.Over 500 others were wounded in the coordinated suicide attacks on three churches and three hotels.This year, the Catholic Church is set to formally honour the bombing victims as ""Heroes of the Faith"" in a special memorial on Monday.However, many within the Church continue to express frustration over what they say is a lack of accountability and transparency. As per AFP, the Church has repeatedly accused successive Sri Lankan governments of shielding those with links to the bombers. High-level investigations in the past have suggested ties between military intelligence units and those responsible for the attacks.","A gunman opened fire at a church in Sri Lanka’s Manampitiya village on Friday evening.

Overlooked letter shows Shakespeare was not a neglectful husband,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/overlooked-letter-shows-shakespeare-was-not-a-neglectful-husband/articleshow/120632792.cms,"NYT photo

Any clue about William Shakespeare's life usually excites scholars, but one piece of evidence had been neglected for decades. Now, a new analysis of that overlooked document seems to shatter a long-standing narrative about the Bard's bad marriage.Shakespeare was 18 in 1582 when he married Anne Hathaway, daughter of a family friend in Stratford-upon-Avon, in her mid-20s and pregnant. For centuries, it was thought he left his wife and children behind for a literary life in London, seeking to avoid ""the humiliation of domestic feuds"", as one 19th-century essayist put it. This view of Shakespeare's wife as a ""distant encumbrance"" suited scholars who thought ""Shakespeare was far too interesting to be a married guy,"" said Matthew Steggle, a professor at University of Bristol, England. The perception was bolstered by the fact that Shakespeare had left her his ""second best bed"" in his will. But Steggle's research, expected to be published this week in the journal Shakespeare, suggests the writer was not detached from his marriage after all.The hint lies in a fragment of a 17th-century letter addressing a ""Mrs Shakspaire,"" found in the binding of a book published in 1608. The letter was noted in 1978 by an amateur historian, but got minimal attention, even after the book was unbound in 2016, revealing what appeared to be part of a reply from Shakespeare's wife, Steggle said.If it really was addressed to Mrs Shakespeare, ""it is self-evidently remarkable,"" Steggle said - it offers new clues about their relationship, and suggests Mrs Shakespeare lived for a time in London with her husband. If she did live in London, she was possibly back in Stratford by the time she received the letter, around 1607 - though not necessarily because her husband wanted independence. Steggle says ""there is an obvious reason to avoid London in 1603-4, namely the very bad wave of plague"". Also, the upcoming arrival of their first grandchild after daughter Susanna's 1607 marriage ""would surely be a good time"" for Hathaway to be back in Stratford.Steggle says her movements should be reconsidered with an eye to her ""possible absences from London rather than her perpetual absence"". The letter concerned money for a fatherless child named John. It called upon her to pay money, most likely held in trust for him, a pledge her husband may have undertaken, and referred to a time when she ""dwelt in trinitie lane,"" which Steggle believes refers to a location in London.","William Shakespeare was 18 in 1582 when he married Anne Hathaway, daughter of a family friend.

Annabel Elliot , younger sister to the British Queen Camilla and official “companion” to her, has said she still cannot bring herself to curtsy to her elder sibling—even two decades after Camilla entered the royal family.The revelation came in a new Tatler profile written by royal biographer Robert Hardman to mark the 20th wedding anniversary of King Charles and Queen Camilla.Although royal customs have relaxed over time—and the official royal website says there are no compulsory gestures—curtsying remains common within the royal household. For most, especially insiders like Elliot who hold formal roles, such traditions are still followed.Elliot, an interior designer by profession, said the formality feels unnatural despite her sister’s royal status. “I think she’s transitioned beautifully, actually. I mean, I sometimes look at her, and I can’t really believe it,” she said, reflecting on Camilla’s journey from private citizen to Queen.While Elliot may skip the curtsy, her love and support for Camilla are unwavering. She has been described as the Queen’s emotional anchor, especially during a difficult year in 2024, which saw family health challenges and personal loss.In the BBC documentary Charles III: The Coronation Year, Elliot appeared visibly moved as she recalled watching her sister depart for Westminster Abbey in the golden coach. “It was quite a moment,” she said, recalling how surreal it felt to see someone she grew up with take the throne beside King Charles.",Annabel Elliot is the younger sister to the British Queen Camilla.

LONDON: Over 30 years after Britain's elite Magic Circle expelled a woman for posing as a man to gain admittance, the formerly male-only society is to welcome her back as a full member.The London-based international magic organisation ejected Sophie Lloyd after she masqueraded as a male in 1991 to win membership.But after her story came to light last year, the society's first female chair Laura London launched a search to track down Lloyd and apologise.She was eventually located living abroad and will later on Thursday be presented with a membership certificate at a special ceremony at the organisation's London headquarters.""It is so exciting after all these months tracking Sophie... I can't tell you how happy we are as a society to welcome her back into the fold,"" London told BBC radio.Lloyd posed as Raymond Lloyd for 18 months before unmasking herself as a woman.But members, who voted to admit women in September 1991, were so angered by her ""deliberate deception"" that they went ahead with her expulsion.The deception was in fact a two-person act involving the late magician Jenny Winstanley, who recruited Lloyd to help her prove that women magicians were just as good as men.""I did a 20-minute show in front of 200 people, three examiners, and spoke to the examiner for an hour-and-three-quarters afterwards,"" Lloyd said, recalling how she managed to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.After the Magic Circle changed its stance on allowing women in, Winstanley, who died in 2004, phoned the society to explain.""Two days later we got a letter to say Raymond's been expelled,"" said Lloyd.""We couldn't get our heads round it. We just thought, 'come on it's funny, it's amusing' but they didn't think so and Jenny was completely snubbed, unfortunately.""After the expulsion, Lloyd continued to perform magic for 11 years in an anti-bullying variety show before eventually moving overseas.She said the Magic Circle had changed out of all recognition in the 30 years since she was thrown out, adding: ""This is for Jenny really, Jenny would have loved it.""London said Thursday's ceremony would also be a chance to recognise Winstanley both for her contribution to magic and her audacious trick at the Magic Circle's expense.""I just think she's a wonderful woman and I know she'd have loved to be here and I just wish more than anything I could have met her myself,"" she said.The Magic Circle was founded in 1905 by around 20 magicians at a restaurant in London's Chinatown district.Members must vow never to give away the secrets of magic.Although women have now been admitted to the Magic Circle for over 30 years, they still make up only around five percent of the society's 1,700 membership.The body says, however, that increasing numbers are now coming through in the 10-18-year-old age group.","Sophie Lloyd was expelled from the Magic Circle after posing as a man to gain admittance.

No, they acted appropriately. Yes, they should have.

A British national was killed by a mob in Ecuador after being dragged from a police station in a remote Amazonian village, according to local media and authorities.The man, named locally as Michael Hann, 34, was taken into custody on 20 April in the riverside village of Playas del Cuyabeno, near the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve. He was suspected of fatally shooting his long-time friend and business partner, Rodrigo Chavez, in an alleged dispute linked to their struggling tourism business.Police confirmed that Hann was arrested early that morning and brought to the station for his own safety after he was “intercepted and beaten by local residents” following the shooting. Authorities said they were preparing to transfer him to Lago Agrio, about 75 miles away, but were delayed due to “geographical conditions.”At around 12:30 pm, a group of angry villagers stormed the station, forcibly removed Hann, and lynched him in the street before setting his body on fire, according to the local outlet Extra, which described the incident as “a shocking act of apparent community justice.”A police report identified the victim only as an “English national,” and a senior police official told the Daily Mail: “We are still trying to establish the specific identity of the citizen we believe is a British national. We know that he was working and teaching English and was making reservations for tourists visiting the area but we don’t have any more information right now.”Authorities said the situation escalated quickly, with seven officers present at the station during the mob attack. The officers reportedly feared for their lives and potential damage to state property. “They were carrying guns and other weapons including stones, sticks, spears and even cans of petrol they were threatening to burn the police station down with and harm officers,” the police chief said.Extra reported that the officers had received advance warnings about threats to the detainee’s safety but were unable to act due to the delayed arrival of backup. Ecuadorian broadcaster Ecuavisa stated that Hann died hours later from burns sustained during the lynching.According to sources close to the investigation, the motive behind the shooting was rooted in a bitter business dispute. Chavez had accused Hann of misappropriating funds from their tourism venture, cutting him out of the business amid financial struggles.The UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said it is urgently working with Ecuadorian authorities and forensic teams to verify the victim’s identity and gather more information. The FCDO has not yet issued an official statement.","A British national was killed by a mob in Ecuador after being dragged from a police station in a remote Amazonian village.

To those mourning – know that the UK stands with you in sorrow and solidarity. Terror will never win. We grieve with India.”The Resistance Front (TRF), a group linked to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack. Gunmen opened fire near a popular tourist meadow close to Pahalgam town, in what has become the worst attack in the region since the 2019 Pulwama bombing.Global leaders including US president Donald Trump have voiced their condemnation and support for India. Trump called the attack “deeply disturbing” and said the United States stood firmly with India in its fight against terrorism.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who returned early from a visit to Saudi Arabia, chaired a high-level security meeting in Delhi. India has since suspended the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan as part of its response.Earlier, Defence minister Rajnath Singh assured the nation of a ""loud and clear"" response to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 28 people, mostly tourists.Rajanth Singh said that the government would hunt down not only the perpetrators who carried out the ghastly attack, but also those behind the scenes.","Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has expressed deep sorrow and outrage over the deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, that killed at least 26 people.

The Resistance Front (TRF), a group linked to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120567029,imgsize-16660,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-2025-04-24T063755-992.jpg"

LONDON: More than 110 wildfires have raged in the UK since the start of the year, according to satellite data released Monday, making it one of the worst years on record.At least 111 fires have torched an area of nearly 24,500 hectares (94 square miles) across the country since January 1, according to data Monday from the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS).The number of wildfires and area affected by them is higher than average for this time of the year, and higher than the same period in 2024.Only 2019 was worse in terms of the area burned (28,700 hectares) and 2022 for the number of fires (151) for the same period, according to the Press Association news agency.Last week, the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) said fire and rescue services had already responded to 380 wildfires so far this year in England and Wales -- more than double the same period in 2022.The EFFIS data is based on satellite readings and only maps fires that are 30 hectares or larger -- accounting for the difference with records from the local authority.In comparison, the NFCC measures wildfires with an area of at least one hectare.""A particularly dry March, followed by warmer-than-average temperatures in April, has seen a number of significant wildfires across the UK over the last fortnight,"" the NFCC said in a statement.The UK and Ireland had a ""drier than average"" March, according to Europe's Copernicus climate monitor. Last month was also the hottest March ever recorded in Europe by a significant margin.""With the increase in extreme weather events, we know that fire and rescue services are stretched as they seek to keep their communities safe,"" said NFCC chair Phil Garrigan.The Met Office said the fires are due to dry and breezy conditions in spring which came after a damp winter, meaning there was ""fuel"" for the blazes because of plant growth.Firefighters in Northern Ireland have been battling dozens of blazes in the last week, with many residents having to evacuate homes and a weather warning for wildfires.The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) said it attended 296 wildfires between April 3-10, many of which were thought to be started deliberately.An ""extreme"" wildfire warning was issued for Scotland on Friday and Saturday, after multiple blazes broke out the previous week.According to Michael Humphreys from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS), wetter weather last year meant fewer blazes in 2024.","More than 110 wildfires have raged in the UK since the start of the year.

'Misplaced and without jurisdiction': Arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari rejects ED's plea to declare him a 'fugitive',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/misplaced-and-without-jurisdiction-arms-dealer-sanjay-bhandari-rejects-eds-plea-to-declare-him-a-fugitive/articleshow/120454377.cms,"Sanjay Bhandari

Arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari has strongly opposed the Enforcement Directorate 's (ED) plea to declare him a ""fugitive"" in connection with a black money case , telling a Delhi court on April 19 that his stay in the United Kingdom was legal. This follows a ruling from the London high court that denied his extradition to India. Bhandari, who has been living in the UK since fleeing India in 2016, claimed that the ED’s application was ""vague, misplaced and without jurisdiction"" and did not meet the requirements under the Fugitive Offenders Act.In February, the high court of justice in London allowed Bhandari to appeal his extradition, citing concerns about his safety in Tihar jail. The court found that he would be at ""real risk"" of extortion, threats, and ""actual violence"" from other prisoners and officials in the Indian prison system. Furthermore, the court ruled that Bhandari’s extradition would violate his human rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, specifically Article 3, which relates to protection from inhuman or degrading treatment. Earlier this month, the UK High Court also dismissed the Indian government’s appeal to challenge the decision in Britain’s Supreme Court.Bhandari’s lawyer, senior advocate Maninder Singh, argued that his client’s presence in the UK could not be deemed illegal, as he had a legal right to reside there. Singh emphasised that the Indian government was bound by the UK court’s decision, and declaring Bhandari a ""fugitive"" in this context would be legally incorrect.Singh further pointed out that the ED’s application failed to provide an assessment by the income tax department regarding the value of the black money case. As per the Fugitive Offenders Act, a person can only be declared a fugitive if the value involved exceeds Rs 100 crore. Singh argued that the ED had misled the court by suggesting that the case exceeded this threshold, as the income tax department had previously submitted that the amount was below Rs 100 crore. Additionally, Bhandari was discharged from non-bailable warrants after the UK High Court’s ruling, and no fresh warrants were pending against him, Singh stated.This legal battle comes amid Bhandari’s involvement in other high-profile cases, including an ongoing money laundering probe linked to Robert Vadra, the brother-in-law of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. Bhandari has also been mentioned in relation to the ongoing investigations into fugitive Mehul Choksi, who recently cited the same UK court ruling in his own extradition case.","Sanjay Bhandari has strongly opposed the Enforcement Directorate's plea to declare him a ""fugitive"" in connection with a black money case.

'Bulldozer procession' targets homes of Awami leaders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bulldozer-procession-targets-homes-of-awami-leaders/articleshow/117998278.cms,"DHAKA: Thousands of protesters set fire to the home of Bangladesh's founding leader as his daughter, ousted former PM Sheikh Hasina , called on her supporters to stand against the interim govt. The South Asian nation of 170 million people has struggled with political strife since Hasina was forced to flee to India in Aug following weeks of protests against her rule in which more than 1,000 people were killed.Witnesses said several thousand protesters, some armed with sticks, hammers and other tools, gathered around the historic house and independence monument while others brought a crane and excavator to demolish the building late on Wednesday.The demolition continued into Thursday, with much of the front of the house destroyed. Many people were seen breaking into it and taking steel and wooden items and books from inside. Similar cases of vandalism also took place at several other places, targeting Awami League leaders. At least two people, accused of being members of Awami League, were beaten by the crowd, witnesses said, reported AFP.The protest rally was organised alongside a broader call, dubbed ""Bulldozer Procession"", to disrupt Hasina's scheduled online address on Wednesday. Protesters, many aligned with the ""Students Against Discrimination"" group, voiced fury over her speech they saw as a challenge to the newly formed interim govt.A symbol of the country's establishment, the house is where Mujibur Rahman declared Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan in 1971. He and most of his family were assassinated at the house in 1975. Hasina, who survived the attack, transformed the building into a museum dedicated to her father's legacy.Hasina, in a slightly emotion-choked voice, said Pakistani troops too looted the house during the 1971 Liberation War but did not demolish or set it on fire. The residence of Hasina's late husband Wajed Mian known as 'Sudha Sadan' on Road 5 in Dhanmondi was also set on fire by protesters.The actions in Dhaka fuelled similar destructions in other parts of Bangladesh. Protesters demolished the home of her cousins - Sheikh Helal Uddin and Sheikh Salauddin Jewel - in Khulna City. Thousands of people gathered around the house, chanting ""Delhi or Dhaka - Dhaka, Dhaka"" and ""Down with Mujibism"". Prothom Alo, the largest Bengali daily, reported crowds used govt-owned excavators to smash down the building. Protesters removed the name of Mujibur Rahman from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall of Dhaka University. They also vandalised several murals of Mujibur.","Mujibur Rahman declared Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan in 1971. He and most of his family were assassinated at the house in 1975.

US: Alabama carries out fourth nitrogen gas execution for 1991 killing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-alabama-carries-out-fourth-nitrogen-gas-execution-for-1991-killing/articleshow/117997606.cms,"(AP photo)

Mother of Alabama death row inmate still hoping for miracle just hours before execution window opens

An inmate in Alabama found guilty of killing a woman in her home whilst she slept was executed on Thursday evening, marking the fourth time nitrogen gas was used for capital punishment in the United States.Demetrius Frazier, aged 52, was declared dead at 6:36pm CST in a south Alabama correctional facility for the 1991 murder and rape of Pauline Brown, 41.This was Alabama's first execution this year and the third in the US in 2025, following executions in Texas and South Carolina.""First of all I want to apologise to the family and friends of Pauline Brown. What happened to Pauline Brown should have never happened,"" Frazier had said earlier. He also expressed criticism towards Michigan governor Gretchen Witmer regarding her inaction on appeals for his return to serve his previous life sentence in Michigan.""I love everybody on death row. Detroit Strong,"" he said.His mother and anti-death penalty activists had requested governor Whitmer to allow Frazier to return to Michigan to complete his life sentence for a teenage girl's murder before his transfer to Alabama. Michigan does not implement capital punishment.The Michigan attorney general's office stated in January that the state did not want Frazier back. While in Michigan custody in 1992, Frazier admitted to Brown's murder, according to police reports.Prior to the execution, governor Whitmer told The Detroit News that her predecessor, Rick Snyder, ""unfortunately"" agreed to transfer Frazier to Alabama, where local authorities took control.""It's a really tough situation,"" she told the media outlet before the execution. ""I understand the pleas and concerns. Michigan is not a death penalty state.""On November 27, 1991, prosecutors stated that Frazier, then 19, broke into Brown's Birmingham flat while she slept. They said he demanded money and sexually assaulted Brown at gunpoint after receiving $80. He then fatally shot her and later returned to eat and search for more money.Frazier received a life sentence in Michigan for killing Crystal Kendrick, 14, in 1992.In 1996, an Alabama jury found him guilty of Brown's murder with a 10-2 vote for the death penalty. He remained in Michigan until 2011, when both states' governors agreed to his transfer to Alabama's death row.Alabama became the first state to carry out nitrogen gas executions, implementing three in the previous year. The procedure involves administering pure nitrogen through a respiratory mask, causing death by oxygen deprivation.The execution commenced at 6:10pm after a final mask check. Frazier moved his hands circularly initially, then showed signs of distress. At 6:13pm, he lifted his legs off the gurney.He appeared to gasp before his breathing slowed to intermittent breaths. Movement ceased by 6:21pm The chamber curtains closed at 6:29pm.Commissioner John Hamm reported nitrogen flow lasted approximately 18 minutes, with monitors indicating no heartbeat 13 minutes after administration began.A federal judge recently declined to stop Frazier's execution despite his lawyers arguing about the method's speed. Media witnesses, including The Associated Press, documented convulsions in previous nitrogen executions.The judge concluded that execution accounts did not indicate ""severe psychological pain or distress"" beyond what is inherent in executions.","Demetrius Frazier, aged 52, was declared dead at 6:36pm CST in a south Alabama correctional facility for the 1991 murder and rape of Pauline Brown, 41.

"US athletic association implements Donald Trump’s order, bans transgender athletes from women’s sports",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-athletic-association-implements-donald-trumps-order-bans-transgender-athletes-from-womens-sports/articleshow/117997447.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

The US National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), has officially updated its gender eligibility policy on Thursday, banning transgender women from competing in women’s sports.The decision, which takes effect immediately, comes just a day after US President Donald Trump signed the “No men in women’s sports” executive order. The new rule states that “a student-athlete assigned male at birth may not compete on a women’s team,” though biological females are still allowed to participate in men’s sports.Taking the matter to the social media platform X, Trump wrote, “Exciting news! Due to my Executive Order, which I proudly signed yesterday, the NCAA has officially changed their policy of allowing men in Women’s Sports – It is now banned! This is a great day for women and girls across our Country. Men should have never been allowed to compete against women in the first place, but I am proud to be the President to save Women’s Sports. We expect the Olympic Committee to also use Common Sense, and implement this policy, which is very popular among the American People, and the entire World!”According to Fox News, this move marks a significant shift from the NCAA’s previous policy, which had been in place since 2010. The old rules allowed transgender women to compete in women’s sports after completing at least one year of testosterone suppression. The new policy aligns with Trump’s executive order, which seeks to establish a uniform standard nationwide rather than leaving the issue to individual states or governing bodies.NCAA President Charlie Baker responded to the executive order, saying it provides much-needed clarity amid a “patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions.” The New York Times quoted Baker as saying, “We strongly believe that clear, consistent, and uniform eligibility standards would best serve today’s student-athletes.”The issue of transgender participation in women’s sports has sparked significant controversy and legal battles. As per Fox News, former NCAA swimmer and conservative activist Riley Gaines is leading a lawsuit against the organisation over her experience competing against transgender swimmer Lia Thomas at the 2022 national championships.Several other female athletes have also filed lawsuits, alleging unfair competition and discomfort in shared locker rooms.Additionally, the department of education (DOE) has launched investigations into potential Title IX violations at institutions such as the University of Pennsylvania and San Jose State University, as reported by Fox News.At San Jose State, transgender volleyball player Blaire Fleming played three seasons on the women’s team, allegedly without other players being informed about Fleming’s birth sex. Eleven Mountain West volleyball players and a former assistant coach have since sued the university.Recently, a New York Times/Ipsos poll found that 79% of Americans, including 67% of Democrats, opposed allowing transgender women to compete in women’s sports.","The US National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), has officially updated its gender eligibility policy on Thursday.

US holding migrants in Guantanamo Bay cells that once housed al-Qaida suspects: Officials,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-holding-migrants-in-guantanamo-bay-cells-that-once-housed-qaida-suspects-officials/articleshow/117998014.cms,"The Trump administration is holding 10 migrants with suspected gang affiliations in the same prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, that has housed men accused of being members of al-Qaida, United States defense officials said on Wednesday.Pentagon made the disclosure as US forces are preparing a tent city for migrants, in compliance with an order from President Trump, on a separate portion of the base. But the defense department said the first group of 10 deportees, who were brought to the base Tuesday, were too dangerous for the migrant site.Instead they were put in a vacant section of the military prison that houses terrorism suspects and convicts, far from the area where other deportees will be held by department of Homeland Security.On Wednesday, Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary, said the men were members of a Venezuelan gang called Tren de Aragua, which the US govt last year labeled a ""transnational criminal organisation"" for human trafficking and other criminal acts. The gang traces its beginnings to a prison in Venezuela.The US govt has long held migrants at Guantanamo Bay, primarily Cubans and Haitians who have been picked up at sea. But the wartime prisoners have always been kept away from the migrants. Migrants are in the custody of the DHS. Suspected al-Qaida members are in the custody of defense dept.The decision to fly migrants from within the US to the base comes as Trump ramps up deportations and immigration enforcement across the country. Last week, he ordered his administration to expand a small, 120-bed center on the base to hold up to 30,000 deportees.On Tuesday evening, US Customs and Border Protection posted a video on social media showing the men being loaded onto the Air Force C-17 plane in El Paso, Texas.""Flights to Guantanamo Bay have begun,"" the post said. ""The worst of the worst have no place in our homeland.""Immigration officials hold around 40,000 detainees in private prisons and local county lockups across US. But Trump suggested last week that the use of Guantanamo could double detention capacity.It is unclear how long migrants will be held at the facility and where they will be taken next, but officials said Wednesday they would be sent to their home country or to another ""appropriate destination.""

Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer called him ""one of the most fringe and hard-right individuals the Senate has seen in a very long time.""The Thursday night vote followed a marathon effort by Democrats to block the nomination, during which they held the Senate floor with speeches for an entire day and night. They warned that Vought was Trump’s ""most dangerous nominee.""""Confirming the most radical nominee with the most extreme agenda to the most important agency in Washington,"" said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer in his floor speech.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday reiterated his proposal for the United States to take control of the Gaza Strip, as Israel’s army has been ordered to prepare plans to allow large numbers of Palestinians to leave the territory.In a post on Truth Social post on Thursday, Trump wrote, “The Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting. The Palestinians, people like Chuck Schumer, would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region. They would actually have a chance to be happy, safe, and free. The US, working with great development teams from all over the World, would slowly and carefully begin the construction of what would become one of the greatest and most spectacular developments of its kind on Earth. No soldiers by the US would be needed! Stability for the region would reign!!!”Trump’s remarks follow his initial proposal earlier in the week. His plan suggests that Gaza, with US-led international development, could be transformed into one of the “greatest and most spectacular developments” on Earth.Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has backed Trump’s proposal, telling Fox News that the idea of allowing Palestinians to leave Gaza is a “remarkable idea” that should be “pursued and done.” Israel’s military has also been instructed to prepare plans for large-scale departures of Palestinians from the territory.""I have instructed the IDF (military) to prepare a plan to enable voluntary departure for Gaza residents,"" Israeli defence minister Katz said, adding that they could go ""to any country willing to accept them"". ""The plan will include exit options through land crossings, as well as special arrangements for departure by sea and air,"" he added, branding Trump's plan as ""bold"".“This is the first good idea that I’ve heard,” Netanyahu said. “It will create a different future for everyone.”Trump’s announcement at a joint White House press conference with Netanyahu on Tuesday has drawn sharp criticism from rights groups, which argue that the plan violates international law and amounts to ethnic cleansing.Despite the backlash, Trump has remained firm, describing Gaza’s potential transformation as the “Riviera of the Middle East.”","US President Donald Trump reiterates his proposal for the United States to take control of the Gaza Strip.

The name of Rebecca Lobach , the third pilot of the military Blackhawk that crashed with an American Airlines plane, was not released until yesterday while identities of the other two pilots were revealed earlier. There was no survivor in the deadly crash as the remnants of both aircraft fell onto the frozen Potomac River. The reason of the unusual mid-air crash is still unknown while minutes before the crash the military helicopter was warned about the passenger plane.After President Donald Trump blamed the DEI (diversity, equity, inclusivity) hiring policy (of the military) behind the mishap, the Blackhawk pilots came on the radar.Social media users claimed that Rebecca Lobach's identity was withheld because her social media accounts were being deleted.

Through the protest note, handed over to the Acting High Commissioner of India in Dhaka, the Ministry conveyed the deep concern, disappointment and serious reservation of the Government of Bangladesh, as such statements are hurting the sentiments of the people in Bangladesh....The Ministry also emphasized that such activities by her, are considered as a hostile act towards Bangladesh and are not conducive to the efforts at establishing a healthy relationship between the two countries,"" the bangladesh foreign ministry said in a post on Facebook.On Thursday, the Bangladesh's foreign ministry summoned the acting high commissioner of India to Dhaka. Bangladesh foreign adviser Md Touhid Hossain said Bangladesh had formally requested India in writing to prevent Sheikh Hasina from making such statements and remarks, as those are against the interests of Bangladesh.He also said, ""We have not got any response in this regard. Due to recent developments, Bangladesh has once again sent a protest note to India. Indian acting high commissioner was summoned and handed over the protest letter so that she (Sheikh Hasina) is prevented.""Hasina delivered the speech on Wednesday night after protesters vandalised and set on fire her father and Bangladesh founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's residence in Dhaka. Similar cases of vandalism also took place at several other places, targeting Awami League leaders.During her address, Hasina urged citizens to mount opposition against the present administration.Speaking with evident emotion, Hasina noted that whilst Pakistani forces had plundered the house during the 1971 Liberation War, they neither demolished nor burnt it.""Today, this house is being demolished. What crime had it committed? Why were they so afraid of the house... I seek justice from the people of the country. Didn't I do anything for you?"" she said.""They can demolish a building, but not the history... but they must also remember that history takes its revenge,"" Hasina said.""They are yet to have the strength to destroy the national flag, the constitution and the independence that we earned at the cost of lives of millions of martyrs with a bulldozer,"" she said, seemingly referring to the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government.Demonstrators gathered near Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's 32 Dhanmondi residence in Dhaka, responding to social media calls for a ""bulldozer procession"". The crowd subsequently ignited the building.The neighbouring structure, which served as offices for various Awami League organisations, was also destroyed. Protesters damaged murals featuring Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.Demonstrators also set ablaze 'Sudha Sadan' on Road 5 in Dhanmondi, the residence of Hasina's deceased husband Wajed Mian.The homes of her cousins - Sheikh Helal Uddin and Sheikh Salauddin Jewel - in Khulna City were also destroyed by protesters.Students removed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's name from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall of Dhaka University in protest.At 77, Hasina has been residing in India since August 5 of the previous year, having escaped Bangladesh amidst a significant student-led uprising that ended her Awami League's 16-year governance.","Bangladesh has formally lodged a ""strong protest"" with India regarding statements made by deposed PM Sheikh Hasina.

How Elon Musk became new boogeyman in Washington,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-doge-usaid-donald-trump-democrats/articleshow/117975765.cms,"Elon Musk as Tony Soprano (AI image for representation)

Why it matters

Musk’s expanding influence represents a radical shift in how the federal government operates. His ability to override agencies, halt government programs, and access vast amounts of federal data without being elected or confirmed by Congress has raised alarms among Democrats and watchdog groups.

The latest flashpoint came after DOGE secured direct access to a Treasury system that processes trillions in government payments annually, sparking fears that Musk's team could manipulate or delay federal payouts.

Musk’s aides have also effectively shut down USAID, a major provider of international humanitarian assistance, prompting accusations that he is dismantling the US’s global influence in favor of an “America First” agenda.

Discussions are already underway within DOGE about issuing an executive order to gut the education department, a move that could significantly reduce federal oversight of public education.

What they are saying

Democrats are scrambling to counter Musk’s rising influence, arguing that the real power in Washington is now in the hands of a single unelected billionaire—rather than Trump or the voters who put him in office.

or the voters who put him in office. As per a Politico report, Rep Don Beyer (D-Va) framed Musk as the perfect political foil, saying, “He’s a good villain. He makes it so easy because he’s so disregarding of how people feel. You know there’s no empathy, there’s no sense of trying to help people.”

""Musk has unprecedented and centralized control of the basic plumbing of government,"" he added.

Elon can't do and won't do anything without our approval, and we'll give him the approval, where appropriate; where not appropriate, we won't. But he reports in. Donald Trump

Between the lines

Musk’s takeover of critical government operations aligns with Trump's long-standing goal of gutting the federal bureaucracy—a campaign promise the president has often framed as dismantling the so-called “deep state.”

Musk has taken on a quasi-official role in the administration, serving as a “special government employee”, which allows him to work at the White House for 130 days without filing the same financial disclosures as full-time officials.

His direct access to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has led to mass emails urging federal workers to accept “deferred resignation” offers, a move eerily similar to his mass layoffs at Twitter in 2022.

Reports indicate that some federal employees have already been locked out of their agency email accounts, adding to the chaos within the bureaucracy.

Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers have largely rallied behind Musk and DOGE, dismissing Democratic concerns as hysterical overreactions.

Rep Darrell Issa (R-Calif) mocked the outrage, asking on X: “Is it just me, or are Democrats not ready for our side winning so much?”

Sen Tom Cotton (R-Ark), a leading defense hawk, suggested that Musk’s takeover was long overdue, saying: “If Democrats had spent more time cutting waste and less time complaining about billionaires, we wouldn’t be in this position.”

Those of us who have worked at Elon's companies can see his fingerprints all over what's happening inside the federal government right now. It's a very seat-of-the-pants affair with Elon's loyalists scrambling to execute his every whim and desire as fast as possible Thomas Moline, a former SpaceX senior avionics engineer, told Reuters

What’s next

Democrats are scrambling for ways to curtail Musk’s power, but their options are limited.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries are weighing whether to use routine government funding bills as leverage to force changes at DOGE.

Some Democrats are even discussing lawsuits to challenge Musk’s takeover of USAID and other agencies, though legal experts say such challenges could take months or even years to play out.

State-level Democratic leaders have also begun sounding the alarm, with California Governor Gavin Newsom warning that Musk’s unchecked power over federal operations could soon spill into state-run programs, particularly in areas like transportation and energy policy.

Meanwhile, Musk himself remains openly defiant in the face of mounting opposition.

On X (formerly Twitter), he dismissed Democratic criticisms as an attempt to “protect the radical-left shadow government that has been looting taxpayers for decades.”

DOGE officials continue to operate at breakneck speed, reportedly working on AI-driven tools to identify and eliminate so-called “wasteful spending” across the federal government.

Some reports suggest that Musk has even floated the idea of privatizing certain government functions, though it’s unclear whether such proposals would have legal backing.

The bottom line

Elon Musk has emerged as the most powerful unelected figure in Washington, redrawing the battle lines in American politics.

For Democrats, he is the new face of unchecked corporate power, wielding more influence than many Cabinet secretaries.

For Trump and his allies, he is a disruptor, a billionaire warrior battling an entrenched bureaucracy that they argue has resisted Trump’s agenda for years.

For federal workers, Musk represents an existential threat, as his cost-cutting vision of government could mean thousands of layoffs, abrupt policy shifts, and a radical transformation of how Washington functions.

As the fight over Musk’s role escalates, one thing is clear: Trump may be the president, but it’s Musk who appears to be pulling the strings in Washington.

Democrats are focusing their political attacks on billionaire Elon Musk—not President Trump—amid an unprecedented restructuring of US federal agencies that has given the Tesla CEO extraordinary control over government operations.The backlash follows Musk’s rapid moves as head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), which has been aggressively taking over federal functions, including the treasury department's payment systems, the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ), and potentially the education department.At a fiery rally outside the treasury department headquarters, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) declared, ""In the building behind me, Elon Musk is seizing power from the American people. We are here to fight back.""Warren accused Musk of ""deciding whether every road repair in America moves forward, whether every Head Start center opens, and whether every military base operates according to his whims.""Activists held signs reading “Nobody Elected Elon,” underscoring the unease about Musk’s unchecked authority in Washington.(With inputs from agencies)","Elon Musk has taken on a quasi-official role in the Trump administration.

Musk’s 25-year-old DOGE staffer resigns after racist posts emerge: report

'Normalize Indian hate'



‘What Musk is doing is illegal’: Bernie Sanders slams DOGE gutting agencies

A staff member of the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), led by Elon Musk , resigned Thursday after the White House was questioned about his connection to a social media account that promoted racism and eugenics , The Wall Street Journal reported.Marko Elez , a 25-year-old programmer, was one of two DOGE staffers with access to the US Treasury’s payment system. The Wall Street Journal reported that Elez had a profile on Musk’s social media platform, X, where he made posts supporting a ""eugenic immigration policy"" and calling for the repeal of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.In a September post, Elez reportedly wrote, “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity.”Another post the same month encouraged users to “normalize Indian hate,” referring to the large number of Indian workers in Silicon Valley’s technology sector.“Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool,” the account posted in July, according to the Journal.Elez studied computer science at Rutgers University. During his sophomore year, he co-founded Unimetrics.io, a company designed to connect high school students with mentors to improve their college applications, as per the WSJ report.He later worked for Musk at SpaceX, contributing to Starlink satellite projects, and at X, where he focused on artificial intelligence, according to archived versions of his personal website.After The Wall Street Journal contacted the White House about Elez’s posts, press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that he had resigned, as per a report in The Independent.The Journal found that archived posts from Elez’s X account (@nullllptr) repeatedly targeted Indian technology workers. In December 2024, he wrote that Indian workers in the US on H1B visas are “going back don’t worry guys.”Another post from Elez expressed hostility toward both sides in the Israel-Gaza war . He wrote, “I would not mind at all if Gaza and Israel were both wiped off the face of the Earth.”DOGE has gained significant power in President Donald Trump’s second term, largely due to the influence of Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars to support Trump’s re-election.In an interview with Bloomberg published Thursday, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said he had personally reviewed the background of one of the two Treasury employees from Musk’s DOGE team.“These are highly trained professionals,” Bessent told Bloomberg. “This is not some roving band running around doing things.”He added, “This is methodical, and it is going to yield big savings.”","Marko Elez, a 25-year-old programmer, was one of two DOGE staffers with access to the US Treasury’s payment system.

"US releases video of shackled Indians, says committed to swift removals",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/farthest-us-deportation-flight-in-military-plane-us-officials/articleshow/117997427.cms,"NEW DELHI: US authorities doubled down on the deportation of 104 Indian nationals with the border patrol chief releasing a video on X that showed Indian nationals, handcuffed and shackled, being hustled into a C17 military aircraft.Asked why a military aircraft was used to deport Indians, a US embassy spokesperson, without going into the details of the flight, said it’s the policy of the US to faithfully execute the immigration laws against all inadmissible and removable aliens. In the first 2 weeks of US President Donald Trump’s return, while dozens of nonmilitary flights were used to deport illegal migrants, only 6 such military flights – to Honduras, Ecuador, Peru and Guatemala - were used for the same purpose.“USBP ( US Border Patrol ) and partners successfully returned illegal aliens to India, marking the farthest deportation flight yet using military transport. This mission underscored our commitment to enforcing immigration laws and ensuring swift removals. If you cross illegally, you will be removed,’’ said USBP chief Michael Banks in a post on X, while putting out a video of men being loaded into a C-17 defence aircraft. The embassy spokesperson here also said enforcing the US immigration laws is critically important to the national security and public safety of the country.While foreign minister S Jaishankar said in response to clarifications sought in Parliament that India was aware about the flight that landed in Amritsar and had provided it the necessary clearances, a few central and South American countries have complained that they were notified about deportation flights only after take-off. Brazil also lodged a protest with the US for the “flagrant” violation of the rights of its citizens.India has accepted illegal immigrants from the US every year since 2009 after verifying their Indian origin. The Modi government accepted more than 6,000 Indian nationals from the US during the first Trump administration . However, the in-your-face spectacle that accompanied what was the first deportation flight to India under Trump 2.0 will be of concern to India, not least because it occurred days before PM Narendra Modi lands in Washington for a bilateral summit with Trump.The last time a major removal flight was conducted to India, in a large frame charter plane, was on October 22 last year. This was made public though only 3 days later – on October 25 – in the form of a press release issued by the Department of Homeland Security. On this occasion, the information about the flight was leaked to the media shortly after the flight carrying Indian nationals took off from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) centre in San Antonio on February 3. The post by Banks, complete with a video, also came in the middle of a raging debate here about whether or not the returnees were handcuffed.Like Colombia, India can send its own aircraft to bring back illegal migrants but the government gave no indication Thursday that it will exercise that option. Even though countries like Mexico remain reluctant to accept military repatriation planes, Trump is likely to use more such flights to not just supplement nonmilitary deportation but also send out a message that his promised crackdown on illegal immigration is not an empty threat.","US authorities doubled down on the deportation of 104 Indian nationals.

‘TIP OF THE ICEBERG’: Trump team unravels government waste at USAID

The Trump administration announced a plan on Thursday to significantly reduce staffing for US aid programs as part of efforts to shut down the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ). The plan would leave fewer than 300 employees out of the thousands currently working for the agency.Senior officials were informed of the plan on Thursday, two current USAID employees and a former senior official, were quoted as saying by the news agency Associated Press.The plan would reduce the number of staff to fewer than 300 from the current 8,000 direct employees and contractors, the AP report said. In addition, an unspecified number of 5,000 local staff members abroad would continue to run a few aid programs that the administration says will continue for now.It is unclear whether this reduction will be temporary or permanent. The Trump administration has said it is reviewing which aid and development programs might resume in the future.US secretary of state Marco Rubio, speaking in the Dominican Republic, said the US would still provide foreign aid .“But it is going to be foreign aid that makes sense and is aligned with our national interest,” he told reporters.The Trump administration, along with Elon Musk , who leads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has focused on cutting USAID as part of broader efforts to reduce government programs.Since President Donald Trump took office on January 20, a funding freeze has stopped most USAID programs worldwide. Nearly all agency employees have been placed on administrative leave or furlough. Trump and Musk have discussed eliminating USAID as an independent agency and shifting its remaining programs under the State Department.Democratic lawmakers and others argue that these actions require congressional approval and cannot be done unilaterally.","The plan would reduce the number of staff to fewer than 300 from the current 8,000 direct employees and contractors.

Many Palestinians, including children, have been killed during Israel’s response.The order says that the ICC is carrying out ""illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel"" and accuses the court of misusing its power by issuing ""baseless arrest warrants"" against Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant.""The ICC has no jurisdiction over the United States or Israel,"" the order says, adding that its actions set a ""dangerous precedent.""Trump signed the order while Netanyahu was in Washington. The two met at the White House on Tuesday, and Netanyahu also met with lawmakers on Thursday.The order further says that the US will impose ""tangible and significant consequences"" on those responsible for the ICC’s actions. Possible measures include blocking assets and banning ICC officials, employees, and their families from entering the USHuman rights groups said these sanctions could discourage the court's work and contradict US efforts in other international cases.""Victims of human rights abuses around the world turn to the International Criminal Court when they have nowhere else to go, and President Trump's executive order will make it harder for them to find justice,"" said Charlie Hogle of the American Civil Liberties Union. ""The order also raises serious First Amendment concerns because it puts people in the United States at risk of harsh penalties for helping the court identify and investigate atrocities committed anywhere, by anyone.""Hogle added that the order ""is an attack on both accountability and free speech.""The US has never joined the ICC and has long opposed a global court with unelected judges prosecuting American officials. A 2002 law allows the US military to free any American or ally detained by the ICC.

February 6 was the last day before which federal workers were supposed to let the administration know whether they want to resign or work from the office. But a federal judge Thursday temporarily blocked the buyout offer hours before the deadline. A federal judge in Massachusetts pushed back the deadline for employees to accept the offer, initially set for 11:59 p.m. Thursday, until at least Monday in response to a lawsuit filed by federal workers unions that argued the administration could not guarantee pay beyond the March 14 expiration date for the existing budget.The program had Elon Musk 's design all over it as Musk did the same thing to then-Twitter when he acquired it.

CNN reported that Trump was planning a mass layoff of those employees who did not take the buyout.US District George O'Toole prevented the agency from implementing the program's deadline during a brief hearing held hours before federal workers were required to notify OPM of whether they would accept or reject the offer to step away from their positions.A Justice Department lawyer said OPM would provide notice to federal employees that the deadline is paused pending further legal proceedings.For those who opted to keep their positions, the message from the administration noted that the Trump administration could not give ""full assurance regarding the certainty of your position or agency."" It also noted that ""the majority of federal agencies are likely to be downsized through restructurings, realignments, and reductions in force"" as part of Trump's efforts to reform the federal workforce.","40,000 employees accepted the deferred resignation program.

Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and transport secretary Sean Duffy had a fiery to-and-fro on X after two major plane crashes -- one in Washington DC in which an Army Blackhawk helicopter crashed into an American Airlines plane killing 67, and another in Philadelphia when a medical jet crashed killing all six on board.In the aftermath of two aviation mishaps, Sean Duffy announced that DOGE officials were going to ""plug in"" and upgrade the country's aviation system. Hillary Clinton reacted to the announcement and in a sharp criticism of Elon Musk 'd Department of Government Efficiency, she said some DOGE officials are not old enough to even rent a car. ""They have no relevant experience. Most of them aren't ol enough to rent a car. And you’re going to let them mess with airline safety that’s already deteriorated on your watch,"" Clinton wrote.“Madam Secretary, with all due respect, ‘experienced’ Washington bureaucrats are the reason our nation’s infrastructure is crumbling,” Duffy replied. “You need to sit this one out.”Clinton did not sit out but came back at Duffy blaming MAGA for the crashes. “US airlines had gone 16 years without fatal crashes. Then MAGA fired the FAA chief, gutted the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, and threatened air traffic controllers with layoffs,” Clinton said. “Now there have been two fatal crashes.”After the DC plane crash, Donald Trump blamed the previous administration's DEI hiring policy that led to massive online trolling of a transgender Army pilot who was not flying the military helicopter.Duffy's announcement that DOGE will take a look at the aviation sector came at a time when DOGE is already in the process of purging several government departments drawing the ire of many.

ISLAMABAD : The UN refugees and migration agencies on Wednesday expressed their concern over Pakistan 's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting relocation to the United States and elsewhere.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR , and the international organization for migration in a statement said they were seeking clarification from Pakistan, which said last week it would deport the refugees back to Afghanistan unless their cases were processed quickly by the countries that had agreed to take them in.About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the US under a program that helps people at risk because of their work with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. They were among tens of thousands of Afghans who fled to neighboring Pakistan after their country fell to the Taliban in 2021.However, they were left in limbo after President Donald Trump paused US refugee programs last month.""A UNHCR-issued non-return advisory has been in place since 2021, calling for a suspension of forced returns of Afghan nationals from any country regardless of their status,"" the joint UNHCR-IOM statement said.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif last week gave the green light to evict Afghans without papers from the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi before March 31, in preparation for deportation if they were not relocated to their host countries.UNHCR and IOM said they are especially concerned for Afghan nationals who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians and others.It said since January 1, 2025, an uptick in arrests of Afghan nationals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi has caused significant distress, with reports of Afghan nationals of various documentation statuses being rounded up.The Trump administration also announced the US refugee admissions program would be suspended from January 27 for at least three months. It has shocked Afghans who were hoping to travel to the United States soon.Afghans in Pakistan have been virtually living in hiding since 2023 when a crackdown began on foreigners who are in the country without proper documentation. An estimated 800,000 Afghans have either gone back voluntarily or been deported since despite criticism from UN agencies, rights groups and the Taliban.Besides thousands of Afghans who are living in Pakistan and awaiting travel to host countries, there are around 1.45 million Afghan nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees in Pakistan as well but their stay has been extended until June.In the statement, UNHCR and IOM urged ""Pakistan to implement any relocation measures with due consideration for human rights standards, including due process, and the legal status of proof of registration (POR) and afghan citizen card (ACC) holders, who have resided in Pakistan for an extended period of time"".""Pakistan has a proud tradition of hosting refugees, saving millions of lives.

The official was speaking on the condition of anonymity.The Pakistani military said the casualties occurred after troops engaged the insurgents who erected barricades on a key highway in Kalat, near the border with Afghanistan.The security forces ""successfully removed the roadblock"" following the overnight clashes, the military said in a statement.The military confirmed 18 soldiers died in the operation and vowed that ""the perpetrators, facilitators and abettors of this heinous and cowardly act, will be brought to justice."" Security forces recovered the bodies of 12 insurgents, the military said.Troops also killed another 11 insurgents in an operation that was still underway, the military added.Pakistan's Balochistan province is currently witnessing a surge in deadly attacks, fueled by demands for independence and control over local resources.A Sunni Muslim ethnic group who live on both sides of the Iran-Pakistan border, and also in parts of southern Afghanistan, over 10,000 Baloch have disappeared since 2011, according to Amnesty International.Efforts for autonomy or independence have been met with violent suppression on both sides of the border. In Pakistan, such efforts are viewed as attempts to fragment the nation — while in Iran the situation is further complicated by the Baloch being a Sunni Muslim minority in a predominantly Shiite country.The largest Baloch militant group, the BLA, is backed by the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).The TTP are a separate group from the BLA, with the TTP being allied with the Afghan Taliban.Balochistan is rich in natural resources such as gold, diamonds, silver, and copper — yet the local population remains among the poorest in Pakistan.","Pakistani troops fight insurgents who set up roadblocks in restive northwestern region of Balochistan. 18 paramilitaries and 23 rebels dead, three other Pakistani soldiers seriously wounded in some of the heaviest clashes in recent years.

Bilal Shabbir, Kalat’s deputy commissioner, said the attacks took place in Pidrang, Khazeni and Mangochar Bazaar areas of the town, where militants started conducting snap checks of passenger vehicles passing through town.In the first incident, Shabbir said a van carrying 17 soldiers from Panjgur to Quetta came under attack near the mountainous area of Khazeni, where armed men battled the security forces. He said one soldier of the Frontier Corps (FC), a paramilitary force, was separately killed in clashes with the militants.“The bodies of the slain soldiers were shifted to Quetta,” Shabbir said. “We don’t know how many attackers were killed because they took the bodies of their fighters into the mountains in the dark.”He said three FC personnel were also injured in the attack, adding that militants set a private bank on fire in Mangochar Bazaar.Separatist groups like BLA have long been at the forefront of a low-level insurgency in Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province by area and rich in mineral resources. Separatists claim that Islamabad is abusing the province’s natural wealth while ignoring the local population.In recent months, the BLA has become a major security threat, carrying out large-scale attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, targeting Chinese nationals and interests engaged in investment projects, security forces, and ethnic Punjabis they perceive as outsiders in Balochistan.",At least 18 soldiers killed and five injured in Balochistan attacks.

A paramilitary who arrived to assist was also killed in the attack.Three others were critically injured, while two managed to escape unscathed.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack so far, but Balochistan has long been plagued by sectarian, ethnic, and separatist violence.The province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran, has seen a surge in attacks in recent months.In January, six people were killed in a bombing claimed by the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which has frequently targeted security forces and civilians, particularly those from other provinces.The BLA has also attacked foreign-funded energy projects, including those backed by China, accusing outsiders of exploiting the province’s vast natural resources while neglecting local communities.In November, the BLA took responsibility for a bombing at Quetta’s main railway station that killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers. Just months earlier, in August, the group launched a series of coordinated attacks that left at least 39 people dead, marking one of the deadliest escalations in recent years.Violence has also surged beyond Balochistan, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province witnessing an increase in militant attacks.The Pakistani military reported that in 2024 alone, 383 soldiers and 925 militants were killed in various clashes.","18 paramilitary personnel killed in ambush in southwest Pakistan's Balochistan province.

ISLAMABAD: Amnesty International has slammed the recent the prevention of electronic crimes (amendment) act 2025, passed in Pakistan, and has called on the Pakistan authorities for immediately repealing the amendment, and ensuring the right to freedom of expression is upheld in the country.Claiming that the act was ""hastily passed"", Amnesty International said that the latest amendment, aiming at criminalizing 'fake and false news' is based on ""vague and overbroad provisions"" which threatens freedom of expression.Responding to the Peca act 2025 , Babu Ram Pant,deputy regional director of campaigns, South Asia, had earlier said that the vague and ambiguous framing of some elements of the offence raises concerns that it can supress ""what little is left of the right to online expression"" in Pakistan.""The amendment introduces a criminal offence against those perpetrating so-called 'false and fake information' and imposes a maximum penalty of three years' imprisonment with a fine.

The organisation urged President Zardari to reject the bill and ensure that the ""constitutional right to freedom of expression is upheld.""Media advocacy group, reporters without borders (RSF), has said that censorship and social media blocking in Pakistan indicates a ""very disturbing decline in press freedom in the country.""Meanwhile, Media Diversity Institute (MDI) also slammed the government over increased control over the press and internet, stating that it has ""resulted in uncertainty, a climate of fear, and discomfort among the masses.""","Amnesty International has slammed the recent the prevention of electronic crimes (amendment) act 2025, passed in Pakistan.

Donald Trump's foreign aid suspension hits Pakistan: How it will impact key sectors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/donald-trumps-foreign-aid-suspension-hits-pakistan-how-it-will-impact-key-sectors/articleshow/117736883.cms,"Immediate impact on key sectors



US policy shift and review timeline



Economic and social consequences for Pakistan



Geopolitical ramifications



Uncertain future for development initiatives



NEW DELHI: Donald Trump has temporarily suspended United States foreign assistance to foreign countries, including Pakistan, for re-evaluation, putting several critical development projects on hold.The decision follows an executive order issued by President Donald Trump, directing a comprehensive review of US foreign aid spending.The US aid suspension is set to impact several key sectors in Pakistan, including energy, economic growth, agriculture, governance, education, health, and cultural preservation. Projects such as the Power Sector Improvement Activity, Pakistan Private Sector Energy Initiative, and Clean Energy Loan Portfolio Guarantee Program face disruptions in the energy sector, as per a Geo news report.Economic growth initiatives, including the Social Protection Activity and Pakistan Private Investment Initiative, may also suffer setbacks. In agriculture, programmes like Water Management for Enhanced Productivity and Recharge Pakistan risk losing funding.The suspension has stalled numerous USAID-funded projects across various sectors, including health, education, agriculture, energy, and governance. The move halts initiatives such as the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP), the Power Sector Improvement Activity, and the Pakistan Private Sector Energy Activity. Economic growth initiatives, such as the Social Protection Activity and Investment Promotion Activity, are also affected.In the education sector, projects aimed at improving girls' education, strengthening higher education systems, and enhancing resilience in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been disrupted. The health sector has also taken a hit, with the suspension of tuberculosis treatment programmes, family health initiatives, and global health security efforts.Tammy Bruce, a spokesperson for the US Department of State, confirmed that all foreign aid funded by the State Department and USAID is under review. Secretary of State Marco Rubio justified the move, stating that every aid dollar must contribute to American security, strength, and prosperity.The White House has clarified that the suspension is temporary, with a 90-day review period. The final decision will be made by the relevant departments in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).The suspension of aid threatens Pakistan’s development trajectory, particularly in regions relying on US-funded initiatives for stability and growth. The decision could delay infrastructural advancements, limit economic opportunities, and disrupt healthcare access for vulnerable populations.Pakistan’s governance and democracy-building programmes are also affected, including projects on electoral reforms, land registration, and local governance. The decision may weaken institutional development efforts and impede progress in human rights and civic participation.The suspension highlights a shift in US-Pakistan relations , with Washington reassessing its financial commitments to Islamabad. Analysts believe this could push Pakistan to seek alternative funding sources, possibly from China or Gulf nations, altering its geopolitical alliances.While the pause in aid does not signify a complete severance of US-Pakistan ties, it raises concerns about future diplomatic engagements and financial support from Washington. The upcoming review will determine whether these programmes will resume, be modified, or face permanent cuts.With crucial projects now in limbo, Pakistani officials and aid-dependent communities await the US review’s outcome. The next three months will be critical in determining whether Washington reinstates its financial commitments or signals a long-term reduction in aid to Pakistan.For now, the suspension leaves Pakistan navigating an uncertain future, with potential setbacks in economic growth, infrastructure development, and humanitarian assistance.","Donald Trump has temporarily suspended United States foreign assistance to foreign countries, including Pakistan.

Ousted Bangladeshi leader and former prime minister Sheikh Hasina called for justice after a mob vandalised her father Mujibur Rahman 's house on Wednesday.""They can demolish a building, but not the history... but they must also remember that the history takes its revenge,"" she said in an emotional address.""Today, this house is being demolished. What crime had it committed? Why were they so afraid of the house... I seek justice from the people of the country. Didn't I do anything for you?"" she added.In an apparent attack on the interim government chief Mohammed Yunus, Hasina said, ""They are yet to have the strength to destroy the national flag, the constitution and the independence that we earned at the cost of lives of millions of martyrs with a bulldozer.""Hasina was addressing an event organized by the now-disbanded student wing Chhatra League of the Awami League , urged the nation to unite in resistance against the current regime.The deposed premier recalled that while Pakistani troops looted the house during the 1971 Liberation War, they neither demolished nor set it on fire.""Today, this house is being demolished. What crime had it committed? Why were they so afraid of the house... I seek justice from the people of the country. Didn't I do anything for you?"" she said.Protesters on Thursday desecrated the house of the country's founding father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, after vandalizing and setting it on fire on Wednesday night. The violence escalated as demonstrators tore down homes belonging to leaders of Awami League and defaced murals of Mujibur Rahman, following the deposed prime minister’s online address.Several thousand people had gathered in front of Mujibur Rahman’s former residence—now a memorial museum—in Dhaka’s Dhanmondi area, responding to a social media call for a ""Bulldozer Procession"" coinciding with Hasina’s speech.The 77-year-old has been living in India since August 5 last year after fleeing Bangladesh in the wake of a massive student-led uprising that ended her Awami League’s 16-year rule.While her father is widely regarded as a hero of Bangladesh’s independence, growing public anger toward Hasina has cast a shadow over his legacy.

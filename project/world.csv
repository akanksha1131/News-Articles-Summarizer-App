Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he's ready to have a "" constructive dialogue "" with his US counterpart Donald Trump to ""solve real problems"" as his last meeting at the Oval Office blew up after a verbal spat over ongoing war with Russia.Trump and Vice President JD Vance flayed Zelenskyy for being dismissive about ceasefire with Moscow , saying the Kyiv had no way of winning the war against the Kremlin.Days after the botched meeting at the White House , Zelenskyy recognised Kyiv's dependence on Washington, however, he avoided apologising.""I am convinced that the situation will pass and more important things are ahead,"" Zelenskyy told Bloomberg during a European leaders summit held in London.If Trump invites him ""for a constructive dialogue, to solve real problems, for serious issues and real, decisive actions and answers — I will arrive,"" he said.""I’m ready for any format of constructive relations with the US,"" Zelenskiyy said.The Ukrainian President further defended his right to stand up for the ""dignity of his country and its people, and urged allies to show understanding for the suffering endured by Ukraine since Russia’s invasion three years ago.Zelenskyy also expressed strong appreciation for the support Ukraine has received during the London summit on Sunday, which focused on Ukraine's future and its relationship with Europe.The urgency of the summit in London's ornate Lancaster House was heightened after Trump chastised Zelenskyy, appalling the West and delighting Moscow, which saw it as ""a miracle of restraint"" that Trump and Vance didn't hit Zelenskyy.Zelenskyy and an ensemble of European leaders were in attendance, at a moment of intense anxiety in the conflict. According to CNN, Starmer told reporters he was working with France and a small number of other nations to craft a plan to stop the fighting, which would then be presented to the US.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he's ready to have a "" constructive dialogue "" with his US counterpart Donald Trump to ""solve real problems"" His last meeting at the Oval Office blew up after a verbal spat over ongoing war with Russia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118671602,imgsize-60516,width-400,resizemode-4/118671602.jpg"
ACLU sues to block migrant transfers by US to Gitmo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/aclu-sues-to-block-migrant-transfers-by-us-to-gitmo/articleshow/118670295.cms,"New camp where the Trump administration plans to house migrants at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay (NYT photo)

WASHINGTON: The Trump administration faced the first direct legal challenge to its policy of sending migrants to the US military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for continued immigration detention with a lawsuit filed Saturday by a coalition of human rights and immigrant advocacy organisations .""Plaintiffs seek this court's intervention to put a stop to these cruel, unnecessary and illegal transfers to and detention at Guantanamo,"" the newly filed complaint said. The plaintiffs, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, are for now seeking a judicial stay to block the transfer of 10 migrants whom the coalition signed up to represent. But it appears to lay the groundwork to seek a potential broader order against the transfer policy, which has raised many novel legal issues.The 10 migrants named in the lawsuit have final removal orders, it said, and come from countries including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Venezuela. The lawsuit asserts that none are gang members, and some have been specifically threatened with transfer to Guantanamo. ""In attempting to justify the transfers, the govt has claimed that the individuals it sent to Guantanamo are members of gangs and dangerous criminals - the 'worst of the worst,'"" the complaint said, citing a remark in Jan by defense secretary Pete Hegseth. It continued: ""That characterisation is patently false. It is also legally irrelevant because the govt lacks statutory authority to send any immigration detainees from the US to Guantanamo."" The justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","The lawsuit was filed by a coalition of human rights and immigrant advocacy organisations.

Some held placards saying ‘Putin Kaput’ or calling for a ban on all international trade with Russia.

LONDON: British PM Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Europe was at a crossroads in history and must do the heavy lifting to defend itself as world leaders met in London to discuss ways of working together to stop Russia's war in Ukraine. His call for European allies to increase their arms spending to shore up their own defences and Ukraine's was not a sign that he thought the US had become an unreliable ally, he said. No two countries are closely aligned than the UK and the US, Starmer said. ""One thing our history tells us is that if there is conflict in Europe, it will wash up on our shores,"" he said.The summit comes two days after US support for Ukraine appeared in greater jeopardy after President Trump lashed out at Ukrainian President Zelensky and said he wasn't grateful enough for US support. Starmer hosted more than 19 world leaders, mostly from across Europe, and also Canadian PM Justin Trudeau. ""Even while Russia talks about peace, they are continuing their relentless aggression,"" Starmer said at the opening of the meeting. Starmer, flanked by Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron, said the three of them had agreed to work on a plan to stop the fighting, and take that to the US, which has discussed brokering a peace deal. ""We need to agree what steps come out of this meeting to deliver peace through strength for the benefit of all,"" he said. ""So, let's get started.""European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen warned on Sunday that ""we urgently have to rearm Europe"". Before the meeting, Von der Leyen said she would present a ""comprehensive plan"" at the EU summit, adding that ""we have to have a surge in defence"" and ""step up massively"". ""It's now of utmost importance we increase spending ... it's important we prepare for the worst,"" she added. Addressing Trump, she said: ""We're ready together with you to defend democracy, to defend the principle that there's a rule of law, that you cannot invade your neighbour and bully your neighbour, or you cannot change borders with force. It's in our common interest that we prevent future wars.""Italian PM Meloni met with Zelensky on the sidelines of the London meeting on Sunday, reaffirming Italy's support for Ukraine. Her office said she expressed support, together with European and Western partners and the US, ""to build a just and lasting peace, which ensures a future of sovereignty, security and freedom for Ukraine"". It was in line with Italy's position through the war while keeping the US in the picture.The leaders of the three Baltic states have not publicly criticised the decision not to include them in London's meeting.

"Iran's parliament fires minister of finance over plummeting rial, mismanagement",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/irans-parliament-fires-minister-of-finance-over-plummeting-rial-mismanagement/articleshow/118669875.cms,"Iranian Finance Minister Abdolnasser Hemmati speaks during an open session of parliament for his impeachment (AP photo)

TEHRAN: Iran's parliament on Sunday impeached the country's finance minister and voted to remove him from office amid growing concerns over the crashing rial and accusations of mismanagement.Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf announced that 182 out of 273 lawmakers voted to dismiss Abdolnasser Hemmati , just six months after President Masoud Pezeshkian 's government took office.Pezeshkian, who defended Hemmati, emphasized that the government is locked in a tough battle with the West. He called for greater unity and cooperation from Parliament to face these challenges.The decision comes amid rising tensions over Iran's nuclear program and worsening relations with the West. Iran's economy has been severely affected by international sanctions, especially after the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal. In 2015, the rial was worth 32,000 to the dollar, but by the time Pezeshkian took office in July, it had plummeted to 584,000 to the dollar. Recently, it dropped even further, with exchange shops in Tehran trading 930,000 rials for each dollar.During the impeachment proceedings, Mohammad Qasim Osmani, a lawmaker supporting Hemmati, argued that rising inflation and exchange rates were not the fault of the current government or Parliament. He pointed to the budget deficit left by the previous administration, which he said contributed to the economic instability. Osmani also cited recent geopolitical events as factors that undermined public confidence, causing many people to convert their savings into foreign currency, which in turn further devalued the rial.Hemmati acknowledged the tough economic climate during his five months in office, including a 10% reduction in inflation. However, he acknowledged that inflation remained high, standing at 35%. He assured lawmakers that his team was working hard to address the issue, but warned that the process would take time.This latest development is another chapter in Iran's ongoing political and economic struggles as the country continues to navigate a complex relationship with the international community.","Iran's parliament impeached the country's finance minister and voted to remove him from office.

Trump's crypto play: A game changer or just a market jolt?

Unanswered questions: How will the crypto reserve work?

US President Donald Trump shook up the cryptocurrency world on Sunday, announcing that XRP (Ripple), SOL (Solana), and ADA (Cardano) would be included in a newly formed US Crypto Strategic Reserve . The move sent all three assets surging between 10% and 35% in market trading, reported Reuters.Trump revealed the decision in a social media post, tying it to his January executive order on digital assets. “I will make sure the US is the Crypto Capital of the World,” he declared, adding that his directive instructed the Presidential Working Group to move forward with the reserve plan.The announcement marks a sharp policy shift from the Biden administration, which had cracked down on the crypto industry over concerns about fraud and money laundering. Trump's 2024 campaign, in contrast, won significant backing from crypto executives, and his latest move signals that he intends to deliver on his pro-crypto promises.While the news initially sparked a rally, broader cryptocurrency markets have struggled in recent weeks, with many digital assets erasing their post-election gains. Analysts believe a more sustained market boost will require either interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve or a clearer regulatory framework from the Trump administration.Despite the excitement, details about the crypto reserve remain unclear. Some experts speculate it could be funded through the US Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund, which is traditionally used to manage foreign currencies. Others suggest it might involve cryptocurrencies seized in law enforcement actions.Legal scholars are divided on whether the reserve could be established without congressional approval. Meanwhile, Trump’s inner circle is pressing ahead—his family has even launched its own cryptocurrency, and the first-ever White House Crypto Summit is set for Friday.With the administration doubling down on its pro-crypto stance, all eyes are now on Washington to see whether Trump’s bold move is the start of a new financial era or just another short-lived market shake-up.","US President Donald Trump announced Sunday that XRP (Ripple), SOL (Solana), and ADA (Cardano) would be included in a newly formed US Crypto Strategic Reserve.

WASHINGTON: Three civilian aircraft reportedly violated the airspace above US President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, prompting the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) to scramble F-16 fighter jets, according to the Daily Mail.The fighter jets deployed flares and escorted the planes out of the restricted airspace, the report said. It remains unclear why the aircraft entered Palm Beach airspace, though similar incidents have occurred in recent weeks.According to Palm Beach Post, three airspace violations took place during Trump’s visit to Mar-a-Lago in February. Two violations occurred on February 15, while another took place on Presidents Day, February 17. There were also reports of F-16s responding to airspace breaches over Wellington, an inland community, and another civilian aircraft flying into Palm Beach on February 18.NORAD, in its response, stated that the flares used during such incidents are “employed with the highest regard for safety, burn out quickly and completely, and pose no danger to people on the ground.”Meanwhile, Irish Star reported that Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago after the fighter jets had dealt with the airspace violations.In a separate development, Trump claimed that boxes of classified documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago residence during a 2022 FBI investigation had been returned to him. According to AFP, Trump suggested that these documents, which were at the center of an inquiry into his handling of government records, could be displayed in his future presidential library.“The department just returned the boxes that Deranged Jack Smith made such a big deal about,” Trump posted on Truth Social, referring to Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the case.“They are being brought down to Florida and will someday be part of the Trump Presidential Library,” he added.The Justice Department has not confirmed Trump’s claim regarding the return of the documents.","Three civilian aircraft reportedly violated the airspace above US President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

Elon Musk Cold Open - SNL

"" Saturday Night Live "" (SNL) took a satirical swing at US President Donald Trump’s recent meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a skit featuring James Austin Johnson as Trump, Bowen Yang as Vice President JD Vance, and Mikey Day as Zelenskyy.The show, which returned with its first new episode since the ""SNL50"" special, also featured an unexpected appearance by Mike Myers as Elon Musk, marking his first regular episode cameo since 2015.The sketch mocked the reported tensions between Trump and Zelenskyy, portraying their White House press conference as a chaotic exchange. The scene opened with a voice-over introducing the event: “Yesterday, President Trump hosted Ukrainian President Zelenskyy at the White House, and it went really, really well. Everyone who watched felt at ease and thought the world is now a safer place.”Johnson’s Trump quipped, “It is I, president and CEO of Gaza Hotel and Casino, Donald Trump, and I’d like to welcome President Zelenskyy here to this incredible trap. It’s going to be a big, beautiful trap, and we’re going to attack him very soon for no reason, right?”Bowen Yang’s Vance jumped in, berating Zelenskyy for not expressing enough gratitude: “I could jump in here, because that’s how we planned this. What happened to ‘thank you’? Remember ‘thank you’? You haven’t said ‘thank you’ to us once the past 15 seconds I’ve been yelling at you! You didn’t say it now, but you didn’t say it now. When you walked in here, you didn’t say thank you.”The sketch then introduced Myers as Elon Musk, who arrived wearing jeans and a T-shirt, prompting Trump to shift his stance on dress code. “We love your outfit. Very official and respectful,” Johnson’s Trump said, contradicting his earlier criticism of Zelenskyy’s casual attire.Myers’ Musk joked, “Thanks, Donald, what are you doing in my office? You know, I’m the president now, right? I’m kidding. I’m kidding. Maybe not?” The skit continued with Musk discussing mass firings and government cutbacks, referencing a controversial restructuring plan.The segment also touched on the recent release of the ""Epstein Files,"" with Trump’s character saying, “And to cap off an amazing week, we’re going to finally release the Epstein Files. Yes, America is going to see all the names, from A to S. No T.”The parody followed reports of a heated real-life encounter between Trump, Vance, and Zelenskyy at the White House, during which Trump and Vance allegedly repeated Russian talking points and pressed Ukraine to make concessions. The actual meeting reportedly devolved into a tense argument over U.S. aid to Ukraine.Shane Gillis hosted this week's episode, marking his second time leading SNL since his initial controversy-laden departure from the show in 2019. Musical guest Tate McRae also made her second appearance on the show. Looking ahead, pop icon Lady Gaga is set to double as host and musical guest next week.This marked the first new episode since ""SNL50: The Anniversary Special,"" which aired on February 16 and drew 14.8 million live viewers, significantly surpassing the show’s season average of 4.9 million. The show’s return continued the momentum generated by its milestone celebration.","Saturday Night Live took a satirical swing at US President Donald Trump’s recent meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a skit.

Richard and Rita Zajko were found shot dead in their home in Chester Heights on December 31, 2022. Their daughter, Michelle Zajko , became a person of interest after authorities discovered her links to individuals associated with the Zizians . She was questioned but refused to cooperate and later fled a Pennsylvania State Police barracks, abandoning her vehicle and $40,000 in cash, NBCNews.com reported.For nearly two years, the case remained unsolved. However, recent developments have reignited attention, particularly after Zajko and two associates were arrested in Maryland on trespassing and weapons charges. A prosecutor revealed in court that they were part of a group ""tied to multiple homicides that have occurred across the United States.""NBCNews.com reported that the Zizians originated from the rationalist community in Berkeley, California, and have been linked to at least six violent deaths. Members have been implicated in crimes ranging from a samurai sword attack in California to the murder of an elderly man scheduled to testify against them. The group is reportedly led by Alaskan computer scientist and blogger Jack ""Ziz"" LaSota, who identifies as female. LaSota was among those questioned in the Zajkos’ murder investigation and was later arrested in Maryland alongside Zajko.While no charges have been filed in the Zajkos’ murder, their family and friends remain hopeful. “Hopefully, there will finally be justice for Rich and Rita,” a family friend told NBCNews.com.The Zizians, an enigmatic group with roots in Berkeley’s rationalist community, are now under scrutiny for their alleged involvement in multiple violent crimes across the United States. Prosecutors have linked the group to at least six violent deaths, including cases in Pennsylvania, Vermont, and California.On December 31, 2022, Richard and Rita Zajko were found shot dead in their Chester Heights home. Their daughter, Michelle Zajko, quickly became a person of interest but managed to evade authorities for nearly two years. While no one has been charged in their murders, prosecutors say Zajko and two associates—also linked to the Zizians—were arrested in Maryland on trespassing and weapons charges.Among those arrested was Jack ""Ziz"" LaSota, the alleged leader of the group, along with another associate, Daniel Blank. “They were part of a group tied to multiple homicides across the United States,” a prosecutor said in court.The Zizians have been connected to a series of violent incidents across the country:Two Zizian members, Ophelia Bauckholt and Teresa Youngblut, were involved in a shootout with Border Patrol agents, resulting in the death of agent David Maland. Bauckholt was killed in the exchange, while Youngblut was wounded and later arrested.A samurai sword attack left one group member dead after their intended victim—an elderly man—shot back in self-defense.The survivor of the samurai attack, Curtis Lind, was later fatally stabbed outside his home. Another Zizian member has since been charged in his murder.Emerging from Berkeley’s rationalist community, the Zizians present themselves as intellectuals focused on existential threats such as artificial intelligence. However, law enforcement officials have linked them to multiple violent crimes, raising questions about whether they function as an organized criminal network or a loosely connected movement.Authorities continue to investigate the group’s structure and motivations, while prosecutors work to uncover the full extent of its influence. For the families of the victims, the search for justice continues. “We still have no answers,” a family friend of the murdered Zajkos said. “Hopefully, there will finally be justice for Rich and Rita.”","Richard and Rita Zajko were found shot dead in their Pennsylvania home on December 31, 2022.

A US spacecraft has successfully landed on the Moon, marking a major milestone for private space exploration . Firefly Aerospace ’s Blue Ghost Mission 1 is now the first private lander to reach the Moon without crashing or tipping over.The lander descended autonomously onto the slopes of an ancient volcanic dome in the Moon’s northeastern near side. Firefly’s Mission Control, based near Austin, Texas, confirmed the successful touchdown from 225,000 miles (360,000 kilometres) away.""We’re on the Moon,"" a controller announced, confirming that the lander was stable. This makes Firefly only the second private company to land successfully, after Intuitive Machines achieved a similar milestone in February 2024.""Firefly just became the first commercial company in history to achieve a fully successful Moon landing. This small step on the Moon represents a giant leap in commercial exploration,"" Firefly Aerospace said in a statement on X.Nasa invested $101 million for Blue Ghost’s delivery, plus an additional $44 million for its onboard technology. The lander carries ten scientific instruments, including a vacuum to collect lunar soil samples, a drill capable of measuring temperatures 10 feet (3 metres) below the surface, and a device designed to counteract lunar dust, which caused issues during the Apollo missions.The lander is expected to operate for two weeks before the harsh lunar night renders it inactive. However, Firefly has planned for Blue Ghost to continue functioning for several hours into the lunar night, extending data collection efforts.During its journey, Blue Ghost sent back stunning images of both Earth and the Moon. It spent 45 days travelling through space, allowing mission controllers to conduct critical health checks on its subsystems and prepare the onboard instruments for lunar operations. While in orbit, it successfully acquired signals from the U.S. GPS and European Galileo constellations, demonstrating the potential for future lunar navigation.On March 14, the lander is expected to capture high-definition images of a total lunar eclipse, when the Earth will completely block the Sun from the Moon’s horizon. Firefly also aims to document the lunar sunset on March 16, gathering data on how lunar dust levitates due to solar influences—a phenomenon first observed by Apollo 17 astronaut Eugene Cernan.The Moon is set for more visitors soon. Intuitive Machines’ IM-2 mission is due to land this week, targeting a site near the lunar south pole. Meanwhile, Japanese company ispace has a lander on a slower trajectory, expected to arrive in three months.This mission is part of Nasa’s push to support commercial lunar exploration under its $2.6 billion Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) programme.

She was 63.Stone was traveling back to Atlanta from Alabama when the vehicle she was riding in overturned and was struck by a big rig around 4 am, her longtime manager Walter Millsap III told The Associated Press. While others in the van survived, Stone succumbed to her injuries.Her children, Diamond and Michael Archer, expressed their grief in a statement shared by the SRG Group: “Never in a million years did we ever expect to get this horrible news. We are still trying to process and are completely heartbroken.”Millsap described the loss as “an unexpected and unfortunate tragedy,” adding, “there are simply no words to express how we feel.”Stone had been scheduled to perform at the halftime show of the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) men’s championship basketball game on Saturday. CIAA Chaplain Pastor Jerome Barber led a moment of silence in her honour. Commissioner Jacqie McWilliams-Parker said the league was “heartbroken by the loss” and praised Stone for using her talent to “inspire and touch us with strength and hope.”A trailblazer in hip-hop and R&B, Stone first gained recognition as a member of The Sequence, the pioneering all-female rap trio signed to Sugar Hill Records. Their song Funk You Up became a hip-hop classic, later sampled by artists such as Dr. Dre. She later joined the R&B trio Vertical Hold before launching a successful solo career.Stone was a key figure in the neo-soul movement of the early 2000s alongside Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Maxwell, and D’Angelo. Her 2001 album Mahogany Soul reached No. 22 on the Billboard 200, while The Art of Love & War (2007) peaked at No. 11. Her collaboration Baby with Betty Wright became a chart-topping hit.Beyond music, Stone ventured into acting, appearing in films such as The Hot Chick, The Fighting Temptations, and Ride Along. She also performed on Broadway in Chicago and appeared on reality shows including Celebrity Fit Club and R&B Divas: Atlanta.Born in Columbia, South Carolina, Stone’s legacy spans decades, from hip-hop’s early days to modern R&B. Her influence, both as a solo artist and as part of The Sequence, remains a defining part of music history.","Stone was traveling back to Atlanta from Alabama when the vehicle she was riding in overturned and was struck by a big rig.

What is polar vortex? Major disruption expected across US and Canada,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-polar-vortex-major-disruption-expected-across-the-us-and-canada/articleshow/118649318.cms,"Representative photo (AFP)

What is a Polar Vortex?

How will it impact the weather?

What happens when the polar vortex collapses?

A powerful polar vortex collapse is forecast to hit within weeks, bringing a dramatic shift in weather conditions across the United States and Canada. Meteorologists predict the event will unfold in mid-March, marking the second major disruption of the polar vortex in 2025. The first collapse occurred in mid-February, unleashing a deep freeze across much of the central and eastern US.Forecasters warn that this upcoming vortex disruption could be particularly intense, bringing extreme winter conditions even as the season draws to a close.A polar vortex is a massive area of low pressure and frigid air that typically surrounds the Earth's poles. It strengthens during winter and weakens in summer, but occasionally, disruptions in the jet stream cause it to shift, allowing Arctic air to plunge southward. The polar vortex exists in the stratosphere, with winds exceeding 155 mph in a stable state.When the polar vortex remains strong, it contains cold air within the Arctic region, maintaining relatively stable weather patterns. However, when it weakens or collapses, the jet stream becomes unstable, allowing frigid Arctic air to spill into lower latitudes. This results in severe cold snaps, heavy snowfall, and unpredictable weather patterns.The UK Met Office explains: ""A stronger jet stream brings stormy and wet weather, while a weaker one allows more frequent outbreaks of Arctic air, leading to colder temperatures.""A polar vortex collapse, also known as a Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW) event, occurs when stratospheric temperatures rise rapidly—sometimes by as much as 50°C within days. This disturbance weakens the vortex, reversing its winds and allowing Arctic air to surge southward.The Met Office explains: ""As the cold air from the stratosphere sinks into the troposphere, it disturbs the jet stream, triggering dramatic weather shifts.""As March approaches, forecasters will continue monitoring developments, but early warnings suggest the potential for another round of extreme winter conditions across North America. The coming weeks could see a sharp downturn in temperatures, reinforcing winter’s grip just as many hope for spring’s arrival.","Polar vortex is a massive area of low pressure and frigid air that typically surrounds the Earth's poles.

Watch: JD Vance asked if he's 'Putin's puppet' during Vermont ski trip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-jd-vance-asked-if-hes-putins-puppet-during-vermont-ski-trip/articleshow/118671576.cms,"J.D. Vance Asked About Being 'Putin's Puppet' While Skiing in Vermont, On Video | TMZ

Vice President JD Vance was heckled as a "" Putin's puppet "" while skiing in Vermont over the weekend, as protesters gathered to voice their anger following his tense confrontation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office. Demonstrators accused Vance of siding with Russia, with some calling for him to ""go ski in Russia.""Hundreds of protesters lined the roads near Sugarbush Resort in Warren, Vermont, where Vance and his family were staying. Many carried pro-Ukraine signs, while others waved Palestinian flags and banners advocating for immigrant rights. The protests erupted just a day after Vance's heated exchange with Zelenskyy, during which he accused the Ukrainian leader of failing to acknowledge US financial aid and dismissed concerns about Russia’s trustworthiness.“Ski Russia because JD Vance has no friends in Vermont, but he’s got lots of friends in Russia, so he should go there for vacation,” Tekla Van Hoven, a protester from Waterbury, told WCAX-TV. Others held placards labelling him a ""traitor.""The protests were planned in advance but intensified following the Oval Office confrontation, which saw Trump and Vance take a hardline stance against continued US support for Ukraine. The meeting reportedly turned into a shouting match, with Trump ultimately cancelling a scheduled lunch and press conference with Zelenskyy.While a smaller group of Trump and Vance supporters held a “welcome rally,” the anti-Vance sentiment dominated the scene. Vermont’s Republican Governor Phil Scott had urged residents to show respect, stating, “I hope Vermonters remember the vice president is here on a family trip with his young children and, while we may not always agree, we should be respectful.”Vance’s stance on Ukraine has been controversial for years. As a Senate candidate in 2022, he dismissed US involvement in the conflict, saying he “didn’t care” what happened to Ukraine. His recent argument with Zelenskyy have reinforced his isolationist views, aligning with Trump’s efforts to pursue a diplomatic deal with Russia.As protests swelled in Vermont, Fox News reported that Vance and his family were moved to an undisclosed location for security reasons. The White House has not commented on the incident.","Hundreds of protesters lined the roads near Sugarbush Resort in Warren, Vermont, where Vance and his family were staying.

Delta passenger claims she was almost thrown off flight over her cat’s meows!,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/delta-passenger-claims-she-was-almost-thrown-off-flight-over-her-cats-meows/articleshow/118671350.cms,"Picture: Instagram

A travel influencer flying from Seattle to Salt Lake City was allegedly warned by a Delta Airlines crew member to silence her or risk being deboarded from the plane, reported New York Post.Janelle Rupkalvis, who was traveling with her partner and their four-year-old cat, Asparagus, shared her experience in a TikTok video that quickly gained attention.Rupkalvis, 30, said the incident happened on February 19, shortly after they settled into their first-class seats. Expecting a routine reminder to keep Asparagus in his carrier, she said she was instead shocked when the flight attendant reportedly said, “If your cat doesn’t stop meowing, we’re gonna have to ask you to get off the plane.”She said she explained that Asparagus wasn’t being disruptive but was simply meowing due to the commotion in the cabin. “He’s a cat. He’s not screaming—just meowing because it’s a stressful situation,” she said in her TikTok video, which has since been viewed 11,000 times.Knowing that Delta allows pets in carriers under the seat, Rupkalvis decided to confirm the airline’s policy. She texted Delta’s customer service and was told that pets must be “passive” but not necessarily silent—contradicting the flight attendant’s warning.Feeling that the situation caused unnecessary stress, Rupkalvis asked Delta if they would offer any compensation. The airline responded by giving her and her partner a combined 30,000 Delta miles.According to New York Post, Rupkalvis said she was satisfied with the resolution and happy to clear up the misunderstanding about Delta’s pet policy.","Janelle Rupkalvis was flying from Seattle to Salt Lake City with her partner and their four-year-old cat, Asparagus.

Defence secretary Pete Hegseth halts US cyber operations against Russia sparking national security concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/defence-secretary-pete-hegseth-halts-us-cyber-operations-against-russia-sparking-national-security-concerns/articleshow/118670943.cms,"Picture: The New York Times

Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered US Cyber Command to stop all offensive cyber operations against Russia on Sunday, reported The New York Times.The decision is reportedly part of a broader attempt to bring Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiation table regarding Ukraine.Intelligence experts argue that retaining access to Russian networks is vital for understanding Putin’s strategies and tracking internal Russian discussions about Ukraine. Former officials say it is not unusual to pause military operations during sensitive diplomatic negotiations to prevent disruptions.However, the order has sparked criticism, with concerns over national security and Russian cyber threats. Critics say halting cyber operations against Russia is a risky move. It assumes Putin will reciprocate by scaling back Russia’s cyber activities against the US and its allies.Russia has long been accused of cyber warfare, including interference in US elections, ransomware attacks, and sabotage efforts across Europe. In the past year, Russian-linked cybercriminals have been blamed for attacks on US hospitals and infrastructure.European nations rely on US cyber support to counter these threats, but with this policy shift, they may need to depend more on Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and Canadian intelligence.Meanwhile, the Trump administration has been rolling back efforts to counter Russian influence operations, including FBI-led initiatives to monitor propaganda.Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday stressed the importance of bringing Russia to the negotiating table over Ukraine. However, he became defensive when questioned about why the US was easing pressure on Moscow.""If this was a Democrat that was doing this, everyone would be saying, well, he's on his way to the Nobel Peace Prize,"" Rubio said. ""This is absurd. We are trying to end a war. You cannot end a war unless both sides come to the table, starting with the Russians, and that is the point the president has made. And we have to do whatever we can to try to bring them to the table to see if it's even possible,"" he added.",Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered US Cyber Command to stop all offensive cyber operations against Russia on Sunday.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed gratitude to US President Donald Trump on Sunday for sending munitions that were previously delayed by the Biden administration.He said the weapons would help Israel in its fight against Iran and its allied militant groups, including Hamas.Netanyahu described Trump as ""the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House."" In a video statement, he said, ""He's shown it by sending us all the munitions that were being held up. This way he is giving Israel the tools we need to finish the job against Iran's terror axis.""He made similar remarks last month during a news conference with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, saying that Israel had already dealt a ""mighty blow"" to Iran’s network of militant groups since the Gaza war began in October 2023. He referred to organisations like Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, which Iran calls its ""axis of resistance.""Trump, who returned to office in January, has reinstated his ""maximum pressure"" policy against Iran, similar to his first-term approach. The US president has also demonstrated strong support for Israel by inviting Netanyahu as the first foreign leader to visit the White House after his return.On Saturday, Rubio announced he had signed a declaration to speed up the delivery of $4 billion in military assistance to Israel. He also confirmed that a partial arms embargo imposed under former President Joe Biden had been lifted.","Netanyahu described Trump as ""the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House"" He said the weapons would help Israel in its fight against Iran and its allied militant groups, including Hamas.

President Trump has rescinded Biden-era limits on counterterrorism drone strikes and commando raids outside conventional war zones, reverting to the looser set of rules he used in his first term, according to officials familiar with the matter. Under restrictions imposed by the Biden administration, US military and CIA drone operators generally had to obtain permission from the White House to target a suspected militant outside a conventional war zone.Now commanders in the field will again have greater latitude to decide for themselves whether to carry out a strike. The relaxation of the rules suggests that the US is likely to more frequently carry out airstrikes aimed at killing terrorism suspects in poorly governed places that are not deemed traditional battlefield zones, like Somalia and Yemen. It also means there may be greater risk to civilians. The Trump administration did not formally announce the change, elements of which were reported earlier by CBS News.",US military and CIA drone operators generally had to obtain permission from the White House to target a suspected militant outside a conventional war zone.

(With inputs from AP and NYT)

CAPE CANAVERAL: A private lunar lander carrying a drill, vacuum and other experiments for Nasa touched down on the moon Sunday, the latest in a string of companies looking to kickstart business on Earth's celestial neighbour ahead of astronaut missions.Firefly Aerospace 's Blue Ghost lander descended from lunar orbit on autopilot, aiming for the slopes of an ancient volcanic dome in an impact basin on the moon's northeastern edge of the near side.Confirmation of touchdown came from the company's Mission Control outside Austin, Texas. ""You all stuck the landing,"" Will Coogan, the Blue Ghost chief engineer, said during a livestream from the flight operations room. ""We're on the moon."" A few minutes later, Jason Kim, the chief executive of Firefly, declared, ""We got some moon dust on our boots.""A smooth, upright landing makes Firefly - a startup founded a decade ago - the first private outfit to put a spacecraft on the moon without crashing or falling over. Even countries have faltered, with only five claiming success: Russia, the US, China, India and Japan.Two other companies' landers are hot on Blue Ghost's heels, with the next one by Houston-based Intuitive Machines expected to join it on the moon Thursday. A third from Japanese company ispace is still three months from landing.Launched in mid-Jan from Florida, the 6-foot-6 tall lander carried 10 experiments to the moon for Nasa. The space agency paid $101 million for the delivery, plus $44 million for the science and tech on board. It's the third mission under Nasa's commercial lunar delivery programme, intended to ignite a lunar economy of competing private businesses while scouting around before astronauts show up later this decade. The demos should get two weeks of run time, before lunar daytime ends and the lander shuts down.It carried a vacuum to suck up moon dirt for analysis and a drill to measure temperature as deep as 10 feet below the surface. Also on board: a device for eliminating abrasive lunar dust - a scourge for Nasa's long-ago Apollo moonwalkers, who got it caked all over their spacesuits and equipment. On its way to the moon, Blue Ghost beamed back exquisite pictures of Earth. It continued to stun once in orbit around the moon, with detailed shots of the surface. At the same time, an on-board receiver acquired signals from the US GPS and European Galileo constellations, an encouraging step forward in navigation for future explorers. The landing set the stage for a fresh crush of visitors angling for a piece of lunar business.","Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander descended from lunar orbit on autopilot, aiming for the slopes of an ancient volcanic dome.

Musk vs. the establishment

A high-stakes battle for power?

Elon Musk is no stranger to controversy, but his latest revelations on Joe Rogan’s podcast sent shockwaves through political and tech circles. With an air of defiance, Musk accused some of the world’s most powerful figures—Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman—of desperately trying to suppress the release of Jeffrey Epstein’s infamous client list.“Known Epstein clients who are obviously extremely powerful – powerful politically and very wealthy – are Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, and Reid Hoffman. And some others, too. But those three,” Musk declared, his voice steady but brimming with implication.His claims came shortly after Attorney General Pam Bondi’s “first phase” release of Epstein-related documents. But instead of the bombshell revelations many expected, the files offered little new information—leading to whispers of a cover-up. Among MAGA circles, frustration boiled over, with conspiracy theories swirling that the real truth was still being kept from the public.Musk didn’t stop there. He pointed directly at Hoffman, alleging that the tech billionaire was not only a key Democratic donor but had also funded columnist E. Jean Carroll’s lawsuit against Donald Trump.“That lawsuit was funded by Reid Hoffman, who is a major Dem donor and also an Epstein client,” Musk said bluntly, suggesting that the lawsuit’s true purpose was to keep Trump out of the White House—and to ensure Epstein’s secrets remained buried.Hoffman’s ties to Epstein have been a subject of speculation for years, and Musk fanned the flames, alleging that billionaires like him were working behind the scenes to control the narrative.This isn’t the first time Musk has hinted at something bigger lurking beneath the surface. In an interview with Tucker Carlson, he suggested that Hoffman was part of the elite circle backing Kamala Harris—billionaires who were, in Musk’s words, “terrified” of what might come to light if Epstein’s files were fully unsealed.While no concrete evidence has emerged to support Musk’s claims, the allegations—true or not—have thrown fuel onto an already raging fire. The Epstein saga remains one of the most mysterious and politically explosive scandals of the decade, and with Musk stepping into the fray, it’s far from over.","Elon Musk accused Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman of trying to suppress the release of Jeffrey Epstein’s infamous client list.

Tulsi Gabbard rips Europe’s ‘double standard’ after explosive Trump-Zelenskyy meeting: ‘They don’t stand for freedom’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tulsi-gabbard-rips-europes-double-standard-after-explosive-trump-zelenskyy-meeting-they-dont-stand-for-freedom/articleshow/118668319.cms,"A storm is brewing between the US and its European allies following a heated confrontation at the White House between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The fallout has exposed deep rifts over the future of the war, with Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard accusing Europe of straying from core American values of freedom and peace.Gabbard didn’t hold back in her interview on Fox News Sunday, slamming European nations for what she called their hypocrisy in supporting Ukraine’s prolonged war while claiming to stand for democracy. ""There's something fundamentally deeper here that shows a huge difference and divergence between the values that President Trump and Vice President Vance are fighting for… versus those of many of these European countries who are coming to Zelenskyy’s side,"" she declared. ""They claim to champion freedom, but their actions tell a different story.""The White House meeting turned into a diplomatic standoff. Trump, reportedly frustrated with Zelenskyy’s posture, delivered an ultimatum: ""You're either going to make a deal, or we're out. And if we're out, you'll fight it out. But you don’t have the cards."" Vice President JD Vance pressed Zelenskyy on whether he was grateful for the billions in US aid—implying that continued support was not guaranteed.As tensions escalated, Trump abruptly ended the meeting, leaving Zelenskyy to seek support elsewhere. The Ukrainian leader wasted no time, jetting to the UK, where Prime Minister Keir Starmer embraced him, signaling that Britain and France were now leading the charge on a peace proposal . European leaders gathered in London on Sunday, determined to move forward without waiting for Washington’s blessing.Gabbard seized on the moment, calling out what she saw as a stark contrast between the US and its European allies. ""They are standing against Putin, obviously. But what are they actually fighting for? Are they truly aligned with the values of democracy and freedom, or are they just prolonging this war for their own interests?"" she asked.She pointed to troubling signs of authoritarianism within Ukraine, citing crackdowns on political opposition, media control, and canceled elections. ""The reality in Ukraine is the exact opposite of what they claim to be fighting for,"" she asserted. ""And Europe is enabling it.""Meanwhile, behind closed doors, Trump’s team was reportedly pushing for a deal granting the US access to Ukraine’s vast mineral resources in exchange for continued support. Zelenskyy, however, was resistant—adding another layer of friction to an already explosive meeting.Zelenskyy addressed the controversy in an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier, sidestepping direct criticism of Trump but making it clear he was not about to apologize. ""I'm very thankful to Americans for all your support,"" he said, before adding, ""I respect the president, and I respect the American people … I think we have to be very open and very honest, and I'm not sure that we did something bad.""",Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard slammed European nations for supporting Ukraine's prolonged war.

"Elon Musk's internet: So based, much wow. So cringe?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musks-internet-so-based-much-wow-so-cringe/articleshow/118668256.cms,"Elon Musk

SAN FRANCISCO: In 2010, a woman in Sakura, Japan, posted photos of her well-manicured Shiba Inu to her digital journal. The dog, Kabosu , shot her owner a wide-eyed glance, a comic image that quickly jumped from Tumblr to Twitter to Facebook and to the rest of the internet.A meme legend was born. Someone on Reddit called the dog ""DOGE,"" a nonsensical nickname that stuck. Another minted a cryptocurrency in DOGE's name.Now, 15 years later, in the fast churn of internet culture, DOGE is considered very old. But try telling that to Elon Musk , who has co-opted ""DOGE"" for the name of his effort to gut the machinery of the federal government -- more formally, the Department of Government Efficiency.It is one of dozens of old-internet ephemera that are baked into his everyday vocabulary. A brief scroll through Musk's X feed reveals a menagerie of aging memes and lingo -- dad jokes for the very online. They include:-- Frequent references to ""420,"" a half-century-old slang term for smoking marijuana said to have started in a high school in Northern California. (After smoking what looked like a blunt live on the Joe Rogan podcast, Musk briefly changed his Twitter bio to ""420."")-- Regularly including the number ""69,"" a slang term for a sex act that has been around since at least the Kama Sutra. (Musk, who is 53 years old, is quick to point out that his birthday falls 69 days after 4/20.)-- Calling things that he supports ""epic"" or ""based."" These are adjectives favored by frequent users of Reddit and popularized by fans of Joss Whedon, a director who created the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer "" television series in the late 1990s and went on to direct two of the Avengers movies. (Musk has said he wants to create ""based"" artificial intelligence with his chatbot, Grok, and recently told Tesla investors he expected an ""epic"" 2026 ahead for the company.)Musk's slang may seem inscrutable to people who aren't steeped in online culture. But to his fans, Musk's dated sensibilities are a kind of internet comfort food -- and a nod to a shared, aggrieved worldview.Musk's posts are full of the language of warfare and conquest portrayed in video games. That loaded language is a rallying cry for gamers and others from Musk's very online world who -- if they have a common political ideology -- see in him someone who shares their skepticism of authority and their belief that America has gone too ""woke."" To them, Musk's online updates about what DOGE is up to come across as far more honest than a press release or news conference or -- worst of all -- something they read in the mainstream media. (It's a strategy that recalls Donald Trump's use of Twitter to signal authenticity during his first administration.)""We're living in the revenge of the nerds era,"" Hasan Piker, a popular, politically progressive online personality who is not a fan of Musk, said in an interview. ""This is the real, actual revenge of the nerds.""Musk did not respond to a request for comment.Every photo of Musk wielding a chain saw while wearing ""deal with it"" sunglasses indoors (another meme) represents a triumph of the nerd culture he has long identified with. On Wednesday, he attended the first meeting of President Donald Trump's new Cabinet wearing a T-shirt that said ""Tech Support.""His fans speak back to him in his language. They send suggestions on how DOGE can fix the government by dismantling entire sections of it, often coded in the language of images typically found on Reddit. (Wojak, a crudely drawn character popularized on message board 4chan, is a perennial favorite.)Musk prods his more than 200 million X followers for help with decisions in online polls. And he listens. The conversation becomes a feedback loop of insider jokes for the billionaire, who once hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" and prides himself on his sense of humor.""Anyone can find their own community, even if it's a community frozen in 2010,"" Brian Feldman, an internet culture writer who has long followed Musk's exploits, said in an interview.But to those steeped in modern internet culture, Musk's communication style is far from on trend. That is especially so when even current terms like ""no cap"" (translation: no lie) or ""lowkey fell off"" (waned in popularity or relevance) are already showing their age. As with recent questions about Musk's claims of superior video game skills, they see cracks in his supernerd facade.""More than people would like to admit, they often become trapped in the internet they first encounter,"" Feldman said.Last week, Musk appeared at a conservative political conference wearing dark sunglasses, a big gold chain and a T-shirt that said he was ""not procrastinating"" but instead working on ""side quests"" (a common practice in sprawling role-playing games). He played off the quote from Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita that Robert Oppenheimer said was going through his mind as he tested the first atomic bomb: ""Now, I am become Death. The destroyer of worlds.""""I am become meme,"" Musk said to a mostly mute crowd. ""There's living the dream, and there's living the meme, and that's pretty much what's happening.""Even some of his most fervent followers on X recoiled. ""Elon Musk fell off lowkey,"" one user wrote.Musk's online vocabulary is a reminder of 2010, when nerd culture was ascendant. Reddit was a meme factory for favorites like Lolcats and icanhazcheeseburger. Gamers gathered in web forums or on online role-playing games to hang out and fight through digital dungeons.This was also the beginning of Musk's metamorphosis from mere billionaire to internet celebrity. That year, he appeared as himself in the second ""Iron Man"" film. His online fans ate it up.All of this also coincided with the rise of Web 2.0, a more social version of the internet. Twitter -- long before Musk bought it and renamed it -- was a town square. Facebook moved beyond likes and status updates with "" Groups ,"" a feature that allowed people to form their own smaller communities. Chat forum 4chan was full of anonymous, often angry online trolls who bonded over vulgar behavior.While online groups had existed for years, the newer social networks were more tightly knit and rewarded the behavior that Musk often displays today. The right kind of posts could pick up steam and shoot across the internet.Provocateurs moved beyond small-scale trolling to aggressive mass movements, such as Gamergate, a targeted harassment campaign against a female game designer by video game players who claimed she represented a lack of ethics in games journalism. It morphed into a social movement that fought diversity, feminism and what gamers saw as overly progressive values in film, television, literature and the video game industry -- a viewpoint that Musk shares.Gamergate also signaled that digital demonstrations could, for better or worse, lead to real-world change.Musk's tweeting style changed from anodyne company updates to more overt trolling. In 2018, he tweeted that he had secured a buyout offer for Tesla for a stock price of $420. Once, when a competing car company tried undercutting him on price, Musk said that he would drop the cost of his Tesla Model X to $69,420.""The gauntlet has been thrown down!"" he proclaimed on Twitter. ""The prophecy has been fulfilled.""Unlike other tech billionaires, who seemed to live lives far removed from regular internet folk and became less online the richer they got, Musk was making himself relatable with memes, absurdity and relentless posting. And parts of the online world embraced him.""Many people find him off-putting, I think,"" coldhealing, a pseudonymous cultural commentator who regularly follows Musk and other social movements online, said in an interview. ""But there are many people who he resonates with, and even though I think it's 10% of the population max, it's an influential 10%.""Musk's online life became even more bombastic after the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. He attacked Tesla short-sellers and California state officials who wouldn't let him reopen a Tesla factory. In 2023, he even live-tweeted photos of himself driving to Mark Zuckerberg's house, threatening to wrestle the CEO of Facebook. (They were, at the time, in the throes of organizing a real fighting match between them. It never happened.)He posted himself playing video games such as Elden Ring, Path of Exile and Diablo IV. One of the world's wealthiest men was telling gamers that he was one of them.Mark Kern, a former video game executive at Blizzard, wrote in a post to X in February that people should not mess with gamers. ""We're forged by endless boss battles against impossible odds. We do not give up. We do not stop. We are the terminators of the culture war.""""Yes,"" Musk wrote, quoting the post.Conservatives who don't spend a lot of time online have also embraced the image of Musk taking a chain saw to what they see as a bloated federal government, even if many of them aren't exactly sure what he's trying to say or when they're supposed to laugh.""It's validation from people who have no idea what he's saying but still think he's speaking this expert language,"" said Feldman, the internet culture writer.But Musk may be finding his online limits. It was difficult for some of his followers to shake off his stage appearance in February at the Conservative Political Action Conference, which reminded them that it is hard to stay cool when you are, in fact, not very young. (Kabosu did not live to see the meme she inspired enter American political life. The 18-year-old Shiba Inu died last year.)""Anyone else feel the vibe-shift in tpot/tech?"" one X user wrote, referring to an online community called ""This Part of Twitter,"" which is largely composed of tech workers who have historically warmed to Musk. In other words, Musk was starting to look a little out of touch and increasingly unpopular.Nonetheless, Musk seems to be doubling down. His posting to X has increased in recent weeks, some days numbering in the hundreds.And he is still being validated by his fans.On Thursday, Musk posted another meme to his X account -- one of dozens of posts he had made that morning. In it was a photo of Mel Gibson as Mad Max in ""The Road Warrior,"" the early 1980s action thriller about a shotgun-toting nomad navigating a postapocalyptic world. In bold lettering, the meme said: ""Ladies, it's time to start thinking whether the guy you're dating has postapocalyptic warlord potential."" (Film buffs may note that Max's wife and son were killed by a biker gang in the first ""Mad Max"" film.)One follower replied with a photo of a man wearing a Trojan helmet and body armor with an assault rifle in one hand and a spear in the other. It was one of more than 7,000 replies.""Yup,"" the follower said, adding a fire emoji.","Elon Musk has co-opted ""DOGE"" for the name of his effort to gut the federal government. It is one of dozens of old-internet ephemera that are baked into his everyday vocabulary. To his fans, Musk's dated sensibilities are a kind of internet comfort food.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118668276,imgsize-31866,width-400,resizemode-4/118668276.jpg"

History repeats itself in the Trump era

The gratitude question

Same pattern, different president

A tense Oval Office exchange between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has reignited an old but telling revelation—Trump isn’t the first US commander-in-chief to grow frustrated with the wartime leader. A resurfaced NBC News report from 2022 details a fiery phone call between then-President Joe Biden and Zelenskyy, in which Biden allegedly lost his temper, demanding that Ukraine “show a little more gratitude.”The June 2022 call, made just months after Russia’s full-scale invasion, reportedly turned sour after Biden informed Zelenskyy of another $1 billion in US military aid. Instead of expressing thanks, Zelenskyy immediately began listing more requests—prompting Biden to raise his voice.“The American people were being quite generous,” Biden reportedly snapped. “Zelenskyy could show a little more gratitude.”The report, published in November 2022, underscores a recurring theme in US-Ukraine relations: the growing impatience of American leaders who, despite pouring billions into Ukraine’s war effort, have found Zelenskyy’s approach increasingly grating.Fast-forward to 2025, and Trump’s handling of Zelenskyy’s latest White House visit appears to be history repeating itself—only this time, the confrontation happened in person. In a dramatic meeting that ended with Zelenskyy being asked to leave, Trump and Vice President JD Vance took turns pressing the Ukrainian leader on his attitude toward US assistance.“Have you said thank you once this entire meeting?” Vance challenged Zelenskyy, calling out his past visit to Pennsylvania to campaign for Trump’s political opponents.Tensions escalated further when Trump accused Zelenskyy of “gambling with World War III” and warned that Ukraine must “make a deal” or risk losing US support. The confrontation ended with a visibly frustrated Trump canceling a scheduled press conference with Zelenskyy and scrapping a separate DC, speaking engagement for the Ukrainian president.Zelenskyy, facing mounting pressure to acknowledge US support more explicitly, later addressed the controversy in an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier. While he expressed appreciation for American aid, he stopped short of offering an apology.“No, I respect the president and I respect the American people,” Zelenskyy stated when pressed on whether he owed Trump an apology.Meanwhile, European leaders, sensing a shift in US support, have begun stepping up their own diplomatic efforts. Over the weekend, Zelenskyy met with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss a new peace initiative, with France and the UK now taking the lead in brokering a deal.As Zelenskyy navigates yet another strained relationship with a US president, one thing is clear: whether it’s Biden or Trump, the world’s most powerful leaders are growing weary of what they see as Ukraine’s endless demands. And with Trump now in office, the consequences of that frustration could be far more immediate—and severe.","A resurfaced NBC News report from 2022 details a fiery phone call between then- President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Comedian Mike Myers sent a clear message during his surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live, sporting a bold T-shirt reading “Canada is not for sale” amid US President Donald Trump’s repeated quips about making Canada the 51st state.The Scarborough-born actor appeared in the show’s closing scene alongside host Shane Gillis and Canadian singer-songwriter Tate McRae, his attire seemingly responding to Trump’s remarks and tariff threats against Canada.Earlier in the episode, Myers made an unexpected cameo, portraying Elon Musk in a satirical re-enactment of the recent tense Oval Office meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

ISLAMABAD: At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque of an Islamic religious school known as the “university of jihad” in Nowshera district of Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province on Friday.Among the dead were Maulana Hamid-ul-Haq Haqqani , head of Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania school, the seminary in Nowshera’s Akora Khattak town where key Afghan Taliban leaders have studied. Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place. They said the casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.Haqqani, the son of slain prominent Pakistani cleric Sami-ul-Haq Haqqani, known as the “father of Taliban, was a vice-chancellor of the sprawling seminary, located 60 km from the provincial capital of Peshawar. Following his father’s assassination in 2018, he also became chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sami (JUI-S) political party. He had also previously served as a member of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007.Haq was also among the few who called on the world and Pakistan to immediately recognise the Taliban govt and establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul in 2021.Last year, he led a delegation of religious scholars to Afghanistan for “religious diplomacy” meetings with Taliban leaders.His seminary had faced controversy in the past as its students were accused of involvement in the assassination of Pakistan’s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. The madrasa, however, denied any connection with the suspects.","At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque.

China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong , marking the first time a foreign national will be aboard the facility.The deal was signed in a ceremony held in Islamabad on Friday, between the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) and Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO). Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was alos present during the ceremony.According to a statement by CMSA, both nations will collaborate on selecting and training Pakistani astronauts, with the chosen candidate expected to join Chinese taikonauts for a short-term mission in the coming years.""This signifies a major step in China’s international space cooperation ,"" reported Global Times, highlighting the growing partnership between Beijing and Islamabad in aerospace advancements.China’s space station, which has been operational for nearly four years, was built after the country was reportedly excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns over the involvement of China’s military in its space programme.The station is also seen as a new frontier of competition between China and the US.As per the news agency PTI, the agreement further solidifies China’s support for Pakistan’s space ambitions, following previous collaborations such as the launch of Pakistani satellites.Pakistan’s first digital communications satellite, Badr-1, was launched aboard a Chinese Long March 2E rocket in 1990, while earlier this year, Pakistan’s CubeSat accompanied China’s Chang’e-6 probe to the Moon.According to Global Times, the selection of the astronaut is expected to take around a year, after which the candidate will undergo intensive training in China. This move, experts say, demonstrates the reliability of China's manned space technology and its willingness to lower barriers for developing countries to participate in space exploration .China has also set ambitious goals for space exploration, with plans to land astronauts on the Moon before 2030.Meanwhile, the US has its sights set on returning to the lunar surface by 2025.","China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong.

Following his father's tragic death, he assumed the roles of vice chancellor at Jamia Darul Uloon Haqqania and chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (Sami).The madressah was established by Islamic scholar Maulana Abdul Haq Haqqani in September 1947, according to the institution's website.Previously, the Madrassa faced scrutiny when its students were alleged to be involved in former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's assassination. However, the madrassa has consistently denied any links to the suspects.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif issued a firm condemnation of the incident and offered prayers for Maulana Haq and other casualties' recovery, as stated by the Prime Minister's Office.He instructed authorities to provide excellent medical care to the wounded individuals and requested a detailed incident report.""Such cowardly and heinous acts of terrorism cannot dampen our resolve against terrorism,"" the PM said.

Clock running out for refugees in Islamabad, Rawalpindi



'We've worked with the Americans for years'



Kabul, Islamabad row amid rising crackdown



Forced to move after decades in Pakistan



UN says Pakistan has a tradition of protecting Afghans

A woman who we will call Fatima fled Afghanistan with her family in December 2021. She had worked for an American non-profit organization in Kabul ­until the US pullout in the summer of 2021, when the Taliban retook control of the country.She is now based in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. And she is in trouble. Her Pakistani visa is days away from expiring, and the authorities are still processing her renewal application.""I am concerned about the renewal of my visa, and if not renewed timely authorities would arrest me and my family for illegally residing in the country,"" Fatima told DW.Police, including female officers, recently conducted a raid on a building where Fatima lives, looking for undocumented Afghan refugees. She was not in the building at the time, but her brother ended up in custody.""Later, we showed them our visa renewal application receipts and proof but police did not cooperate,"" said Fatima, who is now hiding from the authorities.In 2023, Pakistan started a massive initiative to repatriate approximately 4 million Afghans who have entered the country over the past 40 years. And while the authorities granted some leeway last year, Pakistan's government has now set a March 31 deadline to expel foreign nationals residing in the country illegally, with search operations ongoing in January and February.Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi ""have been verbally asked to leave Pakistan till 28th February,"" Umer Gillani, a legal expert and rights activist, told DW.Moniza Kakar, a lawyer working for refugees advocacy in Pakistan, said there was ""uncertainty and fear"" among the Afghani nationals in the area.""Since the start of this year, over 1,000 Afghans have been detained in Islamabad, and more than 18,000 have been forced to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi because of government orders,"" she said.Amin, 28, is from Kabul. He spent years collaborating with the United States in the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan, before he too had to flee across the Pakistani border.Hee said he was just days away from being evacuated to America, but this was put on hold last month with President Donald Trump signing an executive order to suspend a refugee resettlement program.Nearly 20,000 Afghans are presently waiting in Pakistan for approval to resettle in the US through an American government program.""We've worked with the Americans for years, we helped and supported them in Afghanistan, we have given them a part of our lives and they have to support us so that we can live peacefully,"" Amin told DW.Over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with neighboring Afghanistan has deteriorated. Islamabad holds the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan responsible for their inability to control the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions with the Taliban regime escalate, concerns were also raised about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan amid reports of purported intimidation and arrests. The UN special rapporteur has expressed his worries, stating that Afghans in the area deserve more humane treatment.Activist Gilani said millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan are being used as ""hostages to build pressure whenever there is tension between the two countries.""Last week, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry dismissed claims made by the Afghan representation regarding the mistreatment of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, labeling these allegations as ""misplaced"" and urging Kabul to facilitate the smooth repatriation of Afghan citizens.Pakistan has accommodated hundreds of thousands of refugees from its northern neighbor, a situation resulting from decades of regional instability. Afghans who arrived in Pakistan following the Taliban takeover in August 2021 have been relying on visa renewals to stay in the country, a procedure that is costly, uncertain and often subject to significant delays.""The stories of refugees are devastating. Families who have lived in Pakistan for years, even decades, are now being uprooted due to tensions between the two countries. Children, women, and men who have already suffered so much are being treated as if they don't matter. This is not just a refugee crisis, it's a humanitarian crisis,"" said Kakar.UNHCR's top representative in Pakistan, Philippa Candler, told DW that Pakistan already repatriated over 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year.""As of December 2024, Pakistan hosted over 2.8 million Afghans with 69% of refugees living outside refugee villages,"" she said.Candler acknowledged Pakistan's generosity in hosting Afghan refugees for decades, and the current ""economic and security challenges"" in Pakistan that drive the repatriation efforts.At the same time, UNHCR was urging the Islamabad government to ""see the situation of Afghans through a humanitarian perspective"" and ""continue its long-standing tradition of protecting vulnerable Afghans […] regardless of their status.""""It's essential that we work hand-in-hand with both host countries and countries of origin to develop mechanisms that empower refugees to rebuild their lives in safety and dignity, including voluntary repatriation,"" she said.""We are calling for dialogue between the two countries, and for the refugee issue to be separated from political matters.""","Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi are in trouble.

"Under pressure from Donald Trump, NYC ends $220 million sweetheart deal with Pakistan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/under-pressure-from-donald-trump-nyc-ends-220-million-sweetheart-deal-with-pakistan/articleshow/118537188.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington:

New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter following a prolonged MAGA meltdown over use of American taxpayer money to facilitate immigration to the US.Under pressure from the federal government and MAGA hardliners, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who gravitated to the Trump orbit after facing corruption charges from the Biden administration, announced closure of the site that is said to have housed tens of thousands of migrants in its 1025 rooms at $ 200 a night.The site opened in May 2023 to serve as both a new arrivals center and shelter for asylum seekers under a three-year $ 220 million deal with government-run Pakistan International Airlines, which owns the hotel, having bought out a Saudi stake in it for $ 36.4million in 2005.At peak traffic in 2023 when around 4000 migrants were arriving in the city each week, the sight of asylum seekers camping outside the hotel waiting to be processed triggered MAGA hardliners and even some New Yorkers, as Trump and his supporters complained about Democrats housing ""illegal immigrants"" in ""luxury hotels"" at the expense of US taxpayers.""A taxpayer-funded hotel for illegal migrants is owned by the Pakistani government, which means NYC taxpayers are effectively paying a foreign government to house illegals in our own country. This is nuts,"" Trump acolyte and MAGA major Vivel Ramaswamy had raged.Trump himself, lately exercised over a $ 21 million USAID allocation for a voter turnout program in India, had highlighted the purported scam saying the Biden administration had paid $ 59 million to an unspecified hotel in New York City to house illegal immigrants. Standing beside him, Musk had added that the city was paying double the normal rate for the room.Following the Trump victory, his new administration cited concerns about criminal activity at the hotel for freezing $80 million in FEMA funds to the city, by which time Pakistan had already raked in tens of millions of dollars.""FEMA was funding the Roosevelt Hotel that serves as a Tren de Aragua base of operations and was used to house Laken Riley's killer. There will not be a single penny spent that goes against the interest and safety of the American people,"" the homeland security department said, referring to the Venezuelan criminal gang, now declared a foreign terrorist organisation, said to be involved in the murder of an American nursing student.",New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter.

IMF to begin discussions on Pakistan's request for climate resilience loan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-to-begin-discussions-on-pakistans-request-for-climate-resilience-loan/articleshow/118528621.cms,"A technical mission from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will begin discussions on Monday on Pakistan's request for a loan on climate resilience, a media report said. This will be followed by a policy review early next week to assess the authorities' performance under the ongoing USD 7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF), Dawn News reported.Pakistan had requested USD 1 billion to address the impact of climate change. The technical team will mainly engage with key ministries, including planning, finance, climate change, petroleum, water resources, the Federal Board of Revenue, disaster management agencies, and provincial governments.Without going into specifics, the IMF resident representative in Islamabad, Mahir Binici, confirmed the engagements spanning over three weeks from now.""An IMF staff team is scheduled to visit Pakistan in early to mid-March for discussions around the first review under Pakistan's Extended Fund Facility-supported programme and the authorities' request for assistance under a Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) arrangement. In this regard, a technical team will be in Pakistan starting in late February to discuss technical issues related to a possible RSF arrangement,"" he said.Official sources said the relevant authorities, particularly the ministries of planning and finance, had prepared documentation for the Climate-Related Public Investment Management Assessment (C-PIMA) for coming budgets in line with policy advice of the IMF and the World Bank.Talking about the first biannual review of the 39-month EFF, the sources said Pakistan had completed all but one structural benchmark as of now. However, Pakistan missed several indicative targets given the changing domestic and international macroeconomic conditions.The only outstanding benchmark pertains to the required amendments to the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) by the end of December. However, other sub-conditions of these entities regarding governance structure and financial safeguards have already been met.The funding under RSF is made available to nations who commit high-quality reforms to build resilience against climate catastrophes through adaptation and is repayable over 30 years, including a 10-year grace period and is normally cheaper than EFF terms.In October last year, Pakistan formally requested the IMF to top up its USD 7 billion EFF with another USD 1.2 billion RSF.The Fund had already advised Pakistan to invest 1 per cent of GDP per year (over Rs 1.24 trillion at the current year's estimate) in climate resilience and adaptation reforms to be ready to fight repeated and increasing cycles of extreme weather conditions, particularly floods and sustain economic growth and reverse inequalities.Such an investment in climate-adaptive infrastructure can reduce the negative growth impact of a natural disaster shock by one-third while ensuring a quicker and more complete recovery, the IMF suggested.The IMF noted that about 1 per cent of GDP investment in adaptation infrastructure would increase Pakistan's climate resilience and buffer climate shocks.These investments would reduce the growth impact of a natural disaster shock by about a third and return Pakistan to its previous GDP level more quickly.According to the IMF, Pakistan's living standards have been declining for decades, and despite a similar starting point in the early 1980s, Pakistanis' incomes had stagnated and fallen behind regional peers.At the same time, poverty rates remained elevated, and social development indicators also lagged behind those of peers.This had been accompanied by weak human capital outcomes, low fiscal capacity, protection for favoured industries, and a large state footprint. Contributions to growth from human capital and efficiency gains were low, and health and education indicators, while improving in recent years, still lag behind regional and lower-middle-income peers. Human capital spending as a share of GDP has steadily declined.The consequences of these structural weaknesses have been exacerbated by increasingly high climate vulnerability.""Pakistan's climate faces a rate of warming significantly higher than the global average. This will bring increasingly greater climate variability and extreme events, including reduced water availability, more severe and longer droughts, accelerated glacial melt, more variable and intense monsoons accompanied by floods and landslides, and sea-level rise encroaching on coastal settlements and infrastructure,"" it said.The negative macroeconomic consequences of such a shift have already been felt. Climate and weather-related disasters, which have increasingly been exacerbated by climate change, resulted in USD 29.3 billion in economic losses over 1992-2021, equivalent to 11.1 per cent of 2020 GDP, which slowed developmental gains.More recently, the floods of 2022 killed 1,700 people, displaced eight million, increased the poverty rate by up to four percentage points, and brought economic losses equivalent to 4.8 per cent of FY22 GDP, with reconstruction needs estimated at 1.6 times the budgeted national development expenditure of FY23.The disaster was exacerbated by Pakistan's weak urban planning, infrastructure and water resource management, according to Dawn.","Pakistan had requested USD 1 billion to address the impact of climate change.

"No passengers, no planes: China-funded $240m Gwadar airport sits idle",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-passengers-no-planes-china-funded-240m-gwadar-airport-sits-idle/articleshow/118512631.cms,"Gwadar airport in Pakistan (Pic credit: AP)

With no passengers and no planes, Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport is a bit of a mystery. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million, it's anyone's guess when New Gwadar International Airport will open for business. Located in the coastal city of Gwadar and completed in Oct 2024, its a stark contrast to the impoverished, restive southwestern Balochistan province around it.For the past decade, China has poured money into Balochistan and Gwadar as part of a multibillion dollar project that connects its western Xinjiang province with Arabian Sea, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC.Authorities have hailed it as transformational but there's scant evidence of change in Gwadar. The city isn't connected to the national grid - electricity comes from Iran or solar panels - and there isn't enough clean water. An airport with a 400,000 passenger capacity isn't a priority for the city's 90,000 people.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" said Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert who specialises in Pakistan-China ties. ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""CPEC has catalysed a decadeslong insurgency in resource-rich and strategically located Balochistan. Separatists, aggrieved by what they say is state exploitation at the expense of locals, are fighting for independence - targeting Pakistani troops and Chinese workers in the province and elsewhere. Members of Pakistan's ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination by govt and are denied opportunities available elsewhere in the country, charges govt denies.Pakistan, keen to protect China's investments, has stepped up its military footprint in Gwadar to combat dissent. The city is a jumble of checkpoints, barbed wire, troops, barricades, and watchtowers. Roads close at any given time, several days a week, to permit the safe passage of Chinese workers and Pakistani VIPs.Intelligence officers monitor journalists visiting Gwadar. Its fish market is deemed too sensitive for coverage.Many locals are frazzled. ""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" said Khuda Bakhsh Hashim, 76. ""We used to enjoy all-night picnics in the mountains or rural areas. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Hashim recalled when Gwadar was part of Oman, not Pakistan, and was a stop for passenger ships heading to Mumbai. People didn't go hungry and found work easily, he said.But Gwadar's water has dried up because of drought and unchecked exploitation. So has the work. Govt says CPEC has created some 2,000 local jobs but it's not clear whom they mean by ""local"" - Baloch residents or Pakistanis from elsewhere in the country. Authorities did not elaborate.There is a perception Gwadar is dangerous or difficult to visit - only one commercial route operates out of its domestic airport, three times a week to Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. There are no direct flights to Balochistan's provincial capital of Quetta, or national capital of Islamabad.Security concerns delayed the inauguration of the international airport. There were fears the area's mountains - and their proximity to the airport - could be the ideal launchpad for an attack. Instead, PM Shehbaz Sharif and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang hosted a virtual ceremony. The inaugural flight was off limits to media and public.","Gwadar is Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million.

ISLAMABAD: A mob enraged by a local’s murder over a trivial parking dispute snatched the suspect, a watchman, from police and lynched him in the mountainous Galiyat region of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday. Several police officers were wounded in the violence in a neighbourhood under the jurisdiction of Changla Gali police station, around 80km from Islamabad.Police said Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home. When he returned the next day, he got into a fight with the watchman, Khan Zaman, who allegedly stabbed him to death and wounded his brother.As word spread about the murder, a mob milled in the area and burned down five houses in the residential society.Police apprehended the culprit, who was hiding in the basement of a building, and were about to take him away when the mob swooped on him and beat him to death with sticks and stones.Lynchings are common in Pakistan and several instances of mob violence have taken place in the past decade. Many people have been lynched for alleged blasphemy, while mobs have also murdered suspects in street crimes.In June 2024, a suspected robber was lynched by a mob in the southern port city of Karachi. The suspect, armed with a pistol, had attempted to rob a citizen, who put up resistance and was joined by others standing nearby. The mob got hold of the suspect and hit him with blunt weapons, resulting in his death on the spot.In May 2024, another mob lynched a suspected robber in Karachi's Orangi town while police saved his accomplice from being killed.The same month, police rescued a Christian man from angry people, who wanted to lynch him and attacked the homes of other minority members in Punjab’s Sargodha district on charges of alleged blasphemy. Workers at a Sialkot garment factory tortured and burned to death their Sri Lankan general manager in 2023 for alleged blasphemy.","Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home.

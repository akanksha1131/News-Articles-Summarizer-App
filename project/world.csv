Watch: Australia’s first attempt to launch home-made rocket goes up in smoke; comes down 14 seconds after lift-off,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/watch-australias-first-attempt-to-launch-home-made-rocket-goes-up-in-smoke-comes-down-14-seconds-after-lift-off/articleshow/123009540.cms,"Company CEO says 'happy' with results



Australia’s first attempt to launch a home-made rocket into orbit ended in failure on Wednesday.The 23-metre Eris vehicle crashed just 14 seconds after take-off. The rocket rose briefly, gained some thrust, then came crashing down just seconds later.The test flight was carried out by Gilmour Space Technologies . The failed mission took place from a spaceport near Bowen in northern Queensland.Although the rocket cleared the launch tower, it struggled mid-air before disappearing from view. A plume of smoke was seen rising above the site shortly after.Despite the failed attempt to reach orbit, the company described the launch as a milestone.“All four hybrid-propelled engines ignited and the maiden flight included 23 seconds of engine burn time and 14 seconds of flight,” a Gilmour Space spokesperson said in a statement posted on Facebook Gilmour Space is a company that designs and manufactures rockets in Australia. It had aimed to use Eris to carry small satellites into orbit. The launch marked the first time an Australian-designed and built orbital rocket lifted off from within the country.CEO Adam Gilmour remained optimistic. “Of course I would have liked more flight time but happy with this,” he wrote on LinkedIn. In a previous statement made in February, Gilmour noted that it was “almost unheard of” for a private company to succeed on its first orbital launch attempt.The firm had previously said the test would be considered successful if the rocket simply left the ground. According to the company, the launch site infrastructure remained intact.Mayor Ry Collins of the Whitsunday Regional Council also praised the launch, calling it a “huge achievement” even though the rocket failed to reach orbit. “This is an important first step towards the giant leap of a future commercial space industry right here in our region,” he said in a Facebook post.Gilmour Space Technologies is backed by private investors and was recently awarded a 5 million Australian dollar grant by the federal government to support the development of the Eris rocket. This follows a 52 million dollar grant agreement secured in 2023 aimed at boosting the country’s space technology efforts.Australia has seen hundreds of suborbital launches, but only two successful orbital launches have taken place from its soil before. The maiden flight of Eris was the first orbital attempt in over 50 years.No injuries were reported from the incident.","Australia's first attempt to launch a home-made rocket into orbit ended in failure on Wednesday.

Prosecutors said he led her into a back area and forced her to perform oral sex. After the incident, the girl sought help from a passerby, who called the police.Ramalingam represented himself during the trial, which began on January 16. He was convicted on all charges on 7 July.“The fact that she had not run off after the first act of molest, or that she did not resist the assaults, or inform her grandfather, were all to my mind sufficiently explained, particularly given that she was still young and immature,” said Justice Aidan Xu, who found the girl’s account credible and consistent.Ramalingam’s earlier statements to police reportedly included admissions of hugging, kissing, and oral sex. However, he later denied any wrongdoing, claiming he was suffering from erectile dysfunction and that no DNA evidence was found on the victim.The judge ruled that these claims did not undermine the girl’s testimony. “While there was no dispute that Ramalingam suffered from erectile dysfunction, the prosecution’s expert witness gave a cogent explanation that oral rape remained possible,” Justice Xu was quoted as saying to Straits Times.Following sentencing on July 30, Ramalingam said he would appeal and was granted bail of S$80,000. He attempted to negotiate with the judge over the conditions, asking for the removal of his electronic tag and exemption from reporting to the Police Cantonment Complex.

Hack alert: St Paul hit by coordinated digital attack; Minnesota calls in National Guard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hack-alert-st-paul-hit-by-coordinated-digital-attack-minnesota-calls-in-national-guard/articleshow/122989178.cms,"



Minnesota called in the National Guard after a “deliberate, coordinated, digital attack” hit the city of St Paul, severely disrupting public services and forcing a complete shutdown of municipal information systems.St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter confirmed during a press conference on Tuesday that the city had initiated a full shutdown of its information systems as a defensive measure to contain the threat posed by the cyberattack, Reuters reported. The move triggered WiFi outages across city buildings, disrupted services in libraries, and suspended network resources.“While these disruptions are difficult, they are necessary steps to limit exposure, preserve system integrity, and protect sensitive information,” Carter stated.The office of governor Tim Walz said in a statement that the National Guard was being deployed because the scale of the cyberattack had ""exceeded the city's response capacity."" The Guard includes a cyber protection component, which is now supporting local efforts to deal with the crisis.Army Brigadier General Simon Schaefer of the Minnesota National Guard confirmed, “The Minnesota National Guard is providing cyber protection support at the request of the city.”Though the precise nature of the attack has not been disclosed, the pattern bears similarities to ransomware operations, where hackers typically deploy data-scrambling software to paralyse systems until a ransom is paid.Mayor Carter said two firms had been brought in to support the city’s response, although he did not name them. He also confirmed that the city is working closely with the FBI.An FBI spokesperson told Reuters, “We are working with partners and lending our investigative expertise.” The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has referred all questions to the city of St Paul.","Minnesota called in the National Guard after a “deliberate, coordinated, digital attack’ St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter confirmed that the city had initiated a full shutdown of its information systems as a defensive measure.

CMS opt-in system promises convenience- but raises privacy concerns







The Trump administration announced Wednesday a sweeping program allowing Americans to share personal health data and medical records across private tech platforms and health systems. The initiative, backed by more than 60 companies—including Google, Amazon, Apple, UnitedHealth Group, and CVS Health—aims to improve access to patient records and help manage chronic conditions such as diabetes and obesity.It will also feature conversational artificial intelligence for patient support and digital tools like QR codes and medication-tracking apps.During a White House event with industry leaders, President Trump said, as quoted by AP, “For decades America’s health care networks have been overdue for a high tech upgrade… With today’s announcement, we take a major step to bring health care into the digital age.”He emphasised that the new system will address slow, costly, and incompatible current health record systems.Noom, a popular weight-loss and fitness subscription service, is among the companies participating. CEO Geoff Cook explained the system will allow the app to access labs or medical tests from other providers, feeding an AI-driven analysis that could support personalized weight-management plans. He said, “Right now you have a lot of siloed data.”The centers for medicare and medicaid services (CMS), the agency in charge of managing the program, said patient participation is voluntary. Users must opt in to share their data, which CMS said will be kept secure.However, the initiative has drawn criticism from privacy experts. Georgetown law professor Lawrence Gostin warned, “There are enormous ethical and legal concerns… Patients across America should be very worried that their medical records are going to be used in ways that harm them and their families.”Hospitals also see promise in the program. Cleveland Clinic CEO Dr Tomislav Mihaljevic said it will enable doctors to view complete patient histories, improving diagnosis and treatment plans. He added that continuous data from apps, tracking diet and exercise habits, offers insight into a patient’s health outside of the clinic setting: “These apps give us insight about what’s happening with the patient’s health outside of the physician's office. ”Despite these benefits, digital privacy advocates remain worried. Jeffrey Chester of the center for digital democracy criticised the lack of government oversight in health technology, calling the system “an open door for the further use and monetization of sensitive and personal health information.”CMS already holds data on over 140 million Americans. Earlier this month, the agency agreed to share its database, including home addresses, with deportation officials- raising alarms about further expansion of federal access to personal data.","CMS opt-in system promises convenience- but raises privacy concerns.

Virginia city councilman Lee Vogler was left seriously injured on Wednesday after a man, reportedly motivated by personal reasons unrelated to Vogler’s political role, violently attacked him and set him on fire.The 38-year-old was doused in gasoline by the suspect, who had forced his way into Vogler’s office. As Vogler fled outside, yelling for help, the suspect chased him and ignited the flames.The suspect, 29-year-old Shotsie Michael Buck Hayes of Danville, was taken into police custody, and charges are pending. Police have not released further details on how the suspect gained entry to the locked office.The incident occurred at the office of Showcase Magazine, a monthly publication serving southwest Virginia and North Carolina, where Vogler also works as a salesperson and writer. According to magazine owner Andrew Scott Brooks, two employees were inside at the time.Brooks described the terrifying scene, as quoted by AP, “They forced their way into the office, and went to Lee. The next thing, Lee is running through the office covered in gasoline, yelling for our officemate to call 911. The guy chased him outside and set him on fire.”Vogler was immediately flown to a burn unit at a hospital in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.His current condition was not disclosed, and UNC Health declined to comment.The councilmember’s father, Jack Vogler Sr, spoke briefly to AP but did not provide updates on his son’s condition.V ogler has served on the Danville City Council for over 12 years and is currently in his fourth term. He is known for his dedication to the community, having formed a group called Moving Danville Forward to revitalize the city.Brooks said Vogler’s passion lies in serving on the city council and helping residents with their concerns. “He loves when people call them with a concern that he can help them with, and he has been an asset to the community for much of his adult life,” Brooks said.Voogler is survived by his two sons and wife and actively coaches their sports teams.Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin quickly condemned the attack, stating, “Our prayers go out to Danville City Councilman Lee Vogler who was violently attacked at his workplace earlier today. We pray for a swift recovery for Lee and for peace to be on the entire Danville community.”Danville is located about 140 miles north of Charlotte, North Carolina.The investigation remains underway as authorities continue to gather information.","Virginia city councilman Lee Vogler was left seriously injured on Wednesday after a man violently attacked him and set him on fire.

'Defend the homeland': ICE aims to double workforce as immigration crackdown expands; seeks 'heroic Americans' in new campaign,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/defend-the-homeland-ice-aims-to-double-workforce-as-immigration-crackdown-expands-seeks-heroic-americans-in-new-campaign/articleshow/123005583.cms,"Trump administration launches major ICE recruitment drive to hire deportation officers (Image: AP)

What ICE offers and who the new officers are

Training the troops: Multi-year road to full readiness





The Trump administration is launching a new recruiting campaign to attract thousands of deportation officers, lawyers, and investigators as it prepares to massively expand immigration enforcement. Backed by a surge in funding from Congress, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) aims to ramp up deportations to unprecedented levels, and is calling on “brave and heroic Americans” to join the effort to “defend the homeland.”The campaign, introduced late Tuesday, uses imagery reminiscent of World War II recruitment posters, featuring Uncle Sam and phrases like “AMERICA NEEDS YOU.” Photos of President Donald Trump and top homeland security officials are also displayed, with the words “DEFEND THE HOMELAND” across the images, rreported AP.“Your country is calling you to serve at ICE,” said homeland security secretary Kristi Noem in a news release. “This is a defining moment in our nation’s history. Your skills, your experience, and your courage have never been more essential. Together, we must defend the homeland.”This recruitment drive is fueled by a significant budget increase. The recent tax and spending legislation signed by Trump allocates about $170 billion for border security and immigration enforcement over five years.ICE’s budget alone will rise to $76.5 billion, nearly ten times its current annual funding. About $45 billion will expand detention capacity, while nearly $30 billion is earmarked for hiring 10,000 new staff members to help achieve the goal of 1 million deportations annually.Alongside appealing to patriotism, the agency is offering financial incentives such as signing bonuses up to $50,000, overtime opportunities for deportation officers, and benefits including loan repayment or forgiveness options.New hires will include deportation officers tasked with tracking, arresting, and removing individuals deemed ineligible to remain in the US. These officers have become highly visible under the Trump administration, often making arrests at courts, on the streets, and at businesses.Their use of masks during operations has drawn criticism from immigration activists and Democratic lawmakers. The recruitment webpage features a striking image of an armored vehicle with officers in military gear riding on the sides, underscoring the agency’s robust approach.In addition to deportation officers, ICE is seeking criminal investigators and lawyers to prosecute immigration cases. The agency plans to advertise the campaign on college campuses, job fairs, and law enforcement networks starting this week.However, the rapid expansion has raised concerns about maintaining standards and training. Jason Houser, a former ICE chief of staff during the Biden administration, noted that staffing has long been a challenge for the agency.When Trump took office, ICE had about 6,000 officers responsible for monitoring noncitizens and carrying out removals—a number that has not significantly increased despite growing caseloads.Houser warned that a rush to hire could lead to lower recruitment and training standards. He pointed to the early 2000s Border Patrol expansion, where eased standards resulted in increased misconduct among agents. “If they start waiving requirements there like they did for Border Patrol, you’re going to have an exponential increase in officers that are shown the door after three years because there’s some issue,” he said as quoted by AP.Houser also expressed concern about diminished oversight, noting that the Department of Homeland Security has dismantled some agencies responsible for supervising ICE and other branches.He estimated that it would take three to four years to fully hire and train the new staff. Until then, ICE may rely on private contractors, National Guard members, and other federal law enforcement to meet the administration’s goal of 3,000 arrests a day.The administration’s campaign highlights its push to strengthen immigration enforcement through increased personnel and resources, but also underscores challenges related to staffing quality and oversight as the agency prepares for significant growth.This structure begins with the campaign launch and patriotic appeal, then discusses funding, incentives, and recruitment targets. It flows naturally into operational details, concerns raised about rapid expansion, and closes with challenges ahead, making the story easier to follow and more impactful.","The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) aims to ramp up deportations to unprecedented levels.

Kamala Harris Makes A Fiery Comeback; 'Mr. Trump, White House Is Not Yours...' | Watch





Former US Vice President Kamala Harris announced Wednesday that she will not run for California governor in 2026, ending months of speculation about her potential bid for the state’s top office. Her decision opens the door for other opportunities, including a possible presidential run in 2028.“In recent months, I have given serious thought to asking the people of California for the privilege to serve as their Governor. I love this state, its people, and its promise. It is my home. But after deep reflection, I've decided that I will not run for Governor in this election,” Harris said in a statement.The decision may give her more flexibility to pursue a possible presidential run in 2028, though she has not confirmed any plans. She said she will share “more details in the months ahead” about her future.Harris didn’t shy away from addressing the current political climate, highlighting the need for fresh ideas to tackle what she called a “moment of crisis.”“Our politics, our government, and our institutions have too often failed the American people,” she said. “As we look ahead, we must be willing to pursue change through new methods and fresh thinking—committed to our same values and principles, but not bound by the same playbook.”The announcement follows months of Harris reflecting on how best to serve the Democratic Party after her loss in the 2024 presidential election. “I am a devout public servant,” she said, “and from the earliest days of my career, I believed the best way to make a difference was to improve the system from within.” She pointed to her long public service record—as a prosecutor, attorney general of California, US senator, and Vice President—as evidence of her commitment.Though she won’t be running for governor, Harris has been steadily re-engaging in politics lately. She made virtual appearances at a youth voter summit and an abortion rights advocacy event.Meanwhile, her Harris Victory Fund has started fundraising to support former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper’s Senate campaign, signaling her ongoing influence within the party.Despite stepping back from the gubernatorial race, Harris promised she won’t step away from the fight for “freedom, opportunity, fairness, and the dignity of all.”“I look forward to getting back out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about my own plans,” she said in her statement.","Former US Vice President Kamala Harris announced Wednesday that she will not run for California governor in 2026.

'Rule of five': Senate Democrats invoke rare federal law to demand full Epstein files; set DOJ August 15 deadline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/rule-of-five-senate-democrats-invoke-rare-federal-law-to-demand-full-epstein-files-set-doj-august-15-deadline/articleshow/123004950.cms,"Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer (Image: AP)

What Democrats are demanding





Senate Democrats are using a little-known federal law to demand the department of justice hand over all documents related to Jeffrey Epstein—intensifying pressure on the Trump administration to provide full transparency in the disgraced financier’s criminal case and alleged network of high-profile connections.Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer announced the move Wednesday on the Senate floor, saying Democrats are determined to obtain what he called the “full and complete Epstein files.”At the center of this push is Section 2954, or the “Rule of Five,” a rarely invoked statute from 1928 that allows five members of a Senate oversight committee to compel executive agencies—like the DOJ or FBI—to provide information, even without the chairman’s approval. Though seldom used, the law gives minority members significant oversight power.""Today Senate Democrats take additional action to try and uncover the truth about the Epstein files,” Schumer said, as reported by CBS News.The Democrats’ push comes amid renewed public attention to Epstein’s case. A recent DOJ internal review claimed there is no “client list” and found no evidence Epstein blackmailed any powerful figures, findings that were met with widespread skepticism, particularly among Donald Trump ’s supporters.However, the issue has created divisions within Trump’s base, while figures from both parties have called for greater transparency. President Trump has dismissed the controversy as a ""hoax,"" but Democrats have used the internal GOP tension to their political advantageSchumer directly accused Trump of failing to follow through on promises. ""The situation with the Epstein files is very simple- Donald Trump promised transparency and he has broken that promise,"" Schumer said. ""As a candidate, Trump said on many occasions he would release the Epstein files if elected, and yet he has refused to do so,"" he added, as quoted by CBS News.He also challenged Republicans, “If there’s nothing to hide, why all the evasiveness?”Under Section 2954, the request covers all DOJ and FBI documents, files, evidence, or other materials related to United States v Jeffrey Epstein- including anything referencing Epstein’s clients. Democrats emphasized that the privacy of victims would be protected.The DOJ has been given an August 15 deadline to respond.While Section 2954 has legal standing, it’s unclear how enforceable it is in court if the DOJ declines to comply. Democrats have used it in the past, most notably in 2017 to seek Trump Hotel lease records and in 2001 regarding US census data.",Senate Democrats are using a little-known federal law to demand the department of justice hand over all documents related to Jeffrey Epstein.

The Delta Air Line pilot who was taken into custody straight from the plane on charges of child sexual assault in Contra Costa County, California has been charged with 24 felony counts on Tuesday, according to the Norther California authorities.Indian-origin Rustom Bhagwagar, 34, was taken into custody by a group of about 10 law enforcement officers who boarded Delta Flight 2809 from Minneapolis just after it landed at 9.35 pm, handcuffing him in front of stunned passengers and crew.Witnesses described seeing officers with “badges, guns and different agency vests/markings” walk down the aisle and into the cockpit, where they handcuffed the pilot and escorted him off the plane, as reported by The New York Times.The charges against Bhagwagar include engaging in sexual acts with a child under the age of 10, aggravated sexual assault of a child, forcible lewd acts upon a child, and oral copulation with a child. The alleged abuse occurred in Contra Costa County, according to the district attorney’s office.Jennifer Powell, 45, has also been charged with 24 counts in a related felony complaint. Both Bhagwagar and Powell are being held at the Martinez detention facility.Bhagwagar’s bail has been set at $15 million.The charges in both cases carry possible prison terms of 15 years to life. Bhagwagar is expected to be arraigned Wednesday in Martinez, California.“Our office stands firmly committed to protecting children and holding those who cause harm accountable,” said Contra Costa county district attorney Diana Becton in a statement. “Every child deserves to feel safe, protected and heard when an injustice like this occurs.”According to the Contra Costa county sheriff’s office, detectives had been investigating Bhagwagar since April.

"'Vile racism': Trump administration freezes $108 million in research funding to Duke University; withheld over admissions, hiring practices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vile-racism-trump-administration-freezes-108-million-in-research-funding-to-duke-university-withheld-over-admissions-hiring-practices/articleshow/123003595.cms,"Duke University faces $108 million funding suspension (Image: AP)





The Donald Trump administration has suspended $108 million in federal research funding to Duke University, accusing the institution of engaging in racial discrimination through affirmative action policies. The move marks a sharp escalation in the administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices at major US universities, which officials say amount to unlawful racial preferences.Earlier this week, the departments of health and human services and education issued a joint letter accusing Duke University of using racial preferences in its hiring and admissions processes.Health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and education secretary Linda McMahon described the alleged practices as “vile racism,” warning that if substantiated, they would make Duke “unfit for any further financial relationship with the federal government.” The letter claims Duke gave advantages based on race in recruiting, scholarships, and hiring, though it does not provide specific examples.“Racism is a scourge when practiced by individuals, but it is especially corrosive when enshrined in the nation’s most eminent and respected institutions,” the letter said, as cited by AP.The administration is demanding Duke establish a new merit and civil rights committee, approved by the federal government and the school’s board of trustees, to identify and eliminate any race-based practices.If violations persist after six months, the administration said it will pursue legal enforcement.The education department has also opened an investigation into the Duke Law Journal for allegedly favoring prospective editors from underrepresented groups.Duke is the latest university to come under federal scrutiny as part of the administration’s effort to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, which it argues amount to discrimination against white and Asian American individuals. Other universities under investigation include Harvard, Columbia, and Cornell.The funding freeze comes at a difficult time for Duke financially. Nearly 60% of its $1.5 billion annual research spending comes from federal sources. University officials recently announced that around 600 employees had accepted voluntary buyouts, but additional layoffs would still be required due to uncertainty around federal funding and higher endowment taxes.The Trump administration has used funding pressure to prompt reforms at major universities. Columbia University recently agreed to pay $200 million and revise its policies on admissions, hiring, and student discipline in exchange for continued access to federal research funding.

FBI linked to Russia narrative before probe

Congressional review underway





FBI director Kash Patel has uncovered a hidden room inside FBI headquarters containing multiple “burn bags” filled with thousands of sensitive and classified documents—some related to the origins of the Trump–Russia probe, according to sources cited by Fox News. The burn bag system is used to destroy documents designated as classified or higher.Among the documents was the classified annex to former special counsel John Durham’s final report, which includes key intelligence that could shed new light on the FBI’s role in launching the controversial Crossfire Hurricane investigation.Declassification is being coordinated by CIA director John Ratcliffe, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, attorney general Pam Bondi, and acting NSA director William Hartman. Once declassified, the document will be sent to senate judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley, who plans to make it public.Sources revealed that the annex contains credible foreign intelligence indicating the FBI may have played a role in advancing the Trump–Russia collusion narrative even before launching the Crossfire Hurricane probe. With hindsight, the sources claim the intelligence predicted the bureau’s actions “with alarming specificity.”Soon after assuming leadership at the FBI, Patel discovered the unknown sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF) and initiated review of its contents. He told podcast host Joe Rogan that the room, hidden under former FBI director James Comey, was “full of documents and computer hard drives that no one had ever seen or heard of,"" as reported by Fox News.Patel has promised a wave of transparency, saying he would release “truckloads” of files related to politically sensitive investigations. He accused former FBI leaders of hiding documentation in secret areas to avoid scrutiny.Patel has turned the documents over to senator Grassley, who is now reviewing the materials. The release of the classified annex and supporting evidence may support Republican claims that intelligence officials sought to influence the 2016 election in favor of Hillary Clinton by targeting Trump’s campaign.","FBI director Kash Patel has uncovered a hidden room inside FBI headquarters containing thousands of sensitive and classified documents.

Fiercest Senate Clash Between Democrats As Klobuchar Slams Booker’s Protest





Eric Trump, the second son of US President Donald Trump , on Wednesday suggested that someone from the Trump family could “certainly” run for president one day, though whether they would actually pursue it remains uncertain.In an interview with BBC Sport's Dan Roan, Eric was asked if the Trump family could become the next political dynasty in the United States, following in the footsteps of families like the Kennedys, Clintons, and Bushes.""People have asked me to. People have suggested I would. The answer is I very much doubt I would even consider it in 2028,"" he responded.He cited the personal and political toll his family has faced. He described the political environment as harsh and relentless, saying the experience had deeply affected them- especially his father.""I’ve got a great company. I’ve got young kids. Politics is brutal. They put us through hell. They tried to bankrupt us. They tried to put my father in jail. They tried to indict him. They tried to smear him. They made up Russia hoaxes, which were nonsense as everybody knows. They tried to impeach him. They tried to take him off ballots. They tried to censor his free speech. They pulled him off every channel,” he said as quoted by BBC.“And listen, you know they tried to kill him twice this year right?""When asked whether Donald Trump would like to see one of his family members run for office in the future, Eric replied, ""So you asked, could we, and I think the answer is somebody in the family? Certainly.”Eric said that, like his father, members of the Trump family might consider running for office only if circumstances became extremely difficult and left them with no other choice.Eric also highlighted the depth of talent within the Republican Party, emphasising that the party has strong leaders who can continue the Trump legacy beyond the family. He specifically mentioned Vice President JD Vance and secretary of state Marco Rubio as capable figures, expressing confidence that they could uphold the values and vision associated with his father’s presidency, even if the next candidate is not a family member.He added, ""I think there’s tremendous amount of great people out there. I think JD Vance would do a great job. I think Marco Rubio would do a great job. We have real talent in the Republican Party in the US and I think they can certainly continue my father's legacy outside of our family.""In June, Eric Trump hinted that the Trump family has not ruled out the possibility of building a political dynasty, with himself or other relatives potentially running for office. Speaking to the Financial Times, he said pursuing a political career would be “easy” for family members once his father’s second term ends in 2029. However, he added, “The real question is: ‘Do you want to drag other members of your family into it?’”","Eric Trump, the second son of US President Donald Trump, on Wednesday suggested that someone from the Trump family could “certainly” run for president one day.

Nebraska plant explosion: Three dead after blast at biofuels facility; fire continues to grow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nebraska-plant-explosion-three-dead-after-blast-at-biofuels-facility-fire-continues-to-grow/articleshow/123001047.cms,"Firefighters hampered by structural collapse at biofuel plant (Image: AP)





Three people, including two kids, who remained unaccounted for following a powerful explosion at a biofuels plant in Fremont, Nebraska, were confirmed dead Wednesday. The blast occurred midday at Horizon Biofuels, a facility that produces fuel pellets and animal bedding. The explosion caused a large fire and significant structural collapse, making it too dangerous for crews to enter and search for the dead.""When we arrived on scene, we had heavy smoke and a lot of flames coming out,"" Fremont Fire Chief Todd Bernt said at a press briefing Tuesday afternoon as reported by AP. ""We had a lot of structural collapse.""Three people were inside the building at the time of the explosion, Fremont Mayor Joey Spellerberg confirmed. ""But that's all we could say at this point,"" he said.Spellerberg said the two children were waiting for the employee to get off work so they could go to a doctor’s appointment. He wasn't sure of their exact ages but said both were under age 12.The collapse severely limited rescue efforts.""Early on, we tried to get access, but just due to the collapse with the mangled steel, we were unable to get inside,"" Bernt said.The fire remains active as of Wednesday, especially in the facility’s tower.Bernt said crews are expected to remain on site for several days. The plant contains large quantities of wood and alcohol-based materials, which have contributed to the fire’s intensity.The Fremont Fire Department called in Nebraska Task Force One to assess how to safely conduct a search. The cause of the explosion is still under investigation, and the Nebraska State Fire Marshal’s Office is among several agencies responding.Horizon Biofuels has a history of fire-related incidents. In 2014, a fire at the same building damaged its electrical system but left the structure intact, according to the Fremont Tribune.""It's quite incredible to see the work, and we're doing everything we can with this situation,"" Mayor Spellerberg said, praising the coordinated emergency response.Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen also said he is closely monitoring the situation.""Our thoughts and prayers are with all involved -- and we're ready to help any way we can,"" Pillen said in a statement.A woman who came to the scene to hand out water to first responders described seeing a ""large black puff of smoke"" after the explosion.""I was just instantly praying that nobody was hurt,"" she told reporters. ""That's all we can hope for. We're a good community. Everybody will rally together and help each other.""Fremont, a city of about 27,000 residents, is located roughly 32 miles (52 kilometers) northwest of Omaha.

ISLAMABAD: At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June as glacial lake outbursts, cloudbursts, and relentless monsoon rains triggered catastrophic floods across the country, from the Himalayas to the southern plains.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of another severe monsoon spell starting July 29, raising fears of fresh flash floods and landslides, especially in northern regions like Swat, Chitral, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Torrential rains have wreaked havoc across the country, sweeping away entire families, burying homes under landslides, and cutting off remote valleys. A sudden cloudburst near Babusar Top and Naran stranded scores of tourists, prompting military-led rescue operations by air and road. Washed-away bridges and blocked highways have hampered relief efforts.The NDMA, provincial agencies, and army teams are on the ground, but operations remain slow and patchy, especially in the hard-to-reach northern areas. Helicopter sorties continue, though poor weather and visibility are disrupting missions.Experts blame successive govts for ignoring climate adaptation and disaster preparedness, despite warnings. “The pattern is repeating itself — glacial melts, erratic monsoons, unprepared institutions. It’s a deadly mix,” said a disaster risk analyst in Islamabad.The crisis echoes the devastating 2022 monsoon floods, which killed over 1,700, submerged a third of the country, and displaced over 30 million people, causing $30 billion in economic losses. Yet, activists say climate resilience remains absent from Pakistan’s national priorities.With more glaciers than any non-polar country, Pakistan faces an increasing frequency of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) due to rising temperatures. Add to that deforestation, poor drainage, and unregulated construction, and experts say even routine monsoons now turn deadly.As another deluge looms, govt has advised evacuations from high-risk zones and warned tourists to stay away from northern areas. But for many already stranded, the warnings have come too late.","At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June.

Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi, officials confirmed on Monday.Among those killed was Zafran, who was identified as the mastermind of a November 2024 attack on two Chinese engineers in Pakistan's largest city. He carried a bounty of Rs 20 million.The operation was conducted late Sunday night in the Manghopir area by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and intelligence agencies, CTD official Raja Umer Khattab told. The TTP men opened fire when they saw security personnel approaching, triggering a firefight which lasted over an hour.Authorities recovered a suicide jacket, three grenades, a Kalashnikov rifle, two pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition from the site.On November 5 last year, a private security guard opened fire on two Chinese nationals at a textile mill in Karachi, injuring both before fleeing.Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in militant attacks—particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan—since the TTP ended its ceasefire with the federal government in late 2022.Founded in 2007, the TTP is an umbrella organisation of various extremist groups seeking to impose a strict version of Islamic law across Pakistan. It has claimed responsibility for numerous high-profile attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad, the 2009 assault on army headquarters, and multiple strikes on security installations.","Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi.

Pakistan tribal council threatens highway block over girl’s murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tribal-council-threatens-highway-block-over-girls-murder/articleshow/122939897.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: A tribal jirga (council of elders) in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway on July 29 after the killing of a nine-year-old girl sparked public outrage. Convened in Tank’s Gul Imam on Saturday, the jirga issued an 11-point charter of demands, warning of a full blockade if authorities fail to respond.Indus Highway (N-55) is a critical national artery that runs along the river, connecting Karachi in Pakistan’s south with Peshawar in the north and cutting through multiple provinces. The planned blockade at Pezu will impact trade routes, passenger transport, and military convoys.The protests gained momentum after a viral video showed residents confronting armed security personnel -- an extraordinary act in this militarised stretch of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The footage amplified long-standing anger over arbitrary detentions, raids without warrants, and what locals call collective punishment disguised as counterterrorism.“Our decision to block the highway remains. If our demands are accepted, we’ll reconsider.If not, Pezu will be shut down on July 29,” jirga leader Abdul Qayum Kundi said.Police have registered a case in the girl’s death, but authorities have yet to disclose any findings. Locals allege misconduct or negligence by security forces—claims that remain unverified but widely believed within the community.In a bid to defuse tensions, local officials delivered three sheep and (Pak) Rs 2.5 million (around $9,000) to the girl’s family -- an act rooted in tribal custom, meant to symbolise remorse and reconciliation. But jirga members view it as a token gesture. “This is hush money in ceremonial form,” said one elder.The jirga’s demands include the release of detainees not proven to have militant ties, an end to forced house searches, and a halt to arrests of suspects’ relatives. They also call for the return of confiscated weapons and an end to detentions based on vague accusations of mukhbiri (spying).The jirga’s demands echo those of the banned Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which for years challenged Pakistan’s security policies in its tribal belt.","A tribal jirga in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway.

‘Reject Pakistani Rule’: BNM Accuses Pakistan of Genocide in Balochistan, Launches Armed Resistance

Poll Do you think that protests and appeals by families of the abducted individuals can lead to change? Yes, they can raise awareness. No, they are largely ineffective.





The crisis of enforced disappearances in Pakistan's Balochistan region and beyond has deepened this week, as a disturbing string of abductions emerges from Karachi, Noshki, and Kech, according to The Balochistan Post (TBP).Among the most alarming cases is that of Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi.On Monday evening, he was reportedly abducted near the university's Maskan Gate. Eyewitnesses say he was taken by unidentified men in a vehicle while returning to his hostel with friends.Originally from Mashkay in Awaran district, Muslim Dad was a familiar face within the Baloch student community in Karachi. His sudden disappearance has sparked fear among his peers and left his family devastated.In Noshki, another troubling case unfolded earlier today when Hafeezullah, the son of Peer Mohammad and a resident of Qaziabad, was allegedly picked up from his home by Pakistani security forces. His family has raised alarm over his unknown whereabouts and is demanding his immediate release.TBP also reported two recent disappearances in Kech district.On July 23, 16-year-old shopkeeper Qambar Baloch was allegedly taken by men believed to belong to Military Intelligence and the ISI while he was in Jusak, Turbat. And on June 27, Imran Khan, a 26-year-old student of Balochi language and culture at the University of Turbat, was reportedly abducted by Frontier Corps and Military Intelligence personnel in Turbat city—in broad daylight.“These are not isolated cases. This is a pattern,” said a representative from Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), a group that has long campaigned for the safe recovery of abducted individuals. Despite repeated appeals and protests, most cases remain unresolved, with no accountability or formal investigations.","Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi, was reportedly abducted on Monday.

Beijing/Islamabad: Pakistan army chief Asim Munir, who is on his first visit to China after his elevation as the field marshal, on Friday held talks with top Chinese leaders and discussed ways to deepen cooperation across all sectors. Munir held separate meetings with V-P Han Zheng, top military official general Zhang Youxia and foreign minister Wang Yi, according to official media reports.This is Munir's first visit to China after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistam in response to the Pahalgam terror attack. During the conflict, Pakistan used extensive military equipment supplied by China.

ISLAMABAD: As jailed former PM Imran Khan completes two years in prison, his sons – Sulaiman and Qasim – have stepped into the political spotlight, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release just days before Khan’s call for a nationwide protest on Aug 5, which has put the state on edge.Khan, arrested on Aug 5, 2023, remains behind bars despite some convictions being overturned. He is currently serving time in three major cases that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claims are part of a broader effort to keep him out of politics.He was convicted in the Toshakhana case, involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during his premiership. He was sentenced in the cipher case, accused of leaking classified diplomatic correspondence for political gain. And in the Al-Qadir Trust case, Khan and his wife were held liable for controversial land deals linked to a charitable trust.PTI has consistently maintained that the charges are politically motivated, aimed at “eliminating the most popular leader” in the country.Now, with most of PTI’s senior leadership jailed, exiled, or forced to resign, Khan’s sons have taken the international route. Based in the UK, the brothers have held meetings in Washington DC with US lawmakers, policy groups and human rights organisations, and are reportedly preparing to testify before congressional panels.Their message: Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in inhumane conditions, denied light, medical access, and family contact.The campaign has triggered speculation about whether the two sons might return to Pakistan, possibly to appear at the planned protest. While PTI has not confirmed this, party insiders say their presence could act as a powerful morale boost for the party’s dispersed support base.Meanwhile, the state has moved swiftly to neutralise any protest momentum. On July 22, an anti-terror court in Lahore sentenced eight senior PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, to 10 years in prison for their alleged role in the May 9 riots, when military installations were targeted after Khan’s initial arrest. Observers see the convictions as a tactical strike to undercut mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 protest. The verdicts have raised concerns among legal experts about the selective use of terrorism laws against political opponents.From prison, Khan has issued a call for unity among PTI ranks, urging supporters to “shun differences” and prepare for what he called a decisive moment for Pakistan’s democracy. But the party remains fractured and leaderless, with ongoing rifts between loyalists and factions seen as open to negotiations with the establishment.At the heart of the political storm is the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was controversially elevated to five-star rank in May. PTI blames him, along with PML-N and PPP leaders, for orchestrating what it calls a civil-military clampdown to sideline Khan and crush dissent.In a recent prison note, Khan mocked Munir as the “King of the Jungle”, accusing him of ruling the country through “fear, not law”.","Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release.

[It’s] quite a sophisticated scam.”Last year, Pakistanis filed 10,542 asylum applications in the UK, the highest from any single nationality and an 80% surge from the previous year, the report said citing government data.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Asim Munir for President? Pakistan Defence Minister Denies Amid Buzz Of Asif Ali Zardari Quitting





A political and diplomatic dogfight is underway over a prospective visit to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump en route to the Quad summit in India in September amid a gradual recalibration of ties in the region.Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit after pulling off a coup by arranging a luncheon meeting last month for the country's army chief Asim Munir with the US President.Munir charmed Trump by endorsing him for a Nobel Peace Prize, playing up to his craving for one, and the Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits, despite having thrown itself at China's feet for survival.Although the White House has not confirmed Trump's Quad attendance given New Delhi is yet to nail the dates -- which also depends on the leaders of Japan and Australia -- Pakistan's excitable media broadcast that the US President would visit Pakistan on September 18, before retracting the report because Trump will be on a state visit to the UK from September 17-19.There are indications though that Trump may stopover in Pakistan whenever he heads out to the Quad summit.This could be as late as November given the MAGA supremo's obsession with trade deals over strategic alignments. He has just delivered a tariff shock to Japan and also riled up Australia, while India has proved to be a tough negotiator, frustrating his trade boffins attempts to strong-arm New Delhi into a quick deal.In fact, Trump's fetish for tariffs and his fixation on trade deals puts a question mark over the strategic salience of the Quad even as long-time allies and partners adjust to his mercurial approach.According to some diplomats, India itself may have to reassess its approach to Trump-era Washington after a rosy-eyed view of long-term strategic ties with the US. They acknowledge that Trump’s response during his second term to the Pakistani outreach – driven more by opportunism than any strategic vision – clearly caught India off guard. New Delhi resents the re-hyphenation that would be implicit in such a two-fer, but has no way of thwarting it.If Trump does visit Pakistan, it will be the first US Presidential trip to the country in nearly two decades after George W Bush layover in 2006. Bush stopped by in Islamabad for a few hours under a tight security blanket on his way back from a three-day visit to New Delhi, talking up counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan while rejecting its pleas for a nuclear deal similar to the one he forged with India.Presidents Obama and Biden both disdained even a stopover while Trump himself trashed Pakistan during his first term, accusing it of ""nothing but lies & deceit"" and providing ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.""Pakistan is now promising to turn itself into a safe haven for US businesses promoted by Trump associates -- including transforming Islamabad into the ""crypto capital of South Asia"" and a ""global leader in the digital finance revolution,’ -- to land a Presidential visit.During his first term, Trump is famously said to have complained about landing in Iraq and Afghanistan with the lights on Air Force One turned off (as a security measure), despite the US having spent billions on the countries. If the Pakistan stopover comes through, he may well insist on landing in full sight – to soak up the fanfare and flattery.","Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit. Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits.

Pakistan Flood Fury: Watch Moment Journalist Gets Washed Away While Reporting In Rawalpindi





At least 54 people have died in the past 24 hours across Pakistan, pushing the monsoon-related death toll to around 180 since late June, the government's disaster management agency reported on Thursday.Pakistan's Punjab region has been lashed by relentless rain since Wednesday morning, triggering urban flooding and widespread disruption in several low-lying areas.Officials have ordered residents near the river flowing through Rawalpindi — next to the capital Islamabad — to evacuate following a sudden surge in water levels.Authorities have advised residents in vulnerable areas to prepare emergency kits with food, water, and essential medicines for three to five days, in case of worsening conditions.A spokesperson for the national disaster management authority (NDMA) told AFP that 54 people were killed and around 227 injured across Pakistan in the past 24 hours. The death toll was recorded as of 8:00 am (0300 GMT) on Thursday, she added.Since June 26, around 180 people — including 70 children — have died, and nearly 500 have been injured.The meteorological department has warned that heavy rainfall will continue until Friday.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Electric vehicles account for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal.

Harry and the Diary of Reconciliation: Prince to share calendar with palace; seeks to avoid Angola trip-like clashes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/harry-and-the-diary-of-reconciliation-prince-to-share-calendar-with-palace-seeks-to-avoid-angola-trip-like-clashes/articleshow/122940387.cms,"Representational image

Harry's olive branch







Prince Harry has agreed to share his official diary with the royal family to avoid clashes in public appearances and ease ongoing tensions.The move comes after his recent trip to Angola made headlines for revisiting princess Diana’s iconic anti-landmine walk, on the same day Queen Camilla's 78th birthday portrait was released. Harry’s photos reportedly overshadowed the coverage of the Queen’s milestone, which did not go down well with the palace.According to The Mail, Harry is now open to “deconflicting” his schedule with other senior royals, including Prince William’s team at Kensington palace.Their PR teams have reportedly kept in touch since private talks began earlier this year. In fact, aides from both camps were seen meeting at a London members club earlier this month.Harry is also quietly pushing for a more personal reconnection with his father. According to royal expert Hilary Fordwich, King Charles remains “cautious and wary” of Harry’s recent efforts. She said ,“Harry misses the UK and many aspects of royal life, but his return risks more disclosures, and that worries the family,” she added.Royal biographer Tom Bower told The Mirror that Harry is “seriously worried” about being permanently shut out.“He’s afraid that once Charles is gone, William will banish him from the UK entirely,” Bower said.This fear reportedly led to a discreet meeting at the Royal Over-Seas League in London last week. Harry’s aides flew in to meet King Charles’ top communications official, Tobyn Andreae. Witnesses said the two teams chatted on the garden terrace before moving indoors. Though there was no set agenda, both sides “had things to talk about”.","Prince Harry has agreed to share his official diary with the royal family to avoid clashes in public appearances and ease ongoing tensions.

'We must confront them': British woman slammed for criticising Hindi-speaking staff at Heathrow; accused of racism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/we-must-confront-them-british-woman-slammed-for-criticising-hindi-speaking-staff-at-heathrow-accused-of-racism/articleshow/122933874.cms,"(Image: X @LucyJayneWhite1)





A British woman has come under fire after having an issue over Marks & Spencer employees at London Heathrow Airport speaking in Hindi. Lucy White, who describes herself as a public policy specialist, shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism. Many accused her of racism and intolerance in a multicultural environment.White wrote that she had just arrived at Terminal 3 of the airport and visited the M&S store, where she overheard three staff members speaking in a language other than English. When she asked them what language they were speaking, the employees told her it was Hindi, the most widely spoken language in India.“I have a voice recording & their names to report to M&S. We must confront them every time,” she added.Her post drew backlash with users online calling her racist and many questioning why she found it offensive and what rules the employees had broken.This incident is not the first time White has faced criticism for similar remarks. A few weeks ago, she posted another tweet targeting Indian and Asian employees at Heathrow, claiming they spoke “not a word of English.” She added that when she asked them to speak English, they called her a “racist.”One user, on her latest post, commented, “Confront people who talk in a different language? No thanks. We should however confront vile bigots like yourself that make this country a much sadder, less friendlier place.”Another user said, “How embarrassing. Heaven forbid someone speaks more than one language if they work in a major international airport.”","Lucy White shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism.

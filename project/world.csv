‘97 per cent bad’: Donald Trump criticizes US media for negative coverage; calls it ‘illegal’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/97-per-cent-bad-donald-trump-criticizes-us-media-for-negative-coverage-calls-it-illegal/articleshow/124009075.cms,"Donald Trump (AP image)





US President Donald Trump on Friday slammed US media coverage that portrayed him negatively, calling it “illegal” and claiming that networks report “97 per cent bad” news about him, although he did not provide any evidence to support the figure.The remarks have reignited debate over free speech following the suspension of comedian Jimmy Kimmel ’s television show by ABC.“They’ll take a great story and they’ll make it bad. See, I think it’s really illegal, personally,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, reiterating his long-standing view that coverage of him and his administration is overwhelmingly hostile, according to news agency AFP.The 79-year-old Republican has sued several major news organizations this year, including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, as part of his ongoing criticism of US media.Trump also defended Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, whose recent threats to broadcasters over Kimmel’s remarks about conservative activist Charlie Kirk have sparked a national debate. “He’s an incredible American patriot with courage.”The controversy began when Kimmel suggested on his show that “many in MAGA land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk.”Within 24 hours, Carr condemned the comments as “truly sick” and hinted that ABC could face regulatory consequences, including fines or potential license actions.Shortly afterward, ABC announced Kimmel’s show would be suspended indefinitely.Trump’s remarks followed his previous statements aboard Air Force One, where he suggested networks broadcasting negative coverage of him could face government punishment, even hinting that their licenses “maybe” should be revoked. “Again, 97% negative, and yet I won easily. I won all seven swing states,” he said.Not all Republicans agreed with Trump’s stance. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a close ally, warned that it is dangerous for the government to dictate which speech it may or may not like.President Trump recently filed a $15 billion lawsuit against The New York Times, accusing the newspaper of participating in a decades-long smear campaign aimed at damaging him politically. However, the case suffered a setback when a federal judge dismissed it as without merit.","US President Donald Trump slammed US media coverage that portrayed him negatively.

A rare 5-day weekend for UAE National Day is possible! Here’s why: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/a-rare-5-day-weekend-for-uae-national-day-is-possible-heres-why-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/124006129.cms,"UAE National Day holidays in 2025 are officially December 2 and 3, with possible shifts to extend the weekend/ Image: Dubai Media Office





National Day 2025 – The possibility of a very long weekend

Commemoration Day is officially recognized on November 30, but is typically observed on December 1.



If December 1 (Monday) is also declared a holiday, either in addition to or replacing December 3, residents would get a 4-day or even 5-day weekend when combined with the Saturday-Sunday weekend before it.



Key dates to know:





Saturday, November 29, 2025 – Regular weekend

– Regular weekend Sunday, November 30, 2025 – Official date of UAE Commemoration Day(not typically a day off)

– Official date of UAE Commemoration Day(not typically a day off) Monday, December 1, 2025 – Observed Commemoration Day(could potentially be declared a public holiday)

– Observed Commemoration Day(could potentially be declared a public holiday) Tuesday, December 2, 2025 – UAE National Day (official public holiday)

– UAE National Day (official public holiday) Wednesday, December 3, 2025 – Second official day off for National Day (may be shifted to Monday, December 1, under the public holiday law)

The law that could give UAE National Day weekend a 5-day break





Key points of the law:





The law applies to non-Eid holidays, including New Year’s Day, Islamic New Year, Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday (PBUH), and National Day

The two major religious holidays, Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al Adha, are excluded from this flexibility. If they fall on a weekend, they cannot be moved.





Commemoration Day – Its role in the holiday equation

If December 1 (Monday) is officially added as a public holiday in 2025, and paired with December 2 and 3, residents would get three consecutive weekdays off.



Combine this with the standard Saturday-Sunday weekend (November 29–30), and the result is a 5-day break.



Alternatively, a more probable scenario is that the Cabinet moves the December 3 holiday to Monday, December 1, effectively offering a 4-day weekend instead.





How the UAE celebrates National Day

Final word





A midweek National Day, a flexible holiday law, and a calendar quirk might just align to give UAE residents one of the longest weekends of the year.The UAE will celebrate its 54th National Day on Tuesday, December 2, 2025, marking more than half a century since the unification of the Emirates. National Day, also called Eid Al Etihad, commemorates the 1971 federation of six emirates, with Ras Al Khaimah joining in 1972, and symbolizes the country’s independence from British treaties and the start of nationhood under Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.By law, December 2 and 3 are official National Day holidays across the UAE. In 2025, these dates fall on Tuesday and Wednesday, placing the celebration midweek. However, due to updates in the UAE’s public holiday law, there's potential for this to turn into a much longer break.Here’s how it could play out:Nothing has been officially confirmed yet, but similar decisions in past years, and the UAE’s ongoing focus on improving work-life balance, make this scenario increasingly likely.In 2024, the UAE introduced a key revision to its public holiday law aimed at enhancing work-life balance.This legal amendment, announced in the summer of 2024, allows non-Eid public holidays to be moved to the beginning or end of the week if they happen to fall midweek or on weekends. The intent is to help residents benefit more from their holidays through longer, uninterrupted breaks.The official wording states:“With the exception of Eid holidays, the Cabinet may – pursuant to a resolution it issues – transfer any of the public holidays referred to in Article (1) of this Resolution to the beginning or end of the week.”Previously, if a holiday like the Islamic New Year fell on a Sunday, already part of the weekend, workers in the private sector didn’t get an extra day off. For instance, in 2024, Muharram 1 fell on Sunday, July 7, rendering the paid holiday ineffective for many. Under the new rule, that holiday could now be shifted to a Friday or Monday, ensuring residents still benefit.In short: the National Day holiday falling midweek in 2025, combined with Commemoration Day on Monday, sets the stage for either a 4-day or 5-day holiday, depending on how the government chooses to apply this flexibility.UAE Commemoration Day honors the memory of Emiratis who have given their lives in service to the nation. While officially designated as November 30, but usually not with a public holiday, it has been observed on December 1 in recent years, especially when aligning with National Day schedules.Here’s why Commemoration Day matters in this scenario:The UAE's local governments also have discretion to declare additional public holidays not explicitly listed in federal resolutions. This means that emirates such as Dubai or Abu Dhabi could theoretically extend the break by adding Commemoration Day to the public holiday calendar as part of the National Day celebrations.UAE National Day on December 2 is always a big deal, and 2025 is set to be no different. Expect the skies to light up with fireworks and laser shows across landmarks like Burj Khalifa, Dubai Festival City, and the Abu Dhabi Corniche.Streets and buildings will be draped in the national colors, red, green, white, and black, and everyone from kids to grandparents gets into the spirit with festive outfits and flag displays.Traditional dances like Al Ayallah and Al Harbiya, along with poetry and music, bring the country’s heritage to life. In Dubai, the Rashid Boulevard parade steals the spotlight with marching bands, eye-catching floats, and surprise characters. The highlight, though, is the official celebration attended by the rulers of all seven emirates, a powerful show of unity and national pride.While the official announcement is still pending, the calendar setup, holiday law, and past practice suggest there’s a good chance of an extended 5-day UAE National Day weekend. Whether it ends up being four or five days, UAE residents can likely expect a meaningful and festive holiday period this winter.Stay tuned for the official word, but maybe don’t book your December 1 meetings just yet.","UAE will celebrate its 54th National Day on Tuesday, December 2, 2025.

"'Contrary to national interest': Trump admin asks SC to revoke TPS for 300,000 Venezuelans; slams lower court order",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/contrary-to-national-interest-trump-admin-asks-sc-to-revoke-tps-for-300000-venezuelans-slams-lower-court-order/articleshow/124008805.cms,"Donald Trump and US Supreme Court (AP images)





US President Donald Trump 's administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to overturn deportation protections extended to roughly 300,000 Venezuelans living in the United States, accusing a lower court of issuing a “needless affront” by ruling otherwise.The case centers on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ’s decision earlier this year to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS), a form of humanitarian relief granted to Venezuelan migrants.The administration noted that, as long as the district court’s order stands, over 300,000 Venezuelans would remain in the United States despite Secretary Noem’s determination that doing so even temporarily is “contrary to the national interest.”Beyond this policy, the case raises broader questions about how courts, including the Supreme Court, handle fast-tracked emergency appeals under Trump’s second term.Friday’s appeal is the second emergency petition submitted to the Supreme Court that day and highlights an ongoing debate within the judiciary: how much weight lower courts should give to brief or vague Supreme Court emergency orders.Earlier this year, in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to move forward with ending TPS protections while the case continued in lower courts, despite a dissent from liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.A federal judge in California later issued a new order siding with the Venezuelans, temporarily blocking the policy again.In its latest emergency appeal, the administration criticized US District Judge Edward Chen and the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals for taking what it called an “indefensible” position by blocking the policy once more, as reported by CNN.The administration also argued that the lack of reasoning in the Supreme Court’s initial order does not excuse lower courts from following it. “Whether those orders span one sentence or many pages, disregarding them – as the lower courts did here – is unacceptable,” it said.Some lower court judges have expressed uncertainty over how to handle cases when the Supreme Court provides little explanation on emergency rulings. “They’re telling us nothing,” US Circuit Judge James Wynn said during an oral argument earlier this month in a case concerning whether the Department of Government Efficiency can access Social Security data.A key issue in the case is whether Secretary Noem had the authority to end the existing TPS designation before it was scheduled to expire.The former President Joe Biden 's administration initially granted TPS for Venezuelans in March 2021 due to political instability in the country and expanded it in 2023. Two weeks before Trump took office, the Biden administration renewed the protections for another 18 months.Venezuelan migrants covered under TPS have challenged Noem’s reversal, arguing it violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires federal agencies to follow specific procedures when changing policies. They also contend that the decision was motivated by political and racial bias.","The case centers on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ’s decision earlier this year to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) The case raises broader questions about how courts, including the Supreme Court, handle fast-tracked emergency appeals under Trump’s second term.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124008881,imgsize-977968,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

US President Donald Trump ’s administration on Friday escalated its campaign against Harvard University by placing new restrictions on the Ivy League school’s access to federal funds for student aid, citing concerns about the ""financial position"" of the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university.The US Department of Education said Harvard has been moved to a “heightened cash monitoring” status, which requires the university to use its own money to disburse student aid before being reimbursed.It also directed Harvard to provide a $36 million letter of credit to guarantee its financial obligations, pointing to the school’s recent bond issuances and staff layoffs as causes for concern, news agency Reuters reported.“While Harvard remains eligible to participate in the federal student aid program for now, these actions are necessary to protect taxpayers,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said.The department further warned that Harvard could lose access to federal student aid if it fails to comply with records requests from the Office of Civil Rights, which is investigating whether the university still considers race in admissions despite the Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling against affirmative action.Harvard, with an endowment of $53 billion, has denied being in financial trouble but acknowledged that federal actions have strained its budget. In July, it estimated the impact of the Trump administration’s measures at nearly $1 billion annually.Earlier this month, a federal judge ruled that the government had unlawfully terminated more than $2 billion in research grants awarded to Harvard.The restrictions are the latest step in a larger confrontation. The Trump administration has accused Harvard of harboring “radical left” ideologies and failing to curb antisemitism, while targeting its funding, admissions policies and international student programs.Harvard has mounted multiple legal challenges, calling the measures unlawful and politically motivated. It has sued over frozen research grants and directives threatening international students, with courts granting temporary relief in some cases.Trump has personally taken aim at the university. During a recent cabinet meeting, he said Harvard should pay “nothing less than $500 million,” accusing the institution of having “been very bad.”",The US Department of Education said Harvard has been moved to a “heightened cash monitoring’ status.

UAE mirrors US Fed's rate cut

Impact on borrowing costs, sectoral outlook

Real Estate: Falling mortgage rates may reignite demand in Dubai’s property market, especially among first-time buyers and investors seeking leveraged exposure.



Retail and Tourism: Lower interest rates can boost disposable income and spur consumer demand, supporting domestic consumption and inbound travel.



SMEs and Corporates: Easier access to cheaper financing may encourage business expansion, especially for small and medium enterprises and capital-intensive industries.





Why the UAE Dirham is pegged to USD





What is a currency peg?





Reduced exchange rate risk in trade and investment



Greater price stability in imported goods



Enhanced investor confidence due to currency predictability





Behind the Fed's move

Slowing job gains



A slight uptick in the unemployment rate, although it remains relatively low



Moderated economic growth in the first half of 2025



Elevated inflation, particularly in core categories









In a significant shift aligned with the US Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy easing, the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has reduced its base interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.15%, effective September 18, 2025. The rate cut marks the UAE’s response to changing global economic signals and is expected to lower borrowing costs, potentially stimulating sectors like real estate, tourism, and small business growth, while also impacting savings and investment preferences.On September 18, 2025, the Central Bank of the UAE lowered the Base Rate applicable to the Overnight Deposit Facility (ODF) by 25 basis points, from 4.40% to 4.15%. This move directly followed the US Federal Reserve’s decision the previous day to reduce its Interest Rate on Reserve Balances (IORB) by the same margin.The UAE’s base rate, which serves as a floor for overnight money market interest rates, is anchored to the Fed’s IORB. Given the UAE dirham’s long-standing peg to the US dollar, changes in US interest rates are typically mirrored in the Emirates to maintain monetary stability.In addition to adjusting the base rate, the CBUAE announced that it would maintain the spread for borrowing short-term liquidity from the central bank at 50 basis points above the base rate across all standing credit facilities.This is the first interest rate cut in the UAE since the Fed’s last policy shift in December 2024, when rates were reduced to a range of 4.25%–4.50%. With the current adjustment, the Fed’s target federal funds rate now stands at 4.00%–4.25%, the lowest level since November 2022.The UAE’s rate cut is expected to translate into lower borrowing costs, with wide-ranging implications for consumer spending, business investment, and credit activity.Key sectors likely to benefit:Conversely, traditional savers and fixed-income investors may feel the downside. Returns on fixed deposits and bonds are likely to decline, pushing individuals and institutions toward riskier asset classes such as equities or real estate.Stock markets, especially those rich in growth and dividend-paying companies, are expected to benefit from the rate environment, although volatility may persist due to lingering global macroeconomic uncertainties.The UAE’s monetary policy is heavily influenced by its currency peg to the US dollar, a regime that has been in place since 1997. The exchange rate has been fixed at 1 USD = 3.6725 AED, offering a stable foundation for trade, investment, and macroeconomic planning.The peg plays a crucial role in simplifying oil trade transactions, given that oil exports are globally priced in US dollars. This alignment shields the UAE from exchange rate volatility and enhances confidence among international investors.A currency peg, or fixed exchange rate, is a mechanism by which a country’s central bank maintains its currency’s value at a constant rate against a foreign currency or a basket of currencies. The primary benefits include:As of 2024, 12 countries peg their currencies to the US dollar, with the UAE being one of the most prominent examples in the Middle East.Because of this peg, monetary policy independence in the UAE is limited. The Central Bank typically aligns its interest rate decisions with the Fed to maintain the stability of the peg and prevent capital flight or currency arbitrage.The US Federal Reserve’s rate cut on September 17, 2025, was its first of the year, driven by growing signs of a cooling labor market and persistent political pressures, including tariff-related inflationary concerns.According to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), recent economic data pointed to:The Fed emphasized that further policy adjustments will be contingent on incoming data, the evolving economic outlook, and risk assessments. This suggests a cautious but flexible approach to monetary easing in the months ahead.","The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has reduced its base interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.15%, effective September 18, 2025.

US Vice-President JD Vance has said that national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk , warning that such behaviour fuels further political violence.Speaking as guest host of The Charlie Kirk Show on Monday, Vance said: “Call them out, and hell, call their employer. We don't believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility.”The vice-president took over presenting duties from his ceremonial office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, with the programme livestreamed into the White House press briefing room. It was the first episode of the podcast since Kirk, 31, was fatally shot in the neck while moderating a debate at Utah Valley University last week.Vance, who flew Kirk’s body home to Arizona aboard Air Force Two, said he was “filling in for somebody who cannot be filled in for”. He recounted conversations with Kirk’s widow Erika, describing him as “a kind, loving husband”, and admitted her words had inspired him to “be a better husband and… a better father”.In his remarks, Vance directly challenged those making light of Kirk’s assassination. “There is no unity with the people who celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination,” he said.“There is no unity with someone who lies about what Charlie Kirk said in order to excuse his murder… And there is no unity with the people who fund these articles, who pay the salaries of these terrorist sympathisers who argue that Charlie Kirk, a loving husband and father, deserved a shot to the neck because he spoke words with which they disagree. ”He added: “I’m desperate for our country to be united in condemnation of the actions and the ideas that killed my friend. I want it so badly that I will tell you a difficult truth. We can only have it with people who acknowledge that political violence is unacceptable.”Other Republicans have echoed calls for accountability. Florida congressman Randy Fine said he would “demand their firing, defunding, and licence revocation”, while South Carolina’s Nancy Mace urged federal funding to be cut from universities that refuse to act.Vance, who described Kirk as a close friend and mentor, credited him with helping President Donald Trump’s re-election and with shaping the administration. “If it weren't for Charlie Kirk, I would not be the vice president of the United States,” he said.","US Vice-President JD Vance said national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

The Trucial States and British Control: Foundations of UAE National Day





1820–1853: A series of treaties were signed between Britain and the ruling sheikhs, starting with the defeat of the Qawasim maritime force. These agreements aimed to curb maritime conflict, prohibit the construction of warships or coastal fortifications, and maintain peace at sea.

1853: The Perpetual Maritime Truce formalized an indefinite end to hostilities at sea. Britain limited its role to maritime security without interfering in the internal governance of the emirates.

1892: The Exclusive Agreements prohibited the Trucial States from engaging with foreign powers without British approval. In exchange, the UK pledged military protection against external threats.



Path to federation: Early steps toward UAE National Day





February 18, 1968: Sheikh Zayed met with Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum of Dubai at Al Samha . They agreed to unite their emirates and invite others to join, forming the first step toward regional federation — the Union Accord.

December 2 marks a pivotal moment in the history of the United Arab Emirates — the day it became an independent, sovereign nation in 1971. But the choice of this date was not symbolic alone; it was the culmination of decades of treaties, negotiations, British withdrawal, and a shared vision among the region's leaders. This is the detailed story of how the UAE came to be, why December 2 became its National Day, and the constitutional foundations that shaped the Federation.The territory that is now the UAE was historically known as the Trucial States, a group of independent emirates along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf. British involvement in the region began in the early 19th century:British control over the region intensified in the mid-20th century, largely driven by oil exploration and geopolitical interests. They controlled oil concession grants and intervened in territorial disputes to secure exploration zones, including helping define inter-emirate boundaries in the 1950s.However, by 1968, economic constraints pushed the UK to announce a full military and political withdrawal from the Gulf by end of 1971. This move set off a chain of political activity among the Trucial States’ rulers to form a new, self-governed entity before the British departure.The initiative to form a unified state began with Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who became Ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966. Seeing the necessity of regional cooperation, he envisioned a federation that could unify resources and political will.Despite this progress, Bahrain and Qatar opted for independent statehood in August and September 1971, respectively.As the British exit approached, six emirates — Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Fujairah — committed to forming a new union.The Supreme Council of Rulers, composed of the Rulers of each emirate, became the highest federal authority. Decisions would require a majority vote — with both Abu Dhabi and Dubai needed to be part of the majority for any decision to pass.Article 138 specifically enabled the unification of the UAE Armed Forces under federal command, ensuring centralized defense policy and organization.Several shared factors helped facilitate a smooth transition to federation:Immediately after its formation, the UAE began establishing itself as a credible state in the international community:","December 2 marks the UAE’s formation, uniting seven emirates into a strong, independent federation.

Understanding solar eclipses – Types and what to expect

Total solar eclipse



The Moon completely covers the Sun.

Observers in a narrow zone experience brief daylight darkness.

Spectacular but rare. Partial solar eclipse



Only part of the Sun is covered by the Moon.

Creates a crescent or “bitten” appearance of the Sun.

This is the type occurring on September 21, 2025. Annular solar eclipse



The Moon is farther from Earth and doesn’t fully cover the Sun.

A ring of sunlight remains visible, forming the “ring of fire” effect.





In an extraordinary celestial turn, September 2025 is bookended by two eclipses, a lunar eclipse on the 7th and a solar eclipse just 15 days later. While the Moon recently turned a vivid red in a dramatic lunar display, the sky will offer another rare phenomenon: a partial solar eclipse on September 21, timed just before the equinox. However, this spectacle won’t be visible everywhere, and the UAE is among the regions that will miss it.On September 21, 2025, a partial solar eclipse will occur near the equinox, visible mainly across select regions in the Southern Hemisphere. Unlike a total eclipse, this will be a partial solar eclipse, where the Moon covers only part of the Sun, creating a crescent-shaped sliver of sunlight. Even as a partial eclipse, it provides a rare chance to observe the Sun’s changing face.This event holds additional significance because it closely precedes the September equinox, which falls on September 22, 2025. The equinox is one of two moments in the year when the Sun is directly above the Earth’s equator, resulting in nearly equal day and night lengths across the globe. Because of this timing, the eclipse is also being called an ""equinox eclipse"", adding to its astronomical and symbolic intrigue.This partial solar eclipse offers a unique chance for skywatchers in the Southern Hemisphere to observe the dynamic alignment of the Sun and Moon just before the autumnal equinox.The event also carries cultural and astrological meaning. This year's Pitru Paksha — a fortnight in the Hindu calendar dedicated to ancestral remembrance and rituals — uniquely begins with a lunar eclipse and ends with this solar eclipse, a rare alignment astrologers consider especially potent. This celestial pairing not only marks an important astronomical event but also deepens the spiritual significance of Pitru Paksha for many observers.Also Read: Saudi National Day 2025 The September 21 partial solar eclipse will be visible only in specific parts of the Southern Hemisphere, offering clear views to skywatchers in select regions.Skywatchers in visible regions must use proper solar filters or eclipse glasses to view the partial eclipse safely.Unlike the lunar eclipse on September 7, which had wide visibility across many countries, this solar eclipse will not be visible in the UAE or most parts of the Northern Hemisphere.Countries that will not witness any part of the eclipse include:This means millions of skywatchers across Asia and the Americas will miss the event entirely — a sharp contrast to the global excitement generated by the earlier lunar eclipse.A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, partially or fully blocking sunlight in specific areas on Earth. These alignments don’t happen frequently in the same place due to the precise positioning required.There are three main types of solar eclipses:Although this particular eclipse is not a total one, its timing, rarity, and symbolic links to the equinox and Pitru Paksha make it a notable event in the 2025 celestial calendar. This rare equinox eclipse marks the final solar eclipse of 2025, making it a fitting conclusion to a year rich in celestial and symbolic events.","The final solar eclipse of 2025 on September 21 will be partially visible in southern Australia.

Erik Siebert, the US attorney whose office has been investigating mortgage fraud allegations against New York attorney general Letitia James , has been told he is being removed from the position, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Friday.The move comes amid efforts by the Donald Trump administration to pursue criminal charges against James, who has been viewed as a ""political adversary"" of the US president.According to ABC News, Seibert had been ""resisting"" effort to charge James.Siebert, a career prosecutor, joined the Eastern District of Virginia in 2010, becoming part of an elite Justice Department office known for handling complex national security and criminal cases. A former District of Columbia police officer, he was nominated as US attorney by Trump in May with the support of Virginia’s Democratic senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine.It was unclear which official informed Siebert of his removal, the reasoning given, or who might replace him. No public announcement had been made by Friday afternoon, and spokespeople for his office and the Justice Department declined to comment.The allegations against James involve paperwork discrepancies related to her Brooklyn townhouse and a Virginia home. The Justice Department has been investigating for months but has not brought any charges, and there has been no indication that prosecutors have found evidence sufficient to secure an indictment.Her lawyers have strongly denied the allegations, calling the investigation an act of “political revenge.”The New York attorney general has long been a target of Trump’s criticism, in part due to a civil lawsuit she filed against him and his company that resulted in a substantial financial penalty. That penalty was overturned last month by an appeals court, which narrowly upheld a judge’s finding that Trump had engaged in fraud by inflating his wealth over decades.","Erik Siebert, the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has been told he is being removed from the position.

Donald Trump’s $100K H-1B Visa Fee Shocker Sparks Fears Among Indian Tech Workers And US Firms

Significance of the new rule





US President Donald Trump has signed a new proclamation on Friday (US time) introducing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applications, along with other changes to the skilled foreign worker programme, which has been under scrutiny for years.Originally designed to attract exceptional foreign talent for specialised technical roles, the H-1B programme has evolved into a channel for workers accepting salaries around $60,000 annually—well below the $100,000-plus compensation typical for American technology professionals, according to AP reports.""I think they're going to be very happy,"" Trump said, anticipating the tech industry’s response to the changes.Additionally, White House staff secretary Will Scharf said, ""One of the most abused visa systems is the H1-B non-immigrant visa programme. This is supposed to allow highly skilled labourers who work in fields that Americans don't work in to come into the United States of America. What this proclamation will do is raise the fee that companies pay to sponsor H-1B applicants to $100,000. This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers.It is noteworthy that First Lady Melania Trump, formerly Melania Knauss, received an H-1B visa in October 1996 for modelling work; she hails from Slovenia.Established in 1990, the H-1B programme targets individuals with bachelor's degrees or higher in difficult-to-fill positions, particularly in STEM fields. Critics argue the system enables lower wages and limited worker protections. The annual quota of 85,000 visas has traditionally been distributed through a lottery.Lottery applications fell nearly 40 per cent in 2024, following measures to prevent multiple entries that skewed selection odds. Major tech companies had requested reforms after surging applications reduced individual chances, prompting USCIS (US Citizenship and Immigration Services) to limit candidates to a single lottery entry, regardless of multiple job offers.Amazon currently leads in approvals with over 10,000, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple, and Google, with California hosting the largest H-1B workforce.Detractors note that many H-1B positions are junior-level roles rather than senior specialist jobs. Companies can reportedly reduce costs by classifying roles at lower skill levels while employing experienced workers. This has led to outsourcing of basic technical operations to consultancies such as Wipro, Infosys, HCL Technologies, Tata, IBM, and Cognizant, which employ foreign workers—mostly from India—contracted to American firms seeking cost savings.While critics welcome these changes, they are calling for further reforms. The AFL-CIO said the measures are ""some steps in the right direction"" but advocated for visas to be allocated based on highest wage offers rather than random selection—a proposal previously floated during Trump’s first term.The increased fees could affect hiring foreign workers as it'll cost more for companies. Currently, companies pay $215 to register for the lottery and $780 for a Form I-129, the employer-sponsored petition for a non-immigrant worker.The move is expected to discourage mass applications for H-1B visas, particularly affecting startups and small businesses that may struggle to absorb the higher upfront cost. Companies hiring foreign workers will now face significantly higher expenses, potentially shifting focus back to American tech workers.The change also aims to curb abuse of the H-1B system, where companies hire foreigners at lower wages for entry-level roles, while paying Americans significantly more for the same jobs. With the $100,000 fee, hiring foreign talent becomes equally costly, likely reducing opportunities for H-1B-dependent workers.The overhaul comes amid discussions to reform or end the lottery system and raise wage requirements, prioritizing high-wage, high-skill foreign workers and opening more entry-level jobs for US graduates. The administration’s broader goal is to protect American employment in the technology sector.","US President Donald Trump has signed a new proclamation introducing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applications.

Turning Point USA personality Alex Clark has said that Erika Kirk, the widow of slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk , is “more conservative” than him and is already making her mark on the non-profit organisation he co-founded.“I’m excited because Charlie had said on his show at one point that Erika was actually more conservative than he was, so I can’t wait to see what that means,” Clark told Fox News Digital on Thursday. She remarked that Erika, now the company's CEO and board chair, has energised staff since taking over, and described her as “an absolute force” who wants to “10x the organisation.”According to Clark, the group has received more than 62,000 requests for new high school and college chapters since Kirk’s September 10 assassination.

Hundreds March In NYC Urging Trump To Stop U.S. Arms To Israel Amid Gaza Starvation Crisis





In a renewed show of support for Israel, which faces growing global isolation over the Gaza war, the Donald Trump administration has notified Congress of plans to sell nearly $6 billion in weapons to the US ally.According to a US official cited by the Associated Press, the package includes a $3.8 billion deal for 30 AH-64 Apache helicopters—almost doubling Israel’s current fleet—and a $1.9 billion sale for 3,200 infantry assault vehicles. Delivery is expected to take at least two to three years.The State Department declined to comment on the proposal, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.The development comes as Washington struggles to broker an end to the nearly two-year conflict. Peace talks have stalled, particularly after Israel’s recent strike on Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar.Despite mounting international criticism and efforts by some Senate Democrats to block offensive arms transfers, the Trump administration has remained steadfast in backing Israel, whose latest offensive in Gaza City has drawn widespread condemnation.The previous Biden administration had paused shipments of 2,000-pound bombs over concerns about civilian casualties, but Trump reversed that hold after taking office in January. So far this year, his administration has approved roughly $12 billion in major military aid to Israel, including a $500 million deal in June to provide bomb guidance kits for precision strikes.","The package includes a $3.8 billion deal for 30 AH-64 Apache helicopters and a $1.9 billion sale for 3,200 infantry assault vehicles.

Former US transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg — revealed by Kamala Harris as her initial first choice for running mate before she ultimately selected Minnesota governor Tim Walz — said he was ""surprised"" by the disclosure, arguing that it is wrong to assume Americans would not vote for a Black woman as president and a gay man as vice president.“I believe in giving Americans more credit than assuming they couldn’t vote for a Black woman and a gay man on the same presidential ticket,” Buttigieg told Politico. He added: ""My experience in politics has been that the way you earn trust with voters is based mostly on what they think you’re going to do for their lives, not on categories… Politics is about the results we can get for people and not about these other things. ”In her memoir 107 Days — set for release September 23 — Harris writes that Buttigieg topped her initial list of eight potential running mates before she ultimately chose Walz. The then–vice president explained she felt it would be “too big of a risk” to ask voters to back a ticket led by a Black woman married to a Jewish man and paired with an openly gay running mate.“Part of me wanted to say, ‘Screw it, let’s just do it,’” Harris writes.“But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk.” She added that Buttigieg “also knew that — to our mutual sadness.”Buttigieg disputed that claim, saying such a discussion never took place between them.The book’s title refers to the 107 days between July 21, 2024, when then-President Joe Biden announced he would not seek re-election, and November 5 (Election Day). Harris, elevated to the Democratic ticket, ultimately lost with Walz to the Republican duo of Donald Trump and JD Vance — not only in the Electoral College but also in the national popular vote.The outcome marked Trump’s return to the White House, four years after his loss to Joe Biden in 2020 while serving as the incumbent president.","Former US transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg was revealed by Kamala Harris as her initial first choice for running mate before she ultimately selected Minnesota governor Tim Walz.

What is the present cost?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/100000-fee-for-companies-hiring-h-1bs-what-does-this-mean-what-is-the-present-cost/articleshow/124005598.cms,"Companies will be discouraged to hire H-1Bs if they have to pay $100,000 fee.

White House press secretary made a post on X quoting a media report

What is the present fee?



How will it impact US companies, H-1B hirings?



Hiring foreigners equally costly under new rule







In a major overhaul of the H-1B program, US President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order to add $100,000 application fee for the program. This will be a steep jump costing companies a bomb if they want to hire foreign talent under the H-1B visa program.The current fee is around $1,000 for an initial application. It is not yet known whether $100,000 is for every applicant or for certain types of petitions.Currently it takes $215 fee to register for the lottery and a $780 fee for a Form I-129 -- a petition for a non-immigrant worker filed by an employer sponsor.While most details of this new measure are not known, this will discourage companies from reducing the number of applications as companies hiring foreign workers under H-1B would have to pay a much larger upfront cost. Because of the cost, fewer applications may be filed; it could particularly hurt start-ups or small businesses less able to absorb the cost.For American tech workers, it will be good news and companies will now turn towards them.Companies have been abusing the H-1B visa program by hiring foreigners at a cheaper rate for entry-level roles to save money, as they would have to pay Americans much higher wages for the same role.But the $100,000 fee would make hiring foreigners equally costly. People who rely on H-1B sponsorship (e.g. in tech, research, etc.) could see fewer opportunities or more competitive pressure.The move comes as there have been demands to end H-1B programs altogether -- given US' present relationship with China and India, as mostly Chinese and Indians get hired under H-1B program for US tech sector. The administration was already planning to cancel the lottery system and raise the wage level so that only high-wage and high-skill people are brought in from foreign countries while American graduates get entry-level jobs.","The current fee is around $1,000 for an initial application.

At least 11 people were killed in two separate blasts in Pakistan’s restive Balochistan province on Friday, officials said, underscoring the growing wave of militancy in the mineral-rich region bordering Afghanistan and Iran.A suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a convoy of paramilitary soldiers in Dasht, near the Iranian border, killing five people, including three troops, according to two local government officials who spoke to AFP. The separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack.In a separate incident the same evening, a blast near an Afghan border crossing killed six labourers, local official Imtiaz Ali Baloch told AFP. No group immediately claimed responsibility for that attack. Baloch istan has long been a flashpoint for violence, with separatist groups waging a decade-long insurgency against the Pakistani state, alleging exploitation of local resources and discrimination against the Baloch people. The military has responded with a sweeping counter-terrorism campaign, which rights groups say has involved enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions.Earlier this month, 15 people were killed in a suicide bombing claimed by the Islamic State group at a political rally in the provincial capital, Quetta.","A suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a convoy of paramilitary soldiers in Dasht, near the Iranian border, killing five people, including three troops.

More Than 150,000 Evacuated in Pakistan Punjab After India’s Flood Alert

Relief in Jalalpur Pirwala, Alipur

Waters recede, but threat not over

Fields and cattle lost





Even as floodwaters began to recede in parts of south Punjab, the scale of destruction remains staggering, nearly 2.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes and at least 101 lives have been lost, the Dawn reported.The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has called the ongoing evacuation and relief drive one of the largest in recent memory. More than 1,500 boats were deployed to rescue stranded families, with 12,427 people evacuated from villages along the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers.Multan, Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan districts bore the brunt of the floods. Entire villages were submerged — including the union council of Lati Mari in Alipur tehsil, home to 40,000 people.“Nearly 15,000 people from our basti had to leave on their own as water rose,” said Syed Kausar Shah, a local resident. “Homes and crops were destroyed, and people escaped on a hired boat. Some now live in relief camps, others under the open sky.” He added that two villagers drowned while attempting to flee.Officials declared Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur tehsils safe after a major flood wave passed through Head Panjnad.Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu confirmed that 100,000 people had been evacuated from Jalalpur Pirwala alone in three days.Breaches in Shujabad and Jalalpur Pirwala are now being filled, while helicopters and drones drop food and medicine into cut-off areas. Boats continue to ferry supplies into rural belts.At a press briefing in Bahawalpur, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Panjnad Headworks still faced a “high flood” but levels had dropped from 700,000 cusecs earlier this week to 575,000 cusecs on Saturday. By evening, the Flood Forecasting Division reported further decline to 492,695 cusecs.“There is no threat to Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur cities,” Kathia assured, adding that water in Bahawalpur would also recede within 24 hours. He called the scale of evacuation “historic,” stressing that Multan could have faced forced evacuations if operations were delayed.According to official data, 4,447 mouzas across 28 districts have been inundated. Alongside the mass displacement of people, more than 2.19 million cattle were rescued and shifted to higher ground.For now, the rivers appear to be calming, the Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala was recorded at 95,000 cusecs, categorised as medium flood.

Protests Erupt in Pakistan, as Imran Khan Supporters Call for His Release

The sons of jailed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said their father “will not be broken” by his “unlawful” imprisonment, as his legal team lodged an appeal with the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture.The elder son, Sulaiman Khan, condemned Khan's treatment in a statement attached to the appeal:Our father is being kept in conditions that no human being should endure. These are violations of his rights, and they amount to torture.”The younger son, Kasim Khan, said:The UN has already recognised that our father’s imprisonment is arbitrary and unlawful. What he is enduring now shows how far the regime will go to break him. But he will not be broken.”Sulaiman and Kasim are the cricketer-turned-politician’s sons with British filmmaker Jemima Goldsmith, with whom he was married for nine years until 2004. They live in the UK with Goldsmith.The appeal, filed by the US-based law firm Perseus Strategies on behalf of Khan’s legal team, alleged a “systematic pattern of abuse, including prolonged solitary confinement, denial of medical care, contaminated food, and restricted access to legal counsel and family visits.”His lawyers argued that these conditions breach Pakistan’s obligations under the UN Convention against Torture (CAT) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). They urged the UN to press authorities to safeguard the former PM’s physical and mental well-being.Khan has been in prison since August 2023 after being charged in multiple cases.","The sons of jailed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said their father “will not be broken” by his “unlawful” imprisonment.

Aid meant for relief diverted? Pakistan funding reconstruction of LeT HQ destroyed in Op Sindoor; what intel says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/aid-meant-for-relief-diverted-pakistan-funding-reconstruction-of-let-hq-destroyed-in-op-sindoor-what-intel-says/articleshow/123878923.cms,"Intel Reveals Pak Using Aid To Rebuild LeT HQ Hit In Op Sindoor, Experts Say ‘Time To Strike Again’

Poll Do you believe the reconstruction of LeT's Markaz Taiba is a threat to regional security? Yes, it poses a significant threat. No, it will not impact security.

How India destroyed LeT HQ



Why its reconstruction is a matter of concern?







Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba, which was destroyed in precision airstrikes during Operation Sindoor on May 7. According to ANI, citing an agency dossier, LeT has launched fundraising campaigns under the pretext of flood relief to support the redevelopment project.Moreover, Islamabad has already allocated PKR 4 crore, though the group estimates costs at over PKR 15 crore. The dossier stated that its army and ISI remain involved in sustaining and reviving LeT.Senior commanders Maulana Abu Zar and Yunus Shah Bukhari are overseeing the project, due by February 2026, mirroring past cases where LeT diverted humanitarian aid, including most of the 2005 earthquake relief, to militant infrastructure.This comes amidst Pakistan's continuous assertions on global platforms that it was combating terrorism.The Indian Air Force (IAF), earlier this year, showcased the extensive damage caused to LeT Muridke headquarters during Operation Sindoor, highlighting the precision and reach of the strikes.Muridke, home to LeT’s Markaz Taiba, was identified as a critical target. The strikes hit senior leadership residential areas and office buildings where commanders convened for planning and operations.The IAF showed videos captured directly from the weapons, pointing out the level of devastation within the complex.The airstrikes reportedly killed around a dozen high-value terrorists, including Yusuf Azhar, the IC-814 hijacker, Abu Jundal (also known as Mudassar), the Muridke chief of LeT, and the son of the planner of the 2016 Nagrota attack. The operation, conducted in retaliation for the Pahalgam killings, reinforced India’s ability to carry out precise, high-impact missions inside enemy territory.The ongoing reconstruction of LeT Markaz Taiba headquarters has raised serious concerns regarding regional security, given the facility’s central role in training and radicalizing terrorists. Established in 2000, the complex serves as both a residence for senior commanders and a training ground where recruits are instructed in intelligence gathering, arms handling, and other operational skills. Analysts warn that reviving the facility could strengthen LeT’s operational capabilities and enable the recruitment of new militants.Markaz Taiba functions as the “alma mater” of LeT, providing courses that combine physical and arms training with ideological indoctrination. The center attracts recruits from within Pakistan and abroad, using religious and radicalization programs to cultivate loyalty and operational skills among future militants. Its facilities, including a mosque and guest house financed by Osama bin Laden, underscore the longstanding support the organization has received from international terror networks.The scale of the operation at Markaz Taiba further amplifies the threat. The facility reportedly trains around 1,000 students annually, preparing them for operational roles within LeT. Past evidence has shown that graduates of this center have gone on to participate in high-profile attacks, including the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, highlighting the direct link between the facility and acts of cross-border terrorism targeting India.LeT’s historical connection with Pakistan’s intelligence apparatus adds another layer of concern. Senior commanders at the facility, including those who oversaw training for the 26/11 perpetrators, have operated under the guidance of the ISI.","Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba.

A 21-year-old girl was brutally gang-raped in Afghan Refugee Camp No. 16 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Haripur, The Express Tribune reported.Police on Saturday reported a brutal sexual assault. According to the First Information Report (FIR), the woman was on her way to the camp for work when the suspects dragged her into nearby fields, raped her for about two hours, and robbed her of Rs3,000 and a gold nose pin. She named the accused as Bacha, Nadi, Rozi Khan, Javed and Naseer, and said she was also beaten when she tried to resist.Khalabat police have registered a case against all five under Section 375A of the Pakistan Penal Code, which prescribes death or life imprisonment for gang rape. The incident has sparked outrage among local residents, and the victim’s family has demanded exemplary punishment for the accused.The UN refugee agency has reported that the expiry of the Proof of Registration (PoR) card grace period on August 31 has led to a sharp surge in Afghan returns from Pakistan, as per Dawn.According to a situation report released on Friday, voluntary returns in August rose by 254 per cent and deportations by 191 per cent compared with July, coinciding with the launch of the third phase of the ‘Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan’ (IFPR).As of September 4, a total of 531,700 Afghans had returned from Pakistan. Since April, more than 483,700 have gone back to Afghanistan, including 145,200 in August alone, with about 55,000 making the journey in just the last four days of the month.","A 21-year-old girl was brutally gang-raped in Afghan Refugee Camp No. 16 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Haripur.

Hamas-style Ambush Stuns Pak: 12 Soldiers FALL Into Pakistani Taliban Trap, Drones Captured | Watch





A Pakistani Taliban ambush in northwest Pakistan on Saturday resulted in the deaths of at least 12 soldiers, as confirmed by local government and security officials to AFP.During a military convoy's passage through South Waziristan district at 4:00 am, ""armed men opened fire from both sides with heavy weapons"", resulting in 12 security personnel deaths and four injuries, according to a local government official.The area's security officer verified the casualties and reported that the assailants captured the convoy's weaponry.The Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban, took responsibility for the attack via social media.This incident ranks among the most severe attacks in recent months within Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the TTP previously controlled significant territories until a 2014 military operation forced their retreat.Since the Afghan Taliban's return to power in Kabul in 2021, militant activities have intensified in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border regions. Although distinct organisations, the TTP maintains close ties with the Afghan Taliban.Pakistan contends that Afghanistan fails to remove militants who use Afghan soil to attack Pakistan, whilst Kabul authorities reject these claims.Local residents across various Khyber Pakhtunkhwa districts have recently reported TTP-branded graffiti appearing on buildings, expressing concerns about a potential return to the group's previous control during the height of the US ""War on Terror"".A high-ranking local government official recently informed AFP about increased TTP fighter presence and attack frequency.Since January 1, approximately 460 individuals, predominantly security forces personnel, have lost their lives in attacks by anti-state armed groups in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces, according to AFP's records.Pakistan experienced its most lethal period in nearly ten years during the previous year, with over 1,600 fatalities, including almost half being soldiers and police officers, as reported by the Islamabad-based Center for Research and Security Studies.","Pakistani Taliban ambush in northwest Pakistan kills at least 12 soldiers.

Together since the 1960s, they married in Kabul in 1970.""Two British nationals named Peter and Barbara Reynolds, who had violated the laws of Afghanistan, were released from custody today following the judicial process,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said on social media.He added that the government ""does not view the matters of citizens from a political or transactional angle"".“God is good, as they say in Afghanistan,” Barbie Reynolds said after she arrived at Kabul International Airport to fly out of the country.The Reynolds’ family members in the U.K. repeatedly called for the couple’s release, saying they were being mistreated and held on undisclosed charges. While the Taliban rejected the abuse allegations, they have never explained what prompted their detention, AP reported.“This is a moment of immense joy for our family, and we are deeply thankful to everyone who played a role in securing their release,” the family said in a statement after their release, mentioning Qatar and the British governments.“This experience has reminded us of the power of diplomacy, empathy, and international co-operation. While the road to recovery will be long as our parents regain their health and spend time with their family, today is a day of tremendous joy and relief.”Their son Jonathan told Sky News in April his parents had ""never heard one accusation or one charge"". He said the British govt had offered to evacuate them when the Taliban took over, to which they replied: ""Why would we leave these people in their darkest hour?Qatar, an energy-rich nation on the Arabian Peninsula that mediated talks between the U.S. and the Taliban before the American withdrawal, assisted in releasing the Reynolds couple from Afghanistan, a diplomat said. The couple left Afghanistan on Friday. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations involved in the case.Earlier this month, the Taliban said they had reached an agreement with US envoys on a prisoner exchange as part of an effort to normalise relations. The meeting came after the Taliban in March released US citizen George Glezmann, who was abducted while travelling through Afghanistan as a tourist. Afghanistan remains a focus of US President Donald Trump. On Thursday, while visiting the UK, Trump suggested that he was working to reestablish a US presence at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Zakir Jalaly, an official at the Taliban’s Foreign Ministry, dismissed the idea.Reynolds couple were flown to Doha and are now on their way home to be reunited with their family.","Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband Peter, 80, were taken into custody by the Taliban’s interior ministry on February 1 and moved to a maximum-security prison in Kabul in March.

Today is Constitution Day — the day the Nepali people, after 70 years of struggle, saw the constitution enacted by the

Constituent Assembly

they themselves had elected. It is the day when a democratic republic, a federal inclusive system, and the rights of the people were established.

The challenges we faced while drafting this constitution are still fresh in your memory. Even overcoming blockades and threats to the country’s

sovereignty

, the constitution was promulgated. Therefore, Nepal’s constitution is a blueprint for the future that the Nepali people have written for themselves.

After the constitution was enacted, we were building transport structures connecting north and south to make the landlocked country accessible and resilient against blockades. We had also signed transport agreements with our northern neighbor and were expanding the strength of our sovereignty. We were laying the foundations for development structures and the economy was growing steadily.

Last week, during what was supposed to be a peaceful Jan Gatha (Jan-G) protest, intruders entered — as the organizers themselves had claimed. Conspirators who infiltrated caused violence, resulting in the deaths of our youth. The government had not ordered the demonstrators to be fired upon. The investigation must determine how automatic weapons, which the police did not possess, were used. I again express my grief over the incident, pay tribute to the deceased youth, and wish speedy recovery to the injured.

At this moment, our constitution is under a major attack. After my resignation from the position of Prime Minister, Singha Durbar was set on fire — the map of Nepal was burned, and the national symbol was targeted for erasure. Offices of public representatives, courts, business institutions, political party offices, the homes of leaders and activists, and personal property were systematically destroyed.

I will not speak much today about the

conspiracy

behind this; time itself will reveal many truths. Was our country truly being destroyed, or was anger being stirred up merely through fabricated narratives of destruction? Our new generation will realize this for themselves. Society that once criticized the crowds at airports will, in time, understand what it means when external movement is blocked. Our new generation will come to understand all of this.

However, this is something that must be understood now; if not, our country’s sovereignty will exist only in history.

Our youth must have read the history of Bhim Malla’s death sentence. Bhim Malla, after expanding the country’s borders and returning, was executed upon his return, leaving only regret as the option. Outcomes of discontent fueled beyond reality only serve as lessons in regret, and such regret will deepen the memory of the nation being built.

All Nepalis across generations must unite — to face attacks on our sovereignty and defend our constitution. Sovereignty is our existence, and the constitution is the armor of our freedom. Only our unity can lift and protect the country from this unimaginable crisis.

I appeal to everyone —

Let us protect the constitution, let us defend our sovereignty.

Nepal In Flames: PM KP Oli Resigns, Flees In Army Chopper As Gen Z Protesters Burn Down Parliament





Days after massive unrest upended Nepal’s political situation, deposed Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has shifted from army protection to a private residence. According to news agency PTI, citing Nepal army sources, Oli spent nine days under army security before moving out.Oli had flown to an army barracks -- believed to be in the Shivapuri forest area, north of Kathmandu on September 9, immediately after the Gen Z-led protests turned violent and he resigned as Prime Minister.After nine days in army security, the chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) (CPN-UML) relocated to a private location, the Nepal Army confirmed.However, his current address has not been officially disclosed. Media reports indicate that Oli has shifted to a private house in the Gundu area of Bhaktapur district, about 15 km east of Kathmandu.During the second day of the protests on September 9, Gen Z demonstrators burned Oli’s house in Balkot, Bhaktapur, to ashes. On the same day, while Oli was at the official residence of the Nepal Prime Minister, protesters also partially torched the Prime Minister’s Office in Balkot. He was safely evacuated by a Nepal Army helicopter.Several other senior political figures -- including former Prime Ministers Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda,’ Sher Bahadur Deuba, Jhalanath Khanal, Madhav Kumar Nepal, and others -- had also taken shelter under army protection for a few days. At present, only Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba and his spouse, former foreign minister Arzju Rana Deuba, remain under army security. The couple sustained injuries during the protests and are currently receiving hospital treatment under military protection.Meanwhile, the CPN-UML, led by Oli, is planning a separate event to mark Constitution Day on September 19 at Chyasal in Lalitpur district, where the party’s central office is located. However, it remains uncertain whether Oli will attend the programme.Nepal will observe Constitution Day on Ashoj 3 of the Bikram Era calendar—September 19 this year—marking the promulgation of the country’s constitution drafted by the Constituent Assembly on September 20, 2015.The Nepal government is organising a grand celebration in Kathmandu on September 19 to mark Constitution Day and has declared a public holiday for the occasion. President Ramchandra Paudel, Prime Minister Sushila Karki, the Nepal army chief, ministers and other dignitaries are scheduled to attend.","Deposed PM KP Sharma Oli has shifted from army protection to a private residence.

Nepal protesters delete social media presence as police probe closes in,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/nepal-protesters-delete-social-media-presence-as-police-probe-closes-in/articleshow/123984686.cms,"Nepal Lifts Social Media Ban Following Deadly Protests





With Nepal slowly regaining normalcy after the deadly Sept 8-9 protests that left more than 70 people dead, police have turned their focus to identifying those behind the violence. The crackdown has triggered a 'digital retreat' among many protesters, who are deleting social media accounts or going silent online to avoid detection.Nepal police said they have received nearly 30,000 emails from citizens containing photos and videos that document arson, looting, and attacks on public buildings. The evidence was submitted after an appeal by police urging people to share digital material pertaining to the protests while promising not to disclose the identity of the senders to ensure their safety.DIG Binod Ghimire, spokesperson of Nepal police, said the huge volume of citizen responses received would aid the investigation. ""The videos and photos that we have got from citizens will help us track down those involved in the violence. We will analyse the data and act accordingly. We urge people to share more evidence, if any.""His statement came amid another appeal by Kathmandu police cautioning people against buying looted items.During the protests, many had looted valuables from banks, supermarkets, jewellery shops and other business establishments. Some perpetrators had also looted weapons and other items from police stations across the country.Earlier on Wednesday, ministers of the newly-formed interim govt visited the federal parliament building to assess the destruction. Rameshwor Prasad Khanal, the interim finance minister, said: ""The damage to properties is extensive across the country. We are assessing the loss after which necessary action would be taken to repair or rebuild properties. Our PM has already said that the vandalism and arson was a criminal act which will be punished. Police are therefore working towards bringing the perpetrators to justice.""Meanwhile, in Kathmandu, the sense of unease is palpable, especially among younger residents. Many say the fear of being linked to the unrest has changed everyday routines. ""Youngsters are now not just hesitant to come out of their homes but have also deleted their social media accounts,"" said Prashant Shrestha, who runs a souvenir shop in Thamel. ""There's fear of being identified for the loot and vandalism that caused so much loss to both public and private property. ""Ram Bahadur Chhetri, 64, a retired govt employee, termed the vandalism as a 'brainless act' while demanding strict action against perpetrators. ""Our country had somehow managed to get back on its feet after the 2015 earthquake . Now, again some people under the garb of protests against corruption, caused unforgettable damage. It will take years for us to cope with this loss,"" said Chhetri.","Nepal police have received nearly 30,000 emails from citizens containing photos and videos that document arson, looting, and attacks on public buildings.

Why is Trump eyeing Bagram airbase?







United States president Donald Trump on Thursday said he was working to ""get back"" Bagram airbase, which the United States gave up control of after the 2021 Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.""We're trying to get it back, by the way, that could be a little breaking news. We're trying to get it back because they need things from us. We want that base back,"" Trump said at a press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.Trump claimed his intention to return American forces to Afghanistan’s Bagram Airbase is because “China now controls Bagram.”About a month earlier, Trump had suggested the US might return to Afghanistan, saying, “We are going to keep a small force on Bagram” to counter China’s growing influence.Trump stressed that his focus on Bagram was not about Afghanistan itself.“We wanted to keep this base because of China, not because of Afghanistan,” he said, noting the airbase’s proximity to China’s nuclear facilities, “just an hour” away, as its key strategic value.Bagram Airbase has long been one of the United States’ most important military assets in South Asia, valued for both its location and its capabilities.Located about 40 kilometres north of Kabul, it sits close to the borders of China, Pakistan, Iran, and Central Asia, giving the US a forward-operating hub near some of the world’s most volatile regions.Its proximity to China’s Xinjiang region, where Beijing maintains nuclear and military facilities, made it particularly significant for American strategic planning.During the US presence in Afghanistan, Bagram was the largest American airbase in the country. It had multiple runways capable of handling heavy bombers and transport aircraft, housed thousands of US and Nato troops at its peak, and included extensive infrastructure such as command centers, detention facilities, and logistics hubs. This made it the nerve center of US military operations in Afghanistan for nearly two decades.Beyond Afghanistan, Bagram gave Washington the ability to project power across South and Central Asia, carry out surveillance, support counterterrorism missions, and monitor regional adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, and Pakistan. Symbolically too, the base represented the scale of America’s military footprint in the region.Its abrupt abandonment during the 2021 withdrawal was seen by many analysts as a strategic mistake, as it left the facility open to Taliban control and raised concerns about possible Chinese interest in the site.","US president Donald Trump said he was working to ""get back"" Bagram airbase.

Putin Warns UK Against Interference In Ukraine Truce Negotiations | Watch





UK secret intelligence service chief Richard Moore on Friday said there is “absolutely no evidence” that Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to negotiate peace in Ukraine, accusing him of deceiving the world with false promises of dialogue.In a parting speech at the British consulate in Istanbul, Moore said Putin was “stringing us along” while seeking to impose his “imperial will by all means at his disposal.” “Bluntly, Putin has bitten off more than he can chew. He thought he was going to win an easy victory, but he – and many others – underestimated the Ukrainians,” Moore said.Moore warned that the Russian leader is “mortgaging his country’s future for his own personal legacy and a distorted version of history,” adding that the war is accelerating Russia’s decline.The head of Britain’s secret intelligence service, will retire in September this year after serving five years in the role. He will be preceded by UK's first woman intelligence officer, Blaise Metreweli.Moore, a former UK ambassador to Turkey, said the 2022 invasion had backfired on Moscow by strengthening Ukrainian national identity, speeding Kyiv’s westward shift, and prompting Sweden and Finland to join NATO. “Putin has sought to convince the world that Russian victory is inevitable. But he lies. He lies to the world. He lies to his people. Perhaps he even lies to himself,” Moore told reporters.The Ukraine conflict, now in its third year, continues to rage primarily in the country’s east, with tens of thousands killed since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February 2022.","Richard Moore, head of Britain's secret intelligence service, will retire in September this year.

‘Do As I Say Or…’: Trump Loses Temper At NATO Nations Buying Russian Oil; Warns Them To Stop…





US President Donald Trump claimed that the UK Prime Minister supported his criticism of NATO and EU countries over their continued energy purchases from Russia, despite the West’s broader stance on sanctions, calling it a key obstacle to achieving peace in Ukraine.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his return to Washington after a state visit to the United Kingdom, Trump said, “The UK Prime Minister was embarrassed about me calling out NATO and EU countries over buying oil from Russia. And he said that’s not good. He appreciated that I said it, but he said that’s not good. How about that?”Trump further stated that the UK PM Keir Starmer expressed willingness to take action on the issue. “He also agrees to stop buying oil from Russia, and he’s willing to impose sanctions too. And he’s not one of the culprits in terms of Russian oil,”Trump added.The remarks appear to underline ongoing tensions over Europe's energy dependence on Russia, which has remained a point of friction between Washington and several NATO allies. While Trump's comments suggest some level of private consensus with the UK on the issue, there has been no official confirmation yet from Downing Street regarding any new commitments.He reiterated his belief that cutting off Russian oil exports is essential to bringing an end to the war in Ukraine. “Ultimately, if oil prices go down, or if Russia is not selling oil, they have no choice but to settle. When EU or Nato nations are buying oil from Russia, that’s not the greatest thing,” he said.Trump also admitted that the conflict in Ukraine has proven more complex than he had initially expected. He said he felt “let down” by Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite earlier confidence in their personal rapport to help negotiate a peace deal.Trump has consistently criticised Nato and EU nations for what he sees as a contradiction - relying on US defence support while continuing economic ties with Russia through energy trade.(With inputs from agencies)",US President Donald Trump claimed that the UK Prime Minister supported his criticism of NATO and EU countries over their continued energy purchases from Russia.

EU Chief Kaja Kallas To India: Rethink Moscow Ties Or Risk Free Trade Agreement With European Union





The UK has carried out its first deportation under a new returns treaty with France, with home secretary Shabana Mehmood calling it an “important first step” in efforts to curb illegal English Channel crossings.“This is an important first step to securing our borders. It sends a message to people crossing in small boats: if you enter the UK illegally, we will seek to remove you,” Mehmood said Thursday. She added that the government would continue to challenge “last-minute, vexatious” attempts in court, and stressed that Britain would continue to provide refuge through “safe, legal and managed routes — not dangerous crossings. ”According to UK home office sources, the deportee is an Indian national who crossed into Britain illegally on a small boat in August. He was flown on a commercial flight to Paris under the “one-in, one-out” deal signed with France. Once returned, he will be offered a voluntary repatriation scheme to India; refusal would bar him from applying for asylum and could result in enforced removal.The pilot agreement, which began in August and will run until June 2026, allows the UK to deport migrants who arrive illegally while accepting an equal number from France through a new safe and legal asylum pathway, subject to strict eligibility and security checks.The first arrivals under this reciprocal route are expected in Britain in the coming days.Official data show that 2,715 Indian nationals were in UK immigration detention as of August — more than double last year’s figure, an increase of 108 per cent. The deported man is among the first group of migrants held by UK Border Force since the treaty came into force.According to the home office, more than 35,000 people with no right to remain were removed from the UK in the past year, with returns of foreign criminals up 14 per cent and asylum-related removals up 28 per cent.","The deportee is an Indian national who crossed into Britain illegally on a small boat in August.

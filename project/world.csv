Donald Trump: 'Won’t back down': Mexico threatens legal action against Google over 'Gulf of America' name change,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/wont-back-down-mexico-threatens-legal-action-against-google-over-gulf-of-america-name-change/articleshow/118230854.cms,"Mexico has warned it may take legal action against Google over its decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the "" Gulf of America "" for users in the United States, following an executive order signed by US President Donald Trump Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Thursday that her government had already challenged Google over the name change but had not received a satisfactory response. “We do have a dispute with Google at the moment,” Sheinbaum said during her morning news conference. “And if necessary, we will file a civil suit,"" she added.The dispute began after Trump, shortly after returning to the White House on January 20, signed executive orders renaming the Gulf of Mexico.Sheinbaum argued that Trump's order only applied to the United States' continental shelf and should not affect Mexican territory. “What we are saying to Google is: check the order that was issued by the White House and signed by President Trump. You will see that it does not refer to the entire Gulf, but to the continental shelf,” she said.Despite Mexico sending an official letter to Google, the tech giant has stood by its decision. Google said last month that its policy is to apply name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.The name of the Gulf on Google Maps varied based on the user’s location. In the United States, it appeared as the ""Gulf of America,"" while in Mexico, it remained the ""Gulf of Mexico."" In many other regions, both names were shown as ""Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)."" Apple has also updated its maps to display the new name for US users.Sheinbaum has repeatedly defended the name ""Gulf of Mexico,"" noting that its use dates back to at least 1607 and is recognised by the United Nations . She has also pointed to historical maps from before 1848, when the US seized a third of Mexico’s territory, as evidence of the region’s historical ties. In response to Trump’s move, she has jokingly suggested that Google rename the US as ""Mexican America"" when searched.Mexico and the US have a long history of disputes over geographic names.The border river between Texas and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas is another example—Mexico calls it the ""Río Bravo,"" while in the US, it is known as the ""Rio Grande.""The renaming has also sparked outrage beyond Mexico, with Indigenous groups in Alaska condemning Trump’s decision to revert Denali to Mount McKinley.Sheinbaum has made it clear that Mexico will not back down. “If they continue to insist, we will too,” she said. “We are even thinking of a lawsuit, because they are even naming Mexican territory, which is our continental shelf.”","Mexico has warned it may take legal action against Google over its decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico.

"Gaza Conflict: Ceasefire crisis averted? Hamas moves forward with hostage release amid warnings from Donald Trump, Israel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/ceasefire-crisis-averted-hamas-moves-forward-with-hostage-release-amid-warnings-from-donald-trump-israel/articleshow/118229518.cms,"Talks in Cairo

Trump's plan to 'own Gaza'

Turkey, North Korea and Houthis condemn Trump

Israel-Hamas war

Hamas has announced on Thursday it will release three more Israeli hostages, easing tensions over the ceasefire deal in Gaza. The militant group had earlier threatened to delay the handover, accusing Israel of failing to meet its commitments, including allowing essential supplies into the region.Israel, backed by newly elected US President Donald Trump, had warned it would resume fighting if the hostages were not freed. With Hamas confirming the release will go ahead.Israel’s defence minister Israel Katz also issued a stark warning on Wednesday, declaring that “all hell will break loose” if the militant group fails to release hostages as scheduled this weekend.Hamas said it had engaged in discussions with Egyptian officials and was in contact with Qatar’s prime minister over bringing more shelters, medical aid, fuel, and heavy equipment for clearing rubble in Gaza. The group claimed mediators had assured them that obstacles to aid delivery would be removed.Shortly after Hamas' announcement, spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou confirmed to The Associated Press that the hostages would be freed on Saturday as part of the existing ceasefire agreement. Egypt’s state-run Qahera TV reported that mediation efforts by Egypt and Qatar had successfully resolved the dispute.As negotiations continue, Trump's proposal to relocate Gaza’s 2 million Palestinians to other countries has sparked debate. The US president has repeatedly claimed that America will ""own Gaza"".Israel has welcomed the idea, but it has been rejected by Palestinian leaders and Arab nations, who refuse to absorb refugees. Human rights groups have warned that such a move could constitute a war crime under international law.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with top military and security officials on Thursday, discussing the situation at the army’s Southern Command headquarters near the Gaza border.His far-right allies are pushing for a return to war once the first phase of hostage exchanges concludes, aiming to implement Trump’s plan and crush Hamas, which still controls the territory after months of devastating attacks.Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised Trump’s approach, saying it threatens global peace.“To tell the truth, I do not find Mr Trump’s behaviour in the past period and his current statements and challenges to many countries in the world to be right, and I do not see these as a positive development,” Erdogan told an Indonesian television anchor.Meanwhile, Yemen’s Houthi leader Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi issued a warning, threatening military action if the plan proceeds.“We will never remain passive in the face of such an aggressive plan against the Palestinian people,” he said in a televised speech.North Korean state media has strongly criticised the US, accusing it of “slaughter and robbery” over Trump’s plan to take control of the Gaza Strip and remove its more than two million Palestinian residents.“The world is now boiling like a porridge pot over the US’ bombshell declaration,” the Korean central news agency (KCNA) said in a statement on Wednesday.The war began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. More than half have since been released through deals or rescues, but 73 remain in captivity, with around half believed to be dead.According to Gaza's health ministry, over 48,000 Palestinians have been killed, most of them women and children. Israel claims to have killed more than 17,000 militants but has not provided evidence.Israel’s military campaign has left vast areas of Gaza in ruins. The war displaced 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents. Many have returned since the ceasefire, only to find destruction—rubble, human remains, and devastation.Despite the ceasefire, violence has continued. Gaza’s health ministry reported that Israeli fire has killed at least 92 Palestinians and wounded over 800 since the truce began. The Israeli military said it had targeted individuals who entered restricted areas or approached its forces in violation of the agreement.","Hamas confirms it will release three more Israeli hostages on Saturday.

"Trump slaps reciprocal tariffs, says India has most duties",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-slaps-reciprocal-tariffs-says-india-has-most-duties/articleshow/118229366.cms,"(File photo)

In almost all cases, countries charging us vastly more than we charge them: Trump

WASHINGTON: Hours ahead of his meeting with PM Modi, US President Donald Trump inked plans Thursday for sweeping ""reciprocal tariffs"" hitting both allies and competitors, in a dramatic escalation of an international trade war that economists warn could fuel inflation at home.The president signed a measure directing the US Trade Representative and Commerce secretary to propose new levies on a country-by-country basis in an effort to rebalance trade relations - a sweeping process that could take weeks or months to complete, according to a senior White House official, leaving no clear date when they would take effect.Trump named India in his announcement, saying the country had more tariffs than nearly any other nation.Fresh import taxes would be customised for each country, meant to offset not just their own levies on US goods but also non-tariff barriers the nations impose in the form of subsidies, regulations, value-added taxes and other factors that act to limit US trade, said the official prior to the announcement. AgenciesI've decided, for purposes of fairness, that I will charge a reciprocal tariff, meaning whatever countries charge the United States,"" Trump said in the Oval Office. ""In almost all cases, they're charging us vastly more than we charge them but those days are over.""Reciprocal tariffs would be the president's latest step to rework American trade relationships. When it comes to high tariffs, India - like many other developing countries - is often cited as an offender. Trump has repeatedly criticised the high tariffs India charges on American goods, like Harley Davidson motorcycles.Earlier this month, India tried to head off those criticisms by announcing it would voluntarily drop tariffs on certain US products, including motorcycles.""Major exporting nations of the world attack our markets with punishing tariffs and even more punishing non-tariff barriers,"" Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro told reporters, taking aim at EU in particular over VAT.Washington will start by examining economies with which United States has its biggest deficits or ""most egregious issues"", said a White House official. Trump acknowledged Thursday that US prices ""could go up"" due to tariffs, but he expressed confidence that they would ultimately ease.Trump has announced a broad range of tariffs targeting some of the biggest American trading partners since taking office, arguing that they would help tackle unfair practices - and in some cases using the threats to influence policy. A White House official said US has been ""treated unfairly,"" saying a lack of reciprocity is a reason behind its ""persistent annual trade deficit in goods"".","US President Donald Trump inked plans for sweeping ""reciprocal tariffs"" hitting both allies and competitors.

"Over $22 billion funnelled for migrants' cars, home loans, startups, reveals shocking report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/over-22-billion-funnelled-for-migrants-cars-home-loans-startups-reveals-shocking-report/articleshow/118225248.cms,"After USAID, another shocking report came, revealing the data of the US department of health and human services' (HHS) migrants grant and throwing light on misuse.According to the watchdog investigation, the grants for migrants significantly increased between 2020 and 2024, providing them financial support for vehicle purchases, housing, and business credit development. The report revealed that a total expenditure of $22.6 billion has been done from the money paid by tax payer, New York Post reported.The HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), previously criticised for losing contact with 32,000 migrant children, distributed substantial funds to various non-profit organisations. According to auditors from OpenTheBooks, who shared their findings with The Post, this created substantial incentives for asylum seekers at the US border.ORR, responsible for refugee settlement in America, substantially expanded the number of non-citizens eligible for funding during President Joe Biden's administration. The fiscal year 2023 alone saw over $10 billion allocated to grant-receiving organisations.School-age children are dropped off by a school bus at the Row Hotel on Eighth Avenue between 44th and 45th Streets in Midtown Manhattan on Wednesday, February 12, 2025.This coincided with unprecedented southern border crossings, as Customs and Border Protection recorded 2.4 million apprehensions during this period.Non-profit organisations received up to $1.7 billion for various services, including matched savings schemes for vehicles, properties, education or enterprises; business loans up to $15,000; credit repair loans up to $1,500; cultural orientation; emergency accommodation; legal support and healthcare access.Certain programmes had specific eligibility criteria, including residency duration, employment status, and income thresholds relative to federal poverty levels.The largest allocation, $12.4 billion over five years, went towards unaccompanied migrant children. This occurred despite federal whistleblowers raising concerns about ORR placing many of the 291,000 children with unsuitable sponsors.""The Shining City on a Hill, with its walls and doors, makes room for legal immigrants and legitimate refugees and asylum seekers, but the ORR has made a mockery of that vision in recent years,"" OpenTheBooks CEO John Hart told The Post.""ORR is part of a troubling trend of using nonprofit groups as ideological proxies. Vast sums are being outsourced to evade accountability and prop up an immoral, exploitive system that is hurtful to both American citizens and people in other countries who are longing for a better life.""President Joe Biden speaks at the 115th NAACP National Convention at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center on July 16, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada.This report follows controversy surrounding FEMA's allocation of approximately $80 million for migrant accommodation in New York City hotels and related services, which the Trump administration recently recovered.Fiscal disbursements included $2.6 billion in 2020, $2.3 billion in 2021, $3.3 billion in 2022, $10 billion in 2023, and $4.2 billion in 2024. These figures represent obligated spending, with some funds yet to be distributed.The programme encompassed various groups including Cuban and Haitian migrants, humanitarian parolees from Afghanistan and Ukraine, special visa holders from Afghanistan and Iraq, and unaccompanied minors.The watchdog highlighted this funding increase coincided with ORR expanding migrant legal support and removing requirements for refugees to achieve rapid economic self-sufficiency.Church World Services and the International Rescue Committee were primary fund recipients. These organisations received significant funding despite the former opposing a Biden-Trudeau agreement addressing northern border asylum issues.","HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), previously criticised for losing contact with 32,000 migrant children, distributed substantial funds to various non-profit organisations.

But a record of trafficking in dangerous conspiracy theories and eroding trust in public health institutions does not entitle Mr Kennedy to lead these important efforts,"" he said.“This Administration – led by the same President who delivered a medical miracle with Project Warp Speed – deserves a leader who is willing to acknowledge without qualification the efficacy of life-saving vaccines and who can demonstrate an understanding of basic elements of the U.S. healthcare system. Mr Kennedy failed to prove he is the best possible person to lead America’s largest health agency. As he takes office, I sincerely hope Mr Kennedy will choose not to sow further doubt and division but to restore trust in our public health institutions,” McConnell concluded.Kennedy Jr has controversial health takes and he himself was a former addict.

Ranveer Allahbadia and Samay Raina Controversy: American comedian who interviewed Trump comes out in support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ranveer-allahbadia-and-samay-raina-controversy-american-comedian-who-interviewed-trump-comes-out-in-support/articleshow/118213653.cms,"Trump On Who Really Tried to Kill Him, Abortion & More

Who is Samay Raina?



Who is Beer Biceps?







Akaash Singh , the Indian-American stand-up comedian known for his sharp wit and unapologetic humor, has come out strongly in support of fellow comedians Beer Biceps (Ranveer Allahbadia) and Samay Raina.Amid growing online controversy, Singh took to social media to clarify his stance, stating unequivocally that he endorses the jokes of these comedians and all stand-up comics in India.The comedian, who gained widespread recognition for his stand-up special Gaslit and his interview with former US President Donald Trump on Flagrant, did not hold back in defending his peers. Singh’s statement came after several online users criticized Allahbadia and Raina, accusing them of vulgarity and inappropriate humor. In response to a challenge by a user who questioned whether he would openly endorse such humor, Singh tweeted: “Was this not clear? I endorse the jokes of @ReheSamay, @BeerBicepsGuy, and EVERY comedian in India. And to my Indian fans who ask why I only do pop-up shows there, this story is why. I gotta weed out morons like the ones offended by this COMPLETELY harmless joke.”His comments highlight the ongoing tension between artistic freedom in comedy and the growing scrutiny from audiences who feel certain content crosses a moral or cultural line. In India, where stand-up comedy has grown rapidly in the last decade, comedians frequently find themselves at the center of controversy over their material. Many have faced legal challenges, social media outrage, and calls for censorship. Singh’s statement signals his belief that comedians should not be policed for their humor.The debate intensified when another Twitter user suggested that vulgarity should be heavily fined in stand-up and OTT content, proposing penalties of Rs. 5 crore per offensive word. Singh responded with an expletive-laden rebuttal:“Suck my d**** you dumbass m*********.”The blunt response from the comedian, known for his no-filter approach, further fueled the conversation about where the line should be drawn in comedy. Supporters of Singh applauded his defense of free speech, while critics argued that he was endorsing unnecessary crudeness in the art form.Another user accused Singh of supporting “filthy” comedians like Ranveer Allahbadia, to which he simply replied, “Nah.” The straightforward dismissal reflected Singh’s unwillingness to engage in moral policing and his commitment to standing by his peers.Adding to the discussion, Singh also defended Allahbadia directly, tweeting: “@BeerBicepsGuy is family. I don’t know what people are coming after him for and I don’t give a f***. I’m riding with him.”With his influence in both American and Indian comedy circles, Singh’s vocal stance reinforces a larger global conversation about the role of comedy in challenging societal norms. Whether or not his words will shift opinions remains to be seen, but one thing is certain—Akaash Singh isn’t backing down.Samay Raina is a well-known stand-up comedian and chess streamer in India. He rose to fame after winning Comicstaan , a popular Indian stand-up comedy competition, and later carved a niche for himself by merging comedy with chess streaming on platforms like YouTube. Raina, like many other comedians, frequently uses satire and observational humor in his performances.However, Indian comedians often find themselves in controversy due to cultural sensitivities and the country’s strict laws on speech. Even jokes that would be considered mild in American comedy can sometimes spark outrage, leading to social media backlash, police complaints, and even legal trouble. While Raina has not faced serious legal consequences, he has been criticized for his jokes, particularly by more conservative audiences who argue that comedy should remain “clean.”Ranveer Allahbadia, known as Beer Biceps, is a social media influencer, YouTuber, and entrepreneur. He initially gained popularity through fitness content before transitioning into self-improvement, business advice, and long-form podcasting. His podcast, The Ranveer Show, has hosted numerous high-profile guests, from Bollywood celebrities to spiritual leaders, and has positioned itself as a mix of motivational content and deep conversations.Recently, Allahbadia has faced criticism for some of his interviews and comments. While the specifics of the controversy are somewhat scattered, it generally revolves around accusations that he spreads misinformation or engages in sensationalist content for engagement. Some online users also disapprove of the guests he invites, including figures from polarizing political or spiritual backgrounds.","Akaash Singh, the Indian-American stand-up comedian, has come out strongly in support of fellow comedians Beer Biceps (Ranveer Allahbadia) and Samay Raina.

The two leaders discussed key issues including trades, tariffs, extradition of 26/11 accused, Russia-Ukraine war, purchase of F-35 fighter jets and India's border dispute with China.Setting the tone of the ""MEGA partnership"", PM Modi highlighted India and US's shared commitment to economic growth and global leadership.""President Trump often talks about MAGA. In India, we are working towards a Viksit Bharat, which in American context translates into MIGA. And together, the India-USA have a MEGA partnership for prosperity!"" he said.India and the US set a bilateral trade target of $500 billion by 2030 in a effort to ensure joint development, joint production and transfer of technology.

There is a good chance that this figure will go up to as much as 25 billion dollars in the near future,"" ministry of external affairs said in a presser.The talks between the two leaders focused also on increasing energy purchases, which could play a key role in balancing the trade deficit between India and the United States. Officials indicated that expanded energy trade is a strong possibility and could contribute to narrowing the gap in bilateral trade.The US president has offered to mediate in the India-China border dispute and has called for a de-escalation.""I look at India, I do see the skirmishes on the border, which are quite vicious, and I guess they continue to go on. If I could be of help, I'd love to help, because that should be stopped,"" Trump said.PM Modi talked about the issue of illegal immigration and expressed India's readiness to take back those citizens living unlawfully in the US. However, he emphasized that the issue extended beyond deportation, highlighting the role of human traffickers who mislead individuals with false promises.There were no comments on the ""inhuman treatment"" given to the recent deportees when they were restrained and sent back to the country.""Those who stay in other countries illegally do not have any legal right to be there. As far as India and the US are concerned, we have always said that those who are verified and are truly the citizens of India - if they live in the US illegally, India is ready to take them back,"" PM Modi said.US approved the extradition of 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana to India, marking another key takeaway from the visit.""Today I am pleased to announce that my administration has approved the extradition of one of the plotters and very evil people of the world, and having to do with the horrific Mumbai terrorist attack, to face justice in India. So, he is going back to India to face justice,"" Trump said.In January, the US Supreme Court had approved Rana's extradition by dismissing his review petition in the case.PM Modi's visit to the US did not have a significant impact on Donald Trump's recent move to impose 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from India.Rather, Trump said that the States would prefer a ""reciprocal approach"" on tariffs. ""We are, right now, a reciprocal nation. We are going to, if it's India or if it's somebody else with low tariffs, we're going to have the same. We're going to have whatever India charges, we're charging them. Whatever another country charges, we're charging them,"" Trump said.He also reiterated his ""100% tariffs"" on Brics nations threat if they tried to replace the US dollar with any other currency.""I don't care, but Brics was put there for a bad purpose and most of those people don't want it. They don't even want to talk about it now. They're afraid to talk about it because I told them if they want to play games with the dollar, then they're going to be hit with a 100 per cent tariff. The day they mention that they want to do it and they will come back and say we beg you, we beg you not to do this. Brics is dead since I mentioned that. Brics died the minute I mentioned that and I know I remember when Obama and Biden, in particular, I guess he said that oh, they have us over a barrel,"" he said.PM Modi reiterated India's stance on the Russia-Ukraine war and said that the country was in favour of establishing peace.""I have always been in close contact with Russia and Ukraine. I have met the leaders of both countries. Many people are in a misconception that India is neutral, but I want to reiterate that India is not neutral; we are on a side, and that is peace,"" he said.He lauded Trump's efforts to resolve the conflict through dialogue, and said that negotiations were the key to ending the crisis.""I have said that 'this is not a time of war' in front of the media when President Putin was with me. Even today, my conviction is that the solutions to war cannot be found on the battlefield, and ultimately, we have to be at the table,"" he said.PM Modi and US President Trump shared a warm moment with hugs and handshakes at the White House.Trump also gifted PM Modi a book titled 'Our Journey together' which featured images from key events like 'Howdy Modi' and 'Namaste Trump'.The book signed by Trump said, ""Mr Prime Minister, you are great.""",India and the US set a bilateral trade target of $500 billion by 2030.

Reciprocal Tariff: What are reciprocal tariffs that Trump announced as part of his trade war?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-are-reciprocal-tariffs-that-trump-announced-as-part-of-his-trade-war/articleshow/118224920.cms,"No more, no less: Donald Trump explained what reciprocal tariffs are.

Reciprocal tariff: 'It's the golden rule'



When will reciprocal tariffs start?

After Donald Trump's tariff war with Canada, China, and Mexico in the first three weeks of his administration, Trump announced reciprocal tariffs Thursday. As Trump announced the reciprocal tariffs, he explained that for purposes of fairness, the United States will impose the same tariff on each country whatever they charge, not more, not less. ""They charge us a tax or tariff and we charge them the exact tax or tariff. Very simple,"" Trump said.""Nobody knows what that number is unless you go by the individual country, you can see what it is. If you go to individual country and see what they are charging us, in almost all cases, they are charging us more than what er charge them. Those days are over,"" Trump explained.A day ago, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that reciprocal tariffs would be announced soon and before Trump's meeting with Narendra Modi. Explaining the logic of reciprocal tariff, Leavitt said it's very simple, the golden rule that was taught in school. “It’s the golden rule, which we all learned when we were growing up in school: treat others the way you want to be treated. And far too many nations around this world have been ripping off the United States of America for far too long.

The ministry said its embassy in Tripoli had “dispatched a team” to a local hospital at the site near Marsa Dela port for the identification.Late Tuesday, the ministry disclosed that of the 63 Pakistanis on the boat, the bodies of 16 had been fished out and 37 rescued, while 10 were still missing. “Three of the survivors are in Tripoli, being looked after by the (Pakistani) embassy,” the ministry said in a statement.The tragedy unfolded less than a month after 50 Pakistanis died when a boat with 86 migrants to Europe capsized off Morocco on January 16. Before that, at least 300 Pakistanis had drowned in a migrant boat that sank off Greece in June 2023, with Italy their intended destination.In a travel alert, Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has identified Libya as one of 15 transit countries used for human trafficking.Each year, thousands of Pakistanis pay traffickers large sums for risky and illegal journeys to Europe, hoping to find work and send money back to their families. Many also take these perilous routes to escape conflicts and religious persecution.Pakistani authorities claim human smugglers send migrants seeking illegal entry into Europe to Libya, located around 300km from Italy. From there, they either take them by boat to Europe or relocate them to the coastal cities of Morocco and Mauritania in west Africa.On Monday, UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said it was “deeply alarmed” by the dozens of migrants’ bodies found in mass graves in southeastern Libya. Two days back, Libyan authorities claimed they had found the bodies of 28 sub-Saharan migrants in the southeastern district of Kufra, near a site where they were allegedly detained and tortured.The UN agency expressed shock at the discovery of two mass graves in Libya with bodies of dozens of migrants, some with gunshot wounds. The circumstances of the migrants’ death and nationalities remain unknown, it said, adding the graves were discovered following a police raid during which hundreds of migrants were rescued from traffickers.",At least 16 Pakistanis were among 65 illegal migrants who died after their boat capsized.

ISLAMABAD: At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank at the weekend off the coast of Libya , officials said Tuesday.The ministry of foreign affairs said that 33 of the 37 survivors were in Libyan police custody and one was being treated at a hospital. An estimated 65 people were on the boat, it said.Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his deep grief and sorrow for those lost in the capsizing in Marsa Dela port in the western city of Zawiya.Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to complete the process of identifying the victims and provide assistance to those affected. He also ordered action against those involved ""in heinous acts like human trafficking,"" according to a statement.Most of the victims came from Kurram, a district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan , where hundreds of people have been killed in recent years in sectarian clashes.""People try to travel to Europe through illegal means because of unemployment"" at home, said Javed Hussain, a nephew of Shehzad Hussain, one of the victims. He said mourners were gathering at the homes of those who perished in the latest tragedy.In January, authorities said dozens of Pakistanis died when a boat capsized off West Africa. Some of the survivors later accused smugglers of killing 43 migrants in a dispute over payment. Pakistan has since confirmed the deaths of 13 of its nationals.Hundreds of Pakistanis die every year while trying to reach Europe by land and sea with the help of human smugglers. They also use dangerous land and sea routes to reach Europe in an effort to find jobs.Libya, which has borders with six nations and a long shore on the Mediterranean, was plunged into chaos following a Nato-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Since then, the oil-rich country has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East for Europe.At least 674 migrants were reported dead and more than 1,000 missing off Libya in 2024, according to the International Organization for Migration's missing migrants project. More than 21,700 migrants were intercepted and returned to the chaos-stricken country.In 2023, the IOM reported 962 migrants dead and 1,563 missing off Libya. Around 17,200 migrants were intercepted and returned to Libya that year, it said.Those who are returned are held in government-run detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture - practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to UN-commissioned investigators. The abuse often accompanies attempts to extort money from the families of the imprisoned migrants before releasing them or allowing them to leave Libya on traffickers' boats to Europe.","At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya.

Corruption Perceptions Index: Pakistan's ranking on corruption index drops by 2 spots: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-ranking-on-corruption-index-drops-by-2-spots-report/articleshow/118143601.cms,"Pakistan's flag

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024 out of 180 countries, a media report said on Tuesday. The CPI ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption on a scale of zero (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean), Dawn.com reported.The CPI report is released annually by Transparency International Berlin.Transparency International Pakistan (TIP) has no role either in the collection of data or the calculation of the country's score, TIP explains.The score for Pakistan also reduced by two points from 29 in CPI 2023 to 27 in CPI 2024.According to a Transparency International document listing Pakistan's CPI ranking and scores from 1996 to 2024, which was seen by Dawn.com, the country's score in the past 10 years has ranged between 27 and 33 points (a higher score indicating less corruption).Since 2012, when the index changed to a scoring scale of 100 from 10, Pakistan's score rose from 27 to 33 in 2018 but declined consecutively back to 27 last year.Statistics from the past show that in 1996, Pakistan ranked only second-last out of 54 countries part of the index back then, with a score of 1/10.From 1997 to 2011, the country's score went back and forth, reaching as high as 2.7 in 1998 and dropping as low as 2.1 in 2004 and 2005.According to TIP chair Justice (retired) Zia Perwez, the scores of all countries in the region except Oman, China, Turkiye and Mongolia declined. The downslide for the region showed that Pakistan was one of the countries holding up against the overall trend in the region.Global corruption levels remained alarmingly high, with efforts to reduce them faltering, according to the CPI report, which exposed serious corruption levels across the globe, with more than two-thirds of countries scoring below 50 out of 100.Almost 6.8 billion people live in countries with CPI scores under 50 - equivalent to 85 per cent of the world population of 8 billion.For the seventh year in a row, Denmark obtained the highest score on the index (90) and was closely followed by Finland (88) and Singapore (84).Countries with the lowest scores were mostly fragile and conflict-affected ones like South Sudan (8), Somalia (9), Venezuela (10), Syria (12), Libya (13), Eritrea (13), Yemen (13) and Equatorial Guinea (13).While the CPI noted that the Middle East and North Africa's rising average score was a ""reason for optimism"", it pointed out that it was the first increase in over a decade and only by one point - to 39 out of 100.According to Transparency International, the top-scoring region was Western Europe and the European Union, but its score ""decreased overall for the second year in a row - many leaders are serving business interests rather than the common good and laws are often poorly enforced"".""While Asia Pacific does have a range of improving countries, its average score is decreasing, as vicious cycles of corruption and climate change impacts take their toll,"" it added.Over a quarter of the countries in the sample (47) got their lowest score yet on the index, including Austria (67), Bangladesh (23), Brazil (34), Cuba (41), France (67), Germany (75), Haiti (16), Hungary (41), Iran (23), Mexico (26), Russia (22), South Sudan (8), Switzerland (81), the United States (65) and Venezuela (10).Over the past five years, seven countries have significantly improved their scores in the index: These include Cote d'Ivoire (45), the Dominican Republic (36), Kosovo (44), Kuwait (46), the Maldives (38), Moldova (43) and Zambia (39).The global average on the index remained unchanged at 43, highlighting the need for urgent action against corruption and warning of a critical global obstacle to implementing successful climate action.",Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024.

Pakistani lawyers stage protest against high-level meeting of constitutional body to pick eight SC judges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-lawyers-stage-protest-against-high-level-meeting-of-constitutional-body-to-pick-eight-sc-judges/articleshow/118118105.cms,"Representative image (Image credits: ANI)

ISLAMABAD: Hundreds of lawyers on Monday staged protests in Pakistan's national capital against a high-level meeting of a constitutional body with the agenda to appoint at least eight judges of the supreme court. The judicial commission of Pakistan (JCP) meeting was being held despite opposition by four apex court judges, the legal fraternity, resistance by opposition the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and controversy over the recent transfer of judges to the Islamabad high court (IHC), which was opposed by five IHC judges.The JCP, a top body empowered to approve judicial appointments, will finalise appointments for eight vacant supreme court judges.Lawyers gathered at various locations in Islamabad, with the lawyers' action committee staging a protest near D-Chowk. But police responded by closing several key entry points to the Red Zone, which houses key buildings, including the supreme court.Dozens of protestors gathered at Serena Chowk as they were stopped from going to the supreme court due to the closure of the Red Zone. They chanted ""Azaadi"" (freedom) and ""Lawyers' unity zindabad"" (long live lawyers' unity). They were also holding a banner written in Urdu and reading "" 26th constitutional amendment unacceptable"".Clashes were also reported between lawyers and police when they tried to enter the Red Zone. However, there was no report of any arrest or injury during the protest.The protest led to the suspension of metro bus services on multiple routes between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, causing significant inconvenience for commuters. The closure of the Red Zone has caused traffic disruptions, leading to heavy congestion on different roads in the capital.Earlier, the legal fraternity in the country was already expressing concerns against the new appointments and transfers following the controversial 26th constitutional amendment passed last year.The lawyers' representatives had held a convention at the Islamabad district courts, opposing the 26th amendment and demanding the cancellation of the JCP meeting.They also announced on February 3 to protest against the transfer of three high court judges to the IHC but it could not elicit a widespread response. The Karachi bar association had supported the strike call by staying away.Last month, the Lahore high court bar association (LHCBA) moved an application before the apex court through advocate Muhammad Waqar Rana, seeking postponement of the JCP meeting.The JCP earlier this month asked all high courts to send a list of five senior judges from each for consideration for the appointment of eight of them to the supreme court.Initially, the IHC had forwarded the names of three judges - chief justice Aamer Farooq, justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb - to the JCP because justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Babar Sattar did not meet the minimum requirement of five years of service.However, as justice Sarfraz Dogar was made the IHC senior puisne judge following his transfer there from the Lahore high court, his name has also been sent to the JCP.Days before justice Dogar's name was added, five judges of the IHC approached chief justice Yahya Afridi and IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq to reclaim their seniority.Separately, four SC judges, senior puisne judge justice Mansoor Ali Shah, justice Munib Akhtar, justice Ayesha Malik and justice Athar Minallah, in a letter to the chief justice showed concerns last week and are also seeking the postponement of today's JCP session until a decision is made on the petitions against the 26th Amendment.The opposition PTI party in a letter to the chief justice on Sunday asked to postpone the commission's meeting.The 13-member JCP is led by the chief justice and includes four judges of the apex court, as well as parliamentarians from both the treasury and opposition and others.The lawyers and opposition allege that the government was trying to 'pack' the top judiciary with hand-picked judges to influence the fate of political cases, a concern rejected by the government.","Hundreds of lawyers stage protests in Islamabad against high-level meeting of constitutional body.

Policemen at the checkpost offered stiff resistance in an encounter which lasted two hours, following which the terrorists fled,” the provincial police said in a statement.Pakistan has experienced an escalation in militancy in KP, adjacent to Afghanistan, following the collapse of a tenuous truce between TTP and the state in Nov 2022.Pakistani authorities have linked the surge in militant violence to cross-border incursions from Afghanistan, alleging that the Kabul administration is facilitating TTP fighters, a claim Afghan authorities refute. Most of these assaults have been directed at security and law-enforcement personnel, although civilians and govt officials have also been impacted.In KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district last week, four soldiers were killed by gunfire and an improvised explosive device (IED) unleashed by terrorists.In Balochistan, another restive province in Pakistan’s south, 18 soldiers were killed in an attack by terrorists earlier this month.Islamabad think-tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) has described 2024 as the most lethal year for security forces in a decade, with a minimum of 685 military and police fatalities resulting from 444 terror attacks.Alongside such attacks, militants have stepped up targeted killings and kidnappings of officials in KP and Balochistan.","Nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

ISLAMABAD : The UN refugees and migration agencies on Wednesday expressed their concern over Pakistan 's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting relocation to the United States and elsewhere.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR , and the international organization for migration in a statement said they were seeking clarification from Pakistan, which said last week it would deport the refugees back to Afghanistan unless their cases were processed quickly by the countries that had agreed to take them in.About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the US under a program that helps people at risk because of their work with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. They were among tens of thousands of Afghans who fled to neighboring Pakistan after their country fell to the Taliban in 2021.However, they were left in limbo after President Donald Trump paused US refugee programs last month.""A UNHCR-issued non-return advisory has been in place since 2021, calling for a suspension of forced returns of Afghan nationals from any country regardless of their status,"" the joint UNHCR-IOM statement said.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif last week gave the green light to evict Afghans without papers from the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi before March 31, in preparation for deportation if they were not relocated to their host countries.UNHCR and IOM said they are especially concerned for Afghan nationals who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians and others.It said since January 1, 2025, an uptick in arrests of Afghan nationals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi has caused significant distress, with reports of Afghan nationals of various documentation statuses being rounded up.The Trump administration also announced the US refugee admissions program would be suspended from January 27 for at least three months. It has shocked Afghans who were hoping to travel to the United States soon.Afghans in Pakistan have been virtually living in hiding since 2023 when a crackdown began on foreigners who are in the country without proper documentation. An estimated 800,000 Afghans have either gone back voluntarily or been deported since despite criticism from UN agencies, rights groups and the Taliban.Besides thousands of Afghans who are living in Pakistan and awaiting travel to host countries, there are around 1.45 million Afghan nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees in Pakistan as well but their stay has been extended until June.In the statement, UNHCR and IOM urged ""Pakistan to implement any relocation measures with due consideration for human rights standards, including due process, and the legal status of proof of registration (POR) and afghan citizen card (ACC) holders, who have resided in Pakistan for an extended period of time"".""Pakistan has a proud tradition of hosting refugees, saving millions of lives. This generosity is greatly appreciated,"" UNHCR representative in Pakistan Philippa Candler said.""IOM is committed to work with the government of Pakistan and UNHCR to develop a mechanism to register, manage and screen Afghan nationals in Pakistan,"" said IOM chief of mission, Mio Sato.She said ""This will open the door to tailored solutions including international protection to those in need and pathways for Afghan nationals, with long-standing socioeconomic and family ties in the country.""","UN refugees and migration agencies express concern over Pakistan's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees.

DHAKA: The foreign ministry of Bangladesh on Thursday said the Yunus government will send a ""formal reminder"" to India regarding the extradition of deposed PM Sheikh Hasina when it deems the timing is appropriate. ""It (the reminder) will be sent when the political leadership feels it is the right time,"" ministry spokesperson Mohammad Rafiqul Alam told reporters. Pressed for details, he emphasised that the matter involves both political considerations and diplomatic procedures .Alam confirmed that Bangladesh had formally requested Hasina's extradition in Dec, submitting a set of relevant documents along with a diplomatic letter (note verbale) to India.On whether Bangladesh had provided an arrest warrant to facilitate the extradition, Alam said all required materials, received from the relevant ministries, had been included in the note verbale. When asked about the timing of a possible reminder to India, Alam reiterated that it would be a ""diplomatic and political decision"" and that govt would proceed accordingly. Alam said despite Bangladesh's formal request, India is yet to respond. ""We continue to expect a response from New Delhi ,"" he said.India's foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has confirmed that New Delhi received Bangladesh's extradition request.

Taliban's security challenges

One killed and three others suffered injuries in a suicide attack on Afghan ministry of urban development and housing on Thursday.""The suicide attacker wanted to enter the ministry and one of the mujahideen (security forces) shot him and then in the result of the explosion another person near him was killed and three injured,"" interior ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani told AFP.Although violence in Afghanistan has significantly decreased since the Taliban reclaimed power in 2021, the Islamic State (IS) group continues to launch deadly attacks challenging their rule. IS has previously targeted Taliban officials, foreign diplomats, and civilians in Afghanistan.A doctor at Kabul's Emergency Hospital, speaking anonymously, said that ""five to six injured"" individuals had been brought to the facility for treatment. However, official casualty figures often differ from those reported by medical personnel on the ground.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Thursday's attack, but IS has a history of carrying out high-profile bombings in Afghanistan. In December, the group claimed responsibility for a suicide attack that killed Khalil Ur-Rahman Haqqani, the Taliban government's minister for refugees, inside his Kabul office. Just a day before Thursday's attack, IS also claimed responsibility for a deadly assault on a northern Afghan bank, which left eight people dead. The attack specifically targeted Taliban employees collecting their salaries.IS-Khorasan, the Afghan chapter of the Islamic State founded in 2015, has been behind some of the deadliest attacks in the country. The group gained global attention in August 2021 when it bombed Kabul airport during the chaotic US evacuation, killing around 170 Afghans and 13 American service members.Since taking power, the Taliban government has declared security its highest priority, claiming success in curbing IS activities through an extensive crackdown. However, IS remains a persistent threat, continuing to target government officials and civilians alike.Security forces frequently seal off attack sites, making independent verification of casualty figures difficult. The Taliban maintains that its counterterrorism measures have weakened IS, but Thursday's bombing highlights the ongoing security challenges the administration faces.","One killed and three others injured in suicide attack on Afghan ministry of urban development and housing.

UN reports rights abuses in B'desh 2024 protest response, estimates 1,400 killed

DHAKA: A UN report released on Wednesday found that human rights abuses were inflicted on members of Bangladesh's Hindu, Ahmadiyya Muslim and indigenous communities during the anti-discrimination protests that led to Sheikh Hasina govt's fall and its aftermath in 204.While 100 arrests related to attacks on distinct religious & indigenous groups have reportedly been made, perpetrators of many other acts of revenge violence and targeted attacks on such groups still enjoy impunity, UN Human Rights Office said. After fall of the govt, ""widespread attacks were reported against Hindu homes, businesses and places of worship"", it said. The report validates India's repeated claims of targeted attacks on Hindus & temples.Widespread attacks were reported against Hindu homes, businesses, and places of worship, especially in rural and historically tense areas such as Thakurgaon, Lalmonirhat and Dinajpur, as well as other places such as Sylhet, Khulna, and Rangpur"", said the UN report titled 'Human Rights Violations and Abuses related to Protests of July and August 2024 in Bangladesh'.These destructions were especially prevalent in areas perceived to be sympathetic to the Awami League as Hindus have often been stereotypically associated with this political faction, it added. The report, based on the deaths reported by various credible sources, also estimated that as many as 1,400 people may have been killed during July 1-Aug 15 last year and thousands were injured, the vast majority of whom were shot by Bangladesh's security forces.""Bangladesh's former govt, security and intelligence services, alongside violent elements associated with Awami League, systematically engaged in a range of serious human rights violations during last year's student-led protests,"" it added.Former PM Sheikh Hasina left the country on Aug 5 and Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt began its journey three days later. The report released by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights documented ""troubling instances"" of retaliatory killings and revenge violence during the student-led protests. It stated that security and intelligence services ""systematically engaged"" in rights violations that could amount to crimes against humanity.UN Human Rights chief Volker Turk described the response as a ""calculated and well-coordinated strategy"" by the Hasina govt to retain power amid mass opposition. ""Hundreds of extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, detentions, and torture"" were carried out with political leadership's knowledge and coordination, he added.Director of Rights and Risks Analysis Group (RRAG) Suhas Chakma criticised the report for not identifying individual officers responsible for the carnage, citing the limitations of Yunus's interim govt, which restricted the investigation period from July 5 to Aug 15, 2024.The report also includes recommendations to reform Bangladesh's security and justice sectors. ""The interim govt must ensure that violent crimes targeting supporters of Awami League, police officers, or members of distinct religious and indigenous groups are promptly and independently investigated with due diligence and that identified perpetrators are brought to justice,"" it said.","UN reports rights abuses in B'desh 2024 protest response, estimates 1,400 killed. 100 arrests related to attacks on distinct religious & indigenous groups have reportedly been made. perpetrators of many other acts of revenge violence and targeted attacks on such groups still enjoy impunity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118196706,imgsize-566875,width-400,resizemode-4/118196706.jpg"

2016 elections probe: Trump accuses Obama of Russia ‘hoax’; calls it ‘crime of the century’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/2016-elections-probe-trump-accuses-obama-of-russia-hoax-calls-it-crime-of-the-century/articleshow/122825361.cms,"



US President Donald Trump has launched a fresh attack against Barack Obama , accusing the former president of orchestrating the false story that Russia helped Trump win the 2016 election. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and others were part of what he called “the crime of the century” and said there is clear proof against them.“Obama himself manufactured the Russia, Russia, Russia HOAX. Crooked Hillary, Sleepy Joe, and numerous others participated in this, THE CRIME OF THE CENTURY! Irrefutable EVIDENCE. A major threat to our Country!!!”Trump’s comments come just as the US department of justice formally received a criminal referral from former Congresswoman and director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard . The referral alleges a “treasonous conspiracy” by senior Obama-era officials to undermine Trump’s 2016 electoral victory and cast doubt over the legitimacy of the democratic process.On Friday, Gabbard made public more than 100 pages of internal documents which, she claims, show deliberate efforts by members of the Obama administration to suppress benign intelligence in the closing weeks of Obama’s presidency.“Their goal was to usurp President Trump and subvert the will of the American people,” Gabbard posted on X (formerly Twitter). “No matter how powerful, every person involved in this conspiracy must be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.The integrity of our democratic republic depends on it.”Among the released records were assessments dating back to December 2016 from US intelligence agencies, which stated unequivocally that foreign adversaries had not altered the outcome of the presidential election via cyberattacks.“We have no evidence of cyber manipulation of election infrastructure intended to alter results,” one of the reports read, cited by the New York Post.Despite this, those findings were reportedly excluded from the Presidential Daily Brief after the FBI, then led by James Comey, expressed dissent based on what was described as “new guidance.”Just two days later, President Obama met with senior intelligence and security chiefs, including James Clapper, Andrew McCabe, and CIA Director John Brennan, in the Oval Office to discuss what would later become the cornerstone of the Trump-Russia collusion narrative.Gabbard said she has turned over all related materials to the DOJ and is urging a full-scale investigation into what she labelled the “boldest and most coordinated political deception” in modern American history.While the Department of Justice has yet to comment publicly, the explosive nature of Gabbard’s claims, paired with Trump’s renewed accusations, sets the stage for yet another high-profile political battle.","US President Donald Trump has launched a fresh attack against Barack Obama, accusing the former president of orchestrating the false story that Russia helped Trump win the 2016 election.

It’s been six months since Donald Trump returned to the White House in January as the 47th president. His second term has already brought major changes to US domestic and foreign policy. From sweeping tax reforms and economic growth to tough border measures and bold international deals, here’s a rundown of what the US president claims to have done so far.Congress passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” delivering the largest tax cut in US history and increasing some Americans’ take-home pay by up to $13,300, while cutting off benefits for over 1.4 million undocumented immigrants.Another major package is aimed at saving taxpayers $9 billion by cutting what the administration described as unnecessary and politically driven spending on certain foreign aid programmes and publicly funded media outlets like NPR and PBS.Meanwhile, the economy has added 671,000 jobs since January 2025. All new jobs have reportedly gone to native-born Americans, while employment among foreign-born workers has declined. Blue-collar wage growth hit its fastest pace in nearly 60 years, and companies and foreign governments have pledged $7.6 trillion in new investments into the US.Inflation has remained low, with core inflation tracking at just 2.1%, the same level seen during Trump’s first term.Prices of essentials like eggs and fuel have fallen significantly. Wholesale egg prices are down by more than half since the start of the year, and summer petrol prices are at their lowest, in real terms, in nearly two decades.Gas and oil drilling permits have surged after Trump declared an “energy emergency,” with approval rates now 44% higher than under the previous administration, as per a release by the White House. Deregulation efforts are said to have saved Americans over $180 billion so far, with billions more expected in savings from loosened car-related rules.The Trump administration has taken a strict stance on immigration. In June, the number of illegal border crossings hit a record low at just 6,070. No migrants were released into the US on parole that month, compared to over 27,000 in June last year. Deportations have ramped up, setting a new record for monthly flights.The self-deportation campaign has seen results, and over 600 suspected terrorists have reportedly been removed. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has also arrested more than 100,000 undocumented criminals, including thousands linked to violent gangs like Tren de Aragua, as per the White House statement.A February executive order now blocks undocumented immigrants from receiving taxpayer-funded benefits. The White House claims this has protected more than $40 billion in public funds.Trump has met with 23 world leaders in six months, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (three times) and the NATO Secretary General (twice). The release also claimed that he secured a breakthrough NATO deal where members agreed to increase defence spending to 5% of GDP, something long considered unlikely. Trump signed a major military support deal for Ukraine, with NATO paying the costs.In trade, Trump struck new agreements with the UK, China, Indonesia and Ukraine, including a $14 billion “Golden Share” sale of US Steel and a major minerals deal. US tariffs brought in $90 billion this year, with a record surplus of $27.2 billion in June, the first June surplus since 2005.President Trump has signed over 170 executive orders. These include bans on gender-affirming care for minors, removing transgender women from women’s sports, ending federal DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) programmes, and stopping federal censorship and school indoctrination.As a result, several major hospitals have stopped gender-related procedures for children, and schools across the country, including major universities, have barred biological males from competing in women’s sports.Efforts to “Make America Healthy Again” have also picked up pace. About 35% of the US food industry, including major names like Hershey and big ice cream brands, have pledged to stop using artificial dyes in their products.","Donald Trump has been in the White House for six months.

'Total disaster': Trump slams Obama appointed judge in Harvard case hearing; vows to appeal again if loses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/total-disaster-trump-slams-obama-appointed-judge-in-harvard-case-hearing-vows-to-appeal-again-if-loses/articleshow/122824385.cms,"



US President Donald Trump launched an attack on a federal judge presiding over a high-stakes legal battle between his administration and Harvard University.He accused her of bias and vowed to appeal in case of an unfavourable ruling.Taking to his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote, “The Harvard case was just tried in Massachusetts before an Obama appointed Judge. She is a TOTAL DISASTER, which I say even before hearing her Ruling. She has systematically taken over the various Harvard cases, and is an automatic “loss” for the People of our Country!”He went on to claim, “Harvard has $52 Billion Dollars sitting in the Bank, and yet they are anti-Semitic, anti-Christian, and anti-America. Much of this money comes from the U.S.A., all to the detriment of other Schools, Colleges, and Institutions, and we are not going to allow this unfair situation to happen any longer.”Questioning how Judge Allison Burroughs came to oversee the matter, the US President further added, “How did this Trump-hating Judge get these cases? When she rules against us, we will IMMEDIATELY appeal, and WIN.”He also signalled a broader move to cut off federal support to the Ivy League institution, saying, “The Government will stop the practice of giving many Billions of Dollars to Harvard, much of which had been given without explanation.It is a longtime commitment to Fairness in Funding Education, and the Trump Administration will not stop until there is VICTORY.”During a two-hour hearing on Monday, Judge Burroughs seemed doubtful of the administration’s case and suggested that the IVY might prevail in the legal battle against the Trump administration. She didn’t give a ruling but questioned the government’s arguments as both sides asked for a quick decision, as per the New York Times.In the hearing that took place in a Boston court, Burroughs questioned the justice department's efforts to cut off billions in medical research funding, pressing for explanations on how such funding withdrawal decisions were linked to civil rights of Jewish people.She challenged the rationale behind the move, warning of “staggering” constitutional implications if the executive branch could penalise a university without proper process.“What I'm wrestling with is this idea that the executive branch can decide what is discriminatory or racist,” she said, “these ad hoc decisions without any procedure around it.these ad hoc decisions without any procedure around it.”Harvard sued the Trump administration two months ago, alleging that the government violated its First Amendment rights by conditioning federal funding on the university’s compliance with politically driven demands. At the centre of the dispute is whether the administration bypassed established rules in a rush to defund the school.Justice department lawyer Michael Velchik defended the administration’s stance, arguing that the government has the authority to determine where taxpayer money goes.But Harvard has rejected claims that it supports discrimination. Steven Lehotsky, representing the university, told the court the administration’s actions were a “blatant, unrepentant violation of the First Amendment.”He also pointed out the government's departure from normal procedures in its attempt to punish Harvard.Judge Burroughs also indicated that the case may hinge not only on constitutional principles but also on whether due process was followed.",US President Donald Trump launched an attack on a federal judge presiding over a high-stakes legal battle between his administration and Harvard University.

Breonna Taylor case: Ex-police officer Brett Hankison handed 33 months prison sentence; Judge rejects DOJ’s call for leniency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/breonna-taylor-case-ex-police-officer-handed-33-months-prison-sentence-judge-rejects-dojs-call-for-leniency/articleshow/122825315.cms,"Breonna Taylor (File photo)





A federal judge dismissed a Justice Department appeal for clemency on Monday and handed down a 33-month prison term to a former officer for breaching the civil rights of a Breonna Taylor, a Black woman, whose 2020 death sparked extensive demonstrations.The Kentucky jury found Brett Hankison, a previous Louisville police detective, guilty in November of violating Taylor's civil rights during a failed police operation at her residence.Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the Justice Department's civil rights division, made an extraordinary request to Judge Rebecca Jennings last week, suggesting a sentence as time served, which is one day Hankison spent in custody upon arrest.However, Jennings, a Trump-era judicial appointee, dismissed this suggestion, expressing concern over the prosecution's sentencing document and lenient recommendations, according to the Louisville Courier Journal.The sentence included 33 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release, despite the possibility of a life sentence.The deaths of 26-year-old Taylor followed by George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man killed by a white Minneapolis officer in May 2020, catalysed substantial protests across the United States and internationally against police misconduct and racial discrimination.On March 13, 2020, around midnight, Taylor and her partner Kenneth Walker were asleep in her Louisville flat when they detected noise at the entrance. Walker discharged his firearm, wounding an officer, believing an intrusion was occurring.The police, armed with a disputed no-knock warrant for a drug arrest, responded with over 30 shots, fatally wounding Taylor.During the operation, Hankison fired 10 shots, some entering a neighbouring flat, without hitting anyone. He remains the sole officer convicted regarding the incident.In her sentencing document, Dhillon argued that a substantial prison term would be ""unjust."" ""Hankison did not shoot Ms. Taylor and is not otherwise responsible for her death,"" she said. ""Hankison did not wound her or anyone else at the scene that day, although he did discharge his duty weapon ten times blindly into Ms Taylor's home.""The Taylor family's legal representatives acknowledged that whilst the sentence didn't ""fully reflect the severity of the harm caused,"" it exceeded the Justice Department's recommendation. ""We respect the court's decision, but we will continue to call out the DOJ's failure to stand firmly behind Breonna's rights and the rights of every Black woman whose life is treated as expendable,"" they said.In May, the Justice Department withdrew lawsuits initiated under Joe Biden 's administration against Louisville and Minneapolis police forces, which had alleged excessive force and racial discrimination.","Breonna Taylor, a Black woman, was fatally shot by a police officer in 2020.

‘Extreme lack of effort’: Hillary Clinton email row back in spotlight after probe documents declassified; Senate Judiciary Committee alleges FBI missteps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/extreme-lack-of-effort-hillary-clinton-email-row-back-in-spotlight-after-probe-documents-declassified-senate-judiciary-committee-alleges-fbi-missteps/articleshow/122824927.cms,"Hillary Clinton (File photo)





Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley on Monday released newly declassified documents related to the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton ’s use of a private email server during her time as Secretary of State. The materials, according to Grassley, reveal that the FBI “failed to fully investigate” Clinton’s handling of classified information.“This document shows an extreme lack of effort and due diligence in the FBI's investigation of former Secretary Clinton's email usage and mishandling of highly classified information,"" Grassley said in a press release.""Under Comey's leadership, the FBI failed to perform fundamental investigative work and left key pieces of evidence on the cutting room floor,"" he added.Grassley further criticized the disparity between the FBI’s handling of the Clinton case and its aggressive investigation into alleged Trump-Russia ties. ""The Comey FBI's negligent approach and perhaps intentional lack of effort in the Clinton investigation is a stark contrast to its full-throated investigation of the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, which was based on the uncorroborated and now discredited Steele dossier.Comey's decision-making process smacks of political infection,"" the statement read.Clinton faced FBI scrutiny over her use of a private server to store classified emails during her tenure from 2009 to 2013 in the Obama administration. In 2016, just months before the presidential election , then-FBI Director James Comey announced that the bureau would not recommend prosecution. ""Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,"" also said Comey. ""Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before bringing charges. There are obvious considerations, like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent. Responsible decisions also consider the context of a person's actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past.""Grassley’s newly released documents stem from what is known as the “Clinton annex,” an appendix to the Department of Justice Inspector General’s 2018 review of the Clinton email investigation. The materials were declassified at Grassley’s request by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Trump administration officials, according to Fox News.The documents reportedly show that Comey and other FBI leaders took possession of key thumb drives but failed to thoroughly examine them. According to Grassley’s office, the drives potentially contained classified content from several federal agencies- including the State Department, congressional communications, and even correspondence involving former President Barack Obama.Additional intelligence, cited in Grassley’s release, suggests possible interference in the investigation by the Obama administration. The FBI also reportedly received information indicating communication between then-Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz — who chaired the Democratic National Committee until July 2016 — and members of the Soros-founded Open Society Foundations. However, Grassley claims the bureau ""did not make serious investigative efforts"" to follow up on such leads.""I warned years ago that the Clinton investigation failed to hit the mark, and I'm grateful the American people can finally see the facts for themselves,"" Grassley said. ""After nearly a decade in the shadows, this information is now coming to light thanks to Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel's dedicated efforts to fulfill my congressional request.""""I appreciate their ongoing commitment to transparency and strongly urge them to continue to fully review this matter, including its national security impact,"" he added.This development comes just days after Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard made headlines by declassifying documents she says reveal extensive efforts by Obama-era officials to politicize intelligence on Russian interference in the 2016 election.According to Gabbard, the documents show that “overwhelming evidence” supports the claim that the Obama administration helped initiate the Trump-Russia investigation after Clinton’s defeat. ""Their goal was to usurp President Trump and subvert the will of the American people,"" Gabbard posted on X. ""No matter how powerful, every person involved in this conspiracy must be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The integrity of our democratic republic depends on it. We are turning over all documents to the DOJ for criminal referral.""Fox News confirmed that the Department of Justice has received the referral, but the DOJ declined to comment further.","Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley on Monday released newly declassified documents related to the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton ’s use of a private email server during her time as Secretary of State.

"Secret deportation: 82-year old lost after ICE office visit to replace green card; family was told he died, later found alive in Guatemala",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/secret-deportation-82-year-old-lost-after-ice-office-visit-to-replace-green-card-family-was-told-he-died-later-found-alive-in-guatemala/articleshow/122805010.cms,"



Luis Leon, an 82-year-old Pennsylvania resident, was unexpectedly deported to Guatemala after visiting a US immigration office to replace his lost green card.Leon had been living in Allentown for decades after being granted political asylum in the US in 1987, following torture under Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet’s regime.He had lost his wallet containing the physical card that confirmed his legal residency, according to The Morning Call report cited by the Guardian. Therefore, Leonus and his wife had booked an appointment at an immigration office for 20 June to have the card replaced.However, upon arrival, Leon was suddenly handcuffed by two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and led away without explanation, his wife said. She was allegedly held inside the building for 10 hours before relatives came to collect her. The family said they then heard nothing about Leon’s whereabouts, despite numerous attempts to contact authorities.Days later, they received a phone call from a woman claiming to be an immigration lawyer who said she could assist, but she did not explain how she knew about the case or where Leon was being held. On 9 July, the same woman contacted the family again and told them Leon had died.However, in a shocking twist, the family learned a week later through a relative in Chile that Leon was, in fact, alive, but hospitalised in Guatemala, a country with which he has no known connection. The relative said Leon had initially been detained in an immigration facility in Minnesota before being deported, although his name did not appear on any public ICE deportation lists.His family remains in the dark about how and why he was removed to Guatemala. A recent US Supreme Court ruling had allowed the Trump-era policy permitting deportations to third countries, not just countries of origin, to stand.Leon, who had spent nearly four decades in the US working at a leather manufacturing plant and raising a family, had since retired. His medical condition remains unclear, but relatives say that he suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and a heart condition.

Bizarre jailbreak: How French prisoner escaped in released cellmate’s laundry bag; went unnoticed for 24 hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/bizarre-jailbreak-how-french-prisoner-escaped-in-released-cellmates-laundry-bag-went-unnoticed-for-24-hours/articleshow/122807352.cms,"AI-generated representative image





A 20-year-old inmate, Elyazid A, nicknamed ""the Joker"" or ""the Equaliser"", chose a unique way to escape from a French prison- concealed in fellow inmate's laundry bag, who was being released.The inmate serving several sentences escaped by hiding in the luggage of his inmate who complete his sentence, the Prison Service said in a statement to AFP. He ""took advantage of the liberation of his fellow inmate to hide himself in his luggage and get out,"" the statement said.However, the authorities re-apprehended him later in a village cellar last week, approximately 25km from Lyon-Corbas prison, according to Guardian News.The prison staff failed to notice his absence for 24 hours. Reports indicate he escaped by hiding in a large plastic laundry bag filled with clothes, which his released cellmate transported out on a trolley on Friday. The police continue their search for the accomplice cellmate.Multiple investigations have been launched by Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin, Lyon prosecutors, the French prison service and Lyon-Corbas facility to examine the escape circumstances.The national prison service head, Sébastien Cauwel, confirmed that Elyazid A, despite facing charges including criminal association and conspiracy to murder, was not considered a security threat. Cauwel described the escape method as exceptionally uncommon, attributing its success to significant internal failures.The incident raised questions about systemic issues within the facility, primarily stemming from staff-related shortcomings rather than infrastructure problems. The severe overcrowding exacerbates these challenges for prison officers.Lyon-Corbas prison currently houses almost 1,220 inmates despite its 678-person capacity. A May report by the Lyon bar association urged immediate action to address overcrowding and maintain basic human rights.The French prison system accommodates 85,000 inmates in facilities designed for under 63,000 people. Cauwel noted that vacant cells are immediately filled, potentially contributing to oversight failures. According to a 2024 Council of Europe assessment, French prisons rank third in EU overcrowding rates, behind Cyprus and Romania. The country has witnessed numerous dramatic escapes, including about 20 helicopter breakouts since the 1980s, reported The Guardian.The prison service faces a shortage of at least 5,000 officers. Recent incidents include armed attacks on prison facilities, with 21 arrests in April following assaults, including gunfire at Toulon prison's entrance.Drug cartels have targeted prison facilities, damaging officers' housing and burning vehicles, responding to increased government enforcement and stricter regulations for imprisoned crime leaders.","20-year-old Elyazid A, nicknamed ""the Joker"" or ""the Equaliser"", chose a unique way to escape from a French prison.

Suspect on run after stealing firetruck, causing massive amount of damage





A fire truck theft in Washington state on Friday night led to extensive damage and multiple vehicle collisions.The incident occurred when an Everett Fire Department vehicle was taken from Hoyt Avenue, situated 30 miles north of Seattle, whilst firefighters attended a medical emergency at an apartment building's fifth floor, according to the department's update on Saturday morning, quoted by NBC News.The thief drove the fire engine at high speeds through north Everett's residential areas, causing considerable damage to parked vehicles and landscaping across five locations before abandoning the vehicle. The theft was discovered after 11 pm (Local time) when the first 911 call reported a hit-and-run incident. Witnesses reported that the fire truck had struck two parked vehicles at high speed before leaving the scene.The vehicle eventually came to a halt in the 1000 block of E Marine View Drive after colliding with at least ten parked vehicles. The Everett Police Department responded to at least six locations where damage to parked cars, trees, directional signs and grass was reported. Fortunately, no injuries occurred at any of the sites.“Losing a fire engine in such a reckless manner not only jeopardizes the safety of our first responders but also puts our community at risk,” said Everett Police Chief John DeRousse said in a statement, quoted by NY Post.The 2018 Pierce Enforcer pumper truck, which retailed between Rs 4 crore and Rs 8 crore, was severely damaged and had to be taken out of service.The stolen vehicle, a 2018 Pierce Enforcer Pumper weighing approximately 35,000 pounds, sustained significant damage and has been impounded as evidence. The fire truck, one of the department's newer engines, is particularly dangerous when moving due to its substantial weight.Everett Police Chief John DeRousse said, ""Losing a fire engine to such a reckless person not only jeopardizes the safety of our first responders but also puts our community at risk. We are committed to ensuring the safety of our residents, and any information that helps us resolve this incident is crucial. It is imperative that we hold the suspect accountable for their actions, and we will work diligently to bring them to justice.

Here are some key facts about Clinton's file



""This document shows an extreme lack of effort and due diligence in the FBI’s investigation of former Secretary Clinton’s email usage and mishandling of highly classified information,"" Grassley said in a Monday press release.

""Under Comey’s leadership, the FBI failed to perform fundamental investigative work and left key pieces of evidence on the cutting room floor. The Comey FBI’s negligent approach and perhaps intentional lack of effort in the Clinton investigation is a stark contrast to its full-throated investigation of the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, which was based on the uncorroborated and now discredited Steele dossier. Comey’s decision-making process smacks of political infection,"" he added.

The Department of Justice Office of Inspector General's Clinton addendum reveals that while the FBI acquired USB drives from an informant during their Clinton investigation, senior officials including Director James Comey, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, Special Agent Peter Strzok and colleagues neglected to conduct specific, focused examinations of these storage devices, despite their relevance to the enquiry.

The report demonstrated that due to this oversight, the FBI's investigation of the Clinton matter was incomplete, failing to properly assess the national security implications of Clinton's negligent handling of classified materials. The DOJ OIG noted that these drives contained sensitive data extracted from various US government departments, including State Department files, correspondence from then-President Barack Obama, and possibly congressional materials. Despite a preliminary FBI memo suggesting otherwise, these storage devices never underwent proper scrutiny as part of the Clinton investigation. The DOJ OIG findings additionally indicate that whilst these drives warranted immediate analysis for potential foreign intelligence concerns, this crucial step was overlooked.

""The intelligence reports alleged that the Obama administration took efforts to scuttle the investigation into Clinton and protect her candidacy,"" Grassley's release reported.

Here are some key details from King Jr files:



“Today, after nearly 60 years of questions surrounding the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., we are releasing 230,000 MLK assassination files,” Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard wrote on X.

""The American people deserve answers decades after the horrific assassination of one of our nation’s great leaders,"" said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. ""The Department of Justice is proud to partner with Director Gabbard and the ODNI at President Trump’s direction for this latest disclosure.""

The newly released King assassination files contain investigative leads, interviews with associates of James Earl Ray, and previously undisclosed information about international intelligence cooperation during Ray's pursuit, according to US government officials.

A recently disclosed audio recording features a police interview with Jerry Ray, the brother of James Earl Ray. Officials noted that these documents had remained undigitised and neglected in various federal facilities for many years.

The quality of numerous documents has deteriorated significantly due to age and digitalisation. The records encompass diverse aspects of the investigation, including newspaper articles, public information, details about Ray's attendance at dance lessons and locksmith training, and his preference for using pseudonyms inspired by James Bond literature.





The Trump administration dropped documents on Monday, and no, it wasn’t the long-awaited Epstein files. Instead, the release spotlighted two old favourites: the FBI's surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr and his assassination in 1968, and Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server and mishandling of highly classified information during her time as Secretary of State.More than 6,000 documents — adding up to nearly 250,000 pages — tied to the 1968 assassination of Rev.

Former US president Joe Biden 's son Hunter, in recent podcast appearances, took aim at various Democrats he believes contributed to his father's political downfallDuring his appearance on Jaime Harrison's debut podcast episode, the former-president's son broadly criticised the Democratic party, suggesting their lack of loyalty to his father led to the 2024 electoral defeat for the Democrats.In a subsequent three-hour podcast released Monday with YouTuber Andrew Callaghan, Hunter Biden targeted specific individuals, including Anita Dunn, David Axelrod, James Carville, Crooked Media founders, Jake Tapper and George Clooney , using strong language throughout, as reported by NYT.He characterised Clooney as ""a brand"" and dismissed Carville's relevance.

The Donald Trump administration Monday released records of FBI's surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr and his assassination in 1968. “Today, after nearly 60 years of questions surrounding the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., we are releasing 230,000 MLK assassination files,” Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard wrote on X. Gabbard said that the documents, released in partnership with the Justice Department, Central Intelligence Agency, National Archives and the FBI, detail the federal investigation into the shooting at Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn., which resulted in 39-year-old King’s death.“The American people have waited nearly sixty years to see the full scope of the federal government’s investigation into Dr. King’s assassination,” Gabbard said. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we are ensuring that no stone is left unturned in our mission to deliver complete transparency on this pivotal and tragic event in our nation’s history.”“I extend my deepest appreciation to the King family for their support.”King’s family, including his two living children, Martin III, 67, and Bernice, 62, were given advance notice of the release and had their own teams reviewing the records ahead of the public disclosure.They issued a lengthy statement after the government's release and said their father's assassination captivated public curiosity for decades. But they said that these files are personal and must be viewed within their full historical context.“As the children of Dr King and Mrs Coretta Scott King, his tragic death has been an intensely personal grief — a devastating loss for his wife, children, and the granddaughter he never met -- an absence our family has endured for over 57 years,” they wrote. “We ask those who engage with the release of these files to do so with empathy, restraint, and respect for our family’s continuing grief.”President Donald Trump promised as a candidate to release files related to President John F. Kennedy’s 1963 assassination. When Trump took office in January, he signed an executive order to declassify the JFK records, along with those associated with Robert F. Kennedy’s and King’s 1968 assassinations.

Timeline of 9-year-old's murder



No motive found but daughter was supposed to be in mother's custody







New York State Police has not found any motive behind Canadian father Luciano Frattolin, 45, killing his 9-year-old daughter Melina Frattolin on the last day of their US vacation, but charged him with second-degree murder and then disposal of the body.The father told the judge that he could not afford an attorney for himself. A not guilty plea was entered oin his behalf as the county's public defender appeared on behalf of him.The father spoke briefly in the court telling judge Richard Carpenter that the address listed for him in Montreal was incorrect.The father and daughter arrived in the US on a vacation on July 11. They visited places in Connecticut and New York, including NYC. On Saturday, at around 5.30 pm, they were in Saratoga Springs, a restaurant surveillance camera showed. It was their last day of vacation and they were supposed to be in Montreal Sunday,Around 6.30 pm, Melina called her mother and she was fine.Police think Melina was killed between her phone call with her mother and when her father called the 911 at 9.58 pm Saturday. He told the police that he pulled over his car and went inside the woods to urinate. When he returned, he saw Melina was not there and two men forced her inside a white van. The 911 dall triggered an Amber alert as the frantic search for the nine-year-old began.Police said the abduction story started to disintegrate as the investigation continued as Melina's body was found at around 10.50 am Sunday in the shallow end of a pond in Ticonderoga.Police said the body was concealed under a log and an autopsy would reveal how she was killed.Luciano Frattolin has no criminal record in Canada and his estranged wife also did not believe there was any danger to their daughter from him. Melina's mother was given the full custody of Melina when the parents split in 2019 but Melina's father was authorized to take the daughter out on a vacation.","Luciano Frattolin, 45, charged in the US for murder of his daughter, appeared in the court Monday.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Asim Munir for President? Pakistan Defence Minister Denies Amid Buzz Of Asif Ali Zardari Quitting





A political and diplomatic dogfight is underway over a prospective visit to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump en route to the Quad summit in India in September amid a gradual recalibration of ties in the region.Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit after pulling off a coup by arranging a luncheon meeting last month for the country's army chief Asim Munir with the US President.Munir charmed Trump by endorsing him for a Nobel Peace Prize, playing up to his craving for one, and the Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits, despite having thrown itself at China's feet for survival.Although the White House has not confirmed Trump's Quad attendance given New Delhi is yet to nail the dates -- which also depends on the leaders of Japan and Australia -- Pakistan's excitable media broadcast that the US President would visit Pakistan on September 18, before retracting the report because Trump will be on a state visit to the UK from September 17-19.There are indications though that Trump may stopover in Pakistan whenever he heads out to the Quad summit.This could be as late as November given the MAGA supremo's obsession with trade deals over strategic alignments. He has just delivered a tariff shock to Japan and also riled up Australia, while India has proved to be a tough negotiator, frustrating his trade boffins attempts to strong-arm New Delhi into a quick deal.In fact, Trump's fetish for tariffs and his fixation on trade deals puts a question mark over the strategic salience of the Quad even as long-time allies and partners adjust to his mercurial approach.According to some diplomats, India itself may have to reassess its approach to Trump-era Washington after a rosy-eyed view of long-term strategic ties with the US. They acknowledge that Trump’s response during his second term to the Pakistani outreach – driven more by opportunism than any strategic vision – clearly caught India off guard. New Delhi resents the re-hyphenation that would be implicit in such a two-fer, but has no way of thwarting it.If Trump does visit Pakistan, it will be the first US Presidential trip to the country in nearly two decades after George W Bush layover in 2006. Bush stopped by in Islamabad for a few hours under a tight security blanket on his way back from a three-day visit to New Delhi, talking up counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan while rejecting its pleas for a nuclear deal similar to the one he forged with India.Presidents Obama and Biden both disdained even a stopover while Trump himself trashed Pakistan during his first term, accusing it of ""nothing but lies & deceit"" and providing ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.""Pakistan is now promising to turn itself into a safe haven for US businesses promoted by Trump associates -- including transforming Islamabad into the ""crypto capital of South Asia"" and a ""global leader in the digital finance revolution,’ -- to land a Presidential visit.During his first term, Trump is famously said to have complained about landing in Iraq and Afghanistan with the lights on Air Force One turned off (as a security measure), despite the US having spent billions on the countries. If the Pakistan stopover comes through, he may well insist on landing in full sight – to soak up the fanfare and flattery.","Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Monday it was creating a national paramilitary force, prompting concern among opposition parties and human rights groups that it could be used as a tool of political repression.The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force that will be called the Federal Constabulary, state minister for the interior Talal Chaudhry told a press conference in the eastern city of Faisalabad. Its new duties will include internal security, riot control and counter-terrorism, according to a copy of the amended law reported by the local Dunya News TV.The announcement came after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of former jailed PM Imran Khan said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of his arrest. Several such protests since his Aug 2023 arrest have turned violent, in some cases paralysing the capital Islamabad for days.“This will be a new force. This will be a stronger force. We need this force for internal security,” Chaudhry said, adding that President Asif Ali Zardari had already approved amendments in the law introducing changes in the paramilitary force.The new force replaces the Frontier Constabulary (FC), whose cadres were previously recruited only from tribes in the northwestern province, Chaudhry said.Training of the new force will bring it into line with other national law enforcement agencies, he added. Khan’s party spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari said the changes should be subject to parliamentary discussion.The new force “should not be used as a gimmick to silence political opponents, as has been previously witnessed when the government applied such laws against a large number of the PTI leadership and supporters,” he said. His concern was echoed by Haris Khalique, secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent body. “We are alarmed by the changes being made to the security and law enforcement structure of the country without any debate in parliament,” Khalique said.REUTERS","The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force.

Poliovirus found in 20 Pakistani districts amid rising vaccine refusals: New sewage data signals resurgence; 13th polio case confirmed in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/poliovirus-found-in-20-pakistani-districts-amid-rising-vaccine-refusals-new-sewage-data-signals-resurgence-13th-polio-case-confirmed-in-2025/articleshow/122421011.cms,"



Pakistan's battle against polio has hit a fresh setback, with the deadly virus detected in sewage samples across 20 districts, including the capital, just as the country grapples with rising vaccine refusal rates.According to ARY News, citing the National Reference Laboratory, 28 sewage samples collected between May 8 and June 17 tested positive for Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1). The presence of the virus was confirmed in major urban centres such as Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, as well as in districts across Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts. Lahore recorded three cases, while Islamabad and four districts in KP also registered positive samples. In Balochistan, the virus was found in Mastung, Khuzdar, and Sibi. Mirpur in PoJK also showed signs of the virus.This alarming development follows Pakistan’s second national polio vaccination drive earlier this year, which saw over 60,000 refusals, 39,000 of them in Karachi alone. These refusals, officials say, are now posing a major roadblock to the country’s eradication efforts.“We’re not just fighting a virus; we’re battling misinformation and mistrust,” a senior health official told ARY News.Pakistan remains one of only two countries where polio is still endemic, the other being Afghanistan. With the confirmation of another new case this week, the total number of polio cases in the country has reached 13 so far in 2025.Health experts warn that the virus spreads primarily through contaminated water or food and can cause paralysis or death. There is no cure for polio, making vaccination the only defense. The World Health Organisation emphasises that multiple oral doses are needed to protect children under five, the group most vulnerable to the disease.Despite ongoing national campaigns, large pockets in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain difficult to access for vaccination teams, leaving thousands of children at risk.As the virus resurfaces in urban and rural sewers alike, officials say the next phase in Pakistan’s anti-polio war must tackle both the virus, and vaccine hesitancy, with equal urgency.","Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts.

Pakistan’s economic performance under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) $7 billion loan programme has been “strong so far”, according to Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, reported PTI.Speaking at a lecture hosted by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Islamabad on Sunday, Binici said Pakistan’s first review under the three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF), approved in July 2024, was successfully completed by the IMF Executive Board in May.The EFF aims to cement macroeconomic stability and lay the groundwork for “stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth,” he said. So far, Pakistan has received two instalments under the programme, with the government implementing agreed policy measures aimed at fiscal discipline and investor confidence.“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici noted.He stressed the importance of structural reforms to ensure long-term economic sustainability, including strengthening tax equity, improving the business climate, and encouraging private-sector-led investment.Binici also welcomed Pakistan’s commitment to climate-related reforms under the $1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), approved in March.The RSF supports projects focused on disaster preparedness, efficient water use, green investments, and better climate data transparency.“Support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory,” he said.On regional prospects, Binici said economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including Pakistan, was expected to improve in 2025 and beyond. However, he warned that global economic uncertainty remains high due to trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation, and weakening cooperation.","Pakistan's economic performance under IMF's $7 billion loan programme has been'strong so far' Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, spoke at a lecture in Islamabad.

Karachi blackout protest chokes city traffic: Punjab Colony residents block roads after 24-hour outage; report points to systemic collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/karachi-blackout-protest-chokes-city-traffic-punjab-colony-residents-block-roads-after-24-hour-outage-report-points-to-systemic-collapse/articleshow/122418234.cms,"



A protest over a prolonged power outage in Karachi’s Punjab Colony spiraled into city-wide traffic chaos on Saturday, underscoring what many see as chronic governance failure and energy mismanagement in Pakistan, Dawn reported.Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity. Power had reportedly been out since 11 am Friday, and despite repeated complaints, K-Electric, Karachi’s sole power distributor, allegedly failed to respond.The resulting sit-in crippled traffic on Defence Road and nearby areas. Long queues of trucks and tankers vital to Karachi Port were stalled from Qayyumabad to the KPT Flyover. Major intersections like Boat Basin, Gizri, and Hino Chowrangi were brought to a standstill, leaving thousands of commuters stranded, according to Dawn.The outage reportedly followed K-Electric’s anti-theft operation in the adjacent P&T Colony. Protesters claimed legal connections were also cut off in the sweep, with no clear procedure followed. KE, however, described the protestors as ""miscreants"" attempting to restore illegal connections and said their teams were attacked during the operation, allegedly linked to a cable TV network.No evidence was provided implicating all affected residents in theft.While KE later claimed to have restored power to parts of the area, the larger issue remains unresolved. The incident highlights Pakistan’s ongoing struggle to provide reliable electricity, exacerbated by outdated infrastructure and lack of accountability in power distribution.As Dawn noted, the crisis is less about one blackout and more a reflection of systemic dysfunction, where citizens bear the brunt of institutional failure.","Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity.

Afghanistan was rocked by two more earthquakes early Saturday with a magnitude of around 4.0 on Richter scale, marking fifth such seismic event in the past week, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS).The first tremor, recorded at 1.26 am IST, measured 4.2 on the Richter scale with a depth of 190 km. The second quake struck just 45 minutes later at 2:11 am IST, registering a magnitude of 4.0 and a depth of 125 km. Both events were located in the northern region of Afghanistan, based on NCS data.On Friday night, another quake measuring 4.6 also shook the region. Earlier in the week, two more quakes of magnitudes 4.7 and 4.3 were reported, making this the fifth seismic jolt since July 17.Afghanistan’s vulnerability to frequent and often destructive earthquakes stems from its location at the convergence of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. The Hindu Kush mountain range, in particular, experiences frequent tremors and aftershocks.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) notes that Afghanistan remains highly prone to natural disasters including earthquakes, landslides, and seasonal floods. These events further strain communities already grappling with decades of conflict and limited infrastructure, making disaster response and recovery particularly challenging.","The first tremor measured 4.2 on the Richter scale with a depth of 190 km.

Claimed to be pregnant to extract over 7 million baht from one monk

Received around 385 million baht over three years, mostly from temple-linked accounts

Told media she had fallen in love with some of the monks and gave money to one

Reportedly spent much of the funds on online gambling

Phones seized from her home contained tens of thousands of compromising images and videos

Police say she is connected to multiple temples across Thailand

Has become a lightning rod in a scandal that has triggered broader questions about the abuse of wealth and status in Thai Buddhism.





A dramatic scandal involving Thailand’s senior Buddhist clergy has gripped the nation after the disappearance of a well-known monk led to a web of blackmail, sex, and temple money trails. At the centre of it all is Wilawan Emsawat, a woman now accused of seducing and extorting powerful monks, and exposing a deeper rot in Thailand’s religious institutions.The controversy erupted after Phra Thep Wachirapamok, a respected monk from a central Bangkok temple, vanished without a trace. Investigators soon found the trail led to Wilawan, whose home was reportedly filled with phones containing tens of thousands of compromising images and videos involving monks. Her financial records showed deposits linked to temple accounts, drawing in at least nine senior clergy who have since been disrobed or dismissed.Police say Wilawan used romantic relationships with monks to pressure them into paying large sums to maintain silence, money often transferred directly from temple funds. She allegedly claimed to be pregnant in one case and demanded 7.2 million baht from a monk who later fled the monkhood, the Guardian reported.Wilawan, now in her mid-30s, was arrested in Nonthaburi province on charges of extortion, money laundering, and receiving stolen property. She has not commented since her arrest, and it remains unclear whether she has legal representation. However, before her arrest, she admitted to relationships with at least two monks and a religious academic. She also expressed guilt, saying she had “fallen in love.”Police say 385 million baht (around $11.9 million) passed through Wilawan’s accounts in three years, much of which was spent on online gambling, as per the report.Thailand’s acting Prime Minister has now ordered a review of laws governing monk behaviour and temple finances, amid growing calls for reform.

I'd wake up and he would have started having sex with me,"" she said. ""Sometimes I'd just think 'let it carry on' but there would be other times when I would cry. And those times he'd sometimes stop, not all times, but then he'd be in a foul mood if he did.""She also recalled being kicked out of bed and having to sleep in the spare room with the door barricaded. A turning point came when she saw the abuse directed at their newborn. ""When our baby was just two weeks old I realised that the abuse may not stop with me. He turned round and said 'shut the F up' and it was said with such force and aggression,"" she said.In 2018, Griffiths was caught sexting two constituents and later resigned. After this, Kniveton left the family home but had to fight the family court to stop him from seeing their child. In 2021, a judge found that Griffiths had raped and abused her. He denies the rape.In 2019, Kniveton ran for Parliament against Griffiths and won. Through her new documentary, she wants to show how many family court cases involve abuse and why the system needs to change to protect victims and children.","Former Conservative MP Kate Kniveton has spoken out about the years of abuse she suffered from her ex-husband, former Tory MP Andrew Griffiths. In a new ITV documentary, Breaking The Silence: Kate’s Story, she shared how the abuse lasted for more than a decade and continued through legal channels.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122808641,imgsize-17364,width-400,resizemode-4/122808641.jpg"
"Antimicrobial resistant superbugs could kill millions, cost $2 trillion yearly by 2050: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/antimicrobial-resistant-superbugs-could-kill-millions-cost-2-trillion-yearly-by-2050-report/articleshow/122810364.cms,"Representative AI-generated image





Antimicrobial-resistant superbugs could lead to substantial global mortality and economic losses of approximately $2tn annually by 2050, according to a study, quoted by the Guardian.Analysis from a UK government-sponsored research reveals that rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) could result in yearly global GDP losses of $1.7 trillion over the next 25 years without decisive intervention.The Center for Global Development's research indicates severe economic impact on the US, UK and EU economies. Recent reductions in aid funding appear counterproductive, particularly as the UK government has eliminated Fleming fund support for AMR prevention in developing nations. Similarly, the US has confirmed $9 billion in foreign aid reductions, with European nations following suit.Anthony McDonnell, who led the research at the Center for Global Development, explained that initial projections were based on historical resistance trends. He noted that significant aid reductions by the US (80%), UK (from 0.5% to 0.3% of GNI), France, and Germany could accelerate resistance rates to worst-case scenarios.He emphasised that no country, regardless of their AMR control success, should be complacent. Without protecting AMR programmes from funding cuts, global resistance rates could escalate to match severely affected nations, resulting in increased mortality worldwide and substantial economic consequences.The study, covering 122 countries, projects annual GDP losses by 2050 could reach $722 billion in China, $295.7 billion in the US, $187 billion in the EU, $65.7 billion in Japan, and $58.6 billion in the UK under pessimistic scenarios.The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation forecasts a 60% increase in AMR-related deaths by 2050, with annual mortality reaching 1.34 million in the US and 184,000 in the UK. Drug-resistant infections are expected to rise significantly.Antibiotic-resistant infections double treatment costs due to increased hospitalisations, extended stays, expensive alternative treatments, and complex care requirements.The research estimates global AMR treatment costs could rise by $176bn annually, with UK costs increasing from $900m to $3.7bn and US costs from $15.5bn to $57bn.The study indicates workforce reductions of 0.8% in the UK, 0.6% in the EU, and 0.4% in the US due to resistant infections.However, increased investment in addressing superbugs could boost annual economic growth by $156.2bn in the US and $12bn in the UK by 2050.Dr Mohsen Naghavi from IHME warned that without immediate action, current medicines might become ineffective, potentially making simple infections lethal, according to The Guardian.This requires governmental policy changes, new drug development, and public education about antibiotics' ineffectiveness against viruses.A UK government representative highlighted their 10-year health strategy addressing AMR, citing progress in reducing antibiotic use in meat production and developing new treatment incentives whilst maintaining international cooperation.","Antibiotic-resistant superbugs could lead to substantial global mortality and economic losses of approximately $2tn annually by 2050.

‘Keep spreading the word’: Tommy Robinson shares cryptic message on social media; urges people to assemble in London,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/keep-spreading-the-word-tommy-robinson-shares-cryptic-message-on-social-media-urges-people-to-assemble-in-london/articleshow/122800630.cms,"Image: X@/TRobinsonNewEra





Far-right British activist Tommy Robinson on Sunday shared a cryptic post calling people to assemble in London but gave no further details.“The amount of people contacting me who are travelling from Ireland to London for September 13th is insane . We appreciate the support,” he posted on X.One user commented “Train tickets are booked for me gf & friends. And more friends say they are coming. Keep spreading the word,” sharing a picture of them wearing a t-shirt that read “September 13th London be there…enough is enough!!”Another user said “What is there on September 13th in London?’“Booked my tickets from Ireland yesterday. Meeting lads I've not seen for years. I wouldn't miss this for the world,” another user commented.Robinson previously posted “the future belongs to patriots, nothing can stop what is coming.” It is unclear whether these two posts are related.Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, 42, is known for his controversial statements, inflammatory views, and has a vocal presence on social media.He has previously been imprisoned for assault (2005), mortgage fraud (2014), and contempt of court offences (2019).Robinson presents himself as a whistleblower suppressed by the state, a narrative that has gained substantial online support, including public backing from Elon Musk. The latter reinstated Robinson’s X account earlier this year and substantiated his claims about establishment failures in prosecuting child exploitation cases.“Why is Tommy Robinson in a solitary confinement prison for telling the truth? He should be freed and those who covered up this travesty should take his place in that cell,” Musk said at the time.Robinson was initially a member of the far-right British National Party and in 2009, he co-founded the English Defence League (EDL) to protest the activities of a small Salafist group in Luton. While the movement claimed to oppose ""Islamist fascism,"" its influence waned in the early 2010s following revelations of ties to Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in July 2011, as per Le Monde.","Far-right British activist Tommy Robinson on Sunday shared a cryptic post calling people to assemble in London but gave no further details.

A 65-year-old grandmother masterminded one of UK’s most sophisticated drug trafficking operations, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison. Deborah Mason, infamously nicknamed the “Queen Bee” and “Gangster Granny,” ran a sprawling family-led drugs cartel that trafficked more than a ton of cocaine worth up to £80 million across the country.Mason and seven of her relatives, including her sister and children, operated the high-level narcotics ring over a seven-month period from April to November 2023, reported. On Friday, she was sentenced in a London courtroom alongside other key members of the syndicate.The court heard that Mason’s gang used a network of couriers to transport massive quantities of imported cocaine. The drugs were distributed from London to several major cities including Bradford, Leicester, Birmingham, Bristol, and Cardiff.The cartel’s value of cocaine ranged between £23 million and £35 million, while its street value was estimated at a whopping £80 million. Despite the scale of the operation, prosecutors noted that Mason’s relatives were not coerced into joining the syndicate, but were instead ""motivated by financial benefit.""Mason’s 29-year-old daughter, Roseanne Mason, played a crucial role in the cartel's logistics. She was responsible for managing collections of the drug shipments.In a show of how deeply involved the family was, Roseanne even babysat the children of other couriers so they could continue working uninterrupted. She was sentenced to 11 years in prison for her part in the operation.Other members of the gang received lengthy prison terms as well, with sentences ranging from 13 to 15 years based on their individual roles in the criminal enterprise.The Metropolitan Police launched a thorough investigation into the drug ring, employing a range of surveillance tactics, including analysis of extensive call data and physical tracking of suspects. Acting on critical intelligence, most of the gang members were apprehended in May 2024.","Deborah Mason, 65, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for her role in UK's largest-ever drug trafficking operation.

Man asks 'is this vegan restaurant?' at Iskcon-run Govinda's in UK; then pulls out KFC chicken and eats it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/man-asks-is-this-vegan-restaurant-at-iskcon-run-govinda-in-uk-then-pulls-out-kfc-chicken-and-eats-it-video-viral/articleshow/122796574.cms,"



A viral video has triggered widespread outrage online after a man was seen eating chicken at an Iskcon-run vegetarian restaurant 'Govinda's', despite clear instructions from the vendors that it was associated with a ""temple"".The footage, which could not be independently verified by the TOI, captured the chaotic scene as the man held out a half-eaten piece of chicken to stunned diners before erupting into a loud chant of “Free the chicken!”The incident began with the man walking in and asking the shopkeeper, “Is this a vegan restaurant?” The shopkeeper replied, “Yeah.” Seeking further confirmation, the man pressed, “So there’s no meat, no nothing?” To which the staff reiterated, pointing to the sign board outside, “No meat, no onion, no garlic.”The shopkeeper, attempting to clarify further, added, “It’s a temple,” referencing the restaurant’s affiliation with Iskcon, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, which follows strict vegetarian dietary practices in line with its religious beliefs.However, the conversation took an unexpected turn when the man, in what appeared to be a performative protest, suddenly took out a KFC bucket and started having chicken, leaving the vendors shocked.

"Debate over having Sikh Regiment in British Army resurfaces, but UK MoD says no such plans",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/debate-over-having-sikh-regiment-in-british-army-resurfaces-but-uk-mod-says-no-such-plans/articleshow/122786929.cms,"File photo





LONDON: The debate over whether there should be a Sikh regiment in the British armed forces has resurfaced but the ministry of defence (MoD) insists there are no such plans.The debate was triggered after Lord Sahota asked defence minister Lord Coaker in the House of Lords on July 7 whether there was any progress on having a Sikh regiment in the British Army, given the loyalty of Sikh soldiers in both world wars. Coaker replied, “Let me consider that request from my noble friend. I am quite happy to meet him to see what more we can do to recognise the contribution of soldiers such as Sikhs.” This led to UK headlines such as “Minister open to British Army Sikh regiment proposal”.But MoD sources told TOI: “Over the years there have been conversations about this, but it would breach Britain’s anti-discriminatory laws. There are no current plans for a Sikh regiment as it goes against the Equality Act. We want to do something to recognise Sikh contributions in some way, but not through a Sikh regiment.”Lord Sahota, whose grandfathers served in the British Indian army, including the 15th Punjab Regiment, told TOI: “I don’t think it would go against the Equality Act.” He pointed out the British Army has had the Staffordshire regiment and currently has the Brigade of Gurkhas, the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, Royal Welsh and Royal Regiment of Scotland and so on.“Itdoesn’t mean other faiths like Hindus, Muslim or Christians wouldn’t be able to serve in a Sikh regiment. If you are in the Royal Regiment of Scotland, it doesn’t mean you have to be Scottish.”.“We are struggling to recruit ethnic minorities in this country,” he said, and so having a Sikh Regiment would give Sikhs a “reason to join.” “They would wear turbans and have beards and it would reflect Sikh heritage and values,” he said.“It would foster a better relationship with other countries such as India and South Asia as well,” he added.There are estimated to be only 200 Sikhs in the British Armed Forces currently.“People tend to go in the army if their grandfather was in it. Sikhs don’t have that role model here,” Sahota said. He said if there was a Punjab or Sikh Regiment they would have that role model. “There are more than 700k Sikhs in the UK. I am sure quite a few would be prepared to follow in their great grandfather’s footsteps. King Charles even told a Sikh soldier he wanted to see more Sikhs in the British Army,” the Labour life peer added.", debate over whether there should be a Sikh regiment in the British armed forces has resurfaced. But the ministry of defence (MoD) insists there are no such plans.

BEIJING: China on Monday prepared to welcome Latin American leaders to Beijing for a major summit, seeking to draw the region closer in response to the trade war with the United States Beijing has stepped up economic and political cooperation with Latin American nations in recent years and urged a united front against US President Donald Trump's recent maelstrom of tariffs.Two-thirds of Latin American countries have joined Beijing's trillion-dollar Belt and Road (BRI) infrastructure programme, and China has surpassed the US as the biggest trading partner of Brazil, Peru and Chile, among others.The forum between China and the 33-member Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) is due to formally begin on Tuesday.Beijing has already begun welcoming regional leaders, notably Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who arrived in Beijing on Saturday for a five-day state visit.Lula has sought to improve ties with both China and the US since returning to power in early 2023. Brazilian exports to China reached more than $94 billion last year, according to the United Nations Comtrade Database.The South American agricultural power sends mainly soybeans and other primary commodities to China, while the Asian giant sells semiconductors, telephones, vehicles and medicines to Brazil.On Monday, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi hosted his Cuban counterpart Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla at Beijing's ornate Diaoyutai State Guesthouse for talks.Other expected attendees at the forum include Colombian President Gustavo Petro and Chilean President Gabriel Boric Petro said last week that he would sign a ""letter of intent"" to join the BRI when he meets Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming days.Xi will address the summit at its opening ceremony on Tuesday, according to Beijing's foreign ministry.A senior ministry official said on Sunday that Beijing had ""always approached the development of China-Latin America relations from a strategic and long-term perspective"".""The people of Latin America and the Caribbean seek to build their own homeland -- not to serve as the backyard of any other country,"" Miao Deyu told a press conference.China was ""willing to strengthen communication and coordination with Latin American countries"" in the face of US tariffs, and ""jointly work to... oppose unilateralism and economic bullying"", Miao said.","Beijing has stepped up economic and political cooperation with Latin American nations.

"'Set-jetting' turning fiction into real, and often expensive, vacations",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/set-jetting-turning-fiction-into-real-and-often-expensive-vacations/articleshow/121093958.cms,"The phenomenon, in which travellers choose vacation destinations based on TV series and films has become one of the biggest trends in travel (Representative AI image)





Have you found yourself dabbling with the idea of spending your next vacation at White Lotus, a luxury resort famous for its obnoxious guests and regular murders? Welcome to the world of "" set-jetting ,"" in which settings of popular movies and TVs shows like ""The White Lotus"" become pilgrimage sites for fans.The White Lotus resorts are, of course, fictional. But the properties where the HBO series films are real. And after seasons 1 and 2, set in Maui and Sicily, travellers flocked to those properties, and both reported a tenfold rise in bookings, said Marc Speichert, executive V-P and chief commercial officer of Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts. The company was not able to share booking numbers for its resort in Thailand, where the latest season was set.The term set-jetting - a play on ""jet set"" - appears to date to a 2007 New York Post article describing the allure of trips inspired by films like ""The Queen"" (Brocket Hall, near London) and ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (the Segovia region of Spain).The concept goes back to at least the 1960s, said Daniel L Spears, an associate professor of hospitality and tourism, who has studied the trend. After the 1965 blockbuster ""The Sound of Music"", tourism to Austria surged, particularly to Mirabell Garden in Salzburg, setting for the song ""Do-Re-Mi"".Set-jetting picked up steam in the early 2000s, when ""Lord of the Rings"" franchise began to draw large numbers of Shire- and Rivendell-obsessed tourists to New Zealand, and ""Game of Thrones"" did the same for Iceland and Croatia. Since then, the options have exploded.One of the biggest players in the field, the luxury travel company Black Tomato, offers an array of set-jetting vacations, including adventures that'll make you feel you're in a ""Yellowstone"" episode, with horseback riding and a fireside dinner with cowboys. If you fancy a tuxedo and a stiff (and shaken) martini, its menu of James Bond-themed trips is vast, including a training session with a stunt coordinator from the five latest 007 films. Black Tomato's clients typically pay $10,000 to $20,000 per person for a 10-day trip, said a company official. It's a long way mentally from the once-idyllic Coco Palms Resort of ""Blue Hawaii"" to the unsettling plot lines of ""The White Lotus"". Why are so many people travelling to places that are not exactly the stuff of ukulele solos and flower leis? It might be the immersive nature of streaming establishes a deep bond with the characters and the place, giving fans a ""sense of nostalgia,"" Spears said. ""There's a dark turn, but there's also emotional connection.""","""Set-jetting"" is a phenomenon in which travellers choose vacation destinations based on TV series and films.

DHAKA/NEW DELHI: Bangladesh 's deposed PM Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League on Sunday rejected ""with disgust"" the interim govt's decision to ban the party and vowed to continue its operations despite the restriction.The Muhammad Yunus-headed interim govt's council of advisers or the cabinet on Saturday night slapped a ban on ""all activities of Awami League"", including in cyberspace, under an anti-terrorism law.

UK government to tighten immigration rules amid voter anger over 'failed experiment in open borders',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/uk-government-to-tighten-immigration-rules-amid-voter-anger-over-failed-experiment-in-open-borders/articleshow/121092591.cms,"UK PM Keir Starmer (AP)





LONDON: British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will on Monday unveil plans to tighten immigration rules, confronting an issue that has bedeviled successive governments and fuelled the rise of a new anti-immigrant party that could threaten the country's political establishment. Starmer, whose centre-left Labour Party won a landslide victory last July, is facing pressure from voters who are increasingly frustrated by high levels of immigration that many believe have strained public services and inflamed ethnic tensions in some parts of the country.Starmer is pledging to end what his office described as ""Britain's failed experiment in open borders,"" less than two weeks after Reform UK rode the immigration issue to victories in local elections.Labour and the center-right Conservatives, long the dominant parties in British politics, both saw their support crater in the contests for local government councils and mayors.""Every area of the immigration system, including work, family and study, will be tightened up so we have more control. Enforcement will be tougher than ever and migration numbers will fall,'' Starmer said in excerpts of a speech to be delivered on Monday.""We will create a system that is controlled, selective and fair.""Immigration has been a potent issue in Britain since 2004, when the European Union expanded to Eastern Europe. While most EU countries restricted immigration from the new member states for a period of years, the UK immediately opened its labor market, attracting a flood of new arrivals.By 2010, then-Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to cut annual net immigration to less than 1,00,000, a target four Conservative governments failed to meet. In 2016, anger over the government's inability to control immigration from the EU triggered a referendum in which Britain voted to leave the bloc.But Brexit did nothing to reduce the number of people entering the country on visas for work, education and family reunification.In recent years, concerns that the government has lost control of Britain's borders have been fuelled by the sight of thousands of migrants entering the U.K. illegally on leaky, inflatable boats operated by people smugglers. Some 37,000 people crossed the English Channel on small boats last year, down from 45,755 in 2022, government statistics show.Reform's performance in the local elections was ""because people are raging, furious, about the levels of both legal and illegal immigration,"" Deputy Party Leader Richard Tice told Sky News.Annual net migration, the number of people entering the UK minus those who left, stood at 7,28,000 in the year to June 2024. While that figure was down 20% from the year to June 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics, it was still more than seven times the target set by the Conservatives in 2010.Starmer's government doesn't plan to set a new target, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who is in charge of immigration, said on Sunday.""We're not going to take that really failed approach, because I think what we need to do is rebuild credibility and trust in the whole system,"" she said in an interview with Sky News.Instead, she said, the government will focus on policies such as restricting visas for lower-skilled workers. The new rules will mean 50,000 fewer visas for these workers next year, Cooper said.Chris Philp, Cooper's Conservative counterpart, said his party will support such proposals but they don't go far enough.""Tomorrow we intend to push to a vote in Parliament a measure that would have an annual cap on migration voted for and set by Parliament to restore proper democratic accountability, because those numbers were far, far too high,"" he said.","UK PM Keir Starmer will unveil plans to tighten immigration rules on Monday.

QUITO: Five fishermen who spent 55 days adrift at sea arrived Saturday at a port in the Galapagos Islands after being rescued by a tuna boat, the Ecuadorian navy said on X.The three Peruvians and two Colombians had been missing since mid-March and were found on May 7 by an Ecuadorian boat called Aldo.The fishermen had reported damage to the boat's alternator two days after setting sail from Pucusana Bay, to the south of Peru's capital Lima, the navy said in a separate post on Friday.The failure caused communication and navigation tools to malfunction, Ecuadorian navy Frigate Capt. Maria Fares told The Associated Press, adding that they had no power on the boat.""They had no starter, lights and everything that a battery generates,"" she said.To survive, they had to ""take rusted water out of the engine (and) when a fish passed by, they caught it and parboiled it to eat."" Fares added that they also drank rain and sea water to survive.The men are in stable condition and the navy said it is coordinating with local and foreign authorities to ensure their safe return to their respective countries.Earlier this year, another Peruvian fisherman, 61-year-old Maximo Napa, spent 95 days at sea alone. He was also rescued by an Ecuadorian vessel and returned to Lima in mid-March to be reunited with his family.","Three Peruvians and two Colombians had been missing since mid-March and were found on May 7 by an Ecuadorian boat called Aldo.

Donald Trump announces plan to cut prescription drug prices by 30% to 80%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-announces-plan-to-cut-prescription-drug-prices-by-30-to-80/articleshow/121092102.cms,"(File photo)





US President Donald Trump has pledged to slash prescription drug and pharmaceutical prices in the United States by as much as 80 percent through a new executive order, reviving a key issue from his first term in office. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he would sign the order on Monday morning, promising Americans immediate relief from high medication costs.“For many years the World has wondered why Prescription Drugs and Pharmaceuticals in the United States States of America were so much higher in price than they were in any other nation,” Trump wrote. “Sometimes being five to ten times more expensive than the same drug, manufactured in the exact same laboratory or plant, by the same company???”Trump said the new policy would introduce a “MOST FAVORED NATION’S POLICY,” tying the cost of drugs sold in the US to the lowest price paid by any other country for the same drug.“Our Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,” he added.The US president accused pharmaceutical companies of exploiting Americans by citing research and development costs to justify inflated prices. “Campaign Contributions can do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican Party,” he wrote. “We are going to do the right thing, something that the Democrats have fought for many years.”Trump said the policy would not only lead to reductions in US drug prices of between 30 and 80 percent but would also force prices to rise in other countries to match, calling it a matter of fairness. “They will rise throughout the World in order to equalize and, for the first time in many years, bring FAIRNESS TO AMERICA!” he wrote.If implemented, the executive order would primarily affect drugs administered in doctors’ offices and covered under Medicare Part B — such as cancer treatments and other injectable medications. These are some of the most expensive drugs Medicare covers, and costs for them reached $33 billion in 2021.Trump first introduced a similar plan during his first term, but it was blocked in court and never took effect. At the time, the pharmaceutical industry lobbied hard against it, arguing that pegging US prices to foreign rates would undermine innovation and give foreign governments control over US drug costs.Despite the previous failure, Trump insisted that this time would be different, promising that the move would “save TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS.” The proposal is expected to face strong pushback once again from drug manufacturers.","US President Donald Trump has pledged to slash prescription drug and pharmaceutical prices in the United States by as much as 80 percent.

What is the row over 'flying palace'?



Why Trump needs a new plane







Qater reacted to the report that President Donald Trump is going to be gifted a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet as a gift from the ruling family of Qatar during his trip to the Middle East and said the matter remains under review. Ali Al-Ansari, Qatar’s media attaché, in a statement, said, ""Reports that a jet is being gifted by Qatar to the United States government during the upcoming visit of President Trump are inaccurate. ""“The possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One is currently under consideration between Qatar’s Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense,” the statement said. “But the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made.”ABC News reported a detailed plan over the jet, called 'flying palace' because of its amenities and said it would be converted into Air Force One for Trump's use as long as he is in office. And then it will go to the presidential library. Democrats called it a broad daylight bribery, but Qatar drew the line and said it could be a transaction, not a gift.The Constitution’s Emoluments Clause bars anyone holding government office from accepting any present, emolument, office or title from any “King, Prince, or foreign State,” without congressional consent.“Nothing says ‘America First’ like Air Force One, brought to you by Qatar,"" Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. ""It’s not just bribery, it’s premium foreign influence with extra legroom.”Both the planes that Trump flies on are more than 30 years old. Boeing Inc. has the contract to produce updated versions, but delivery has been delayed while the company has lost billions of dollars on the project.Delivery has been pushed to some time in 2027 for the first plane and in 2028 — Trump’s final full year in office — for the second.This Qateri aircraft can work as a stop gap with the Air Force planning to add secure communications and other classified elements to it.","Qatar dismissed reports of possibly gifting its super jet to Trump and said no decision has been taken.

Is it legal for Trump to accept a plane from a country?





During his visit to the Middle East, President Donald Trump would receive the most expensive gift ever extended to the United States from a foreign government -- from the royal family of Qatar. It is a super luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet that President Trump will use as his new Air Force One.ABC News reported that the gift is expected to be announced next week when Trump visits Qatar on his first foreign trip of his second term. A Qatari official said that it is not a gift to Trump, individually. But it is more of a government-to-government transaction.Trump and his aides toured the plane earlier this year at the airport in Palm Beach and Trump boasted about the luxurious features of the plane; he was so impressed.Trump has become frustrated that Boeing is not readying his new plane and at one point entrusted Elon Musk with the task of expediting the delivery of a new plane.The plane is called the flying palace because of its plush interiors. It has plush, well-designed bathrooms, private bedrooms and a grand staircase. The aircraft flew around the members of the Qatari royal family and was then put in the service of the Turkish government.Now the plane will be transferred to the United States Air Force, which will modify the 13-year-old aircraft to meet US military specifications required for a presidential plane. Aviation company L3Harris has been commissioned to overhaul the plane. The plane is expected to be ready by this year.When Trump's second term ends, the plane is expected to be transferred to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation.Senator Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and vocal Trump critic, wrote on X, ""[it] seems pretty clear that a $400 million 'air palace' from a foreign emir qualifies.

About 49 White South Africans will be admitted to the US Monday while everyone else remains most unwelcome in Donald Trump's administration. Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, said this will be the first move in a ""much larger-scale relocation effort"". “What’s happening in South Africa fits the textbook definition of why the refugee program was created,” Miller said. “This is race-based persecution. The refugee program is not intended as a solution for global poverty — and historically, it has been used that way.”These South Africans will get US citizenship, apart from housing, groceries. As many as 1,000 Afrikaners could be admitted to the US this year.Afrikaners are a Southern African ethnic group which descended from mainly Dutch settlers who first arrived at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652.They claim to have been victims of racial discrimination. Trump accused the South African government of confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people very badly.What Elon Musk said about this alleged racial discriminationElon Musk, who is also from South Africa, claimed on X that a political group is promoting a ""white genocide"" in the country. But the claim has been widely denied. Musk has been openly critical of the Expropriation Act.South Africa's transport ministry said the first group, which has been selected for resettlement in the US, would leave by Sunday evening. Transport ministry spokesman Collen Msibi told AFP on Sunday that 49 individuals were set to leave from Johannesburg's main airport on a chartered flight at 8:00 pm (1800 GMT).Trump said in March that any South African farmer seeking to ""flee"" would have a ""rapid pathway"" to US citizenship, despite halting all other refugee arrivals to the US immediately after taking office in January.South Africa's foreign ministry on Friday said the resettlement of Afrikaners ""under the guise of being 'refugees' is entirely politically motivated and designed to question South Africa's constitutional democracy"". It would however ""not block citizens who seek to depart the country from doing so"", it added.","49 South Africans will be admitted to the US on Monday.

"Major mayhem in Newark airport: 80 flights cancelled, 40 delayed owing to fresh outage",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/major-mayhem-in-newark-airport-80-flights-cancelled-40-delayed-owing-to-fresh-outage/articleshow/121083274.cms,"Newark airport experience another outage on Sunday morning resulting in flight cancellations and delays.

What's happening in US airspace?







At least 80 flights were cancelled and around 40 were delayed at Newark Liberty International Airport on Sunday morning amid a back-to-back aviation crisis in Newark. The FAA said in a statement that a telecommunications issue at the Philadelphia TRACON Area C facility, which guides aircraft in and out of Newark, caused the agency to issue a ground stop for 45 minutes.Operations have returned to normal now but this was the third time that air traffic got affected in Newark.On Friday morning, radar screens at the airport went black for about 90 seconds, according to the FAA. During the outage, which unfolded about 3:55 a.m., air traffic controllers could be heard telling a FedEx plane that their screens went dark and then asking the aircraft to tell their company to put pressure on to get the problem fixed.The outages come when the US airspace witnessed some of the most tragic crashes this year. Transport secretary Sean Duffy on Saturdat said he is concerned about the whole airspace of the United States as FAA is using old equipment.""I'm concerned about the whole airspace,"" Duffy said during an interview with NBC News' Meet the Press. ""The equipment that we use—much of it we can't buy parts for new. We have to go on eBay and buy parts if one part goes down.""""You're dealing with really old equipment. We're dealing with copper wires, not high-speed fiber,"" he said.Duffy said Sunday “it is” safe to fly out of Newark airport , adding that flights will be scaled back at the airport in the interim while the issue is fixed.He didn’t say exactly how long delays and cancellations will last, but said, “In the next several weeks, we’re going to have this reduced capacity at Newark. I’m convening a meeting of all the airlines that serve Newark, get them to agree on how they’re going to reduce the capacity. So you book, you fly.”“We are building a new line that goes directly from Newark to the Philly Tracon, which controls the New York airspace,” Duffy said, adding he believes that will be complete by the end of the summer.","At least 80 flights were cancelled and around 40 were delayed at Newark Liberty International Airport on Sunday morning.

Why are judges in US getting pizzas that they didn't even order?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-are-judges-in-us-getting-pizzas-that-they-didnt-even-order/articleshow/121082904.cms,"Anonymous pizza delivery only to judges: What is this strange thing happening?



'We are now not opening the door'







Several judges in the US have complained of getting pizzas delivered to their houses and even to their relatives, though they did not place any order for these pizzas. Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI director Kash Patel have been asked to investigate the matter as the judges think these anonymous pizzas delivered are part of a threat that the President Donald Trump administration is giving them.Many of these pizzas were sent to judges who are presiding over cases against the administration.According to reports, the deliveries began around late February. In March, the office of the US Marshald for the Southern District of New York sent a memo to some judges in the area mentioning this anonymous deliveries and said the incidents appeared to be connected to high-profile court cases, the Washington Post reported.The senders have targeted judges at multiple levels, including Supreme Court justices, and the children of some judges.US Circuit Judge J. Michelle Childs told the Washington Post that she received seven anonymous pizza deliveries at her home in the past few months — one shortly after she gave a verdict against the Trump administration.“It’s really an unnecessary and an unfortunate threat to our security when we’re trying to be judicial officers in a very neutral position with respect to our cases,” she said.“You need a strong judiciary for the system to work. This is infringing on democracy generally.”Childs said that now she does not open the door when a delivery person arrives -- after several unsolicited pizza deliveries. “We’ve been asking questions, not opening the door, just looking through the Ring,” she said, adding that the deliveries have come through multiple pizza vendors and one third-party delivery app. “Each time, we learn a little bit more.”","Judges in the US have complained of getting pizzas delivered to their houses and even to their relatives, though they did not place any order for these pizzas.

From 'bridge builder' to 'force for unity': How catholics perceive American-born Pope Leo XIV,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-bridge-builder-to-force-for-unity-how-catholics-perceive-american-born-pope-leo-xiv/articleshow/121082818.cms,"Pope Leo XIV (Image: AP)





The election of Pope Leo XIV , the first pope born in the United States, was welcomed with optimism by Catholics across both liberal and conservative viewpoints.Many hope that the new pontiff can bring unity and reduce tensions among different groups within the Church.Catholics with liberal views are hopeful that Pope Leo XIV will carry forward Pope Francis ’ legacy, especially his focus on helping the poor, immigrants, and marginalised communities. They also hope he will speak out against Trump administration policies that conflict with their values.Catholics belonging to the conservative stance believe that Pope Leo will firmly uphold traditional Church doctrines, particularly its teachings against abortion, same-sex marriage, and the ordination of women.One of the key reasons for this hopeful outlook is Leo’s strong message of unity. His motto and early remarks have emphasised bringing people together within the global Church “He will be a good force for unity in the Church. Even with differences of opinion and different ideas of strategy and so forth, we can have unity in the church,” said San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone, describing Leo as a “bridge builder.”The announcement of a US-born citizen being elected as the next pope came as a surprise to many, including John McGreevy, a historian of Catholicism, who thought a US-born pope was highly unlikely.However, he noted that Pope Leo has had a global journey—serving in Peru, working in the Vatican, and leading an international religious order.“He is a global catholic citizen,” McGreevy said. He added, “Even though he's an American, and we're super proud that he's American, it's hard to think of someone more embedded in a lot of the global church.”A major issue during Pope Francis’ time was how the Church handled Catholic politicians who support abortion rights , such as former US President Joe Biden and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Pope Francis allowed Biden to receive Communion (holy supper of the Lord), even though some bishops disagreed because he supported abortion rights. Pope Leo’s past sermons, where he spoke about protecting life from the unborn to the elderly, have reassured abortion opponents like US Representative Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican.At the same time, reproductive rights groups like Catholics for Choice acknowledged Leo’s opposition to abortion but still hope he will take a more inclusive and compassionate approach to issues like birth control, IVF and reproductive health The role of women in the Church is still a major issue. Pope Francis gave women more leadership roles but did not allow them to become priests or deacons. Supporters of women’s ordination are watching Pope Leo closely. Ellie Hidalgo from Discerning Deacons said his past words showed humility and a commitment to service. The Women’s Ordination Conference also hopes he will engage in an open dialogue with Catholic women.Pope Francis helped shape Pope Leo XIV’s path by entrusting him with key roles in Peru and later at the Vatican, where he oversaw the appointment of bishops. Experts believe Pope Leo will likely continue Francis’ trend of selecting bishops who focus more on caring for people rather than strictly enforcing rules.Many were worried that having a pope from the US might give the country too much influence in the Catholic Church, especially because of its power as a global superpower. They expect Leo to focus on Church teachings, particularly on important global issues like migration and climate change , rather than favoring any one country’s interests.",The election of Pope Leo XIV was welcomed with optimism by Catholics across both liberal and conservative viewpoints.

180-degree turn in a day: What happened?



Wild accusations surface against Kash Patel







Indian-origin director of the FBI, Kash Patel , who came on the radar for his misuse of FBI jets for personal use, recently showed his independence as he complained that the administration allocated too small a budget for the FBI. Testifying before a House panel on Wednesday, Patel said the FBI needed more than what has been proposed in the budget plan.The White House budget, recently submitted to Congress, would cut FBI funding by around 5 per cent. Patel told members of the House that he would need $1 billion more than what the White House proposed.“In order to achieve the mission of the FBI, if we continue on the current trajectory outlined, we will have to not only eliminate 1,100 vacancies currently at the FBI, I’ll have to fire 1,300 more,” Patel said.A day later, Patel backtracked his comments and said he would make the mission work on whatever budget has been promised to him. “My view is that we will make and agree with this budget as it stands and make it work for the operational necessity of the FBI,” Patel told members of a Senate Appropriations subcommittee Thursday.“As the head of the FBI, I was simply asking for more funds because I can do more with more money,” he explained his earlier demand but did not explain why he did not stick to that.In recent days, wild allegations against Patel are doing the rounds, starting with former FBI official Frank Figliuzzi claiming that Kash Patel is spotted more at nightclubs than in the office. Another report citing FBI insiders claimed that Kash Patel reduced the number of meetings and seems not interested in his work. He spends more time in sporting events, works from home, uses FBI jets to visit girlfriend -- and the allegations go on. FBI spokesperson Ben Williamson, however, dismissed these claims and said Patel comes to office every day and his work speaks for itself. The sporting events he attended were mostly for his close friends and as far as the allegations of flying on FBI jets are concerned, the FBI director is only supposed to take FBI jets for flying for security reasons.","Indian-origin director of the FBI, Kash Patel, recently showed his independence as he complained that the administration allocated too small a budget for the FBI.

Earthquake of 5.7 magnitude hits Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/earthquake-of-5-7-magnitude-hits-pakistan/articleshow/121050126.cms,"Representative photo





A 5.7-magnitude earthquake struck Pakistan on Saturday morning, Reuters reported. The tremor occurred just hours after a 4.0-magnitude quake had hit the region.Shallow earthquakes tend to be more dangerous than deeper ones because their seismic waves have a shorter distance to travel to the Earth's surface. This results in stronger ground shaking, increasing the potential for structural damage and higher casualties.Pakistan is among the most seismically active countries in the world due to its position along the boundary between the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The ongoing collision between these plates generates frequent and often destructive seismic activity.Several major fault lines run through the country, further heightening its vulnerability. The provinces of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, and the former FATA lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian Plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir sit on the north-western edge of the Indian Plate.",Shallow earthquakes tend to be more dangerous than deeper ones because their seismic waves have a shorter distance to travel to the Earth's surface.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday called a meeting of National Command Authority after India targeted at least four Pakistan air bases in response to Pakistan’s recent cross-border drone and missile attacks that targeted multiple Indian military and civilian locations.National Command Authority is Pakistan’s highest security decision-making body, comprising senior civilian and military leaders. It oversees key national security matters, including the country’s nuclear weapons policy and strategic planning.However, Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif, later said that no such meeting was held.""This thing that you have spoken about (nuclear option) is present, but let's not talk about it - we should treat it as a very distant possibility, we shouldn't even discuss it in the immediate context,"" Asif told ARY TV.""Before we get to that point, I think temperatures will come down. No meeting has happened of the National Command Authority, nor is any such meeting scheduled,"" he added.This comes after India destroyed key Pakistani posts and terrorist launch pads near Jammu, which were being used to launch tube-launched drones, news agency ANI reported citing sources.Earlier in the morning, multiple explosions were reported across several locations in Pakistan, indicating possible Indian punitive action in response to recent cross-border escalations.According to Pakistani claims, three of its air bases were targeted: Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi, Murid Air Base in Chakwal, and Rafiqui Air Base in Jhang district of eastern Punjab province.The Indian retaliatory strikes come after a series of provocations from Pakistan, including a major drone offensive on strike, when 26 locations—from Jammu and Kashmir to Gujarat—were targeted using armed drones. Defence sources confirmed that Indian forces successfully thwarted these attacks, which were aimed at key infrastructure such as airports and air bases, for a second consecutive night.On Thursday night, Indian defence systems also intercepted and neutralized drones and missiles launched in an attempt to strike military installations in 15 northern and western Indian cities.The latest actions are part of a broader Indian military response under Operation Sindoor, which began on Wednesday.As part of that operation, Indian armed forces carried out precise missile strikes on nine terror targets in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and Pakistan. The operation was launched in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed the lives of 26 innocent civilians.","Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called a meeting of National Command Authority.

NEW DELHI: Amid its widening hostilities with India, Pakistan army came under a sensational attack in South Waziristan, resulting in the death of 20 security personnel. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack.Two more Pakistani soldiers were killed in a clash with Baloch insurgents The attack by TTP took place on Thursday night on Pakistan military's Dawngate outpost in Shakai sub-division of South Waziristan, sources said. TTP claimed it was a multi-phase operation, initially killing six soldiers using laser-aided rifles after which a military convoy sent to support the besieged outpost was ambushed.According to the group, 20 security personnel were killed and five wounded.TTP accused Pakistan army of leaking coordinates of Jaish-e-Mohammed's Bahawalpur Markaz, which was targeted in an Indian air strike that killed 14, including 10 family members of JeM chief Masood Azhar. TTP spokesman Md Khorasani expressed grief over the incident, criticising Pakistan army as a ""traitorous and pro-Western"" group that provided the information leading to the attack.Khorasani described Pakistan army as a ""professional killer group"" that served foreign interests at the expense of its own people.He accused Pakistan army of ""handing over mujahideen to infidels"", a reference to Osama bin Laden's killing in Abbotabad.On Friday evening, Baloch Freedom fighters launched coordinated attacks across various regions of Balochistan, targeting Pakistani forces and infrastructure. The attacks occurred in multiple locations, including Turbat, where a grenade attack targeted Pakistani forces in D Baloch area, and Quetta, where two grenade attacks hit Pakistani army posts in Hazarganji and Faizabad areas.The fresh attacks came two days after Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) targeted Pakistani military vehicle in Bolan. An IED blast killed at least eight soldiers, including a special operations commander. Six were critically injured. A week prior, 10 Pakistan army personnel were killed in an IED attack by BLA in Quetta.Pakistan is under mounting pressure as TTP and BLA have intensified their attacks.

A magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck Tibet in the early hours of Monday, according to National Center for Seismology (NCS). The tremor was recorded at a depth of just 10km.The NCS posted the seismic details on X, stating the quake occurred at 2:41am IST, with coordinates at latitude 29.02°N and longitude 87.48°E. Just days earlier, on May 8, the region experienced a smaller 3.7 magnitude quake at a similar depth.Experts warn that shallow earthquakes often have more severe effects, as energy is released closer to the surface, leading to stronger ground shaking and a higher potential for destruction.The Tibetan Plateau lies along a major fault line where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide, making the area highly prone to seismic activity.These tectonic shifts continue to shape the Himalayas.Speaking to *Al Jazeera*, geophysicist Marianne Karplus said that while earthquakes cannot be predicted, scientific research and investment in resilient infrastructure are essential to minimise risk and improve safety in vulnerable regions.","A magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck Tibet in the early hours of Monday.

Bangladesh's Electoral Commission is waiting for an official interim government notice to determine the fate of Awami League's registration after the interim administration, under Muhammad Yunus, prohibited the party's operations using anti-terrorism legislation.Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin indicated they would convene to address the registration matter upon receiving the gazette on Monday.Under Bangladesh's electoral laws, the Awami League's potential deregistration would prevent their participation in the forthcoming general election, scheduled between December 2025 and June 2026.On Saturday evening, the interim government's Council of Advisers implemented restrictions on ""all activities of Awami League"", including digital presence, under anti-terrorism provisions.The Council's office confirmed that the official notification would be published on the next business day.The Council stated that restrictions would continue until the International Crimes Tribunal concludes proceedings against the party and its leadership, citing national security and sovereignty concerns.The decision also aims to protect the security of participants and witnesses involved in the July 2024 uprising, which resulted in the Awami League government's removal.Under Yunus's chairmanship, the meeting modified the ICT legislation to encompass trials of political organisations, their subsidiaries and associated groups.The Awami League's 16-year administration under Hasina ended on August 5 following student-initiated civil unrest, causing the 77-year-old leader to seek refuge in India.Yunus assumed leadership of the interim government three days after Hasina's departure.Hasina and numerous party officials currently face multiple legal charges, including corruption and mass murder allegations. Most party leaders and former ministers are either in custody or have left the country.The Awami League, established in 1949, spearheaded Bengali autonomy movements in former East Pakistan and subsequently led the 1971 Liberation War.At Sunday's press briefing, Yunus's press secretary Shafiqul Alam suggested that democratic nations would likely support the interim government's ban on ""this shameless, killer, anti-democracy and corrupt party"".","Bangladesh's Electoral Commission is waiting for an official interim government notice to determine the fate of Awami League's registration.

COLOMBO: A passenger bus skidded off a cliff in Sri Lanka's tea-growing hill country on Sunday, killing 21 people and injuring at least 14 others, an official said.The accident occurred in the early hours of Sunday near the town of Kotmale, about 140 kilometers (86 miles) east of Colombo, the capital, in a mountainous area of central Sri Lanka, police said.Deputy Minister of Transport and Highways Prasanna Gunasena told the media that 21 people died in the accident and 14 others are being treated in hospitals.Local television showed the bus lying overturned at the bottom of a precipice while workers and others helped remove injured people from the rubble.The driver was injured and among those admitted to the hospital for treatment. At the time of the accident, nearly 50 people were traveling on the bus.The bus was operated by a state-run bus company, police said.Deadly bus accidents are common in Sri Lanka, especially in the mountainous regions, often due to reckless driving and poorly maintained and narrow roads.","The accident occurred in the early hours of Sunday near the town of Kotmale, about 140 kilometers (86 miles) east of Colombo, the capital.

Bangladesh’s interim government on Saturday banned the Awami League , the party once led by deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina The decision was taken under the country’s anti-terrorism law and is expected to be formalised through a gazette notification on the next working day.The statement from Muhammad Yunus ’s office described the action as a “statement of the council of advisers”, referring to the Cabinet. The ban will stay in effect until the International Crimes Tribunal completes trials against the Awami League and several of its top leaders.The tribunal will examine allegations connected to events leading up to and during the Awami League’s rule, which ended following a popular uprising in July 2024.Officials said the move was also aimed at ensuring the safety of individuals who led the July uprising, as well as the complainants and witnesses involved in the ICT trials.""The decision was taken in the interest of protecting the country's security and sovereignty,"" the statement read.In a parallel development, the council of advisers chaired by interim leader Muhammad Yunus amended existing legislation governing the International Crimes Tribunal. The changes now allow the tribunal to prosecute not only individuals but also entire political parties, their front organisations, and affiliated bodies.The Awami League, founded in 1949, has been one of the most influential political forces in Bangladesh. It spearheaded the autonomy movement for Bengalis during the era of East Pakistan and played a central role in the 1971 Liberation War.","The decision was taken under the country’s anti-terrorism law.

Colombo, May 07, 2025 -Sri Lanka's leftist government won local council elections but with significantly lower margins, in its first test since sweeping national polls last year, official results showed on Wednesday.President Anura Kumara Dissanayake 's coalition received the most votes in 265 out of the 339 councils, but fell short of an outright majority in about half of them.The main opposition SJB won just 14 councils, while the country's main minority Tamil party, the Tamil National Alliance , performed better, winning 35.The parties of former presidents Ranil Wickremesinghe and Mahinda Rajapaksa failed to win control of a single council, but between them secured 1,123 of the 8,299 council seats.The leftist NPP will need the support of other parties to control about 130 councils where it fell short of an absolute majority, but has ruled out any coalition with traditional parties.Dissanayake's NPP vote share fell to 43.3 percent, down from the 61.6 percent it secured at the November parliamentary election.The main opposition SJB made a marginal gain, reaching 21.7 percent, up from 17.70 percent.Dissanayake, who upset the more established parties to win the September presidential election, built on his popularity to secure the parliamentary vote held two months later.The 56-year-old has made a U-turn since coming to power on his pledge to renegotiate the terms of an unpopular IMF bailout agreed by his predecessor, and has maintained high tariffs.He had turned the local elections into a referendum on his six-month-old administration, saying it was essential for his party to secure local councils so that all layers of government were ""free of corruption and endemic waste"".About 60 percent of the 17.14 million electorate turned out to vote on Tuesday, down from nearly 70 percent in November and 80 percent in the September presidential vote.The campaign was lacklustre, with no high-profile figures in the running.","President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's coalition received the most votes in 265 out of the 339 councils.

LONDON: Sky News has traced social media accounts expressing support for jihadist terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and al-Qaida to the exact location of the building in Muridke, Pakistan, which was struck by India last week in retaliation for the Pahalgam terrorist attack .A Sky News forensics and data team geolocated to Markaz Taiba in Muridke multiple videos on TikTok, YouTube and Google which express support for the LeT and ""313"", referring to the 313 Brigade , al-Qaida's military wing in Pakistan.The videos were posted before India blew the complex up last week. The channel confirmed the video locations using satellite imagery in and around the complex.According to Stanford University's mapping militants project, members of 313 Brigade include Taliban and allied jihadist groups, such as Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, LeT and Jaish-e-Muhammed . 313 Brigade has been behind many high-profile attacks and bombings inside Pakistan.Captions, hashtags and usernames posting these videos express support for either or both the LeT and ""313"".

US president Donald Trump on Thursday confirmed a trade framework with the United Kingdom that reduces tariffs on autos and metals while keeping the baseline 10% tariff as it is. The announcement followed a phone call with UK prime minister Keir Starmer Under the plan, US tariffs on British cars will drop from 27.5% to 10% for a quota of 100,000 vehicles. Tariffs on steel and aluminium will be removed. In return, the UK will increase purchases of US agricultural goods, simplify customs for American products, and cut import taxes on around 2,500 items, including olive oil, wine, and sports equipment.The Republican president indicated that other countries negotiating trade deals with the US could face steeper import taxes.Referring to the UK’s 10% tariff rate, Trump said, “That’s a low number,” and argued that nations with which the US runs trade deficits—and which he claimed had treated the US unfairly—would be subject to higher tariffs.US stocks meanwhile surged Thursday as investor optimism grew following the announcement of the trade deal between the United States and the United Kingdom that could ease recession fears by lowering select tariffs and restrictions.Earlier, during simultaneous press conferences in London and Washington, Keir Starmer appeared via video link from the White House alongside Donald Trump, calling the US-UK trade agreement “a truly fantastic and historic day.”","US president Donald Trump confirmed a trade framework with the United Kingdom that reduces tariffs on autos and metals.

A secretly recorded video shows Prince Andrew ’s former adviser, John Bryan , alleging the Duke of York had sex with underage girls, linked to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein . The footage, released by American journalist James O’Keefe. Bryan also says that Prince Andrew lied to him about the nature of his relationship with Epstein.This video comes just days after the death of Virginia Giuffre , the woman who accused Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Prince Andrew of abuse. Giuffre was found dead on 25 April in what authorities have reported as a suicide. However, her father, Sky Roberts, has publicly rejected this, saying, “There’s no way that she did. Somebody got to her.”Virginia Giuffre was one of the most vocal accusers in the Epstein scandal. She claimed she was trafficked to Prince Andrew when she was 17 years old—an accusation the Duke has strongly denied. In 2022, Prince Andrew reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre. The deal included a statement expressing regret for his association with Epstein, though it did not include any apology or admission of liability.Days before her death, Giuffre had posted about being seriously injured in a car crash. Police later questioned how serious the accident was.Since 2019, Prince Andrew has withdrawn from public royal duties following his widely criticised BBC Newsnight interview about Epstein.","A secretly recorded video shows Prince Andrew ’s former adviser, John Bryan, alleging the Duke of York had sex with underage girls.

Poll Should the Bank of England adopt a more proactive approach to monetary policy? Yes, absolutely No, they should be cautious





LONDON: The Bank of England is widely expected to look past near-term inflationary pressures in the British economy and opt to cut interest rates on Thursday as a result of the potential shock to growth emanating from the tariff policies of the Trump administration.Most economists believe it's a near-certainty that the nine-member monetary policy committee will sanction a quarter-point reduction in the bank's main interest rate, to 4.25%. The decision is to be announced at 12:02 p.m., two minutes later than usual as a result of the two-minute silence for Victory in Europe Day. There's some speculation that some members may opt for an even bigger half-point cut.Economists are going to be particularly interested in the bank's accompanying economic forecasts as they will be the first since US President Donald Trump made his tariff announcement in early April.Though most tariffs were paused for 90 days following the ensuing market turmoil, including the 10% baseline tariff applied to UK goods entering the United States, the backdrop for the global economy remains highly uncertain.""With US trade policy presenting a new demand shock, there have been early signs that the MPC is willing to adopt a more proactive approach to loosening policy,"" said Edward Allenby, UK economist at Oxford Economics.The forecasts, particularly those regarding growth and inflation, will provide a steer as to whether a more proactive approach is likely. Since it started cutting interest rates in August 2024 from the 16-year high of 5.25%, the MPC has been consistent in lowering borrowing costs every three months.The imposition of US tariffs on British goods, and the potential for a wider global trade war, has the potential to weigh on growth as well as oil prices, which would consequently depress price pressures by lowering demand.Though UK inflation stands at 2.6% and could well hit double the bank's target rate of 2% in coming months as a result of a raft of price increases in April, such as domestic energy and water bills, economists think rate-setters will opt for a cut, given the anticipated slowdown.Unlike the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank, which last month cut interest rates too, the US Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged Wednesday as its policymakers wait to see how Trump's tariffs affect the US economy before making any moves.Inflation rates around the world are way down from levels seen a couple of years ago, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from the near zero rates during the coronavirus pandemic. Prices then began to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and later because of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed energy costs higher.As inflation rates have declined from multidecade highs, central banks, including the Fed, have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and during the pandemic.","Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates on Thursday.

TOI CORRESPONDENT FROM LONDON: Despite the rhetoric that tensions between India and Pakistan might spill over onto Britain’s streets, things were calm on Wednesday and members of the Indian and Pakistani diaspora were all still getting on with each other.“Our fight is not against any community, religion, or nationality — it is against terrorism and the nations that sponsor it,” said a spokesman for British Indians Voice. He said the diaspora supported India’s military strike. “India has shown restraint for decades. This was not a reckless strike — it was a measured and necessary response to repeated acts of terror emanating from Pakistani soil. We stand with our homeland. It is time for the world to unite against terror. Because silence is no longer an option.”British Indian Santosh Patil said: “Terrorism has no place in a civilised society and anywhere where terrorist sympathising groups are based should meet the same fate. British Indians feel it is the right thing that happened as India attacked a terrorist group. We are still getting on with British Pakistani friends and neighbours.This is not an attack on Pakistan but on terrorism.”Ganapati Bhat, Kannadigaruuk president, said: “The whole community have a sense of justice being done because it was the worst of kind of terrorist attack on 22nd April and India has been at the receiving end of terrorism since Independence. Retaliation was not there previously, except for a couple of instances, and this time they have done it very well and eliminated this terrorist infrastructure so we feel satisfied. There is a bit of worry that things could impact trust issues among communities but I think people view Pakistan and terrorists as separate things. These things have been happening for over a decade, so I don’t see it spilling over into UK’s streets.”Amjid Ali Akram Jarral Rajput, a British Kashmiri with roots in J&K, said: “It’s dreadful what has happened.” He has family on both sides of border. “This is just another way to escalate what is happening and bring the world’s attention to Kashmir. This is due to what Britain did and the mess it left Kashmir in.”British Pakistani Murtuza Ali Shah, bureau chief for Geo News in the UK, said: “British Pakistanis are worried about their families in the region.” He said he did not see tensions playing out on UK streets. “We have all lived here a long time and fought racism together.

Working for GRU:

Like a 'spy novel':





Six Bulgarians, members of a sophisticated spy network dubbed ""The Minions"", were before court Wednesday for sentencing, facing up to 14 years in prison for spying for Russia The four men and two women either pled guilty or had been convicted of charges of conspiracy to spy at Russia's behest with their sentences due to be handed down on Monday, after four days of hearings at London's Old Bailey court.Between 2020 to 2023, the six-person cell targeted journalists and a Kazakh former politician, and plotted to kidnap and honeytrap targets, tracking them across several European nations.It was "" industrial-scale espionage on behalf of Russia"", Metropolitan police counter-terrorism Chief Commander Dominic Murphy said in March.Ringleader Orlin Roussev, 47, along with his second-in-command Bizer Dzhambazov, 43, and Ivan Stoyanov, 32, pled guilty to spying.Barrister for the prosecution, Alison Morgan, on Wednesday laid out their roles in different operations, stressing they knew they were spying for Moscow.London-based Katrin Ivanova, 33, Vanya Gaberova, 30, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, were convicted in March after a trial lasting more than three months at the Old Bailey court.Two of the group were in court on Wednesday, with the rest appearing by video link from their detention centres.They had dubbed themselves ""The Minions"" after the cartoon yellow characters in the film ""Despicable Me"" who work for the dastardly Gru. The six also worked for the GRU, the acronym for the Russian military intelligence service.The group launched operations in the UK as well as Austria, Spain, Germany and Montenegro.But UK police were able to retrace six operations thanks to more than 100,000 messages found on Roussev's Telegram account, which led police to his seaside home in the eastern town of Great Yarmouth.Roussev received his instructions from Jan Marsalek, an Austrian fugitive who reportedly fled to Russia in 2020 after becoming wanted for fraud in Germany.Marsalek, the former chief operating officer of payments firm Wirecard, was acting as a proxy for Russian intelligence services.One operation targeted investigative journalist Christo Grozev, from the Bellingcat website, who uncovered Russian links to the 2018 Novichok chemical weapon attack in the English town of Salisbury and the downing of a Malaysia Airlines aeroplane four years earlier.The group had planned ""disruptive activity"" at the Kazakh embassy in 2022, discussing a plan to spray the building with fake pig's blood.Roussev received more than 200,000 euros ($227,000) to fund his activities.After the gang was busted in February 2023, police found huge amounts of spyware equipment in his home, including cameras and microphones hidden in ties, a stone, even a cuddly toy and a fizzy drinks bottle.In messages to Marsalek, Roussev claimed ""he will find the resources"" to ""keep the Russians happy"" such as by kidnapping someone, Morgan said.""The defendants were deployed to gather information about prominent individuals whose activities were of obvious interest to the Russian state,"" she added.Murphy said in March that police had found ""really sophisticated devices -- the sort of thing you would really expect to see in a spy novel"".Journalist and UK-based dissident Roman Dobrokhotov, and former Kazakh politician Bergey Ryskaliev, granted refugee status in Britain, were also among their targets.The group also kept the US military base Patch Barracks in Stuttgart, Germany, under surveillance, believing Ukrainian soldiers were being trained there in using the Patriot air defence system.Ties between Britain and Russia have been strained since Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.British security minister Dan Jarvis warned the convictions should ""send a clear warning to those who wish to do the UK harm"".","Six Bulgarians, members of a sophisticated spy network dubbed ""The Minions"", facing up to 14 years in prison for spying for Russia.

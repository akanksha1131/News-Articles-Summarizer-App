Reciprocal taxes

Global market concerns

President Donald Trump on Thursday urged the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, assuring that the tariff policies would ease the economy. He described April 2 as a “liberation day” for the country, marking the implementation of new trade measures.In a post on Truth Social, he wrote, “The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S.Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy. Do the right thing. April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!.”On Wednesday the Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged for the second consecutive meeting, while reaffirming plans to cut rates twice before the end of the year. However, officials acknowledged rising uncertainty as inflation remains persistent and economic growth slows.In its latest forecast, the Fed revised its growth expectations downward and projected a slight increase in unemployment to 4.4 per cent by the end of 2025. Inflation, currently at 2.5 per cent, is now expected to rise to 2.7 per cent this year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that new tariffs could further delay inflation relief by increasing costs on imported goods.It also announced a slowdown in the reduction of its US treasury holdings, limiting the monthly runoff to $5 billion instead of $25 billion. This move aims to keep long-term borrowing costs in check.Previously, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump defended his tariff policy, claiming it would reclaim wealth lost under previous administrations.“April 2 is a liberating day for our country,” he said. “We’re getting back to some of the wealth that very, very foolish presidents gave away because they had no clue what they were doing,” quoted by The Hill.The move marked a major escalation in his trade policies, which the White House alleges, would affect ‘trillions’ of dollars in goods, Finance News Network reported.Despite growing concerns about the impact on financial markets in the US and abroad, Trump dismissed the idea of pulling back on tariffs. When asked whether he had any plans to ease trade restrictions, to which he firmly replied, “No.”“It’s a liberation day for our country because we’re going to be getting back a lot of the wealth that we so foolishly gave up to other countries, including friend and foe,” he added.Trump’s tariff plan includes major reciprocal measures and sector-specific duties, particularly targeting steel and aluminium used in auto production.“If India, China, or any other country hits us with a 100 or 200 percent tariff on American-made goods, we will hit them with the same exact tariff,” he said.While his approach has rattled markets and triggered talk of retaliation from Canada, Trump signalled an even more aggressive stance, announcing that the steel and aluminium tariff would increase from 25 per cent to 50 per cent in response to Canada’s electricity surcharges.Trump’s tariff policies have rattled investor sentiments. S&P 500 has fallen more than 8 percent in the past month, while the Nasdaq has dropped nearly 13 percent.Though detailed tariff plans are expected to be revealed over the upcoming weeks, the move is expected to trigger tensions with major trading partners and add to global economic uncertainty.Since taking office, Trump has imposed tariffs on approximately $800 billion (£630 billion) worth of imports from China, Mexico, and Canada. Despite these concerns, his administration is pressing ahead with an even broader tariff strategy, led by vice president JD Vance, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, and treasury secretary Scott Bessent.Trump, however, remains adamant that his policies will ultimately benefit the US economy and help in fostering domestic industries.","President Donald Trump urged the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.

Legal battle over Riibe’s detention

Sudiksha Konanki missing case

An Iowa man who was previously named a person of interest in the disappearance of missing University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki has returned to the United States after nearly two weeks of detention in the Dominican Republic .Joshua Riibe , 22, was able to leave after securing a new passport from the US Consulate on the Caribbean island. He was accompanied by his father on the journey home, as per his lawyers, quoted by the New York Post.“The prosecutor’s office of La Altagracia informed [Riibe] of their readiness to return his passport,” said the Dominican law firm Guzman Ariza in an email to The Post. “While Joshua appreciated this decision, he chose, for privacy reasons, to apply for a new passport at the US Consulate, which was promptly issued. We are pleased to announce that Joshua and his father are currently traveling back to their home in the United States.”Riibe, a student at St Cloud State College, had been detained in the Dominican Republic since March 6, when Sudiksha Konanki vanished after the two went for an early morning swim in rough waters at the RIU Hotel & Resort in Punta Cana.Riibe told authorities that he had managed to pull Konanki to safety but lost consciousness on the beach, after which she was never seen again.Though officials identified Riibe as a person of interest, he was never formally named as a suspect in the case. However, his passport and phone were confiscated, preventing him from leaving the island.During a court hearing on Tuesday, tensions escalated as prosecutors pushed back against claims that Riibe was being unlawfully detained.Judge Edwin Delgado ruled in Riibe’s favour, granting his request to end police surveillance and allowing him to leave the resort, but he was still unable to leave the country.Finally on Wednesday, Riibe boarded a flight home to Rock Rapids, Iowa, bringing an end to his legal ordeal.Sudiksha Konanki, a 20 year old Indian-origin pre-med student from Chantilly, Virginia, went missing while on spring break with five friends at the Riu Republic Resort in Punta Cana on March 6.Konanki's father initially suspected foul play and egged on the administration to widen their search when the mysterious disappearance of the Pitt University student was seen as a case of drowning.Konanki and a group of friends were at the beach before most of them decided to return to their hotel, leaving her behind with a male companion, according to Dominican media reports.After a massive search on land, water, and air turned yield no results even after 12 days, Sudiksha’s parents, Subbarayudu and Sridevi, finally gave up hope of their daughter returning alive. They wrote a letter to the Dominican Republic authorities, asking them to declare their daughter 'dead'.","Joshua Riibe, 22, has returned to the United States after nearly two weeks of detention in the Dominican Republic.

Trump to Iran: Strike a nuclear deal ‘very soon’ or face consequences,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-to-iran-strike-a-nuclear-deal-very-soon-or-face-consequences/articleshow/119232628.cms,"Two-month deadline

Iran’s response

Rising tensions

US President Donald Trump reportedly sent a letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, urging him to agree to a new nuclear deal “very soon,” a senior administration official revealed.However, if Tehran fails to comply, Trump is prepared to consider alternative measures to prevent the country from developing nuclear weapons.“President Trump made it clear to Ayatollah Khamenei that he wanted to resolve the dispute over Iran’s nuclear program diplomatically—and very soon. If this was not possible, there would be other ways to resolve it,” US National Security Council official Brian Hughes told The New York Post.Trump has given the 85-year-old supreme leader a two-month deadline to reach an agreement on Iran’s nuclear program, Axios reported. The president had hinted at the move earlier in an interview with Fox News, revealing that he had reached out to Khamenei to propose direct negotiations.“We can’t let them have a nuclear weapon. Something is going to happen very soon. I would rather have a peace deal than the other option, but the other option will solve the problem,” Trump had said.The letter was passed through diplomatic channels, first handed to UAE President Mohammed Bin Zayed by US special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, before being transferred to Iran, Axios revealed. However, it remains unclear when exactly the two-month deadline began.Khamenei dismissed Trump’s letter as “a deception” aimed at portraying Iran as unwilling to negotiate. However, Iran’s mission to the United Nations later suggested it was open to discussions—under specific conditions.“If the objective of negotiations is to address concerns regarding any potential militarization of Iran’s nuclear program, such discussions may be considered,” the statement read.“However, if the goal is to dismantle Iran’s peaceful nuclear program to claim that what Obama failed to achieve has now been accomplished, such negotiations will never take place.”The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), brokered under former President Barack Obama, imposed temporary restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. A vocal critic of the deal, Trump withdrew the US from the agreement in 2018, reimposing heavy sanctions under a ""maximum pressure"" campaign. In response, Tehran resumed uranium enrichment beyond JCPOA limits, including restarting an advanced centrifuge facility in Natanz in 2020.The nuclear negotiations come amid rising tensions, with US officials alleging in court documents that Iran plotted to assassinate Trump during the 2024 election season. Tehran has also sought revenge for the 2020 killing of General Qasem Soleimani, who was targeted in a US airstrike ordered by Trump.Trump has warned that any attack against him would trigger explicit instructions he left his team to “obliterate” the regime if Iran kills him.Meanwhile, Trump issued fresh warnings to Iran over its alleged support for Houthi militants, who have been attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea.“Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN. IRAN will be held responsible and suffer the consequences—and those consequences will be dire,” Trump declared on Truth Social on Monday.","US President Donald Trump reportedly sent a letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, urging him to agree to a new nuclear deal.

Ceasefire talks amid continued fighting

US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a ""constructive"" call on Wednesday, discussing potential steps toward a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. Among the key points raised was the possibility of the US taking control of Ukrainian power plants to safeguard critical infrastructure, a move Trump suggested could ensure their security.According to a statement from secretary of state Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz, Trump told Zelenskyy that the US could be ""very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise."" The statement described the conversation as ""fantastic."" Trump also floated the idea that ""American ownership of those plants could be the best protection for that infrastructure.""The discussion marked a notable shift in tone following last month's contentious Oval Office meeting, which resulted in Trump temporarily halting intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine. A senior Ukrainian official, speaking anonymously, described Wednesday's call as ""very good"" and even lighthearted at times, with both leaders joking around. However, the conversation also focused on how a potential ceasefire would be monitored and the technical issues that negotiators must still resolve.During the call, Zelenskyy requested additional Patriot missile defence systems, to which Trump responded that he would work with allies—particularly in Europe—to explore availability, according to Rubio and Waltz.Trump has made ending the war a key priority of his administration, citing concerns over the cost of US support, which has exceeded $180 billion since the war began. His call with Zelenskyy followed a conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin a day earlier, during which Putin agreed not to target Ukraine's energy infrastructure but refused to commit to a full 30-day ceasefire.The Kremlin has maintained that any deal must include an end to foreign military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. However, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt reaffirmed Wednesday that the US would continue providing intelligence support to Ukraine for defensive purposes.Zelenskyy, meanwhile, expressed scepticism about Putin's commitment to limiting strikes on energy facilities. Speaking at a news conference in Helsinki alongside Finnish President Alexander Stubb, he pointed to a barrage of overnight drone attacks as evidence that Russia was not upholding its pledges.""Even last night, after Putin's conversation with President Trump—when Putin said he was allegedly giving orders to stop strikes on Ukrainian energy—there were 150 drones launched overnight, including on energy facilities,"" Zelenskyy said.As negotiations continue, the question of US involvement in Ukraine's energy infrastructure and the broader feasibility of a ceasefire remain unresolved.","US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a ""constructive"" call on Wednesday.

Donald Trump administration freezes $175 million in federal funds for University of Pennsylvania over transgender policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-administration-freezes-175-million-in-federal-funds-for-university-of-pennsylvania-over-transgender-policy/articleshow/119226616.cms,"US President Donald Trump's administration has suspended roughly $175 million in federal funding for the University of Pennsylvania, citing concerns over transgender participation in women's sports, the White House announced Wednesday.The decision follows President Donald Trump's February 5 executive order barring transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports. The day after signing the order, the department of education launched an investigation into Penn's swimming program, focusing on transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, who last competed for the school in 2022.However, the White House clarified that the suspension of federal funds came from a separate review of discretionary federal money allocated to universities. The frozen funds originated from the department of defense and the department of health and human services.A spokesperson for Penn said the university had not been notified about the funding suspension.""It is important to note, however, that Penn has always followed NCAA and Ivy League policies regarding student participation on athletic teams,"" said Ron Ozio, Penn's spokesperson. ""We have been in the past, and remain today, in full compliance with the regulations that apply to not only Penn, but all of our NCAA and Ivy League peer institutions.""The education department's office for civil rights is investigating whether Penn violated Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex-based discrimination in education, by allowing Thomas to compete. Thomas, the first openly transgender athlete to win a Division I title, swam for Penn's women's team before graduating in 2022.At the time, the NCAA permitted transgender athletes to compete under guidelines set by individual sports' national governing bodies, international federations, or the International Olympic Committee. Thomas met the requirements, which allowed transgender women to compete after one year of hormone replacement therapy.Trump's executive order, however, mandates that federal agencies can withhold funding from institutions that do not follow the administration's interpretation of Title IX—defining ""sex"" strictly as the gender assigned at birth.In response to the order, the NCAA swiftly altered its policy, eliminating the sport-by-sport approach and implementing a blanket rule that restricts women's sports to athletes assigned female at birth.The University of Pennsylvania is not the only institution under scrutiny. The department of education has also launched investigations into San Jose State University's volleyball program and the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association as part of a broader effort to enforce the administration's stance on transgender participation in athletics.","The White House suspended roughly $175 million in federal funding for the University of Pennsylvania.

The White House on Wednesday accused federal judges of overstepping their authority after a series of legal setbacks for US President Donald Trump 's administration, including a ruling that blocked the deportation of Venezuelan migrants.Press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed there was a ""concerted effort by the far left"" to install judges acting as ""partisan activists"" against the Republican-led government.""Not only are they usurping the will of the president and the chief executive of our country, but they are undermining the will of the American public,"" Leavitt said during a press briefing.One of the rulings that drew particular criticism was issued by district judge James Boasberg , who over the weekend ordered the suspension of deportation flights that the administration had carried out under a rarely used wartime law. The Trump administration had invoked the centuries-old legislation to justify the mass deportation of undocumented Venezuelan migrants, particularly gang members.Leavitt blasted Boasberg as an ""activist judge"" and a ""Democrat activist"" attempting to interfere with the president’s authority.Trump himself escalated the attacks, calling for Boasberg's impeachment on Tuesday. He labelled the judge a ""Radical Left Lunatic,"" accusing him of being a ""troublemaker and agitator"" who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.The remarks drew a rare rebuke from supreme court chief justice John Roberts, who reminded Trump that ""for more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.""Despite the pushback, Trump continued his criticism on his Truth Social platform, warning that judicial interference in executive decisions posed a serious threat to the country.""If a president doesn't have the right to throw murderers and other criminals out of our country because a Radical Left Lunatic Judge wants to assume the role of President, then our country is in very big trouble and destined to fail!"" he wrote on Wednesday.The legal challenges against Trump 's administration have been mounting. A judge on Tuesday halted the shutdown of the main US aid agency, which had been ordered by Elon Musk's newly created department of government efficiency (DOGE). Another ruling blocked the administration’s ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, citing constitutional protections of equality.Musk, a key Trump ally, also condemned the judiciary, calling the recent decisions a ""judicial coup"" in a series of posts on his social media platform, X.","The White House accused federal judges of overstepping their authority after a series of legal setbacks for US President Donald Trump's administration.

After making an official request to declare her dead, Konanki's parents told the New York Post that they were convinced that there was no foul play and that Konanki drowned.Subbarayudu Konanki said the authorities showed them how high the ocean waves were when she went missing. He was also explained that Joshua Riibe, the person who was last seen with Konanki was not a suspect but a person of interest. “It is with deep sadness and a heavy heart that we are coming to terms with the fact our daughter has drowned,” he said. “This is incredibly difficult for us to process.”Konanki's parents want Riibe to be released from police interrogation. Konanki's hometown Loudon County Sheriff's office also said Tuesday that they don't think Joshua was involved in the mysterious disappearance. Riibe’s lawyer filed a legal “habeas corpus” request Monday demanding that he be allowed to return to the US because he has not been charged with wrongdoing.Konanki's parents said the media attention has been too much for them, making their loss more difficult. “We still have two young children to care for and they’re at a very tender age,” Subbarayudi Konanki said. “In light of this, we respectfully request some space, time and privacy to focus on healing and helping our children recover as we try to move forward with our lives.”Joshua Riibe told police he pulled Konanki out of the high waves but did not know what happened.

Did Joe Biden block Elon Musk from bringing back Sunita Williams? Here is the truth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-joe-biden-block-elon-musk-from-bringing-back-sunita-williams-here-is-the-truth/articleshow/119216966.cms,"The Political Controversy: Musk’s Claim vs. NASA’s Explanation



How SpaceX Helped Bring Them Home



The Health Implications of Their Extended Stay



Did Biden Block Elon?



On June 5, 2024, NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore launched aboard Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft for what was intended to be an eight-day mission to the International Space Station (ISS). However, due to technical malfunctions—including helium leaks and thruster failures—the spacecraft was deemed unsafe for their return. As a result, NASA decided to keep Williams and Wilmore aboard the ISS while working on an alternative plan to bring them back.Following their return to Earth on March 18, 2025, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made a bold claim: SpaceX had allegedly offered to bring the astronauts back much earlier, but the Biden administration rejected the proposal “for political reasons.” Musk argued that his company could have returned Williams and Wilmore to Earth months earlier, avoiding their extended stay in space.This statement quickly became a political flashpoint. President Donald Trump echoed Musk’s claim, accusing the Biden administration of neglecting the astronauts. However, NASA officials and the astronauts themselves disputed this narrative. Both Williams and Wilmore stated that they were never ""abandoned"" and emphasized that NASA’s approach was methodical and focused on ensuring their safe return. NASA maintained that all mission decisions were based on safety and technical considerations—not politics.Despite the controversy, when it became clear that Boeing’s Starliner would not be able to bring Williams and Wilmore back, NASA turned to SpaceX. The Crew-9 mission, which was initially intended to transport four new astronauts to the ISS, was adjusted to accommodate Williams and Wilmore. This required reducing the number of original Crew-9 astronauts to make space for them.On March 18, 2025, after spending nine months in orbit, Williams and Wilmore boarded SpaceX’s Crew Dragon Freedom for their long-awaited return. The spacecraft undocked from the ISS and completed a smooth 17-hour journey before splashing down off the coast of Florida, marking the successful end of their unexpectedly extended mission.Spending nine months in microgravity comes with physical consequences. Long-duration spaceflight can cause muscle atrophy, bone density loss, and fluid shifts that affect vision. Williams and Wilmore were immediately placed into a rehabilitation program upon returning to Earth to help their bodies readjust to gravity. NASA will continue monitoring their health as part of ongoing research into the effects of prolonged space travel.So, did Joe Biden (or his admin) personally block Elon Musk and SpaceX from bringing Sunita Williams home? The evidence suggests otherwise. While Musk claimed that political reasons delayed SpaceX’s involvement, NASA and the astronauts themselves have firmly stated that safety, not politics, was the priority. The decision to extend their stay was based on ensuring a secure return, and once it was clear that Boeing’s Starliner couldn’t be used, NASA worked with SpaceX to bring them home.The situation highlights a larger reality: spaceflight is complex, and unforeseen technical issues can disrupt even the best-laid plans. While political debates continue, the successful return of Williams and Wilmore demonstrates the importance of multiple commercial spaceflight providers. SpaceX played a crucial role in their return, reinforcing its reliability as a NASA partner. Moving forward, the challenges faced by Boeing’s Starliner will likely shape future decisions on how NASA collaborates with private space companies to ensure astronaut safety.","NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore spent nine months aboard the International Space Station.

'US deeply concerned about persecution of minorities in Bangladesh': Tulsi



France embassy in Dhaka called a post ""ridiculous, baseless and intellectually weak statement"" which was claiming that they support Mohammad Yunus-led Bangladesh interim government's criticism against US intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard on persecution of minorities in the country.Reacting to a post, France embassy said, ""How ridiculous, baseless and intellectually weak statement @kawsarc @mainul_haque @carmel_trish.""A former Navy official Manoj Rawat, sharing the screenshot of French embassy sharing the Yunus' statement on Gabbad's post in his post on X, claimed that they are supporting the Yunus Government 's criticism of Gabbard's statement on the genocide of Hindus in Bangladesh.He further said that it seems that the the Indo-French Strategic partnership is just a business arrangement for France to secure lucrative Defence contracts from India.""Time to call out the French mischief in the sub-continent,"" he said in a post on X.Bangladesh released a statement challenging Gabbard's observations, calling them ""misleading and damaging"" to the nation's standing.""This statement is both misleading and damaging to the image and reputation of Bangladesh, a nation whose traditional practice of Islam has been famously inclusive and peaceful, and that has made remarkable strides in its fight against extremism and terrorism,"" Bangladesh's interim government said in a statement.""Gabbard's comments are not based on any evidence or specific allegations. They paint an entire nation with a broad and unjustified brush. Bangladesh, like many countries around the world, has faced challenges with extremism, but it has continuously worked in partnership with the international community, including the US, to address these issues through law enforcement, social reforms, and other counterterrorism efforts. Bangladesh strongly condemns any efforts to link the country to any form of 'Islamist caliphate,"" the statement added.Bangladesh also urged Gabbard to base her statements on ""actual knowledge"" when discussing sensitive issues, warning that such remarks could reinforce harmful stereotypes.""Political leaders and public figures should base their statements, especially about the most sensitive issues, on actual knowledge and take care not to reinforce harmful stereotypes, to fan fears, and potentially even stoke sectarian tensions,"" the statement said.In media interviews later, Gabbard said the US was deeply concerned about the persecution of minorities in Bangladesh and the Trump administration was committed to defeat ""Islamist terrorism"" globally. She noted that PM Modi also took this threat seriously and added that the two leaders would work together to identify and defeat the threat.""The long-time unfortunate persecution, killing and abuse of religious minorities like Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and others has been a major area of concern for the US govt and President Trump and his administration,"" Gabbard told NDTV World.She spoke about the ideology of an ""Islamic Caliphate"" and how extremist elements and terror groups globally aimed for such an outcome. ""The threat of Islamist terrorists and the global effort of different terror groups are routed in the same ideology and objective - which is to rule or govern with an Islamist Caliphate,"" she said, adding, ""This obviously affects people of any other religion, other than the one that they find acceptable, and they choose to carry this out with terror and very violent ways and means.""Her remarks mark a strong indictment of Mohammad Yunus-led interim dispensation in Dhaka which had enjoyed support from the Biden administration. In her meeting with Singh, Gabbard reaffirmed the growing strength of the India-US bilateral defence partnership, drawing from the joint statement issued after the recent Modi-Trump meeting in DC, while laying emphasis on intelligence-sharing.","France embassy in Dhaka called a post ""ridiculous, baseless and intellectually weak statement"" which was claiming that they support Mohammad Yunus-led Bangladesh interim government's criticism against US intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard on persecution of minorities in the country.

"On Trump orders, thousands of JFK assassination documents newly public",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/on-trump-orders-thousands-of-jfk-assassination-documents-newly-public/articleshow/119235219.cms,"WASHINGTON: Thousands of pages of digital documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy are now available for historians, conspiracy theorists and the merely curious, following orders from US President Trump.An initial tranche of electronic copies of papers flooded into the National Archives website on Tuesday evening after justice department lawyers spent hours scouring them. As of 10.30pm, the National Archives had published 2,182 PDFs totaling 63,400 pages. Trump had said a day earlier that the release would include around 80,000 pages. The archives did not immediately respond on Wednesday to a request for comment on whether more documents would soon be released. The archives' Kennedy assassination collection has more than six million pages of records, the vast majority of which had been made public before Trump's order.The digital documents released on Tuesday offer a window into the climate of fear surrounding US relations with the Soviet Union shortly after the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Experts doubt the new release will change what is known about the killing of JFK, as Kennedy is known, in Dallas on Nov 22, 1963. The release is nonetheless likely to intrigue people.Fredrik Logevall, a Harvard history professor whose books include ""JFK: Coming of Age in the American Century 1917-56,"" said in an email the new papers may help fill in the picture, but added, ""...I don't expect dramatic new revelations that alters in some fundamental way our grasp of the event.""One document with the heading ""secret"" was a typed account with handwritten notes of a 1964 interview by a Warren Commission researcher who questioned Lee Wigren, a CIA employee, about inconsistencies in material provided to the commission by the state department and the CIA about marriages between Soviet women and American men. Oswald was married to a Soviet woman at the time of the shooting.Department of defence documents from 1963 covered the Cold War of the early 1960s and the US involvement in Latin America, trying to thwart Cuban leader Fidel Castro's support of communists in other countries. The documents suggest that Castro would not go so far as to provoke a war with the US or escalate to the point ""that would seriously and immediately endanger the Castro regime."" One document released from Jan 1962 reveals details of a top secret project called "" Operation Mongoose ,"" or simply ""the Cuban Project,"" which was a CIA-led campaign of covert operations and sabotage against Cuba, authorised by Kennedy in 1961, aimed at removing the Castro regime.Kennedy's murder has been attributed to a sole gunman, Oswald. But polls show many Americans still believe his death was a result of a conspiracy.Trump's secretary of health and human services, Robert F Kennedy Jr, a nephew of JFK, has said he believes the CIA was involved in his uncle's death, an allegation the agency has described as baseless. Kennedy Jr declined comment when contacted on Tuesday.","Thousands of pages of digital documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy are now available for historians, conspiracy theorists and the merely curious. An initial tranche of electronic copies of papers flooded into the National Archives website on Tuesday evening after justice department lawyers spent hours scouring them. Experts doubt the new release will change what is known about the killing of JFK.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"

It was based on the finding Musk has acted as a US officer without having been properly appointed to that role by President Trump. Chuang said a group of unnamed aid workers who had sued to stop the demolition of USAID and its programmes was likely to succeed in the lawsuit. He agreed with their contention Musk's rapid assertion of power over executive agencies was likely in violation of constitution's appointments clause.The judge ordered the agency operations be partially restored, though the reprieve is likely to be temporary.

He also ordered the team to submit a plan for staff to reoccupy an office from which they were evicted last month, and barred Musk's team from engaging in any further work ""related to the shutdown of USAID"".

They set off to spend eight days at the space station. The trip lasted nine months instead. On Tuesday, two Nasa astronauts who had been in orbit since June, Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, splashed down in calm, azure waters off the coast of the Florida Panhandle, concluding a saga that had captivated the world for several months.It was a SpaceX capsule, the Crew Dragon, that brought them back from space Tuesday. The spacecraft detached from the space station just after 1 am Eastern time and then travelled back to Earth, slowing from more than 17,000 mph before deploying four large parachutes that gently plopped the spacecraft into the water just before 6 pm. Once the capsule had been hoisted onto a ship, the door was opened and the beaming astronauts were extracted from the spacecraft.After months of weightlessness, their bodies still adjusting to the pull of gravity, they were lifted onto gurneys.They all looked like they were feeling about normal for the landing and recovery phase, where their body is trying to re-adapt,"" Steve Stich, the manager of Nasa's commercial crew program, said.Returning with the two astronauts were Nick Hague, the commander of this mission known as Crew-9, and Alexander Gorbunov, a Russian astronaut. The four astronauts were scheduled to fly back to Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where they were to remain briefly until doctors let them go home. ""They'll join their families in the next day or so,"" Stich said. The mission both underlined the dominance of SpaceX in the growing field of private spaceflight and the comparative woes of Boeing. The astronauts' return was also tinged with politics.US President Donald Trump suggested in Jan that the Biden administration had stranded the astronauts, and Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, said this month that the Biden administration had rejected his offer to bring them home sooner. But Bill Nelson, who served as the administrator of Nasa during the Biden administration, said Nasa never heard about Musk's offer. ""On the basis that there was no contact with Nasa, there was no political consideration from Nasa's point of view,"" Nelson said. About a half-hour after the astronauts returned, the White House posted on social media, ""PROMISE MADE, PROMISE KEPT: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months.""However, it has been Nasa's plan since Aug for the Crew-9 mission to return with Williams and Wilmore around this time frame. An hour after the White House post, Musk offered celebratory congratulations on X to teams at SpaceX and NASA ""for another safe astronaut return!"" He also thanked Trump ""for prioritising this mission!"" But the astronauts also disputed the notion that they were stuck in space.At the station, Williams and Wilmore had to adjust to unexpectedly long stay. From the start, they were short of clothes, because their suitcases had been left off the Starliner to make room for a replacement pump to fix the toilet. They relied on spare clothing in the space station. Nasa sent up their clothes and other personal items a couple of months later on a Northrop Grumman cargo ship.According to a summary published by Nasa, astronauts at the space station carried out a variety of tasks on the station, including maintenance work and nearly 1,000 hours of scientific research. That included a spacewalk by Williams and Wilmore to swab the outside of the space station to see if Earth microbes could survive and maybe even thrive in space. By the end of their journey, Williams and Wilmore had traveled nearly 121,347,500 miles, having orbited the Earth 4,576 times. Wilmore has spent a total of 31 hours conducting spacewalks during his career and Williams 62 hours, a record for a female astronaut.","Two Nasa astronauts who had been in orbit since June splashed down in calm, azure waters off the coast of the Florida Panhandle.

A huge repatriation drive

Growing worries about deportations

Calls for international help

Zahra Mousavi, a women's rights activist, fled from Afghanistan to neighboring Pakistan in March 2022 after months of fighting and protesting the oppressive Taliban regime She now lives in hiding and constant fear of being apprehended by the Pakistani police and deported to her home country.Mousavi actively participated in street protests against the Taliban regime after the Islamic fundamentalist group seized power in the war-ravaged country in August 2021.She advocated for women's rights by taking part in public gatherings and demonstrations, and tried to make the voices of Afghan women heard in the rest of the world.But with the Taliban slapping broad restrictions on women and girls and gradually squeezing them out of public life, Mousavi was forced to leave.In Pakistan, however, she has struggled to secure the necessary documents to stay in the country.""I could not obtain a valid Pakistani visa for myself and my family due to high costs and Pakistan's strict visa policies,"" the 29-year-old told DW.""This led to my arrest by Pakistani police on February 22. They entered my home in plain clothes, conducted an intense search, and arrested both me and my young daughter, taking us to a deportation detention camp,"" she said.""We were kept there in extremely harsh conditions for two days and one night, and we were only released after providing guarantees and due to the pressure of human rights activists.""DW spoke to several other Afghan female activists, who are also living in hiding as Islamabad looks to accelerate deportations to Afghanistan.Jamila Ahmadi, 27, said many of her fellow Afghan women had already been sent back to Afghanistan and warned that their lives, as well as hers, were in danger.""My activism, especially my efforts toward women's capacity-building before the Taliban takeover, my reporting on Taliban crimes, and my involvement with the National Directorate of Security (NDS), has placed me in significant danger,"" Ahmadi said.""If I am compelled to return to Taliban rule, it would clearly be a certain death.""Many women's rights activists only sought asylum in Pakistan when the situation became untenable in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.""In February 2021, I was attacked, resulting in a broken leg, but my determination remained unshaken,"" said Ahmadi.""Again, in September 2021, we were brutally beaten by the Taliban.""Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades.But over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with Afghanistan has deteriorated.Islamabad is angry with the Taliban authorities over the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions escalate, concerns about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan have increased.Islamabad is currently carrying out a huge drive to repatriate the roughly 4 million Afghans who have crossed the border in the past four decades.Pakistan already repatriated more than 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year, according to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).Legal experts and refugee rights activists have criticized the Pakistani government's deportation plans, particularly when it comes to deporting Afghan women's rights activists .""Sending activists back to Afghanistan, where they are very likely to be subjected to torture at the hands of the Taliban regime, would put them in greater risk,"" Osama Malik, a refugee lawyer in Islamabad, told DW.Ahmadi said her health had been affected by the deportation drive.""Unfortunately, for more than a month, the Pakistani police have made life difficult for refugees, including issues with visas and visa extensions. My visa expired on February 25, 2025. My personal, psychological and emotional problems are due to not having a visa and being unable to extend it,"" she said.While rights groups have accused the Pakistani authorities of harassing Afghan refugees, Islamabad has denied the allegations and stressed that the removals were part of a 2023 campaign called the ""Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan.""There ""is no specific category for activists among those being deported,"" a Pakistani official, who asked not to be named, told DW. ""The responsibility of hosting Afghan refugees should not fall solely on Pakistan, as other countries can also accommodate them,"" the official added.Qaiser Khan Afridi, spokesperson for the UNHCR in Pakistan, said the agency was worried about the deportations.""UNHCR is especially concerned for Afghans who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, single women, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians.""""In view of these mounting challenges, UNHCR urged Pakistan to continue to provide safety to Afghans at risk, irrespective of their documentation status,"" said Afridi.Maria Noori, a 34-year-old activist from Kabul facing deportation, called on the international community to intervene and save the lives of Afghan female activists living in fear in Pakistan.""Being sent back to Afghanistan would mean facing torture, imprisonment, or even death. The international community must understand that deporting human rights activists, particularly women, is a direct threat to our lives, and immediate action is needed to protect us,"" she told DW.The lawyer Malik criticized Western governments for their inaction.""It is unfortunate that none of the Western countries have stepped up to immediately allow these female activists to travel to their countries,"" he said.Noori explained that the lack of a legal status and residency documents poses a big challenge.

Laptops, monitors, keyboards, and other electronic equipment intended for investigative purposes were instead carried away by opportunistic looters.Videos circulating on social media captured scenes of individuals, young and old, forcing their way into the building and openly making off with electronic devices. A large crowd gathered outside, and despite the presence of law enforcement, the looting continued unabated. Eyewitnesses reported that FIA officials struggled to control the situation, allowing the ransacking to proceed unchecked.

A key operative of LeT, he was involved in planning and executing multiple attacks in Jammu and Kashmir.

He was also known as Faisal Nadeem .

Qatal had strong ties with Hafiz Saeed , the mastermind behind the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.

His terror activities date back to 2002-03 when he infiltrated India and operated in the Poonch-Rajouri region.

He founded terror outfits like People’s Anti-Fascist Force (PAFF) and The Resistant Force (TRF) to hide LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammed’s (JeM) activities.

Played a key role in the June 9 Reasi attack, where terrorists opened fire on a bus carrying pilgrims from Shiv Khori temple, killing nine and injuring 41.

PAFF, one of his proxy groups, was designated a terrorist organization by ministry of home affairs on January 7, 2023.

Abu Qatal , a top Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative and one of the most wanted terrorists, was gunned down by unidentified assailants in Pakistan's Jhelum Sindh on Saturday night.He was a high-priority target for Indian security agencies, including the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Indian Army, for his involvement in the 2023 Rajouri attack and the 2024 Reasi bus attack , along with other deadly assaults in Jammu and Kashmir.","Abu Qatal, a top Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative, was gunned down by unidentified assailants in Pakistan's Jhelum Sindh on Saturday night.

Authorities have yet to confirm any casualties in that attack.Pakistan's military is engaged in an ongoing operation in Kurram, an area that has witnessed years of violence between Sunni and Shia Muslim communities, as reported by Al Jazeera. Hundreds of people have been killed in fighting between armed groups, exacerbating tensions in the region.Kurram has remained isolated since last November, after authorities blocked key roads following sectarian violence. The closure has led to severe shortages of medicine and food, deepening a humanitarian crisis.In another incident, a bomb exploded outside a mosque in the northwestern city of Peshawar, killing a religious leader, local police said on Saturday.

Back-to-back attacks on mosques

Balochistan train attack

A powerful blast at a seminary-cum-mosque in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province’s Peshawar district killed a senior cleric and injured three others on Saturday, marking another attack on religious institutions in the region within 24 hours.Mufti Munir Shakir , the founder of the outlawed militant group Lashkar-i-Islam , succumbed to his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), hospital authorities confirmed. The explosion took place in Urmur Bala village, prompting a swift response from police, the Counter-Terrorism department, and bomb disposal teams, who are now investigating the scene.Mohammad Asim, an LRH spokesman, confirmed the cleric's passing, stating, “Mufti Shakir was brought to LRH in a critical condition and succumbed to his injuries.”Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister’s Advisor on Health, Ihtesham Ali, expressed his condolences, calling Shakir’s death a ""martyrdom"" and mourning the loss.Mufti Munir Shakir was a controversial figure in Khyber tribal region, known for founding Lashkar-i-Islam in 2004. However, his extremist views and conflicts with another militant leader, Haji Namdar, led to his expulsion from Bara Qambarkhel within six months.After continued internal strife, a tribal jirga forced both Shakir and Pir Saifur Rehman out of Bara in early 2005. The group later came under the leadership of Mangal Bagh, a former bus driver turned militant, who was elevated to amir in May 2005.Pakistani security forces launched their first military operation against Lashkar-i-Islam in mid-2005, demolishing the house of Haji Rabat and destroying an FM radio station the group had set up inside a mosque.The blast comes less than a day after another explosion at Maulana Abdul Aziz Mosque in South Waziristan on Friday. The attack, carried out using an improvised explosive device (IED), left Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) district chief Maulana Abdullah Nadeem and several others injured.The province has witnessed repeated attacks on mosques, particularly during Friday prayers when large gatherings make them vulnerable.Last month, a suicide blast at Darul Uloom Haqqania seminary killed six people, including JUI-S leader Maulana Hamidul Haq Haqqani, and injured 15 others.The Pakistan Army on Friday said that 18 of the 26 hostages killed in the Balochistan Liberation Army's recent ambush on a train were army and paramilitary soldiers.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General, Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, stated during a press conference with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti that militants executed all 26 hostages before the military operation began.“The 26 hostages include 18 army and paramilitary soldiers, three other government officials and five civilians,” he confirmed.","Mufti Munir Shakir, the founder of the outlawed militant group Lashkar-i-Islam, succumbed to his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), hospital authorities confirmed.

Did it take off without a wheel?

Smooth landing, rough questions

Passengers aboard Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight PK-306 got an unexpected surprise when their aircraft landed in Lahore—with one of its rear wheels missing. Despite what sounds like a scene from an action movie, the landing was smooth, and no injuries were reported.The big mystery now: Did the wheel vanish midair or was it never there to begin with?PIA officials have launched an investigation to determine whether the aircraft took off from Karachi already missing a wheel or if it fell off during takeoff. Some wheel fragments were reportedly found at Karachi airport, raising eyebrows about the plane’s condition before departure.""It appears that one of the rear wheels was in shabby condition when the aircraft took off,"" an official admitted, reported PTI.PIA’s damage control mode kicked in quickly. A spokesperson assured that the landing was “smooth and uneventful,” and passengers disembarked as usual—only for the captain’s routine inspection to reveal the missing wheel .""Passengers disembarked as per routine. During a walk-around inspection by the aircraft captain, it was revealed that one out of the six-wheel assemblies on the main landing gear (rear) is missing,"" a PIA spokesperson said, quoted PTI.""As per the standard flight practices, the matter was taken up by PIA flight safety and the Lahore airport teams who are investigating the matter and will submit their report later,"" the spokesperson said.While officials claim the aircraft is designed to handle such contingencies, the biggest question remains—was the wheel stolen? Although unlikely, investigators are leaving no stone unturned.One thing’s for sure—this flight gave ""landing on your last leg"" a whole new meaning!","Passengers aboard Pakistan International Airlines flight PK-306 got an unexpected surprise when their aircraft landed in Lahore.

has hosted the Dalai Lama and the since 1959. China views any Indian involvement in the succession process as a provocation. Recently, India has increased security around the Dalai Lama in response to Beijing’s growing interest in his succession. The United States has consistently supported Tibet’s religious freedom.

Voice for the Voiceless

""Tibetans have spent nearly 75 years fighting for freedom. Their struggle should continue beyond my lifetime.""

The Dalai Lama’s succession has long been a point of contention between Tibetans and China, but his latest statement has escalated the dispute. In his newly published book,, the 89-year-old Tibetan spiritual leader has explicitly stated for the first time that his successor will be born in the ""free world""—outside of China. This defies Beijing’s longstanding claim that it has the sole right to choose the next Dalai Lama.For China, controlling the Dalai Lama’s succession is about more than religion—it’s about political authority and maintaining control over Tibet. The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, has long been regarded as a “separatist” by Beijing. With his 90th birthday approaching in July, the question of who will succeed him has become urgent, as it could determine the future of Tibetan Buddhism and Tibet’s political movement. Below, we break down the key issues surrounding this controversy.Also read: ‘Will be born in free world’: Dalai Lama declares successor will be born outside China; Beijing counters China considers the Dalai Lama to be a symbol of Tibetan resistance and fears that an independent successor could fuel separatist sentiments. By controlling the reincarnation process, Beijing hopes to install a Dalai Lama loyal to the Chinese government, ensuring tighter control over Tibet. The current Dalai Lama, however, has made it clear that any successor appointed by China will not be respected by Tibetans:According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, the Dalai Lama is reincarnated, and his successor is identified by senior monks through visions, signs, and tests. Historically, this process has been free from political interference. However, China insists that it has the final say, citing historical conventions:– Mao Ning, Chinese foreign ministry spokespersonIn, the Dalai Lama explains that his successor must be free from Chinese control to continue his spiritual and humanitarian mission:This move is intended to prevent China from appointing a successor who would serve its political interests rather than uphold the spiritual and cultural values of Tibetan Buddhism.Beijing has dismissed the Dalai Lama’s remarks, insisting that it alone has the authority to choose his successor. The Chinese Foreign Ministry called him:They also reiterated that the reincarnation must follow government regulations:The controversy over the Panchen Lama—a senior figure in Tibetan Buddhism—illustrates China’s approach to religious succession. In 1995, the Dalai Lama identified a six-year-old boy, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, as the 11th Panchen Lama. Shortly after, the Chinese government abducted the child and appointed its own Panchen Lama, Gyaltsen Norbu, who is seen by many Tibetans as illegitimate.The original Panchen Lama has not been seen since, with China claiming that he is now living a ""normal life."" This fuels fears that Beijing will follow the same strategy with the next Dalai Lama.If China installs a Dalai Lama of its choosing, Tibetans and the global Buddhist community are unlikely to accept him. This could lead to two rival Dalai Lamas—one recognized by Tibetans in exile and another by China. The Dalai Lama himself has warned:A divided leadership could deepen the Tibetan resistance against Chinese rule and further strain China’s relations with the international community.The dispute over the Dalai Lama’s succession has global implications, especially for China’s relations with India and the US.Beijing has condemned such foreign involvement as an attempt to destabilize China.In, the Dalai Lama expresses concern over Tibet’s fate under Chinese rule but remains hopeful:He also reaffirmed that the struggle for Tibetan freedom will continue beyond his lifetime:(With inputs from agencies)","Dalai Lama says his successor will be born in the ""free world""—outside of China.

Indian radiographer suspended in UK for not knowing how to X-ray hand or foot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/unable-to-perform-x-ray-indian-radiographer-suspended-in-uk/articleshow/119130183.cms,"Representative AI image: Indian radiographer suspended in UK

LONDON: A radiographer from Kerala has been suspended from practising in Britain for six months after a panel found she was not able to do basic procedures like X-raying a hand or foot that a radiographer “straight out of training would be able to do”, and that she was putting the health of UK patients at risk.Smitha Johny, an Indian national who trained in India, had declared her first language as English on her application to be registered with the health and care professionals council (HCPC) in 2021. By law, radiographers must be registered with it to work in the UK. She had also declared English as her first language on her application to work as a radiographer at the private hospital, North Downs Hospital, in Surrey, where she started working in Jan 2023. She also claimed to have 23 years of experience.Johny had to resign and is back in India.However, the health and care professions tribunal service found that she struggled to communicate with patients and colleagues in English, was unable to answer basic questions about the radiography process, could not identify basic anatomy, did not follow required guidelines, was unable to set a up an X-ray machine, failed a mandatory life support course, and misrepresented her experience. Theyfound her performance reflected incompetence rather than “misconduct”, saying she was “naïve” and “did not understand the expectations in the UK, which may be different from those where she was working in a remote part of India”.Her line manager, Fernando Pinto, was so concerned about her performance that he presented himself as a patient coming for a hip X-ray. She pointed the machine towards his knee, not his hip, which was a radiation breach causing unnecessary exposure, which could cause cancer. Pinto told the panel she showed “no knowledge about the X-ray machine”, did not know how to position it and did not know what any of the buttons were for. She also did not ask him enough about his personal details to check she was X-raying the correct patient.She was unable to recognise the scaphoid bone in the wrist, nor could she identify a fracture in the neck from an X-ray, and did not know what a femur bone was. She also failed the life support course because she could not understand anything the instructor was saying.At her three months review in April 2023, when confronted with her poor performance, she said she was “more like a manager in her previous role” and had worked on the hospital reception desk in India checking in patients. She also said she had worked with CT scanners and not X-rays. She was then told she would be put on authorised leave that could leave to termination.On April 24, 2023 she resigned.On April 26, 2023 her manager referred her to the HCPC raising concerns about her command of English and lack of professional knowledge. The hospital also contacted the home office, which gave her 60 days to leave the UK.In an earlier stage of the proceedings, Johny had said the X-ray machines in India were “entirely different to those at the hospital” and alleged there was “racism in the workplace”.Johny required a Malayalam interpreter to attend her virtual video hearing, which was held in March this year. She was in India at the time and only attended on the first day, saying she was ill and her “family condition is very bad”. She did not attend after that and did not make any submissions.","Smitha Johny, an Indian national who trained in India, had declared her first language as English on her application to be registered with the health and care professionals council (HCPC) By law, radiographers must be registered to work in the UK.

BEIJING: UK energy minister Ed Miliband met officials in Beijing on Monday after vowing to press them on China's emissions as well as touchy topics such as Hong Kong and forced labour.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has sought to boost engagement with China since coming to power in July, despite concerns over security and human rights crackdowns.Although it is the largest emitter of the greenhouse gases that drive climate change, China, the world's second-largest economy, is also a renewable energy powerhouse and aims to reach net zero by 2060.The UK has pledged to decarbonise completely by 2050 and has ramped up the transition to clean energy sources, which it claims will help boost its flagging economy.On Monday, Miliband met with Wang Hongzhi, head of Beijing's National Energy Administration, for the China-UK Energy Dialogue that London has said will be the first of regular "" climate change talks between both countries moving forward"".He also held talks with Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang at Beijing's ornate Great Hall of the People.Miliband is the third minister in Starmer's cabinet to visit China, writing in The Guardian newspaper last week that he will use the trip to ""urge continued action from China... to tackle the climate emergency"".""I consider it to be negligence towards today's and future generations not to engage China on this topic,"" he wrote.Official data showed last month that China missed a key climate target in 2024 and that emissions rose slightly as coal remained dominant, despite record renewable additions.The figures mean that China is off-track on a key commitment under the Paris climate agreement , analysts said.London has said the UK will share with China ""expertise on phasing out coal, having closed its last coal-fired power station last year.""Miliband said he would also raise concerns over rights abuses in Hong Kong and the treatment of the Uyghur minority, as well as ""forced labour in supply chains"" and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Beijing has never condemned.""Disagreement cannot be an excuse for disengagement,"" Miliband said.The energy minister also plans to invite Chinese counterparts to London later this year to renew formal climate dialogue between the countries, as the UK looks to play a leading role in global cooperation on the climate.""This is about protecting the British people now and for generations to come,"" he wrote.",UK energy minister Ed Miliband met officials in Beijing on Monday after vowing to press them on China's emissions.

A scholar under threat

A technicality with huge consequences

The shock and fallout

A systemic issue?

A decorated historian, an Oxford alumna, and a researcher dedicated to unearthing India's colonial past—Manikarnika Dutta never imagined she would be fighting to remain in the country she has called home for over a decade. Yet, a bureaucratic technicality threatens to uproot her life and academic career.Manikarnika Dutta , 37, an assistant professor at University College Dublin, is facing deportation from the UK after the Home Office deemed her ineligible for indefinite leave to remain (ILR). The reason? Her extensive research trips to India, where she accessed critical archives for her work on British imperial history, exceeded the maximum number of days allowed abroad under UK immigration rules, reported the Guardian.Dutta, who moved to the UK in 2012 for a master's degree at the University of Oxford, later pursued doctoral research and held positions at Oxford and the University of Bristol. Her academic commitments necessitated travel, yet those very commitments are now being used to justify her removal.UK Home Office rules allow ILR applicants to spend a maximum of 548 days outside the country over a 10-year period. Dutta exceeded this by 143 days—an overage caused by essential research trips and international conferences. Despite her argument that these trips were integral to her role, the Home Office ruled against her, reported the Guardian.Adding to the controversy, her husband, Dr Souvik Naha, a senior lecturer at the University of Glasgow, was granted ILR under the same application process, while Dutta was rejected. The Home Office further argued that she does not have a family life in Britain, despite being married and residing in London with her husband for over 10 years.“I was shocked when I got an email saying I have to leave,” Dutta told The Observer. “I have spent the majority of my adult life in the UK. I never thought something like this would happen to me.”Her lawyer, Naga Kandiah, has launched a legal challenge against the decision, emphasizing that her travel was not personal but essential for fulfilling academic responsibilities. The case has sparked an outcry in academic circles, with many arguing that the UK's approach risks alienating top-tier global scholars.Dutta is not alone. Other academics have faced similar issues, raising concerns that UK immigration policies are failing to accommodate the realities of academic research. Experts warn that such rigid rules could discourage global talent from considering the UK as a long-term base for research and innovation.For now, the Home Office has agreed to review her case over the next three months. But Dutta remains in limbo, unsure of whether she will be allowed to continue her career in the UK or forced to leave the country she has called home for more than a decade.A Home Office spokesperson stated: “It is longstanding government policy that we do not routinely comment on individual cases.” However, the implications of Dutta’s case extend far beyond her personal situation, raising urgent questions about the UK’s commitment to retaining world-class academic talent.","Manikarnika Dutta, an assistant professor at University College Dublin, is facing deportation from the UK.

UK Care Worker Recruitment: UK tells care companies to first try to hire locally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-tells-care-companies-to-first-try-to-hire-locally/articleshow/119073951.cms,"Representative image

TOI correspondent from London: The UK government has announced new rules for recruiting foreign care workers in the UK, prioritising foreign care workers already in the country above those based overseas. Indian nationals are currently the largest recipient of care worker visas in Britain.From April 9, care providers in the UK who want to recruit a new worker from overseas will have to first prove that they have attempted to recruit a foreign worker from within England who needs new sponsorship.Thousands of Indians who came to the UK on care worker visas have been left in destitute conditions, with some facing deportation.Many paid huge fees to agents in India to come to the UK, only to find the care company that sponsored their visa for does not exist or has no care work. Once their licence was revoked, they faced deportation.The new rules will allow this pool of workers to get hired. Seema Malhotra, minister for migration and citizenship, said: “Those who have come to the UK to support our adult care sector should have the opportunity to do so, free from abuse and exploitation.”Between July 2022 and December 2024, the UK government revoked 470 sponsor licences in the care sector to clamp down on abuse and exploitation. Over 39,000 workers have been associated with these sponsors since October 2020.","Indian nationals are currently the largest recipient of care worker visas in Britain.

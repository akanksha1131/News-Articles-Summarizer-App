Execution by nitrogen gas & lethal injection: Texas and Alabama carry out two deaths; nine more scheduled this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/execution-by-nitrogen-gas-lethal-injection-used-texas-and-alabama-carry-out-two-deaths-nine-more-scheduled-this-year/articleshow/124141351.cms,"



Two US inmates were executed Thursday in separate states, with one put to death by nitrogen gas in Alabama and another by lethal injection in Texas. The executions, carried out within 18 minutes of each other, bring the total number of US executions this year to 33, the highest since 2014.In Alabama, Geoffrey West, 50, was pronounced dead at 6:22 p.m. US Central Time for the 1997 murder of Margaret Berry, 33, a mother of two, during a gas station robbery in Attalla. In his final statement, provided to USA TODAY by his attorneys, West apologized and reflected on faith, saying, ""I am at peace because I know where I am going and look forward to seeing Mrs. Berry when I get there... I urge everyone, especially young people, to find God. ""Berry's son, Will Berry, who was 11 when his mother was killed, had sought a reprieve, expressing a wish to meet West before his execution. ""I believe that in seeking to execute Mr. West, the state of Alabama is playing God,"" he wrote in an opinion piece. Alabama Governor Kay Ivey declined to commute the sentence, citing the state's legal duty to punish egregious crimes. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said, ""Margaret did not have to senselessly die... Justice is how we restore peace to the communities they leave behind.""Just 18 minutes later in Texas, Blaine Milam, 35, was executed by lethal injection for the 2008 killing of his girlfriend’s 13-month-old daughter, Amora Carson, during what Milam and the mother described as an ""exorcism."" Court documents described the child’s death as including 24 bite marks, 18 broken ribs, severe skull fractures, and genital injuries. Milam’s final words, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, thanked the department for allowing him to join a faith-based program on death row. ""I love you all, bring me home Jesus,"" he said.Milam’s attorneys argued that he is intellectually disabled and that the bite mark evidence in his case was unreliable. The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected those claims. His case was featured in Werner Herzog’s 2013 documentary, ""On Death Row.""Both executions mark the fifth instance this year where two inmates were executed on the same day in the United States. Florida has carried out the most executions this year, followed by South Carolina and Texas.President Donald Trump, a proponent of capital punishment, signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday directing federal prosecutors to pursue the death penalty in Washington, D.C., for the nation’s most heinous crimes. The memo, cited by USA TODAY, highlights Trump’s commitment to enforcing federal capital punishment despite opposition from some politicians, lawyers, and non-governmental organizations.Nine more executions are scheduled in eight states by the end of 2025, putting the U.S. on pace to execute at least 42 inmates this year, a number not seen since 2012. The next execution is set for Sept. 30 in Florida, where Victor Tony Jones is scheduled to be lethally injected for the 1990 stabbing murders of inventor Jacob Nestor and his wife, Matilda Nestor. October is expected to be particularly busy, with seven executions planned across multiple states, including Florida, Mississippi, Missouri, Texas, and Arizona.","Two US inmates were executed Thursday in separate states, with one put to death by nitrogen gas in Alabama and another by lethal injection in Texas.

Phoenix-area shooting spree: Arizona man convicted of eight murders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/phoenix-area-shooting-spree-arizona-man-convicted-of-eight-murders-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/124140232.cms,"



An Arizona man was convicted Thursday on eight murder charges for a series of fatal shootings that targeted random victims as well as his own mother and stepfather over a three-week period in late 2017.Cleophus Cooksey Jr., 43, was also found guilty of kidnapping, sexual assault, and armed robbery. Authorities did not provide a motive, and Cooksey maintained his innocence throughout the months-long trial. The sentencing phase of the trial begins Monday, with prosecutors seeking the death penalty.The killings began on November 27, 2017, when Andrew Remillard, 27, and Parker Smith, 21, were found shot in the head inside a parked car in Phoenix. Five days later, Salim Richards, 31, a security guard, was killed while walking to his girlfriend’s apartment. His 9 mm Glock handgun and a necklace were stolen.On December 13, Latorrie Beckford, 29, was found shot twice in the head in the common area of a Glendale apartment complex. Two days later, Kristopher Cameron, 21, was shot while arriving at another Glendale complex to conduct a drug transaction with Cooksey.Later that day, Maria Villanueva, 43, was abducted from a parking lot by an unknown man captured on surveillance cameras. She was found partially nude and shot to death the following morning in a Phoenix alley. Investigators said Cooksey’s DNA was recovered from her body, and her car keys were found in his possession at the time of his arrest.The spree ended on December 17, when police responding to gunfire at Cooksey’s mother’s apartment found Rene Cooksey, 56, and her husband, Edward Nunn, 54, dead from gunshot wounds. Cooksey initially told officers he had cut his hand and was the only one home, but threatened an officer when they tried to detain him.Authorities also recovered Salim Richards’ gun, later linked to the killings of Beckford, Cameron, and Villanueva. Police said Cooksey was wearing Richards’ stolen necklace at the time of his arrest. Prosecutors declined to charge Cooksey in a suspected ninth killing of his ex-girlfriend’s brother, Jesus Real.Cooksey’s victims included people he knew and strangers. Adriana Rodriguez, the daughter of Villanueva, said her family finally received closure with the verdict. “He took my mom, the only support system that I had,” she said, breaking into tears.A family friend of Rene Cooksey and Edward Nunn, Eric Hampton, called Cooksey a “monster” and expressed hope that he would receive the death penalty. “I thought maybe he had a little heart. But he doesn't have any heart at all, you know, to actually do these things to people and actually the worst part, kill your own mom,” Hampton said outside the courthouse.The killings occurred four months after Cooksey’s release from prison on a manslaughter conviction linked to a 2001 strip club robbery in which an accomplice was killed. Cooksey, an aspiring musician, consistently claimed he was innocent. In a 2020 handwritten letter to a judge, he wrote that he was “not a rapist or murderer” and described himself as a “music artist.”The trial was delayed multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cooksey appeared in court looking down as the verdicts were read.Cooksey’s arrest followed two previous serial shooting sprees in metro Phoenix. In 2015, a series of 11 shootings occurred on Phoenix freeways over several weeks, but no serious injuries were reported and charges against the accused were later dismissed.The next case, which lasted nearly a year and ended in July 2016, involved bus driver Aaron Juan Saucedo, who was charged with killing nine people. Saucedo’s trial is scheduled for December, and he has pleaded not guilty.Maricopa County prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Cooksey during the upcoming sentencing phase, citing the brutal nature of the killings and the inclusion of his own family members among the victims. Authorities have said the case represents one of the most disturbing serial murder sprees in recent Arizona history.","Cleophus Cooksey Jr., 43, was also found guilty of kidnapping, sexual assault, and armed robbery.

'Hybrid attacks': What Denmark revealed about drone & disruption at airports; Russia denies involvement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/hybrid-attacks-what-denmark-revealed-about-drone-disruption-at-airports-russia-denies-involvement/articleshow/124139555.cms,"Drones Over Copenhagen Airport A 'Serious Attack'; Russia Breaks Silence, NATO Vows Response

Prime minister calls it ‘hybrid attacks’





Aim to create fear, says justice minister









Denmark said Thursday that drone flights over multiple airports this week were part of “hybrid attacks” aimed at spreading fear and disrupting the country, prompting authorities to consider new security measures and closer coordination with NATO allies. Russia firmly denied involvement, calling the incidents a “staged provocation.”Authorities confirmed that unidentified drones were seen over several Danish airports, including Aalborg, Esbjerg, Sonderborg and the Skrydstrup air base, as well as near Billund, the country’s second-largest airport. Aalborg was closed for several hours, while Billund was briefly shut following unverified reports of drone activity. Earlier in the week, a similar episode had forced Copenhagen Airport, Denmark’s busiest, to halt operations.North Jutland police inspector Jesper Bojgaard Madsen said drones over Aalborg flew “over a very large area over a couple of hours” and could not be intercepted. Police said investigations were under way in cooperation with the intelligence service and the armed forces.“Over recent days, Denmark has been the victim of hybrid attacks,” Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a video address on social media.She warned that such incursions “could multiply” and highlighted Russia as the main security threat to Europe.“There is one main country that poses a threat to Europe’s security, and it is Russia,” Frederiksen said. She added that she had discussed the incidents with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.The Kremlin rejected the accusations. “We firmly reject any suggestion of involvement in these incidents,” the Russian Embassy in Copenhagen said in a social media post, describing the drone flights as “a staged provocation.”Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard said the purpose of the flights was “to spread fear, create division and frighten us.” He said Denmark would invest in new capabilities to “detect” and “neutralise” drones in response to the incidents.Defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen said the pattern of activity suggested “the work of a professional actor” with “systematic navigation across several locations at virtually the same time.” While he noted that the flights posed “no direct military threat,” Poulsen said they highlighted Denmark’s vulnerability to hybrid warfare and sabotage.Military intelligence officials said investigators had not yet identified those responsible. “The risk of Russian sabotage in Denmark is high,” said intelligence chief Finn Borch.Denmark has not yet decided whether to invoke NATO’s Article 4, which allows a member state to call consultations if its security or territorial integrity is threatened. Poulsen said the option remained under consideration given the “current security situation in Europe.”French President Emmanuel Macron voiced solidarity, saying France was ready “to contribute to the security of Danish airspace.” European defence ministers are due to meet Friday to discuss drones as emerging threats, while EU leaders are scheduled to gather in Copenhagen next week for a summit.The incidents in Denmark follow drone incursions in Norway, Polish and Romanian airspace, and the violation of Estonian airspace by Russian fighter jets. Earlier this month, more than 20 Russian drones crossed into Polish territory, prompting Warsaw to trigger NATO’s Article 4.European analysts describe such actions as part of so-called “grey zone” or hybrid warfare tactics designed to destabilise opponents without open conflict. “Russia sees a new opportunity space and is trying to explore it,” said Flemming Splidsboel Hansen, a researcher on hybrid warfare and post-Soviet Russia.For many Danes, the drone sightings stirred unease. “I feel rather insecure. I live in a country where there has been peace since 1945. I am not really used to thinking about war,” said 85-year-old Birgit Larsen in central Copenhagen.Others expressed a more measured view. “It’s probably Russia, you know, testing the borders of Europe. They fly close to the borders and stuff and try to provoke, but not threaten,” said 48-year-old Torsten Froling.The threat posed by drones to airports has grown in recent years. In December 2018, drone activity over Gatwick Airport in London disrupted hundreds of flights, while in January 2019, drone reports near Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey temporarily halted air traffic.Danish officials said the latest events underscore the need to strengthen defences. The government recently announced plans to acquire long-range precision weapons for the first time, citing Russia as a long-term threat.Poulsen said the government was treating the situation with urgency but emphasised that it remained under control. “This was a systematic operation, but there was no immediate military danger,” he said.The drone incursions, coinciding with Denmark’s preparations to host European leaders, have intensified debate over how Nato and the EU should respond to unconventional threats at a time when the war in Ukraine continues to destabilise the region.","Drones seen over several Danish airports, including Aalborg, Esbjerg, Sonderborg and the Skrydstrup air base.

Hegseth is said to have summoned US military brass from across globe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hegseth-is-said-to-have-summoned-us-military-brass-from-across-globe/articleshow/124139327.cms,"



Defence secretary Pete Hegseth has summoned scores of generals and admirals from around the world to meet on short notice next week at a Marine Corps base in Virginia but has not disclosed the reason for the gathering, four US officials said Thursday. The unusual directive, which has been filtering its way through military commands, and the undisclosed rationale, has stirred anxiety among the military's top ranks at a time when Hegseth has fired several senior officers.The officials said the gathering was scheduled for next week, probably Sept 30, at the base in Quantico, Virginia. There are about 800 general-level officers in the armed forces, including 44 at the most senior, four-star level. It was not immediately clear how many of them would be ordered to the gathering, reported earlier by the Washington Post.In May, Hegseth ordered a 20% reduction in four-star officers, continuing the broad job reductions and firings that have marked the first several months of his tenure.Hegseth has already fired more than a dozen military leaders, many of them people of colour and women. Chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said Hegseth ""will be addressing his senior military leaders early next week.""Top four-star combatant commanders and chiefs of armed services typically meet at least twice a year in Washington, often holding a working dinner with the president. But the large number of generals who could be ordered to Washington, including those working in active conflict zones, is without precedent in recent memory, officials said.","Defence secretary Pete Hegseth has summoned scores of generals and admirals from around the world.

"Drone attack in Haiti slum kills 8 children: Residents blame police for strike; UN-backed mission still short on manpower, funding",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/drone-attack-in-haiti-slum-kills-8-children-residents-blame-police-for-strike-un-backed-mission-still-short-on-manpower-funding/articleshow/124059212.cms,"



A drone attack targeting a suspected gang leader killed at least eight children and injured six others in Cité Soleil, a gang-controlled slum of Haiti’s capital, relatives and activists told The Associated Press on Monday. They blamed police for launching the strike on Saturday night.The explosions struck during a gathering reportedly organised by suspected gang leader Albert Steevenson, known as Djouma, who was preparing to celebrate his birthday. Haiti’s National Human Rights Defense Network said Steevenson was distributing gifts to children at the time.“This is my daughter,” said Claudia Bobrun, 30, showing AP a video of her 8-year-old girl lying in a pool of blood. Tears rolled down her face as she replayed the clip.Residents said at least 13 people died, including civilians and suspected gang members. Victims included the two grandchildren and son of 60-year-old Michelis Florville. “People were running right and left,” he recalled.Nanouse Mertelia, 37, said her son was killed after being caught in the blast. “Come get me, come get me, please mama,” she quoted him as saying before he died from blood loss.The rights group accused police of using two kamikaze drones in the Simon Pelé community of Cité Soleil. Activists added that a similar drone operation in downtown Port-au-Prince earlier this month killed at least eleven civilians.“However, the drones have not targeted terrorist leaders. On the contrary, these leaders have grown more at ease and increasingly arrogant, even moving openly in convoys. Drones must not be selective, and they must also ensure the protection of civilians to avoid collateral damage,” the group said.The attack follows the creation of a new task force earlier this year that operates outside Haiti’s police oversight, relying on certain units and private contractors using explosive drones.It comes as private security firm Vectus Global, linked to former US Navy Seal Erik Prince, prepares to deploy nearly 200 foreign personnel to Haiti under a one-year contract. The government has confirmed it is working with foreign contractors but has not disclosed the terms of the deal.Meanwhile, the UN-backed multinational mission in Haiti continues to face resource shortages, with just 991 personnel deployed against a target of 2,500, and funding standing at $112 million of the $800 million required annually, according to a recent UN report.","The explosions struck during a gathering reportedly organised by suspected gang leader Albert Steevenson, known as Djouma.

Trump’s H-1B crackdown: How the ‘American Dream’ got expensive; costlier than luxury cars & homes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/us-canada-news/trumps-h-1b-crackdown-how-the-american-dream-got-expensive-costlier-than-luxury-cars-homes/articleshow/124039035.cms,"American dream (AI image generated using ChatGPT)

A $5 million dream out of reach



Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH

Trump’s $100,000 H-1B visa fee



Relief and panic among Indian professionals



The American dream has long been seen as a promise of opportunity and prosperity, but fresh analysis shows it is becoming alarmingly expensive. According to Investopedia, achieving the traditional dream now carries a lifetime price tag of more than $5 million — a sum larger than the value of most luxury homes or cars. At the same time, President Donald Trump’s new crackdown on H-1B visas has added another barrier for many foreign professionals seeking to build their lives in the United States.The Investopedia report, published this month, calculated the costs of eight milestones Americans most associate with the dream: retiring comfortably, raising children, buying a home, affording healthcare, owning a car, taking annual holidays, caring for pets, and holding a wedding. Together, those ambitions total a staggering $5,043,323.Retirement alone is priced at $1.6 million, while home ownership averages nearly $958,000 over a lifetime once mortgage interest, taxes, and insurance are included. Raising two children through university adds $876,092, and new cars — assumed to be bought once a decade — account for another $900,346. Even annual holidays, weddings and pets pile up thousands of dollars more.“This is about showing people the real cost of the dream,” Investopedia editor-in-chief Caleb Silver explained. “Homeownership, raising kids, sending them to college — all of these are rising in price across the board.”As costs soar for Americans, the pathway for foreign workers chasing the same dream is also being reshaped. The Trump administration last week confirmed that all new H-1B visa petitions will carry a one-time fee of $100,000 — a dramatic increase from the current costs of $2,000 to $5,000.The US Citizenship and Immigration Services clarified that the charge applies only to new applications, not to renewals or current visa holders, and will first take effect in the next lottery cycle. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers defended the move, saying it would “discourage companies from spamming the system and driving down wages” while prioritising American workers.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick described it bluntly: “Either the person is very valuable to the company and America, or they’re going to depart, and the company is going to hire an American.”The clarification brought some relief to thousands of Indian IT professionals already in the US, who had feared immediate costs to re-enter the country or extend their stay. Still, immigration lawyers warned of chaos for those caught outside America when the proclamation took effect on 21 September, with many scrambling to return before the deadline.Attorney Cyrus Mehta warned that some visa holders could be stranded. “H-1B visa holders who are out of the US on business or vacation will get stuck unless they get in before midnight September 21,” he said.The H-1B programme allows American firms to hire highly skilled foreign workers, with 65,000 visas issued annually under a congressional cap, plus an additional 20,000 for those with advanced US degrees. For decades, it has been the main gateway for Indian and Chinese professionals entering Silicon Valley.","Investopedia calculated the costs of eight milestones Americans most associate with the dream: retiring comfortably, raising children, buying a home, affording healthcare, owning a car, taking annual holidays, caring for pets, and holding a wedding.

Divorce trends in Kuwait : Rising cases and new patterns





Marriage and divorce numbers: Contrasting realities in Kuwait





Ministry of Justice steps up family support and prevention efforts





Raising awareness and inter agency cooperation in Kuwait









Between January and July 2025, Kuwait witnessed a significant number of divorces among its citizens, with detailed statistics revealing new patterns in family dynamics. Despite these rising divorce figures, marriage rates remain robust. In response, the Ministry of Justice has implemented improved mediation strategies aimed at preserving family cohesion and addressing underlying social challenges.New data from Kuwait’s Ministry of Justice highlights 222 cases of khula (divorce initiated by wives) recorded between January 1 and July 31, 2025. Notably, 287 Kuwaiti women divorced before consummation of their marriages in the same period, outnumbering those who divorced after cohabitation. This suggests a shift in marital dissolution patterns, where many separations occur early on, even before couples fully start married life.Additionally, 439 cases involved Kuwaiti husbands divorcing one wife while remaining married to one or more other wives, reflecting complexities in polygamous family structures that still exist in the country.Despite the rising divorce figures, marriage rates among Kuwaitis remain strong.The Ministry of Justice reports a total of 5,993 marriages between Kuwaiti nationals in the first seven months of 2025. Over 75% of these marriages involved Kuwaiti citizens on both sides, underscoring the continued social importance of marriage in Kuwaiti society.However, divorces are not limited to recent marriages. The statistics reveal a total of 2,666 divorces during 2025 involving couples married in previous years. This indicates that many dissolutions happen after longer periods of marriage, pointing to challenges that affect families over time rather than only during the initial stages.In response to these developments, a responsible source at the Ministry of Justice confirmed the recent adoption of an enhanced framework aimed at reducing divorce rates. Central to this effort is the strengthening of marital reconciliation centers across Kuwait.These centers now operate with a multidisciplinary team comprising sociologists, family counselors, and religious scholars who actively engage with couples to mediate disputes before they escalate into divorce. Their role is to provide guidance, conflict resolution, and counseling tailored to the social and cultural context of Kuwaiti families.Beyond mediation, the Ministry emphasizes broad inter-agency collaboration to educate newly married couples about critical social risks. A key focus is raising awareness about the impact of drug abuse on families, a factor increasingly recognized for its potential to destabilize marriages and harm children.Officials also highlight the importance of informing couples about the social and psychological consequences of divorce, aiming to promote healthier family dynamics and reduce the strain on individuals and society.","Between January and July 2025, Kuwait recorded 2,666 divorces, including 222 khula and 287 pre-consummation cases.

'Time to stop': Trump was asked if he'll allow Israel to annex the West Bank?

""It's been enough,"" said US President Donald Trump as he shot down questions about whether he would allow Israel to annex of West Bank.Asked directly about Israel’s suggestions that it could seize control of parts of the territory, he repeated, “I will not allow it. It’s not going to happen.”“I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. Nope. I won’t allow it. It’s not going to happen,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.The comments came just as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in New York to address the United Nations before heading to Washington for talks at the White House.The 47th POTUS confirmed he had spoken to Netanyahu earlier in the day, adding: “Yeah, but I’m not going to allow it. Whether I spoke to him or not, I did, but I’m not allowing Israel to annex the West Bank. There’s been enough. It’s time to stop now.”The statement marks one of the rare occasions Trump has broken from Netanyahu, despite his long record of backing Israel, both financially and through defence equipment.Around 3 million Palestinians live in the West Bank alongside some 500,000 Israeli settlers, in communities deemed illegal under international law.Netanyahu, under pressure from his nationalist coalition partners, has resisted calls for Palestinian statehood and overseen the expansion of settlements.The comments came after several US allies, including the UK, France and Australia, recognised a Palestinian state in an attempt to revive the stalled two-state solution. Arab leaders, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, had warned Trump that annexation would be a “red line.”Trump’s remarks also came amid Israel’s intensifying military campaign in Gaza, where tens of thousands have died during nearly two years of war with Hamas. Speaking on Thursday, he said he believed progress was being made towards ending the conflict. “We spoke with Bibi Netanyahu today, and we spoke to all the leaders in the Middle East who are great people, and we’re getting pretty close to having a deal on Gaza and maybe even peace,” he said.Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas, addressing the UN by video after being denied a US visa, urged countries to continue recognising Palestinian statehood and rejected any role for Hamas in a future government.","'I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank.

US President Donald Trump met Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and Army Chief Asim Munir in the White House Oval Office on Thursday in a public embrace of a country he had derided as a deceitful terrorist haven for much of his political career, including during his first term.The White House did not release any details of the meeting, nor were there any statements or readouts, much less a press conference in the hours after the unusual engagement that included ""Field Marshal"" Munir, regarded as the country’s de facto ruler. But a clutch of photos released by the Pakistani government showed Sharif and Munir seated in the gilded Oval Office for talks that were said to have lasted 80 minutes, and later posing with a grinning Trump with his characteristic thumbs up gesture.Trump appeared to be showing a mock up of the White House in a third photo, and in a fourth, secretary of state Marco Rubio is seen guffawing with the Pakistani leaders. The US President also conspicuously wore a pin of a fighter jet along with the trademark American flag. While Pakistan partisans claimed he wore the pin to recognise its downing of Indian aircraft during the recent war, it turned out that he wore it earlier in the day for his meeting with Turkish President Erdogan to press for sale of F-16s and F-35s to Ankara.Shortly before the Pakistan meeting, Trump had boasted about American military manufacturing prowess and said foreign leaders and generals were lining up to visit US factories to buy equipment, without specifically mentioning Pakistan. Erdovan, the leader of Turkey, a NATO ally, had met Trump earlier in the day and Washington has been hawking its military wares to him too.Absent any briefing from either side till the time of writing, speculation raged about the real purpose of the Pakistani meeting, which came soon after Trump had hosted a lunch for Erdogan, who, like with India, was asked by the US to cease purchasing Russian energy. But Pakistan is not a significant economic power, so much of the conjecture centered on Trump’s recent post seeking to retake the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan now under Taliban rule, and also Washington repurposing Islamabad for exploiting its purported mineral wealth. The US also appears to have taken a benign view of the Saudi-Pak defense pact even though it is ostensibly aimed at Israel, arguably the closest US ally.Even Pakistan’s defense minister Khwaja Asif, excluded from the meeting where his Army Chief was present, shed little light on the meeting with a cryptic social media post that read: “Victory over India, defense agreement with Saudi Arabia, and unprecedented progress in Pak-US relations. 2025, a year full of successes, Alhamdulillah. The continuation of the successes of the hybrid system's partnership. Allahu Akbar. ”The meeting, which was scheduled for 4.30 pm, began half an hour late as Trump was busy signing executive orders and bantering with reporters. Shortly before he met the Pakistani duo, he told the White House press corps, ""I'm very dissatisfied with what Russia's doing and what President Putin is doing. I haven't liked it at all...I have solved seven wars. In fact, we have a great leader coming, the prime minister of Pakistan and the field marshal. Field Marshal is a very great guy and so is the prime minister, both, and they're coming, and they may be in this room right now. I don't know, because we're late...they actually maybe somewhere in the Oval Office…behind you.""The fact that he did not mention, or remember, their names was trademark Trump transactional, which some Pakistani analysts opposed to the current regime lit into. ""Trump made 30,573 false or misleading claims in his first term alone. His strategy is pure exaggeration. Here, he inflates the stature of a military dictator and his puppet with empty praise, all to conscript their services for his dirty work in Gaza,"" Adil Raja, a retired Pakistani Army officer and a vocal critic of the establishment he once served, said on X.""Calling Pakistan's fascist rulers ""great leaders"" is just the price tag for making them his cleanup crew. Only idiots can celebrate this statement!"" Raja, now a staunch supporter of former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party and a social media influencer, wrote.Supporters of the current Pakistani dispensation though rejoiced over the country getting back into the good books of the White House after almost two decades of being in the doghouse for its use of terrorist proxies, something even Trump had flagged as far back as 2012 when he was still on the margins of US politics.“When will Pakistan apologize to us for providing safe sanctuary to Osama Bin Laden for 6 years?! Some 'ally.'"" he posted on July 5, 2012. And on January 1, 2018, during his first term as President: “We no longer pay Pakistan the $Billions because they would take our money and do nothing for us, Bin Laden being a prime example, Afghanistan being another. They were just one of many countries that take from the United States without giving anything in return. That’s ENDING!""That indeed now appears to have ended, with Pakistan opening up its purported mineral wealth for exploitation, and according to several media accounts, serving as a crypto front for US businesses to milk.","US President Donald Trump met Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and Army Chief Asim Munir in the White House Oval Office.

‘Left-wing terrorism’: Trump orders probe into violent protest funding; justice dept likely to target Soros-backed groups,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/left-wing-terrorism-trump-orders-probe-into-violent-protest-funding-justice-dept-likely-to-target-soros-backed-groups/articleshow/124139081.cms,"Justice Department directive



Escalation against political opponents



Pushback from civil society groups







US President Donald Trump on Thursday directed his administration to crack down on what he called “left-wing terrorism,” instructing federal agencies to investigate the financial backers of groups he accused of funding violent protests.Trump’s directive placed the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Taskforce in charge of the effort, with involvement from the Treasury Department and other agencies. He said the objective was “to identify and disrupt financial networks that fund domestic terrorism and political violence.”When pressed to name possible targets, Trump pointed to two of the Democratic Party’s most prominent donors, billionaire philanthropists George Soros and Reid Hoffman. “If they are funding these things, they're going to have some problems,” he said.The president’s announcement came weeks after the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah and a shooting outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas that left one detainee dead and two others wounded. Authorities have identified suspects in both cases but have not publicly provided evidence of a wider conspiracy or organized funding network.Ahead of Trump’s order, Soros’ Open Society Foundations rejected accusations that it promotes violence. “These accusations are politically motivated attacks on civil society, meant to silence speech the administration disagrees with and undermine the First Amendment right to free speech,” the organization said in a statement. It added, “Our activities are peaceful and lawful.” Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn and PayPal, could not be reached for comment.The New York Times reported that a senior Justice Department official has instructed more than half a dozen U.S. attorney’s offices to prepare investigative plans targeting groups funded by Soros. A copy of the directive, viewed by the newspaper, suggested potential charges including arson, racketeering, wire fraud and material support for terrorism.The directive, issued Monday by Aakash Singh, a lawyer in the deputy attorney general’s office, asked prosecutors in California, New York, Washington D.C., Chicago, Detroit and Maryland, among others, to review allegations against the Open Society Foundations. It also cited a report by the conservative Capital Research Center, which claimed the foundation “has poured over $80 million into groups tied to terrorism or extremist violence. ” One cited example was al-Haq, a Palestinian human rights group that the Israeli government declared a terrorist organization in 2022.At the time, Open Society Foundations disputed Israel’s designation, saying it was unsupported by credible evidence and was intended to silence human rights defenders.Chad Gilmartin, a Justice Department spokesperson, said the new directive was focused on safety. “This DOJ, along with our hardworking and dedicated U.S. attorneys, will always prioritize public safety and investigate organizations that conspire to commit acts of violence or other federal violations of law,” he said.The move comes as Trump continues to call for investigations into high-profile political adversaries. Over the weekend, he urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to bring charges against former FBI director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Both are subjects of separate federal investigations, and grand juries may soon be asked to consider indictments.Trump’s criticism of Soros has intensified since the killing of Kirk. Speaking to NBC News earlier this week, Trump said Soros is “a bad guy” who “should be put in jail.” He has also called for Soros and his son to be prosecuted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, a law historically used against organized crime. In an August social media post, Trump claimed they should face charges “because of their support for Violent Protest, and much more, all throughout the United States. ”Soros, who began funding pro-democracy initiatives abroad in the 1980s, expanded his Open Society network to the United States in the 1990s. The foundation funds programs supporting human rights, democracy and equity. Critics, including Trump and some Republicans, allege without evidence that the network promotes unrest and violent demonstrations.The Open Society Foundations has joined more than 100 philanthropic organisations in condemning efforts to link its work to political violence. “Organizations should not be attacked for carrying out their missions or expressing their values in support of the communities they serve,” a joint letter said. “We reject attempts to exploit political violence to mischaracterize our good work or restrict our fundamental freedoms, like freedom of speech and the freedom to give. ”Last week, the Soros family donated $10 million to Democratic redistricting efforts in California, part of a nationwide battle over congressional maps ahead of future elections.Hoffman, another donor singled out by Trump, has long supported Democratic campaigns and has funded projects opposing online disinformation.The Justice Department’s directive requires prosecutors to determine whether the allegations against Open Society and other groups merit opening criminal investigations. Singh’s memo also asked prosecutors to be ready with plans for grand juries if charges are pursued.For now, Soros’ organisation maintains that its US work is focused only on democratic freedoms. “Our activities are peaceful and lawful,” the foundation said in its latest statement.","US President Donald Trump on Thursday directed his administration to crack down on what he called “left-wing terrorism’ The directive instructs federal agencies to investigate the financial backers of groups he accused of funding violent protests.

Former FBI director and longtime Donald Trump critic James Comey has been indicted on two counts, US media reported Thursday, marking the latest escalation in the president’s campaign of legal action against political adversaries.Comey faces charges of making false statements and obstruction of justice. The indictment follows Trump’s public call earlier this week for Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue charges against Comey and other officials.""No one is above the law,"" Bondi said on X after the indictment was announced, without naming Comey. ""Today's indictment reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people. We will follow the facts in this case.""The indictment was filed by Lindsey Halligan, a former personal lawyer to Trump who was appointed US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia just days earlier. Halligan has no prior prosecutorial experience. She replaced Erik Siebert, who resigned last week after reportedly telling Justice Department leaders there was insufficient evidence to charge Comey or New York Attorney General Letitia James.James and other Democratic officials have been accused by Trump allies, including Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte, of falsifying mortgage documents.Comey was dismissed by Trump in 2017 during an investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. His indictment comes amid a broader crackdown on critics, including former national security advisor John Bolton, whose home and office were raided in August as part of a classified documents probe.Bolton has angered Trump with his memoir,, and frequent public criticism of the president, calling him ""unfit to be president.""Since returning to office in January, Trump has taken punitive steps against perceived opponents, including stripping former officials of security clearances, targeting law firms that handled past cases against him, and cutting federal funding to certain universities.Trump himself has faced multiple investigations. The FBI raided his Mar-a-Lago residence in 2022 over classified documents, and Special Counsel Jack Smith charged him with trying to overturn the 2020 election results. Neither case went to trial, and Smith dropped both after Trump’s victory in the 2024 election, citing Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president.","Former FBI director James Comey indicted on two counts of making false statements and obstruction of justice.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order approving a deal for the Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok to be taken over by a group of American investors, including Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, allowing the app to continue operating in the US. The signing took place in the Oval Office.Trump emphasized the platform’s importance during his 2024 campaign, saying, “I used it myself during the campaign, and it was very successful.” He also noted the influence of former conservative activist Charlie Kirk , who was assassinated this month, saying Kirk “helped me a lot, too,” and encouraged him to use TikTok to reach voters, as cited by NBC. Charlie helped me a lot too! He said to me, 'you should go on TikTok.' And it actually helped. We got RECORD votes with the young voters!"" Trump said.Highlighting the transition to US ownership, Trump said, “it’s very good and very meaningful, but we have American investors taking it over, running it, highly sophisticated,” adding that they would “play a very big role in terms of security, safety and everything else,” as quoted by NBC.Former President Joe Biden signed legislation last year requiring China’s ByteDance to sell TikTok’s US assets to an American company by early this year or face a nationwide ban.However, Trump has repeatedly issued orders allowing TikTok to continue operating in the US while his administration worked toward a sale agreement.ByteDance currently owns TikTok, but to remain functional in the US, a majority stake will shift to American investors, including Oracle and Silver Lake. ByteDance will retain less than 20 percent equity to comply with the divest-or-ban law and will have one board representative, who will be excluded from security-related matters.Many details of the arrangement remain unclear, but Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping “gave us the go-ahead” to proceed with the deal.Vice president JD Vance said the American company that takes ownership of TikTok will be valued at $14 billion. He also emphasized that US investors will ""actually control the algorithm"" of the app.“We actually think this is a good deal for investors, but ultimately the investors are going to make the determination about what they would invest in and what they think is proper value,” Vance added, as reported by NBC News.Neither Vance nor Trump specified the exact buyers of TikTok, but both noted that Oracle will play ""a big part"" in the deal.","US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order approving a deal for the Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok to be taken over by a group of American investors.

Blank prescriptions pre-signed by Anand



Anand disputed allegations, said he treated victims of 9/11, was US Navy's physician







Indian-origin doctor Neil K Anand who was convicted for US health care fraud earlier this year has been sentenced to 14 years in prison for pushing his patients to accept goody bags of sedatives that they did not need so that he could get insurance money. The 48-year-old Pennsylvania doctor was also ordered to pay over $2 million in restitution and over $2 million in forfeiture.Layers of irregularities were uncovered in the investigation as apart from forcing patients to take medicines that they did not need, he pre-signed prescriptions where his interns, with no license to prescribe medicines, wrote controlled substances.According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Dr Anand conspired to submit false and fraudulent claims to health plans provided by Medicare, the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Independence Blue Cross (IBC), and Anthem, for “Goody Bags” of medically unnecessary prescription medications, which were dispensed to patients by in-house pharmacies owned by Anand. In total, Medicare, OPM, IBC, and Anthem paid over $2.4 million in reimbursements.To entice patients to take the unwanted Goody Bags, Anand also conspired to distribute oxycodone outside the usual course of medical practice and without a legitimate medical purpose. Unlicensed medical interns wrote prescriptions for controlled substances using blank prescriptions that were pre-signed by Anand. As part of the scheme, Anand prescribed 20,850 oxycodone tablets for nine different patients.After learning that he was under investigation, Anand concealed the proceeds of the fraud by transferring approximately $1.2 million into an account in the name of a relative and for the benefit of a minor relative.Dr Anand and his family disputed the allegations and said his compassion for patients was unfairly criminalized. He treated victims of 9/11 attacks in New York City in 2001 and then enlisted in the US Navy as a physician.“The law has spoken for now, but the deeper questions remain: What is healing? What is justice? Where’s the line between mercy and misconduct?” Anand said. US District Judge Chad F Kenney said he believed Anand had grown to be motivated by greed and illicit profits and not the needs of his patients. “For you, their pain was your gain,” Kenney said. “You were not focused during this period on treating your patients.”Dr Anand was charged in 2019 and as his trial went for years, several groups on social media claimed that he became a victim of government propaganda and sought support.

The gunman who opened fire at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas despised the US government and sought to incite terror by killing federal agents, officials said Thursday, revealing the first indication of a motive.The gunman, identified as Joshua Jahn, who ultimately fatally shot himself, “carried out a targeted, ambush-style attack on law enforcement,” Joseph Rothrock, head of the FBI’s Dallas field office, was quoted as saying by AP.He “specifically intended to kill ICE agents,"" firing at ICE vehicles and sending multiple rounds into ""the windows of the office building where numerous ICE employees do their jobs every day.”The attack took place at daybreak on Wednesday, targeting the ICE building and a van in a gated entryway carrying detainees. One detainee was killed, and two others were critically wounded, though no ICE personnel were injured.The attacker is believed to have acted alone. Nancy Larson, the acting US attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said investigators discovered a series of notes at his residence, including one that read, “yes, it was just me.”Other notes were highly critical of ICE agents and suggested he intended to avoid harming detainees.Larson said investigators have found no evidence linking the gunman to any group or organization. While he expressed a broad hatred of the federal government, she noted he did not mention any federal agency other than ICE.FBI director Kash Patel confirmed on Wednesday that Joshua Jahn was influenced by the rooftop killing of Charlie Kirk, noting that Jahn searched multiple times on September 23 and 24 for “Charlie Kirk Shot video.” Jahn also fired his shots from a nearby rooftop.“The perp downloaded a document titled ‘Dallas County Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management’ containing a list of DHS facilities,” Patel said.The shooter also left behind a note stating he hoped the attack would “give ICE agents real terror,” Patel said through a post on X on Thursday.The FBI director shared a photo on social media of a bullet recovered from the scene, marked with the words “ANTI-ICE.” In response, Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem ordered increased security at ICE facilities nationwide, according to a DHS post on X.The shooting marks the latest high-profile targeted attack in the US, coming just two weeks after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot by a rooftop gunman at Utah Valley University. It also unfolds amid heightened immigration enforcement, which has fueled both backlash against ICE agents and growing fear in immigrant communities.","Gunman opened fire at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas.

D4vd moves out of Hollywood Hills apartment: Why isn't he arrested yet?



Body handed over to family: Is the investigation over?







While the mystery behind 14-year-old Celeste Rivas Hernandez's death and her connection with D4vd remain unsolved, the singer's friends have now issued statements claiming that Celeste had many fake IDs and they used to believe that she was 19. The revelations come as the LAPD has not yet made any arrests in Rivas' death, nor has it issued any statement on Rivas' connection to the singer who is now out of the public eye.TMZ reported that D4vd's friends claimed that they saw Celeste at parties and hangouts which had age restrictions, and they thought D4vd and Celeste were a couple. They also believed that Celeste was a student at USC.Several conspiracy theories are doing the rounds as the LAPD has not yet charged D4vd, even after raiding the Hollywood Hills apartment where Celeste used to stay with him. Celeste was reported missing in 2024 until her remains were found in D4vd's Tesla on September 8. But Celeste was not dead long before as a neighbor claimed that he saw Celeste with D4vd weeks before her body was found.The neighbor claimed that the Tesla apparently met with an accident and D4vd did not repair it and eventually dumped it.Celeste had a habit of running away from her troubled home and speculations are rife whether Celeste fled from D4vd's house also and met with some accident, or if that's what D4vd told the cops to distance himself from the death.But the body was found at D4vd's car and it's not yet known how things are adding up for the investigators.Meanwhile, D4vd's manager ended the lease agreement for the apartment where many believe Celeste was murdered. They have started moving their belongings out as well.The police handed over the rotting body of Rivas to the family for the funeral without answering the mysteries surrounding the death. The body was rotting when it was found on September 8, as it was reported to the police because of a foul smell. It was already attracting flies and it took almost a week to establish the identity. Officials could even determine the clothes that Rivas was wearing when she died. But they have not revealed the cause of death and the date of death yet.",D4vd's friends said they thought Celeste Rivas was his girlfriend and that she was 19.

‘Scrambling to change plans’: Pentagon summons top military leaders to rare in-person meeting in Virginia; purpose not revealed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/scrambling-to-change-plans-pentagon-summons-top-military-leaders-to-rare-in-person-meeting-in-virginia-purpose-not-revealed/articleshow/124130186.cms,"Pete Hegseth (AP)





The Pentagon is convening a rare gathering of top US military leaders next week in Quantico, Virginia. Defence secretary Pete Hegseth has summoned senior commanders from around the world, though the purpose of the meeting remains unclear.""People are scrambling to change their plans and see if they have to attend,"" a source was quoted as saying by Reuters.Many senior military officials, who often command thousands of troops and maintain schedules planned weeks in advance, face disrupted plans due to the meeting. It remains unclear how many will attend, but gatherings of this scale, with so many top officials in one room, is a rare occurrence.“The Secretary of War will be addressing his senior military leaders early next week,” Pentagon spokesperson Parnell’s office said. The office did not respond to questions regarding the number of officers attending, the purpose of the meeting, or why Hegseth issued the abrupt summons.A meeting of this scale is highly unusual and would typically be conducted via secure video teleconference, as roughly 800 generals and admirals are stationed across the US and globally.The order targets senior officers at the rank of brigadier general or higher, or their Navy equivalents, along with their top enlisted advisers, as cited by the Washington Post.The US maintains troops worldwide, including in distant locations such as South Korea, Japan, and across the Middle East, under the command of two, three, and four star generals and admirals.Hegseth has rapidly reshaped the defence department, dismissing top generals and admirals to advance Trump’s national security agenda and eliminate diversity initiatives he deems discriminatory.Last month, Hegseth removed the head of the Pentagon’s intelligence agency along with two other senior military commanders.In May, Hegseth issued a directive to cut roughly 100 generals and admirals, including a ""minimum"" 20 percent reduction among four-star officers. He also ordered an additional 10 percent reduction in general and flag officers across the military.""More generals and admirals does not lead to more success,"" Hegseth said at the time, as reported by Reuters.","Pentagon convenes rare gathering of top US military leaders next week in Quantico, Virginia.

US President Donald Trump is expected to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the White House on Thursday, a Trump administration official told Reuters on Wednesday.The meeting comes weeks after the two countries agreed to a trade deal and follows a brief encounter between the leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.US-Pakistan ties have warmed in recent months under Trump, even as Washington’s relations with New Delhi have been tested over issues such as visa hurdles, high tariffs imposed on Indian goods, and Trump’s repeated claims that he brokered an India-Pakistan ceasefire in May.The United States and Pakistan announced a trade deal on July 31, including a 19% tariff rate imposed by Washington.However, US has yet to reach a similar trade agreement with India.Donald Trump previously hosted Pakistani army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House, marking the first time a US president met the head of Pakistan’s army without senior civilian officials. “We're working through a number of issues when it comes to counter-terrorism, when it comes to economic and trade ties,” a senior State Department official said. “And so the president remains focused on advancing US interests in the region, that includes through engaging with Pakistan and their government leaders.Asked about frictions with India, the official told Reuters, “Trump believed in being frank about frustrations in ties but the relationship was strong. Washington viewed New Delhi as a good friend and partner and believed their relationship would define the 21st century.” The official added that planning continues for a summit of the Quad grouping of India, Australia, Japan and the United States, expected either later this year or early next year.Sharif also met Trump on Tuesday on the sidelines of the UNGA in a meeting hosted alongside Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, attended by leaders from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Egypt, the UAE, and Jordan. According to Pakistan’s foreign office, “Informal exchange followed the dialogue between President Trump and leaders of eight Islamic-Arab countries, including Pakistan.” The meeting focused on exploring diplomatic, political, and humanitarian options for de-escalating the conflict in Gaza.Washington said it shared peace proposals with leaders from those countries during the meeting. Pakistan has backed Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his claimed efforts in easing India-Pakistan tensions, although Islamabad has criticised Israel’s operations in Gaza.Donald Trump addressed the UNGA for the first time since returning to the Oval Office, claiming he had ended seven wars in seven months, including the conflict between India and Pakistan.",US President Donald Trump is expected to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the White House on Thursday.

Poll Do you believe that security measures for trains in Balochistan are adequate? Yes, they are sufficient No, they need improvement





At least 12 people, including women and children, were injured in a bombing attack on the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express in Pakistan’s Balochistan province — the latest in a string of attacks on the train since March.Officials said the blast struck the passenger train as it passed through the Spizend area of Mastung district, causing six carriages to derail and one to overturn on Tuesday. Around 270 people were on board. Security forces rushed to the site and evacuated the injured to a nearby hospital, PTI reported.It was the second explosion in the area within 10 hours. Earlier that morning, an IED went off near the main track linking Balochistan to the rest of the country just as the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express was preparing to leave Quetta station. That train was cleared to continue because the rails were undamaged.The Jaffar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has repeatedly been targeted by separatist groups. On August 10, an IED derailed six coaches of the Peshawar-bound train, injuring four passengers. On August 7, a bomb near Sibi station exploded moments after the train passed; and on August 4 gunmen opened fire on its pilot engine near Kolpur, an attack later claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army.Earlier incidents this year include a remotely controlled blast in June that derailed four carriages in Jacobabad and a March hijacking in Bolan that killed 21 passengers and four security personnel before security forces killed 33 suspected militants in a follow-up operation.Rail officials said repairs to the damaged section of track would begin Wednesday under security clearance, with services temporarily suspended.","The Jaffar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has repeatedly been targeted by separatist groups.

Pakistan economic setback : Poverty rate reaches 25%; here is what World Bank says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-economic-setback-poverty-rate-reaches-25-here-is-what-world-bank-says/articleshow/124072300.cms,"



The World Bank’s latest report shows that poverty in Pakistan has climbed past 25%, highlighting the urgent need for long-term, inclusive reforms to safeguard the nation’s most vulnerable communities.The report, ""Reclaiming Momentum Towards Prosperity: Pakistan's Poverty, Equity and Resilience Assessment,"" marks the first in-depth look at poverty and welfare in the country in over 20 years. Using more than two decades of household surveys, administrative records and spatial analysis, it paints a stark picture of growing inequality, the Dawn reported citing the report.Pakistan’s poverty rate has climbed 7% in three years, reaching 25.3% in 2024-25, after a long decline from 64.3% in 2001-02 to 21.9% in 2018-19. The World Bank links the reversal to multiple crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, severe flooding and economic instability.The study also notes that previous poverty reduction was largely driven by a shift from farming to service-sector jobs. But the country’s economic transformation has been uneven, slowing job creation, productivity growth and economic diversification. Informal employment still dominates, making up more than 85% of all jobs, while women and young people remain largely excluded from the workforce, ANI reported citing Dawn.Social indicators are equally worrying. Nearly 40% of children are stunted, one-quarter of primary-aged children are out of school, and three-quarters of those attending struggle with basic reading skills. Access to clean water and sanitation is limited, with only half of households having safe drinking water and nearly a third lacking proper sanitation facilities.The World Bank also pointed to persistent regional inequality. Rural areas continue to suffer more than double the poverty seen in cities, and many historically underdeveloped districts remain trapped in the same conditions today, Dawn reported.","Pakistan’s poverty rate has climbed 7% in three years, reaching 25.3% in 2024-25.

At least 11 people were killed in two separate blasts in Pakistan’s restive Balochistan province on Friday, officials said, underscoring the growing wave of militancy in the mineral-rich region bordering Afghanistan and Iran.A suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a convoy of paramilitary soldiers in Dasht, near the Iranian border, killing five people, including three troops, according to two local government officials who spoke to AFP.

Unless we get it, we will see how the election is held and how someone could dream of attaining power,"" Alam posted on social media.EC's senior secretary, Akhter Ahmed, on Tuesday told a media briefing that NCP would not be allotted the symbol they demanded as it is ""not included in the list of electoral symbols as per the regulations"".""The 'shapla' is not on our list of 115 electoral symbols.

While it’s well known that Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived, he has now raised the issue with Sergio Gor, the US ambassador-designate to India who will also play the role of Special Envoy for South and Central Asia.Yunus met Gor on the margins of the ongoing UNGA session in New York. According to Dhaka, the chief advisor noted that the interim government has intensified efforts to revive SAARC, which has not held a summit in over a decade.SAARC summits are held biennially but the process has remained stalled since the summit in Kathmandu in 2014. The Uri terrorist attack in 2016 put paid to the summit that Pakistan was scheduled to host that year and India has since maintained Pakistan’s continued support for cross-border terrorism has made unfeasible the SAARC dialogue, including summits and important meetings.However, India has continued to support SAARC activities in diverse sectors for closer cooperation and blamed Pakistan for blocking trade and connectivity initiatives in the region. While it hasn’t withdrawn from the Association, India has sought to strengthen regional cooperation through the BIMSTEC grouping in which Pakistan is not a member.The US readout said regional cooperation was discussed but didn’t specifically mention SAARC.Bangladesh didn’t say what Gor’s response was to Yunus’ remarks on SAARC but India will be wary of any external pressure to resume the summit process. The idea of Pakistan hosting even a virtual summit has been rendered a non-starter because of the Pahalgam terrorist attack that led to a dramatic military clash between India and Pakistan.India sees the appointment of Gor as ambassador by the Trump administration as a welcome development but will guard against any US attempt to intrude into South Asian affairs through Gor’s dual role, particularly if it has any security fallout for the region. India is already worried about security challenges that Dhaka’s warming ties with Pakistan might entail. It has shown little interest so far in Yunus’ efforts to, as he said earlier, revive the spirit of SAARC.While countries like Bangladesh and Nepal seek a resumption of the summit process, India maintains that there has been no material change in the situation since the 19th summit that Pakistan had to host was postponed and that there’s no consensus among members on the meeting.India closely followed a China-Pakistan-Bangladesh trilateral meeting at Kunming, taking note of reports that this was an effort to create a new bloc in the region, However, Dhaka later denied this was an effort to forge an alliance against any country.Yunus also discussed with Gor the Rohingya crisis, and the “proliferation of disinformation targeting Dhaka”. Yunus has in the past described as fake news some of the reports in Indian media about targeting of Hindus in Bangladesh .According to Dhaka, Yunus also expressed Bangladesh’s interest in joining ASEAN, stating that integration with Southeast Asian economies could significantly accelerate the country’s development. He told Gor Dhaka ismaking “comprehensive preparations” to ensure a free, fair, and peaceful general election in the first half of February.","Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived. Yunus has raised the issue with Sergio Gor, the US ambassador-designate to India who will also play the role of Special Envoy for South and Central Asia. SAARC has not held a summit in over a decade.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124078743,imgsize-940257,width-400,resizemode-4/article-6.jpg"

Taliban bans books by Women in Afghanistan's universities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-bans-books-by-women-in-afghanistans-universities/articleshow/124059652.cms,"Image used for representative purposes





The Taliban government is purging books written by women from Afghanistan's male-only university system and outlawing gender studies courses, the latest blows in a campaign against women's rights since the group returned to power four years ago.More than 600 books, many of them written by women, were included in a 50-page list of banned works. The directive was announced in a letter to universities by the Taliban's deputy higher education minister, dated to late August, and published by the Independent Persian on Thursday. The letter said the titles were in conflict with principles of Shariah, or Islamic law.A member of the committee reviewing the books later clarified the Taliban's position to BBC Afghan that ""all books authored by women are not allowed to be taught.""The ban is ""a criminal act,"" said Rahela Sidiqi, the director of The Rahela Trust, a Britain-based group that works in Afghanistan to help women and girls access education. ""It not only affects females. It also affects males. It affects society, because those books were part of the curriculums of those universities.""Alongside the book ban, the Taliban has instructed universities to drop 18 courses spanning topics from human rights and democracy to women's studies, and said more than 200 others were under review.""We know in the spring, there was a committee put together by the Ministry of Higher Education to do exactly this,"" said Lauryn Oates, the executive director of Right to Learn Afghanistan, a group based in Canada that supports human rights and education for girls and women in Afghanistan. ""This will give people the false idea that women don't write books, or that women's ideas are not worth consulting.""The list of texts and subjects being stripped, Oates said, shows that ""they really don't like political science or international relations."" But she said it was also inconsistent, adding that much of it appeared to be coming from ""individual members' personal suspicion of the subjects.""In 2022, Afghanistan's higher education commission released a report after a review of school curriculum. Among the ""deficiencies"" outlined were the promotion of foreign cultural norms, ""moral deficiencies"" and the advancement of ""un-Islamic customs and practices, such as music, television, democracy, etc.""Because the Taliban has banned women and girls from secondary and higher education, the latest wave of censorship primarily affects the curricula of male students. But Sidiqi said the step is reflective of a pattern of ""restricting women from every part of life,"" adding that the removal of women's writing reflects an attempt to ""destroy the history of their life.""The move is part of a wider overhaul of higher education, which the Taliban has pursued since returning to power as it seeks to reshape Afghan society to conform to its hard-line ideology. It has fired scores of university professors who it claims break from state values, stifled dissent on university campuses and restructured curricula to augment the amount of religious education students are required to take.Earlier this week, internet shutdowns hit several provinces of Afghanistan to curb ""misuse,"" which had the effect of curtailing the ability to attend online classes and exchange information.","More than 600 books, many of them written by women, are included in a 50-page list of banned works.

Taliban’s Fresh Threat To US President After Trump Warns Afghanistan Again

Consequences for the economy



'Dark days' ahead



End of online education for girls?







Concerns are growing in Afghanistan over tightening Taliban restrictions on fiber-optic internet access.The war-torn nation's northern Balkh province confirmed a fiber-optic internet shutdown on Tuesday after Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada imposed a complete ban on the technology.There are reports of severe disruption in other parts of the country, including the northern provinces of Kunduz, Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar.The Taliban leadership has not provided an official explanation, however a spokesperson for the governor of Balkh stated that the decision was taken to ""prevent immorality."" But many experts suspect the Islamic fundamentalist group wants to block critical content and preempt any protests.Data from London-based internet monitor NetBlocks show that internet usage in the affected provinces has dropped dramatically.""The disruption of the internet marks the beginning of widespread repression across Afghanistan,"" security expert Bismillah Taban told DW. ""The Taliban could expand their crackdown and evade international oversight. This is a very serious concern.""So far, mobile internet has not been affected. Traders and business owners are warning of severe consequences if this access is also restricted.In addition, prepaid cards are very expensive, and mobile internet is comparatively slow. Fiber-optic internet is primarily used by companies, banks, and government agencies.""Currently, 80% of business is conducted online. We are already facing major challenges. Don't widen the gap between the people and the government any further,"" urged Khan Jan Alokozai, vice president of the Afghan Chamber of Commerce, on X.Sayed Ahmad Shah Sadaat, who served as Afghanistan's education minister from 2016 to 2018, also warned of the potential consequences.""The fiber-optic network, which people rely on for online education, commerce, and the banking system, will negatively impact all areas of life. The Taliban have no alternative internet system. If the network is cut off, Afghanistan faces a dark time ahead,"" she told DW.""Government agencies and institutions such as passport and registration offices, customs offices, banks, and media houses are particularly affected, as they rely on fiber-optic connections. Their failure puts additional pressure on central administrative structures.""International media organisations are also sounding the alarm.""Banning broadband internet is an unprecedented escalation of censorship that will undermine journalists' work and the public's right to information,"" said Beh Lih Yi, regional director of the committee to protect journalists.""The Taliban should end their cycle of repression and unconditionally restore internet access, which is an essential tool for news gathering.""For girls and women, the decision could have especially serious consequences. After being banned from attending schools and universities, many turned to online education as their only means of continuing their studies.""My students had Wi-Fi, but now it no longer works,"" said Afghan filmmaker Sahraa Karimi, who teaches her students from abroad. ""I read in the news that the Taliban have shut down the internet in many cities. I'm heartbroken, how am I supposed to teach the girls now?""Activists inside Afghanistan are also voicing their concerns.""Shutting down the internet is the final step toward backwardness, ignorance, and destruction,"" one woman said in a video message to DW.Another called it ""a direct attack on the dignity, freedom, and future of a nation.""""When the Taliban cut off the internet, it's not just a technical issue,"" warned Pashtana Durrani, founder of the online school network LEARN Afghanistan. ""It's an attack on the country's future.""For many students, she said, the internet is their last link to teachers and lessons. Girls in particular, excluded from schools and universities, lose their only opportunity to continue learning.""Every blackout,"" Durrani added, ""sets Afghan youth further back, weakens the intellectual foundation of the country, and deepens the despair of the younger generation.""","Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada imposed a complete ban on the technology.

Nahid appeared as the 47th witness in the ongoing case.Hossain said, ""We do not intend to involve Muhammad Yunus unnecessarily, but this point was raised only in reaction to witness statements.""""Hasina never ordered use of helicopters or lethal weapons to suppress the movement. On the contrary, she did everything possible to protect lives, safeguard property, and maintain law and order,"" he said, adding, ""No crimes against humanity were committed during July-Aug 2024.

Indian biker from Navi Mumbai Yogesh Alekari, whose Adventure motorbike was stolen in Nottingham while he was on a solo round-the-world trip, can now resume his global expedition after a UK motorbike dealer donated a 2020 KTM 790 Adventure to him.“It’s a more powerful bike. It’s overwhelming. British bikers have helped me beyond my imagination. I really appreciate that. This is the actual bikers’ brotherhood,” he said.

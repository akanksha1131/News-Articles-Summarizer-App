'They should be prosecuted': Trump accuses Democrats of leaking intel on Iran strike; White House calls it 'crime',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-should-be-prosecuted-trump-accuses-democrats-of-leaking-intel-on-iran-strike-white-house-calls-it-crime/articleshow/122103277.cms,"US President Donald Trump





Democrats were responsible for the intelligence leak suggesting ineffective strikes against Iran, US President Donald Trump claimed, and called for their ""prosecution.""The administration has directed the FBI to identify the source who leaked the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) report that indicated American attacks had not destroyed Tehran's nuclear capabilities. The Trump administration believed that the source holds a personal grievance against the president.""The Democrats are the ones who leaked the information on the perfect flight to the nuclear sites in Iran,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""They should be prosecuted!""Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth held a notable press conference, stating he hadn't encountered evidence suggesting Iran relocated its enriched uranium before the bombing, contradicting the leaked intelligence.Addressing the media's coverage of the leaked damage assessment, the defence secretary indicated the US operation had effectively concealed the bomb-making materials.Intelligence reports indicate that 400kg of highly-enriched uranium was moved from Fordow nuclear base to an undisclosed secure location before the attack.Israeli officials informed The New York Times about Iran's recent transfer of equipment and uranium from Fordow.Operation Midnight Hammer on Saturday involved seven B-2 bombers launching bunker-busting bombs at fortified facilities in Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan.Security sources indicated preliminary assessments showed Iran had removed nuclear materials from Fordow before the weekend operations.At the Pentagon briefing, Hegseth praised the US operation but provided limited details about its effectiveness.""I'm not aware of any intelligence that I've reviewed that says things were not where they were supposed to be moved or otherwise,"" Hegseth stated, after avoiding previous questions.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt admitted the information that was leaked was ""top secret intelligence."""" The FBI is looking for the leaker, so you'll have to ask them in the Department of Justice in terms of this investigation. But, you know, leaking top secret classified intelligence is a crime and people need to be held accountable for that crime,"" she said at the presser on Thursday.""This administration wants to ensure that classified intelligence is not ending up in irresponsible hands and that people who have the privilege of viewing this top secret classified information are being responsible with it. And unfortunately, clearly someone who had their hands on this and it was a very few people, a very few number of people in our government who saw this report, that person was irresponsible with it, and we need to get to the bottom of it and we need to strengthen that process to protect our national security and protect the American public ,"" she added.","The administration has directed the FBI to identify the source who leaked the DIA report.

Operation Midnight Hammer: Tehran confirms nuclear sites suffered 'serious' damage; mulls ending IAEA access,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/operation-midnight-hammer-tehran-confirms-nuclear-sites-suffered-serious-damage-mulls-ending-iaea-access/articleshow/122102655.cms,"File photo: Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi (Picture credit: AP)





Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, on Thursday publicly admitted that the country’s nuclear sites sustained “significant and serious damages” in last weekend’s US airstrikes on three facilities, the first such official acknowledgement from Tehran.“The losses have not been small, and our facilities have been seriously damaged,” Araghchi said on Iran’s state television, confirming the full impact of Operation Midnight Hammer, reported the New York Times.The strikes, launched by US B-2 bombers using bunker-busting bombs, targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Araghchi’s remarks contrasted sharply with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who earlier in the day had dismissed US President Donald Trump’s claims of “obliteration” as “exaggerated.”While Khamenei insisted in a prerecorded video that the attacks “were unable to do anything important,” Araghchi painted a far more serious picture and also warned that Iran may end its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). “Without a doubt, we are obliged to enforce this law,” he said, referring to a bill passed by hard-liners and approved by the Guardian Council that would suspend all collaboration with the UN nuclear watchdog.He added, “Our relationship with the agency will take a different shape,” and noted that a visit by IAEA chief Rafael Grossi “would not be welcomed” at this time. Iran has also hinted that it may no longer permit IAEA inspections and will stop filing monitoring reports, a move that has drawn global concern.Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei had earlier admitted the nuclear sites were “badly damaged.” Israeli military officials and American intelligence have similarly assessed that the strikes significantly degraded Iran’s nuclear program, with Brig Gen Effie Defrin stating it has been “set back by years.”US President Trump has defended the strikes, comparing them to the end-of-World War II atomic bombings in Japan. “I don’t want to use an example of Hiroshima or Nagasaki… but that was essentially the same thing. That ended that war. This ended the war,” he said.However, key questions remain unresolved. Iran has not revealed the fate of its 400 kilograms of enriched uranium, enough for nearly 10 nuclear bombs, nor has it confirmed the status of its advanced centrifuges. These details could be clarified by IAEA inspectors, should Tehran allow access.Analysts, including Sina Azodi of George Washington University, believe Tehran is using the confusion to its advantage. “Iran wants to keep everything in the dark… to play the diplomatic game of poker,” Azodi was quoted as saying by the New York Times.Despite Araghchi saying “no agreement has yet been reached” to resume talks, the White House has maintained a tone of cautious optimism. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated the administration’s commitment to diplomacy, saying, “The president wants peace. He always has… and we’re on a diplomatic path with Iran”.Talks are tentatively expected next week, with special envoy Steve Witkoff continuing behind-the-scenes negotiations, supported by regional partners like Qatar.However, Araghchi warned, saying, “Going through a war changes many realities… diplomacy must adjust itself to this new reality.”","Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, on Thursday publicly admitted that the country's nuclear sites sustained “significant and serious damages” in last weekend's US airstrikes on three facilities. “The losses have not been small, and our facilities have been seriously damaged,” he said.

Trump Gets ‘Desperate’ Amid Iran Strike Success Row, Releases Test Footage Of Bunker Busters





The strikes by the US on Iranian nuclear facilities have ""bolstered America's credibility on the global stage,"" according to former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice ""Credibility is not something that you establish one day and then you sort of dial it in and say it's done. We have to keep establishing that the United States is going to try and shape the international system, not just be a victim of it.

Impact on agriculture, tariff and energy



NEW DELHI: Trade talks between India and the US appear to be back on track, as President Donald Trump hinted that a ""very big"" agreement with India will be forthcoming soon.In a presser at the White House, Trump said, ""Everybody wants to make a deal and have a part of it. Remember a few months ago, the press was saying, 'You really have anybody of any interest? Well, we just signed with China yesterday. We are having some great deals. We have one coming up, maybe with India. Very big one. Where we're going to open up India, in the China deal, we are starting to open up China.""""We're not going to make deals with everybody. Some we are just going to send them a letter, say thank you very much. You are to pay 25, 35, 45 per cent. That's the easy way to do it, and my people don't want to do it that way. They want to do some of it, but they want to make more deals than I would do,"" he added.The trade relationship between India and the United States is expected to transform significantly, might lower tariffs, making US products more competitive in India, particularly in energy, agriculture, defence and aviation sectors.Given India's higher average tariffs compared to the US, the BTA could give advantage to American exporters, according to the Finance Ministry's Monthly Economic Review.The US implemented a 26% reciprocal tariff on Indian products in April 2025 but suspended it for 90 days from April 10, maintaining a 10% basic duty. Bilateral discussions have accelerated, showing substantial progress in digital trade, market access, customs procedures, and technical standards. A provisional agreement might be reached before July 9, as India seeks complete exemption from retaliatory tariffs.India-US trade reached $131.84 billion in FY25, establishing India as the US's primary trading partner.CRISIL suggests that while US imports to India might increase under the BTA, Indian exports may see limited benefits, as numerous key exports already enjoy duty-free access to the US market.India's growing energy requirements, especially for LNG, could create beneficial partnerships with US suppliers. CRISIL highlights LNG's advantages in price stability and long-term contract suitability over crude oil. Agricultural imports from the US might increase, including walnuts, pistachios and cranberries, although broader access remains disputed.The defence sector presents significant growth opportunities. Despite India's focus on domestic defence production, it remains a major arms importer. The US, as the world's leading arms exporter, has strengthened defence collaboration with India, including the INDUS-X programme initiated in 2023.Although India's trade surplus might face pressure, CRISIL identifies growth potential in labour-intensive industries like textiles, gems and jewellery, alongside high-value sectors such as smartphones and pharmaceuticals. The BTA negotiations encompass multiple sectors, with both nations considering it a crucial step towards enhanced economic partnership.In agriculture, imports of US items like walnuts, pistachios, and cranberries could increase, though India's resistance to broad agricultural access remains.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump reached an agreement in February to finalise the initial phase of a bilateral trade deal by autumn 2025, with plans to increase trade to $500 billion by 2030, up from approximately £191 billion in 2024.India continues to progress in its negotiations with the European Union for a free trade agreement later this year, and has recently completed discussions for a FTA with the United Kingdom. These initiatives aim to diversify trade partnerships in anticipation of possible US policy changes under Trump.""The ball is now in the US court. India is not for any win-lose trade partnership,"" stated Ram Singh, who leads the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, a government-supported research organisation.Data shows India's exports to the US increased to $17.25 billion during April-May, compared to $14.17 billion in the previous year, indicating that the US tariff increases averaging 10% in early April had minimal effect.","India-US trade reached $131.84 billion in FY25, establishing India as the US's primary trading partner.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday claimed that Israel may have sent agents to inspect Iran’s Fordo nuclear site following recent American airstrikes. He said the site suffered “total obliteration” and warned that further action would follow if Tehran were to resume uranium enrichment.While speaking to reporters at the Nato summit in The Hague, Trump said, “You know they have guys that go in there after the hit, and they said it was total obliteration.”He said that Israel is currently assessing the damage inflicted on the sites.“Israel is doing a report on it now, I understand, and I was told that they said it was total obliteration. I believe it was total obliteration, and I believe they didn’t have a chance to get anything out because we acted fast,” he added.Israeli officials, while responding to remarks made by Trump, told Kan public broadcaster, that they were not aware of any Israeli operation at Fordo nuclear site after the US strikes.Earlier in the week a leaked Pentagon intelligence report first reported by CNN, suggested that US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities might have left core components largely intact, and that Iran’s nuclear program has essentially only been set back only by months.Adding that a significant portion of Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile may have been moved out of the facilities before the bombings took place.The White House has dismissed the report's conclusions and criticized the leak.When asked by the reporters if the US would strike Iran again if Tehran were to rebuild its uranium enrichment facilities, Trump said, “Sure. But I’m not going to have to worry about that. It’s gone for years.”In response to a question about the extent of the setback to Iran’s nuclear program, Trump said, “I think it’s basically decades, because I don’t think they’ll ever do it again. I think they’ve had it. I mean, they just went through hell. They’ve had it.”“The last thing they want to do is enrich anything right now,” Trump said. “They want to recover,” he added.“They’re not going to have a bomb and they’re not going to enrich,” he stressed.Trump went on to compare the American strikes on the three Iranian nuclear sites with the nuclear bombing of Japan towards the end of world war two, “That hit ended the war. That hit ended the war. I don’t want to use an example of Hiroshima, I don’t want to use an example of Nagasaki, but that was essentially the same thing that ended that war. This ended that, this ended that war. If we didn’t take that out, they would have been fighting right now. ”“I think we’ll end up having somewhat of a relationship with Iran,” he added.","US President Donald Trump claimed that Israel may have sent agents to inspect Iran’s Fordo nuclear site following recent American airstrikes.

Understanding Hijri New Year: A Spiritual Milestone



Muharram : A Sacred Month of Peace and Reflection



Why the Date Changes Every Year



In Summary





The Islamic New Year (Hijri New Year) began on June 25, 2025, as the crescent moon of Muharram 1447 was sighted in Saudi Arabia.





The UAE will observe a public holiday on Friday, June 27, for both public and private sectors.





The Hijri calendar starts from 622 CE, the year of Prophet Muhammad’s migration from Mecca to Medina, known as the Hijrah.





Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar, is one of the four sacred months during which warfare is prohibited, emphasizing peace, prayer, and reflection.





Over 20 nations, including the UAE, recognize this day as a national holiday.









The Islamic New Year, also known as Hijri New Year, has officially begun as the crescent moon marking the start of Muharram 1447 was sighted in Saudi Arabia on the evening of Wednesday, June 25, 2025, after Maghrib prayers. This signifies that the previous month, Dhul Hijjah, (May 28, 2025 to June 25, 2025 in the Gregorian calendar) concluded with 29 days this year.Following the moon sighting, the UAE has announced a one-day public holiday on Friday, June 27, for both the public and private sectors, allowing residents to observe the sacred occasion. The announcement aligns with Islamic traditions and is consistent with regional lunar calendar observances.The Islamic or Hijri New Year commemorates a foundational moment in Islamic history, the Hijrah (migration) of the Prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina in the year 622 CE. This event not only marks the beginning of the Islamic lunar calendar, but also symbolizes the emergence of a united Muslim community and the early formation of Islamic society and law.While the occasion does not involve festive celebrations on the scale of Eid Al Fitr or Eid Al Adha, it remains a significant spiritual and cultural event.The day encourages personal reflection, increased prayer, and religious contemplation, especially in the wake of the annual Hajj pilgrimage that concludes days prior, in Dhul Hijjah.The month of Muharram is among the four sacred months in Islam during which warfare is forbidden, a directive rooted in Islamic scripture and tradition. This restriction elevates the month’s spiritual status, making it a time for heightened devotion, charitable acts, and inner reflection.The 1st of Muharram heralds not just a new calendar year, but also an invitation for Muslims worldwide to renew their spiritual goals and intentions. As such, many believers use this time to revisit their faith practices, set moral resolutions, and seek forgiveness.More than 20 countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, and Syria, officially recognize the Hijri New Year as a national holiday. This global observance reinforces the cultural and religious relevance of the occasion across diverse Muslim-majority nations.The Islamic calendar, known as the Hijri calendar, is lunar-based, meaning it follows the phases of the moon rather than the solar cycle. Each lunar month begins with the sighting of the new crescent moon, which causes Islamic dates, including Ramadan, Eid Al Fitr, and Eid Al Adha, to shift approximately 10 to 12 days earlier each year in the Gregorian calendar.As a result, the Islamic New Year does not fall on a fixed Gregorian date annually. For 2025, the crescent moon was sighted in Saudi Arabia on June 25, marking the start of Muharram 1447.","The Islamic New Year (Hijri New Year) began on June 25, 2025, as the crescent moon of Muharram 1447 was sighted in Saudi Arabia.

Civilian nuclear programme: $30bn deal from US to Iran in the works; but there's a non-negotiable condition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/civilian-nuclear-program-30bn-deal-from-us-to-iran-in-the-works-but-theres-a-non-negotiable-condition/articleshow/122103655.cms,"Iran's nuclear sites before US strikes

What is non-negotiable?

$20-30 billion investment offer

US may hold talks with Iran next week

Impact of US strikes on Iran's key nuclear sites





In a surprising diplomatic turn, the Trump administration is considering a massive $30 billion proposal to help Iran develop a civilian nuclear programme, marking a potential shift in the complex relationship between Washington and Tehran.The proposal comes amid recent strikes by US on Iran's key nuclear sites and represents a bold attempt to bring Iran back to the negotiating table, CNN reported.At the heart of the proposed deal lies a firm condition: Iran must commit to zero uranium enrichment. This requirement remains non-negotiable for the US, despite Iran's consistent stance that enrichment capabilities are essential for its energy needs. The preliminary proposal, as revealed in documents obtained by CNN, outlines a comprehensive plan for developing non-enrichment civilian nuclear infrastructure in Iran.According to the CNN report, the cornerstone of the proposal is a substantial investment package ranging from $20 to $30 billion for Iran's civilian nuclear program. The Trump administration has made it clear that this funding would primarily come from Arab partners rather than US coffers. The investment plan was discussed during a confidential meeting at the White House between US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Gulf partners, just hours before recent US military strikes against Iran.The proposal includes additional incentives such as potential sanctions relief and access to approximately $6 billion in currently restricted Iranian funds held in foreign banks. These discussions have been ongoing through backchannel communications, even as military confrontations between Iran and Israel unfolded over the past two weeks.US President Trump's recent statements at the NATO summit in the Netherlands have added another layer to these diplomatic efforts. While confirming upcoming talks with Iranian officials, Trump maintained a characteristically bold stance, claiming that US military actions had already effectively ""destroyed"" Iran's nuclear program.""We're going to talk with them next week, with Iran. We may sign an agreement, I don't know,"" Trump stated during the press conference. He emphasized that any new agreement would maintain the same demands as previous negotiations, focusing primarily on preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons.Last week, US strikes on three of Iran's key nuclear facilities. The Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant, built deep within a mountain for protection, was targeted by six B-2 bombers deploying twelve 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs. Satellite imagery following the strikes showed surface-level damage and potential entry points, marked by distinct ground alterations and grey dust deposits. According to leaked US intelligence, while the bombs successfully sealed facility entrances, they failed to collapse the underground structures.At Natanz, Iran's primary uranium enrichment center, multiple Israeli airstrikes and a US attack targeted the facility's underground enrichment halls. These facilities, buried just meters below the surface, proved more vulnerable than Fordo's deeper installations. Recent satellite imagery revealed two distinct impact craters above the suspected facility locations.The third target, Isfahan, faced a combined assault from US naval forces and Israeli military assets. A US Navy submarine launched over two dozen cruise missiles at the site. The strikes' effectiveness was highlighted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who cited the damage at Isfahan as evidence of successfully impeding Iran's nuclear program.","The US is considering a $30 billion proposal to help Iran develop a civilian nuclear programme. At the heart of the proposed deal lies a firm condition: Iran must commit to zero uranium enrichment. This requirement remains non-negotiable for the US, despite Iran's consistent stance that enrichment capabilities are essential for its energy needs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122103809,imgsize-1984771,width-400,resizemode-4/122103809.jpg"
'Iran can never get nukes': US secretary of state Marco Rubio talks tough with PM Shehbaz Sharif; Pakistan criticised strikes on Tehran's nuclear sites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/iran-can-never-get-nukes-us-secretary-of-state-marco-rubio-talks-tough-with-pm-shehbaz-sharif-pakistan-criticised-strikes-on-tehrans-nuclear-sites/articleshow/122103555.cms,"



US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a firm warning to Pakistan on Friday, saying that Iran must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. The statement came during a call with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif amid high tensions in the Middle East.“Secretary Rubio emphasised Iran can never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon,” said US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce.According to Bruce, both leaders “acknowledged the importance of working together to promote a durable peace between Israel and Iran and maintaining regional stability.”The message to Islamabad comes at a sensitive time, as the country has historically tried to balance its ties with both Iran and the West. Rubio’s call comes just days after a major US military strike on Iran’s underground nuclear facilities.The strikes triggered political controversy in Islamabad which had just days earlier recommended US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.The nomination, signed by deputy Prime Minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, praised Trump’s role in easing tensions with India. However, criticism erupted after Islamabad condemned the strikes as a breach of international law.JUI-F leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman demanded the nomination be withdrawn, calling Trump’s peace claims “false” and accusing him of backing Israeli aggression. Opposition figures, including Mushahid Hussain, slammed Trump for starting an “illegal war” and urged the government to revoke the nomination.PTI’s Raoof Hasan said the move brought “shame and embarrassment”, while other leaders, including Maleeha Lodhi and Afrasiab Khattak, labelled it undiplomatic and misguided.Pakistan’s foreign ministry issued a statement defending Iran’s right to self-defence under the UN Charter and warned of regional destabilisation. The backlash reflects a rapid shift from recent praise of Trump’s diplomacy.On June 22, the United States launched airstrikes targeting Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. Three critical sites — Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan — were struck using 30,000-pound GBU-57 “bunker buster” bombs, delivered by stealth B-2 bombers.On President Donald Trump’s orders, US Central Command carried out what the Pentagon described as a “deliberate and precise strike” to “severely degrade Iran’s nuclear weapons infrastructure.”“At approximately 6:40 PM EST, 2:10 am Iran time, the lead B-2 dropped GBU-57 MOP weapons on the first of several aim points at Fordow,” said General Dan Caine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.The military operation followed Israel’s “Operation Rising Lion” on June 13 and Iran’s retaliatory “Operation True Promise 3.”","US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a firm warning to Pakistan on Friday, saying that Iran must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.

US confident, Iran disputes impact





The US military has revealed new details about the strike on Iran’s nuclear site at Fordo, with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine recounting the dramatic return of the B-2 crews and the years of secret planning behind the mission dubbed ‘Operation Midnight Hammer’.“This was the brightest explosion I’ve ever seen—it looked like daylight,” one pilot told Caine after watching the massive 30,000-pound bunker-buster detonate. The crew had taken off not knowing if they would return. When they landed, “flags were flying and tears were flowing,” Caine said, describing the emotional moment at Whiteman Air Force Base.Also read: Satellite images show damage caused to Iran’s Fordo, Isfahan, Natanz nuclear sites after US strike; see pics ""A crew member told me when I talked to them on video the other day that this felt like the Super Bowl, the thousands of scientists, airmen, and maintainers all coming together,"" Caine said.Operation Midnight Hammer targeted Iran’s key nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. The US deployed 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs — steel-encased, fused to detonate at precise depths.Fordow, built deep underground, had two ventilation routes. Each route had three shafts, a main one flanked by two smaller ones, resembling a pitchfork in Pentagon imagery. Days before the strike, Iran placed concrete slabs over these shafts.According to Caine, the bombs were refined over years of testing on mock facilities. The aim was to delay detonation until the bomb could release a pressure wave through tunnels, destroying underground enrichment equipment.Caine outlined the story of two unnamed officers from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), who had studied the Fordo site for over 15 years.“In 2009, a DTRA officer was brought into a vault at an undisclosed location and shown images of major construction in the Iranian mountains,” he said. The officer, and later a teammate, spent years tracking the site’s geology, airflow systems, construction materials, and movement of equipment in and out of the complex.“They literally dreamed about this target,” Caine said. “They thought about it driving to work. From the first days, they knew what it was for. You don’t build a multilayered underground bunker with centrifuges in a mountain for any peaceful purpose.”Their long effort highlighted one central challenge: the US did not yet have a weapon capable of destroying such a site. So they began working with industry to develop what became the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, Caine said.Hundreds of tests were conducted to ensure the weapon would work.“They tested it over and over again. Dropped full-scale weapons on realistic targets. All for one purpose—kill this target at the time and place of our choosing,” said Caine.Then, in June, the call came from President Trump: execute the mission.Operation Midnight Hammer was launched. Crews from the active-duty Air Force and Missouri Air National Guard carried out the mission, departing on Friday and returning Sunday.Caine described what followed: “Late Saturday night, their families became aware of what was happening. On Sunday, when the jets returned from Whiteman, their families were there, flags flying, and tears flowing. A commander told me, ‘This is a moment in the lives of our families they will never forget.’”Jets flew in formation over the base before landing. “That, my friends, is what America’s Joint Force does,” said Caine.There was no visible crater at Fordo by design. The GBU-57 is built to penetrate deep before detonating.“All six weapons hit exactly where they were intended,” Caine confirmed, targeting each vent shaft of the underground complex. “The primary kill mechanism was a mix of overpressure and blast, ripping through the tunnels and destroying critical hardware.”He said the damage was consistent with extensive modelling, with shockwaves amplifying destruction in the facility’s confined spaces.President Trump has described the outcome as “total obliteration,” with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth dismissing media reports that the damage may have been overstated.However, Iran has disputed the scale of the strike’s impact. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said the US had “exaggerated” its success, insisting it did “nothing significant” to the programme. Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi called the damage “serious” but refused to confirm the programme was crippled.Despite Iranian denials, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, confirmed “extensive damage” at Fordo and other sites, including Natanz and Isfahan.","Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen.

Federal prosecutors informed a judge on Thursday that if Kilmar Abrego Garcia is released from a Tennessee jail, the Trump administration will initiate removal proceedings to deport him to a country other than his native El Salvador, according to Fox News.When US Magistrate Judge Paula Xinis questioned the timing of the removal, asking whether it would be “30 seconds, 30 days, or 30 months,” a federal prosecutor responded that he could only confirm the removal was not “imminent.”Judge Xinis has scheduled the next hearing on the matter for July 7.""This defendant has been charged with horrific crimes, including trafficking children, and will not walk free in our country again,"" a Justice Department spokesperson told Fox News.""This defendant has been charged with horrific crimes, including trafficking children, and will not walk free in our country again,"" a justice department spokesperson told Fox News.The central issue is whether Judge Paula Xinis has the authority to order Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s return to Maryland.

WHAT IS THE LAW?





A brain-dead pregnant Black woman in Georgia was kept on life support due to the state's abortion restrictions but was removed from it after giving birth to a baby boy, according to a report by AFP.Officials stated that the woman, identified as Adriana Smith, gave birth prematurely to a baby boy weighing less than 1 kilogram. Named Chance, the baby was delivered via emergency C-section on June 13 and is currently being cared for in the NICU.Smith, who was taken off life support on June 17, drew national attention as her case unfolded amid major changes to abortion access following the supreme court’s 2022 decision to overturn the federal right to abortion in a review of landmark Roe v Wade judgement granting women to terminate a pregnancy.“On Friday, June 13, 2025, her infant son, named Chance, was born prematurely at approximately 4:41 am via emergency Cesarean section,"" three Democratic congresswomen said in a statement. “Chance weighs about 1 pound, 13 ounces and is currently in the NICU.""Smith, a 30-year-old nurse, began experiencing severe headaches in February while nine weeks pregnant. Her first hospital visit resulted in just a prescription for medication, according to the agency.The following morning, she was brought to the hospital where she was employed. There, doctors discovered multiple blood clots in her brain and ultimately declared her brain dead.Georgia law prohibits abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, under what is known as a ‘heartbeat’ law, based on the first detection of a fetal heartbeat.Since Smith was nine weeks pregnant, doctors were reluctant to take any action that might violate the law, according to her mother, April Newkirk. Speaking to local NBC affiliate WXIA-TV in mid-May, she said, “This decision should’ve been left to us. I’m not saying that we would have chosen to terminate her pregnancy, what I’m saying is: we should have had a choice.”Since the conservative-leaning supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in June 2022, more than 20 of the 50 US states, including Georgia, have enacted strict abortion restrictions or complete bans.The three congresswomen Nikema Williams, Ayanna Pressley, and Sara Jacobs are advocating for stronger protections for pregnant women’s rights, especially for Black women, who are disproportionately affected by systemic medical neglect and strict anti-abortion laws.“The lack of a formal legal opinion or prosecutorial guidance leaves families and doctors in limbo,"" said the lawmakers, who have presented a congressional resolution on the issue.","Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old nurse, began experiencing severe headaches in February while nine weeks pregnant.

Former US first lady Michelle Obama has once again addressed the rumours surrounding her marriage with former President Barack Obama, saying the reason behind them seldom being photographed together is simply because they’re “too old for Instagram"".“The fact that people don’t see me going out on a date with my husband sparks rumors of the end of our marriage,” 61-year-old Obama told NPR podcast host Rachel Martin.“It’s like, ‘OK, so we don’t Instagram every minute of our lives. We are 60. We’re 60, y’all,'” she said.“You just are not gonna know what we’re doing every minute of the day.”The former first lady explained that she deliberately went against expectations by choosing not to attend high-profile events, such as former President Jimmy Carter’s funeral and President Donald Trump’s inauguration, and acknowledged that she had to “own it” when her absence drew backlash and further fueled speculation about problems in her marriage.“One of the major decisions I made this year was to stay put and not attend funerals and inaugurations and all the things that I’m supposed to attend,” she said.“That was a part of me using my ambition to say, ‘Let me define what I want to do, apart from what I’m supposed to do, what the world expects of me.’ And I have to own that. Those are my choices,” she added, acknowledging that her choice to stay away had sparked criticism.“Whatever the backlash was, I had to sit in it and own it. But I didn’t regret it, you know?

A Pakistan military officer who had claimed to have captured Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman was killed in a clash with Taliban militants in the Sararogha area of South Waziristan, near the Afghan border.According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah was killed along with Lance Naik Jibran Ullah during an operation against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters.ISPR added that the Pakistan Army killed 11 TTP militants and wounded seven others in the same operation.Major Moiz’s funeral prayers were held at Chaklala Garrison in Rawalpindi, with Pakistan Army Chief General Asim Munir in attendance.“Major Syed Moiz Abbas fought bravely in the face of resistance and ultimately laid down his life in the line of duty, upholding the highest traditions of bravery, sacrifice, and patriotism,” the ISPR statement quoted Munir as saying.His body was flown to his hometown of Chakwal in Punjab, where he was laid to rest with full military honours.A resurfaced clip of his old interview with Geo TV, now circulating on social media, shows Moiz — then a captain — detailing the events surrounding the capture of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman.Varthaman had shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter in February 2019 before his MiG-21 was hit and he was captured.

FATF Report Reveals Pakistan’s Missile Programme Link to 2020 Cargo Seized in India

What is ICBM?

Change in US strategy?





Another growing concern stems from Pakistan. US intelligence agencies have assessed that Pakistan is actively developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the continental United States.According to a report by, the Pakistani military is pursuing a nuclear-armed ICBM, particularly in the wake of Operation Sindoor that took place in May.While Islamabad maintains that its nuclear program is aimed solely at deterring India—its conventionally superior neighbor—US intelligence agencies have assessed that Pakistan is actively developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the continental United States.By pursuing such long-range capabilities, Pakistan may be attempting to deter potential US actions—whether a preemptive strike on its nuclear facilities or intervention in a future conflict with India.ICBM is a long-range missile with a reach exceeding 5,500 kilometers (3,400 miles), primarily designed to deliver nuclear payloads—typically one or more thermonuclear warheads. While ICBMs are theoretically capable of carrying conventional, chemical, or biological weapons, such payloads have never been operationally deployed on these systems.Modern ICBMs often feature multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), enabling a single missile to deliver several warheads to different targets simultaneously.Countries currently known to possess operational ICBMs include the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Israel, and North Korea. Pakistan, despite being a nuclear-armed nation, remained the only such state without an ICBM capability.Advancements in missile technology, such as those seen in second- and third-generation systems like the US LGM-118 Peacekeeper, significantly increased accuracy, allowing ICBMs to hit even small, fortified targets with high reliability.ICBMs stand apart from other ballistic missile classes due to their extended range and faster speed. They surpass intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs), medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs), short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), and tactical ballistic missiles in both capability and strategic impact.US officials have pointed out, the acquisition of ICBMs capable of targeting American territory would compel Washington to categorize Pakistan as a nuclear threat. Historically, no nation with such reach has been treated as an ally by the United States. In effect, the threat of nuclear escalation now shadows every region central to US strategic interests.While each emerging nuclear adversary—Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran—poses a significant threat on its own, the prospect of coordination or strategic collusion among them presents a far more alarming challenge.","According to a report by, the Pakistani military is pursuing a nuclear-armed ICBM.

ISLAMABAD: Former Pakistan foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari issued a blunt warning on Monday to India over its unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), saying Pakistan would not hesitate to respond if its water rights were violated.Speaking during the budget session of the National Assembly, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman said, “India has two options: share water fairly, or we will take it from all six rivers.” He described India’s move to suspend the 1960 treaty after the April 23 terrorist attack in Pahalgam as both illegal and provocative.The remarks came nearly two months after India suspended the IWT. New Delhi has blamed Pakistan-based militants for the assault, triggering fresh tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours.Bilawal argued there is no clause allowing unilateral withdrawal. “India’s claim that the treaty is in abeyance has no legal basis. According to the UN Charter, cutting off water is a form of aggression,” he said.He warned that if India pursued this course, it could lead to open conflict. “We do not want war, but if water is used as a weapon,” he said. “Pakistan will be forced to act — and we are in a position to defeat India just as we have before,” he claimed.Bilawal also urged India to resume dialogue, particularly on counterterrorism coordination. “Without engagement, violence will only increase in both countries,” he warned, adding that Pakistan’s own fight against terrorism had been undermined by Indian attempts to “politicise the issue”.The former FM also accused India of misusing global platforms to target Pakistan. “When we got off the FATF grey list, India tried hard to reverse it through lobbying and misinformation. But our diplomacy prevailed,” he claimed.He questioned the logic of what he called “PM Modi’s new abnormal”, where any terror incident is met with immediate threats against Pakistan. “We suffer terrorist attacks far more frequently than India — many traced to Indian funding or involvement. Should we adopt the same policy of automatic retaliation? That would mean surrendering our future to the agenda of terrorists,” he said.Bilawal insisted that peace in South Asia was not possible without dialogue and mutual trust. “We are not only fighting for Pakistan’s future, we are fighting for regional stability, for the people of both countries,” he said.The IWT, one of the few surviving agreements between India and Pakistan, allocates water from six rivers in the Indus basin. Under the treaty, India has control over the eastern rivers – Ravi, Beas and Sutlej – while Pakistan has rights over the western rivers – Indus, Jhelum and Chenab.",Bilawal Bhutto Zardari says Pakistan would not hesitate to respond if its water rights were violated.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Monday extended its airspace ban on Indian aircraft for another month, citing ongoing tensions between the two countries following the Pahalgam terrorist attack and subsequent military operations.The ban, originally imposed on April 23, was first extended on May 23 after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7. The Indian military action targeted and reportedly dismantled several terror camps in Pakistan-administered territory, triggering four days of intense cross-border clashes that concluded with a ceasefire on May 10.A fresh Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) issued by the Pakistan Airports Authority now extends the restriction from June 23 to July 23. The notice states, “Pakistan airspace not available for Indian registered aircraft and aircraft operated/owned or leased by Indian airlines/operators including military flights.”The situation remains tense despite the end of direct hostilities. Diplomatic channels have yet to yield any breakthroughs in repairing the fractured bilateral relationship. Indian and Pakistani officials have not resumed formal dialogue since the flare-up.The initial ban followed the Pahalgam terrorist attack, which killed at least 26 people, further deepening mistrust and heightening military alertness on both sides.","The ban, originally imposed on April 23, was first extended on May 23 after India launched Operation Sindoor.

Pakistan Condemns U.S. Strikes On Iran A Day After Nobel Peace Prize Endorsement For Donald Trump





The Pakistani government and its powerful military establishment are facing a wave of public backlash after formally recommending US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, a move that drew widespread condemnation following the US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities.Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar sent a letter to the Nobel Committee in Norway, crediting Trump’s “decisive diplomatic intervention” during the recent India-Pakistan standoff. But the recommendation triggered a storm on social media after Trump ordered attacks on Iran’s Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear sites, an operation he called a “historic moment” and one that escalated regional tensions.On X (formerly Twitter), users accused the Pakistani government of appeasing its “master.” One user mocked, “Pakistanis, beware! After the attack on Iran, PM Shehbaz might not only award Trump the Nobel Peace Prize, but also Tamgha-e-Jurat, Tamgha-e-Shujaat, Tamgha-e-Basalat, Tamgha-e-Imtiaz, and perhaps even the Nishan-e-Haider!”Veteran journalist Ameer Abbas recalled that PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique had once likened Trump to Genghis Khan and Hitler.“Now, the same government nominates him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Who is orchestrating such shameful and cowardly decisions?” he asked.Raheeq Abbasi, political analyst and columnist, noted the irony, “Trump, who vetoed the Gaza ceasefire 8 times and is protested across the West for war crimes, is being nominated for a Nobel by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Is there no sense of honour left?”The backlash cut across ideological lines. Some users accused the military establishment of calling the shots. “The uncrowned kings are ready to sell out the nation whenever they please,” wrote Major (R) Asim.Another user, Jarjees Ahmad, called out the “supreme level of hypocrisy”, “We’re nominating someone involved in the massacre of Palestinians while claiming to stand with Iran.”Aamir Khan added, “What greater betrayal could there be to Muslims, our country, and the people of Pakistan?”The Pakistani government has yet to respond officially to the criticism.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar sent a letter to the Nobel Committee in Norway, crediting Trump’s “decisive diplomatic intervention” during the recent India-Pakistan standoff.

ISLAMABAD: In a move likely to stir diplomatic discussion across the region, the Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan govt announced on Saturday that it will formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, citing his diplomatic intervention during the recent India-Pakistan military crisis, reports Omer Farooq Khan.In an official statement shared on X, the Pakistan govt credited Trump's ""decisive intervention"" and ""pivotal leadership"" with helping de-escalate a rapidly intensifying standoff between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Islamabad said it responded with a calibrated military action - Operation Bunyanum Marsoos - described as a ""measured"" and ""precise"" strike intended to restore deterrence without targeting civilian areas.Pakistan's govt claimed Trump engaged both Islamabad and New Delhi through high-level diplomacy at a moment of heightened regional volatility, securing a ceasefire that averted a wider conflagration. ""President Trump demonstrated strategic foresight and statesmanship, preventing a broader conflict that could have had catastrophic consequences for the region,"" the statement read.The govt also praised Trump for his ""sincere"" willingness to assist in resolving the Kashmir dispute - an issue Pakistan maintains is central to lasting peace in South Asia.India, however, has consistently rejected third-party involvement in Kashmir, reiterating that the issue must be resolved bilaterally under the Simla Agreement.The Pakistani statement expressed hope that Trump's ""legacy of pragmatic diplomacy"" would continue to play a role in addressing global flashpoints, including the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and rising tensions involving Iran.Trump, who is yet to respond publicly, has previously highlighted his role in managing past India-Pakistan tensions, including in 2019 following the Pulwama-Balakot incident. His earlier offer to mediate on Kashmir was firmly rebuffed by New Delhi.The Nobel Peace Prize nomination process permits formal recommendations from heads of state, national lawmakers, and certain academic and diplomatic figures. The Norwegian Nobel Committee does not comment on individual nominations.If successful, Trump would join a select group of American leaders - US Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter, and Barack Obama - who have received the Nobel Peace Prize.","Pakistan to nominate US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.

'Could not Occur Without Money': FATF Condemns Pahalgam Attack; Pakistan's Return To Grey-List Soon?





A new report from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has cited a case involving Pakistan’s missile development programme, referencing a shipment seized by Indian customs officials in 2020 that was bound for Port Qasim in Karachi. The FATF case study outlines how dual-use goods, including equipment critical for ballistic missile technology, were mis-declared in export documents and linked directly to Pakistan’s National Development Complex, which is known to be involved in the development of long-range ballistic missiles.The FATF report reveals that Indian investigators intercepted a cargo ship falsely declaring autoclaves, equipment used for high-energy materials and missile motor components. “The Bill of Lading of the seized cargo provided evidence of the link between the importer and the National Development Complex,” the report noted.This latest disclosure comes as FATF increases its scrutiny of state-sponsored terrorism, particularly following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, which left 26 dead. In a public condemnation, FATF said: “This, and other recent attacks, could not occur without money and the means to move funds between terrorist supporters.”As per PTI sources, India is likely to use this FATF disclosure in its dossier to push for Pakistan’s return to the FATF grey list. The upcoming Asia Pacific Group meeting in August and the FATF plenary in October may see renewed calls for sanctions or monitoring. According to officials cited by PTI, the inclusion of “state-sponsored terrorism” in the FATF’s upcoming analysis marks a significant step in acknowledging Pakistan’s involvement in funding and facilitating terror operations.The incident flagged by FATF, which occurred in February 2020 at Kandla port, saw authorities act on intelligence regarding a suspicious Hong Kong-flagged ship, Da Cui Yun, that had departed from China’s Jiangyin port, TOI had reported. Officials seized a massive pressure chamber described as a pipe-like object, 35-40 feet in length, now confirmed to have potential ballistic missile applications. Experts from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) joined a high-level investigation into the cargo, amid tight-lipped responses from customs due to the national security implications.Also read: ‘Suspicious’ Chinese ship seized at Kandla, under strict scrutiny The FATF report also highlighted the growing global risk from proliferation financing (PF), especially concerning state and non-state actors acquiring dual-use technologies for weapons of mass destruction (WMD). “The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related financing represents a significant threat to global security and the integrity of the international financial system,” the report warns, adding that failure to implement effective controls could allow actors to exploit weaknesses in global export and financial systems.","A new report from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has cited a case involving Pakistan’s missile development programme.

ISLAMABAD: In a bid to recalibrate Pakistan’s global narrative and bolster ties with Washington, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States, meeting senior American scholars, strategic experts, and international media representatives during an official visit to Washington DC, the Pakistani military said on Friday.In a carefully choreographed diplomatic offensive, Munir interacted with leading think tanks and policy institutions, offering what officials described as “Pakistan’s principled perspectives” on evolving regional and global dynamics. His engagements underscored Islamabad’s renewed focus on international outreach amid a shifting geopolitical landscape in South Asia.The army chief reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to regional stability, counterterrorism, and a rules-based global order, pitching the country as a responsible actor in an increasingly multipolar world.Munir spoke at length about Pakistan’s counter-terrorism strategy, highlighting military operations such as Maarka-e-Haqa and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. He reminded his audience of Pakistan’s role as a frontline state in the global war on terror, citing the “immense sacrifices” borne by its security forces and civilians.Without naming India, Munir warned against “regional actors using terrorism as an instrument of hybrid warfare” – a familiar refrain in Pakistan’s diplomatic lexicon referring to its neighbour.While not new, the accusation resurfacing in the US capital, signalling Pakistan’s intent to shape the security discourse in South Asia.Munir also showcased Pakistan’s economic aspirations. He pitched the country’s untapped potential in IT, agriculture, and mineral wealth, calling on global stakeholders to invest in these “engines of shared prosperity”.From foreign policy to economic diplomacy, Munir portrayed Pakistan as a country pursuing dialogue, diplomacy, and international law — an image Islamabad has been keen to project as it seeks to distance itself from past reputational baggage.Discussing Pakistan-US relations, Munir called for transforming the historical security-centric engagement into a multidimensional partnership grounded in strategic convergence and mutual respect. He acknowledged past cooperation on counterterrorism and economic development but pushed for a broader framework of engagement.According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, participants appreciated the candid nature of the discussions and acknowledged Pakistan’s efforts to maintain regional stability. The meetings were seen as a trust-building exercise amid evolving US priorities in the Indo-Pacific region and growing scepticism over Islamabad’s commitments.The visit comes at a time when Pakistan is striving to reset ties with major powers, especially after its recent economic crises and shifting regional alignments. With India drawing closer to the US and Afghanistan remaining volatile, Islamabad is attempting to reposition itself as an indispensable — if complicated — regional player.","Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States.

Trump Hosts Pakistan Army Chief Munir Alone At White House, Faces Fierce Criticism From Pentagon Vet





ISLAMABAD: The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz, with whispers of backroom deals that could reshape the balance of power in South Asia and far beyond.What began as a one-hour lunch in the Cabinet Room turned into a two-hour marathon meeting that continued in the Oval Office, attended by US secretary of state Marco Rubio, special representative Steve Witkoff, and Pakistan NSA and Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Asim Malik.The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) handout flags counter-terrorism, trade, and peace, but the real stakes — against the backdrop of Iran-Israel airstrikes and India-Pakistan tensions — reveal a high-wire act with far-reaching implications.Trump, channeling his trademark deal-maker bravado, now sees Pakistan as a strategic prize. As Israel intensifies strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites and Washington edges closer to military escalation, Pakistan’s shared border with Iran becomes critical. Sources say Trump privately pressured Munir for airspace access and intelligence on Tehran — leveraging Pakistan’s backchannel role as the host of Iran’s interests section for the US.In return, he offered advanced weaponry and economic incentives, aiming to lure Islamabad away from China’s orbit and Russia’s Brics alliance.Trump’s push to expand trade in critical minerals, cryptocurrency, AI, and energy is part of a broader strategy to anchor Pakistan within US-led markets and curb China’s regional influence. He has also claimed credit for defusing the May 2025 crisis between India and Pakistan.As Pakistan’s power broker, Munir brings serious leverage. His military’s fight against Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) syncs with US aims in Afghanistan. With ties to Iran and a shared border, Munir can offer covert intelligence or logistical support, though Pakistan’s pro-Iran rhetoric caps public alignment. Economically, he can unlock Pakistan’s mineral and tech potential for US investors, but treading too far risks Beijing’s wrath.On India, Munir’s role in brokering the May ceasefire – praised by President Trump – has been framed in Islamabad as a direct rebuttal of New Delhi’s allegations of Pakistani involvement in cross-border terrorism. With the country facing severe economic challenges, Munir is believed to have sought US military and financial assistance to modernise Pakistan’s armed forces and stabilise its economy. Trump’s openness to providing drones or missile defence systems could significantly alter the military balance with India. Munir also reportedly urged Trump to de-escalate growing tensions between Iran and Israel, warning of broader regional instability and citing Pakistan’s vocal alignment with Tehran. In a bold diplomatic gesture, Munir extended an invitation for Trump to visit Pakistan, an effort seen as central to reshaping bilateral ties and enhancing Islamabad’s global relevance.Timed amid Middle East turmoil and South Asian friction, the Trump-Munir summit is a geopolitical pivot. It signals a fragile US-Pakistan thaw, driven by Washington’s ally hunt and Pakistan’s economic crunch. For India, it’s a call to counter a US strategy cosying up to both rivals while eyeing Iran. Trump’s deal-making and Munir’s strategic charm aim to reposition Pakistan as a US cornerstone, potentially redrawing South Asia’s power map at India’s expense. Wednesday’s White House talks weren’t just diplomacy, they were a bold move in a high-stakes regional chess game.","The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz.

Footage captured the dramatic scene as the man was dragged off the aircraft, kicking and shouting, while airline staff tried to manage the situation, reported New York Post.The passenger allegedly complained about the lack of space in his window seat on a Thai Lion Air flight departing from Bangkok on Wednesday. He asked to be moved to an emergency exit seat after noticing it offered more legroom, but threw a major tantrum when flight attendants denied his request.The situation escalated to the point where authorities had to be called in to remove the disruptive passenger from the Boeing 737 aircraft.“At first, I thought we couldn’t take off because the man had fallen ill,” the passenger who filmed the video recalled, according to the New York Post. “It turned out he just thought the economy seat was too crowded and insisted on moving to the emergency exit.”Footage shows Thai police yanking the stubborn passenger, dressed in a bright orange Garfield shirt, out of his seat. In protest, he then lay down in the aisle, blocking it and prompting frustration from other passengers.“He is so f–king selfish,” shouted an irritated passenger, while another yelled at him to “get out of the way.”Eventually, police were able to carry the uncooperative passenger off the plane by his arms and legs.His disruptive behavior caused the flight to be delayed by a full hour before it finally took off from Don Mueang International Airport.","British tourist was forcibly removed from a plane in Thailand after reportedly insisting on an emergency exit seat to accommodate his larger frame.

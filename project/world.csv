Canada also gets 30-day tariff reprieve after fentanyl pledges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/us-canada-news/canada-also-gets-30-day-tariff-reprieve-after-fentanyl-pledges/articleshow/117933950.cms,"Canada secured a 30-day postponement in the application of US tariffs on its exports on Monday afternoon just hours before they were scheduled to go into effect after a call between Canadian PM Trudeau and President Trump yielded a border deal that seemed to satisfy both leaders.Trudeau had earlier pledged to retaliate against US tariffs by imposing tariffs against US goods, too. In the end, he seemed to make modest concessions to Trump on the border policies, including thousands of ""front-line'"" personnel stationed at the border.""I just had a good call with President Trump,"" Trudeau said in a social media post that laid out the terms of the agreement. ""Proposed tariffs will be paused for at least 30 days while we work together.""The deal brought relief and de-escalation into what had turned into a brewing trade war between the two close allies and top trading partners, although its 30-day horizon did indicate more negotiations might need to take place down the line.Specifically, Trudeau said that Canada would create a new position for a fentanyl czar and redouble its efforts to tackle the opioid crisis - one that kills Canadians daily - by listing cartels and gangs as terrorist entities, like Trump has said he wants to do in the US. Canada would commit 200 million Canadian dollars (about $139m) to fresh intelligence-gathering efforts around the fentanyl and drug trade, Trudeau said.He also said that as part of the agreement with Trump, Canada would continue to implement a new border-tightening plan that it had announced weeks earlier. That involves the expenditure of CA$1.3 billion in fresh funds over the next several years, the deployment of new technology at the borders and the deployment of more border guards. ""Nearly 10,000 front-line personnel are and will be working on protecting the border,"" Trudeau said.The postponement brought relief to several Canadian industries that were facing severe disruptions if the tariffs had come into effect just after midnight Tuesday. nyt",Canada secured a 30-day postponement in the application of US tariffs on its exports on Monday afternoon just hours before they were scheduled to go into effect.

Elon Musk's blitz shakes US govt as he sweeps through agencies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musks-blitz-shakes-us-govt-as-he-sweeps-through-agencies/articleshow/117933618.cms,"In Elon Musk 's first two weeks in govt, his lieutenants gained access to closely held financial and data systems, casting aside career officials who warned that they were defying protocols. They moved swiftly to shutter specific programmes - and even an entire agency that had come into Musk's cross hairs. They bombarded federal employees with messages suggesting they were lazy and encouraging them to leave their jobs. Empowered by President Donald Trump, Musk is waging a largely unchecked war against the federal bureaucracy - one that has already had far-reaching consequences.Musk's aggressive incursions into at least half a dozen govt agencies have challenged congressional authority and potentially breached civil service protections. Top officials at the treasury department and the US Agency for International Development who objected to the actions of his representatives were swiftly pushed aside. And Musk's efforts to shut down USAID , a key source of foreign assistance, have reverberated around the globe.Musk, the world's richest man, is sweeping through the federal govt as a singular force, creating major upheaval as he looks to put an ideological stamp on the bureaucracy and rid the system of those who he and the president deride as ""the deep state"". The rapid moves by Musk, who has a multitude of financial interests before the govt, have represented an extraordinary flexing of power by a private individual. The speed and scale have shocked civil servants. Senior White House staff members have at times also found themselves in the dark, according to two officials. One Trump official, who was not authorised to speak publicly, said Musk was widely seen as operating with a level of autonomy that almost no one can control.Musk, the leader of SpaceX , Tesla and X, is working with a frantic, around-the-clock energy familiar to the employees at his various companies, flanked by a cadre of young engineers, drawn in part from Silicon Valley. ""He's a big cost-cutter,"" Trump told reporters Sunday. ""Sometimes we won't agree with it and we'll not go where he wants to go. But I think he's doing a great job. He's a smart guy.""There is no precedent for a govt official to have Musk's scale of conflicts of interest, which include domestic holdings and foreign connections such as business relationships in China. And there is no precedent for someone who is not a full-time employee to have such ability to reshape the federal workforce. Historian Douglas Brinkley described Musk as a ""lone ranger"" with limitless running room. He said the billionaire was operating ""beyond scrutiny"". ""It's a harbinger of destruction of our basic institutions.""Several former and current senior govt officials - even those who like what he is doing - expressed a sense of helplessness about how to handle Musk's level of unaccountability. The president has given Musk vast power over the bureaucracy that regulates his companies and awards them contracts. He is shaping not just policy but personnel decisions, including successfully pushing for Trump to pick Troy Meink as the Air Force secretary, three sources said. Meink previously ran the Pentagon's National Reconnaissance Office, which helped Musk secure a multibillion-dollar contract for SpaceX to help build and deploy a spy satellite network for the federal govt.Musk's actions have alarmed Democrats and watchdog groups. At least four lawsuits have been filed in federal court to challenge his authority. Democrats on Monday said they would introduce legislation to try to bar Musk's deputies from entering the treasury system. In private conversations, Musk has told friends that he considers the ultimate metric for his success to be the number of dollars saved per day. ""The more I have gotten to know President Trump, the more I like him. Frankly, I love the guy,"" Musk said in a live audio conversation on X. ""This is our shot. This is the best hand of cards we're ever going to have.""","Musk's aggressive incursions into at least half a dozen govt agencies have challenged congressional authority and potentially breached civil service protections.

US Senate confirms Trump loyalist Pam Bondi as attorney general,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-senate-confirms-trump-loyalist-pam-bondi-as-attorney-general/articleshow/117932532.cms,"Pam Bondi. (AP)

BREAKING: Pam Bondi confirmed as US attorney general

The US Senate confirmed Pam Bondi as attorney general on Tuesday evening. Bondi, a longtime ally of American President Donald Trump, will lead the Justice Department following the removal of career employees seen as disloyal to the Republican administration.The confirmation vote was mostly along party lines, with only one Democrat, Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, joining all Republicans to approve her nomination in a 54-46 vote.Republicans have supported Bondi, saying she will refocus the Justice Department on its main responsibilities.“Pam Bondi has promised to get the department back to its core mission: prosecuting crime and protecting Americans from threats to their safety and their freedoms,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.Bondi, a former Florida attorney general and corporate lobbyist, is expected to oversee major changes in the department, which had pursued criminal cases against Trump. She will also oversee the FBI , which has been under scrutiny due to its role in investigations related to Trump.Bondi’s close ties to Trump have raised concerns among Democrats. Trump previously removed an FBI director who refused to pledge loyalty and replaced an attorney general who recused himself from the Russia investigation.At her confirmation hearing, Bondi assured lawmakers that politics would not influence her decisions but did not rule out investigations into Trump’s political opponents. She also repeated Trump’s claim that the Justice Department had been used unfairly against him.Senator Peter Welch, D-Vt., acknowledged Bondi’s qualifications but expressed concern about Trump’s expectations.“That clearly is a loyalty oath to him as opposed to a demand for straightforward, candid advice, including if the president is asking for something to be done like the prosecution of a political adversary,” Welch said.The confirmation vote took place hours after FBI agents sued the Justice Department over efforts to identify employees involved in the January 6 prosecutions. The agents fear this could lead to mass firings.At her confirmation hearing, Bondi said that she would not pursue cases for political reasons and that her duty was to the public, not the president. However, some of her comments were similar to Trump’s views on the justice system.“They targeted Donald Trump,” Bondi told lawmakers. “They went after him—actually starting back in 2016, they targeted his campaign. They have launched countless investigations against him.” She added, “If I am attorney general, I will not politicize that office.”Trump nominated Bondi after former Representative Matt Gaetz failed to secure enough Republican support for confirmation.Bondi has been a strong public defender of Trump and previously suggested that Justice Department prosecutors would be investigated under his administration.“The investigators will be investigated,” she said in a 2023 Fox News appearance.","Pam Bondi, a longtime ally of American President Donald Trump, will lead the Justice Department.

'His Highness'

'Extraordinary man'

Prince Karim Al-Hussaini , known as Aga Khan IV , has passed away at the age of 88. He was a well-known spiritual leader of millions of Ismaili Muslims and a prominent figure in philanthropy and business.Khan died on Tuesday in Portugal, surrounded by family, according to a statement from the Aga Khan Development Network and the Ismaili religious community.His burial will take place in Lisbon. His successor has been named in his will, which will be read in the presence of family and religious leaders before the name is made public.Aga Khan IV was born on 13 December 1936 in Creux-de-Genthod, Switzerland, and became the 49th hereditary Imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims in 1957 at the age of 20 while he was an undergraduate at Harvard University. His grandfather, Aga Khan III, chose him over his father, Aly Khan, saying that the community should be led by someone “who has been brought up in the midst of the new age.”Under Khan's leadership, the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) expanded its work in healthcare , education, housing, and rural development across more than 30 countries, with an annual budget of around $1 billion. Hospitals and schools named after him now operate in countries like Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan.“We have no notion of the accumulation of wealth being evil,” Khan told Vanity Fair in 2012. “The Islamic ethic is that if God has given you the capacity or good fortune to be a privileged individual in society, you have a moral responsibility to society,"" he added.The Ismailis, a sect with roots in India that has spread across Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East, give up to 12.5% of their income as a religious duty. His wealth was estimated to be in the billions.Aga Khan IV was also known for encouraging dialogue between Muslim societies and the West. While he mostly stayed out of politics, he remained an influential figure. In 1957, Queen Elizabeth II granted him the title “His Highness.”""Few persons bridge so many divides — between the spiritual and the material; East and West; Muslim and Christian — as gracefully as he does,"" Vanity Fair wrote in its 2013 article praising Khan.He supported Islamic culture through architecture and the arts, creating the Aga Khan Award for Architecture and helping restore historic Islamic sites worldwide. He was also known for his interest in horse racing.Khan lived in France for much of his life before moving to Portugal in recent years, where he continued to oversee his philanthropic and development projects.His death brought tributes from around the world. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called him “an extraordinary man of vision, faith, and generosity” and “a very good friend.”UN secretary-general António Guterres took to X to give his tribute, calling Khan ""a symbol of peace, tolerance and compassion in our troubled world.""Aga Khan IV is survived by three sons, a daughter, and several grandchildren. His successor will be announced following the reading of his will.","Prince Karim Al-Hussaini, known as Aga Khan IV, has passed away at the age of 88.

US to impose maximum pressure on Tehran: Donald Trump instructs advisors to 'obliterate' Iran if it assassinates him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-to-impose-maximum-pressure-on-tehran-donald-trump-instructs-advisors-to-obliterate-iran-if-it-assassinates-him/articleshow/117931802.cms,"US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he signs executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, February 4, 2025, in Washington. (AP)

Trump instructs to 'obliterate' Iran

Trump says he left 'instructions' for Iran to be 'obliterated' if it assassinates him

US President Donald Trump reinstated his ""maximum pressure"" campaign on Iran on Tuesday, using a visit from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to announce new economic measures aimed at pressuring Iran into concessions, including giving up its nuclear program.The White House did not immediately release details of the executive order, so its exact terms remain unclear. Trump, who has previously expressed interest in negotiations with Iran, said he was hesitant to sign it.""So this is one I'm torn about,"" he told reporters. ""Everyone wants me to sign it. I'll do that."" He added, ""We have to be strong and firm, and I hope that it's not going to have to be used in any great measure at all.""Trump suggested Iran could negotiate a new agreement, which would likely include restrictions on its support for groups like Hezbollah and Hamas.Trump also said he has given his advisers instructions to respond forcefully if Iran assassinates him.""If they did that, they would be obliterated,"" Trump said while signing the executive order. ""I’ve left instructions if they do it, they get obliterated, there won’t be anything left.""Federal authorities have been tracking Iranian threats against Trump and other administration officials for years.In 2020, Trump ordered the killing of Qassem Soleimani , who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force.It is uncertain if the new pressure campaign will succeed. Trump also pursued maximum pressure in 2018 after withdrawing the US from the nuclear deal Iran had signed with the Obama administration in 2015. While Trump considers that decision a success, many analysts argue it had the opposite effect. European countries did not support the approach, and Iran eventually left the agreement, advancing its nuclear program.In recent years, Iran has resumed large-scale uranium enrichment. Inspectors and experts estimate that Iran now has enough uranium, enriched just below bomb-grade, to produce at least four weapons.Trump's executive order on Tuesday included measures to block Iranian oil shipments, many of which go to China. China has not followed US sanctions, and Trump has accused President Joe Biden of allowing Iran to bypass existing restrictions.","US President Donald Trump reinstated his ""maximum pressure"" campaign on Iran on Tuesday.

(Picture credit: AP)

The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed on Tuesday that an Army Black Hawk helicopter involved in a mid-air collision with an American Airlines flight on January 29, near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport , was flying above its designated altitude limit.Salvage crews have recovered the bodies of all 67 victims, officials confirmed. All but one of the bodies have been identified, according to a statement from various government agencies involved in the recovery effort.The agencies described the completion of the search for remains as a ""significant step"" toward bringing closure to the families of those who died in the accident.""Our hearts are with the victims' families as they navigate this tragic loss,"" the statement said. ""We extend our deepest condolences and remain committed to supporting them through this difficult time.""According to NTSB data, the helicopter was recorded at 300 feet, while the maximum allowable altitude for helicopters in the region is 200 feet. The air traffic control radar data, rounded to the nearest 100 feet, showed the helicopter could have been flying anywhere from 251 feet to 349 feet.The tragic crash claimed the lives of 67 individuals, including all 60 passengers and 7 crew members aboard the American Airlines Bombardier CRJ700 jet , which was cleared for landing at Reagan National Airport at the time of the collision. The plane’s black box data revealed that the jet was flying at 325 feet and that the pilots made an effort to pull up to avoid the crash moments before impact.The helicopter was part of a military training mission aimed at re-qualifying pilots for future flights in the area. However, the crash's circumstances raise questions about why the Black Hawk was operating at such a high altitude in a controlled airspace typically used by commercial planes.As per the Associated Press (AP), the NTSB has noted that investigators are still waiting to retrieve more information from the submerged helicopter to verify the exact altitude.The wreckage from both aircraft is being recovered from the Potomac River, with authorities reporting that they have already retrieved significant parts of the plane, including the right wing, center fuselage, part of the left wing, tail cone, and rudder, as per Fox News. Crews continue working to recover the remaining wreckage of the passenger plane from the frigid waters before shifting focus to retrieving the Black Hawk helicopter.A joint search and recovery operation, led by agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, has been working under challenging conditions to recover all necessary wreckage.The NTSB continues to investigate the incident, and though full investigations typically take longer, they anticipate a preliminary report within the next 30 days.The crash is the deadliest in the US in over two decades, surpassing the 2001 crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in New York, which killed 265 people. The victims included 60 passengers on the American Airlines flight, with some being figure skaters returning from the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships.The Black Hawk helicopter carried three soldiers, all of whom were also killed in the crash.","The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed on Tuesday that an Army Black Hawk helicopter involved in a mid-air collision with an American Airlines flight on January 29 was flying above its designated altitude limit.

Dubai has been long celebrated as a global retail haven, and is now making waves in the world of artificial intelligence (AI). Known for its expansive malls and top-tier brands, the city is seamlessly blending tradition with technology to reshape how consumers shop, interact with brands, and experience retail.Behind the luxurious displays and bespoke offerings lies a layer of AI-powered innovation that’s redefining personalisation, streamlining operations, and enhancing customer satisfaction. From designing jewellery to curating personalised shopping experiences, Dubai is setting new benchmarks in the global retail landscape.In today’s retail environment, customers seek experiences that resonate on a personal level. AI has emerged as the linchpin of this transformation. Amreen Iqbal , Founder and Creative Director of Piece of You, a custom jewellery brand in Dubai, emphasises the depth of this shift: “It’s about understanding the customer deeper—what they want, how they want it, and how we can make it special and unique to each customer. AI helps us do that.”Her brand employs AI-powered tools to enable customers to design unique jewellery pieces through virtual try-ons and bespoke customisation. “The ability to personalise jewellery at this level was unthinkable a few years ago. Now, with AI, it’s a reality,” she adds.Similarly, global e-commerce innovations have gained traction in Dubai. Sue Azari , an e-commerce consultant at, notes, “AI enables highly customised and intuitive customer experiences.”She cites Zalando’s AI-powered chatbot as a perfect example: “If you need an outfit for a Christmas party, you simply describe your needs, and the chatbot curates a complete look, including accessories. It’s like having a personal shopper who knows your wardrobe.”In the beauty sector, major players like Sephora are redefining the customer journey with AI. Through augmented reality (AR) and AI features, their app enables users to virtually try on products like lipstick shades while integrating seamless social sharing options. Azari explains, “It’s about creating an experience, not just a transaction.”Walid BenOthman, Managing Director at Bitpanda, in Dubai, added that AI-driven personalisation has created a 25% improvement in customer satisfaction, revenue, or cost reduction. “Additionally, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants provide 24/7 customer support, improving engagement and customer satisfaction.”He explained AI has made it easy to bring in hyper-personalised advertisements by analysing customer behaviour, creating more effective campaigns and higher conversion rates.Adding to Dubai’s retail innovation is the launch of theat Dubai Mall, as reported. The AI-powered store enhances the telecom retail experience by offering an array of cutting-edge features. Using AI and robotics, customers can explore products, make payments, and even collect purchases from automated lockers.The store is equipped with advanced facial recognition technology, enabling personalised interactions and tailored product suggestions. It epitomises Dubai’s vision to merge physical retail with AI-driven efficiency. As highlighted in several news reports, this initiative underscores Dubai’s commitment to revolutionising traditional retail through technology. report by GoGlobe has highlighted that Dubai AI’s impact extends beyond personalisation, revolutionising how brands market their products. Generative AI (genAI) has emerged as a game-changer, enabling dynamic, hyper-personalised advertisements and streamlining content creation.“AI doesn’t just generate content; it analyses performance metrics to refine strategies in real-time. It saves marketers countless hours and ensures campaigns are efficient and impactful,” explains Azari.Iqbal highlights AI’s ability to enhance marketing precision through predictive analytics, helping businesses target audiences with unparalleled accuracy. From creating dynamic ads to optimising email campaigns, AI ensures that every touchpoint is relevant and impactful.At Amazon, for instance, AI-generated product descriptions have not only increased efficiency but also improved SEO performance and consistency. “This is not just automation; it’s about making marketing smarter and more strategic,” notes Azari.While customers benefit from AI-driven personalisation, its operational applications are equally transformative. Gavin Jackson, Senior Vice President of Data and AI at Endava, highlights the role of AI in inventory management: “AI has turned inventory management into a science. Retailers can now accurately predict demand, ensuring shelves are stocked without over-ordering. It’s a win for both businesses and consumers.”Jackson explains that AI-powered systems can even trigger additional production when products start selling out, ensuring businesses never miss a sales opportunity. Logistics and supply chains are also undergoing an AI-driven revolution, with systems optimising delivery routes, warehouse layouts, and energy consumption. “It’s about creating an interconnected ecosystem where every touchpoint is as efficient as possible,” he adds.Dubai’s embrace of AI is propelling the city into a new era of retail excellence. By integrating advanced technologies across personalisation, marketing, and operations, the city is not only enhancing customer experiences but also setting a global standard for innovation in retail.As Iqbal aptly puts it, “The ability to create personalised, meaningful experiences isn’t just a luxury—it’s a necessity. And AI makes it possible.”Dubai’s commitment to leveraging AI ensures that its reputation as a global retail hub remains stronger than ever, firmly rooted in innovation and customer-centricity.","Dubai is blending tradition with technology to reshape how consumers shop, interact with brands, and experience retail.

What we know about Rebecca Lobach



Was her name kept a secret?

The name of Rebecca Lobach , the third pilot of the military Blackhawk that crashed with an American Airlines plane, was not released until yesterday while identities of the other two pilots were revealed earlier. There was no survivor in the deadly crash as the remnants of both aircraft fell onto the frozen Potomac River. The reason of the unusual mid-air crash is still unknown while minutes before the crash the military helicopter was warned about the passenger plane.After President Donald Trump blamed the DEI (diversity, equity, inclusivity) hiring policy (of the military) behind the mishap, the Blackhawk pilots came on the radar.Social media users claimed that Rebecca Lobach's identity was withheld because her social media accounts were being deleted. ""They deleted Rebecca Lobach’s social media accounts before releasing her name. It wasn’t to grieve,"" one wrote. ""They didn't withhold Rebecca Lobach's name to ""grieve"", they kept it secret while they scrubbed her social media,"" another wrote.Right-wing commentator and conspiracy theorist Laura Lommer said Rebecca Lobach was a Biden aide who attended Pride events. ""So yes, DEI was very much involved in this crash. Trump was right,"" Loomer wrote hinting that Lobach was a lesbian.""PART TIME Blackhawk pilot, Capt. Rebecca Lobach, was the name being withheld.

A power couple in the making

Together, they represent a new breed of conservative power couple—one that blends politics, media, and entertainment.

All eyes weren’t just on Kash Patel at his Senate confirmation hearing last week—his glamorous companion in the front row stole the show. Seated behind the former Trump administration official, the mystery woman was soon identified as Alexis Wilkins , a rising country music star , conservative advocate , and now, a Capitol Hill press secretary . With a love story that blends politics, music, and activism, this couple is making headlines for more than just their romance.Patel, 44, and Wilkins, 26, first crossed paths at the ReAwaken America Tour in October 2022, a conservative event known for drawing high-profile right-wing figures. Their mutual passion for patriotism and conservative values sparked an instant connection, and by early 2023, they were officially dating. Now, with Patel potentially heading for a major role in Washington, DC, and Wilkins taking on a new position as press secretary for Rep. Abe Hamadeh (R-Ariz.), the couple is gearing up for a life in politics together.Wilkins is no political newcomer—she’s been shaping her own influence for years. A Nashville-based country singer and songwriter, Wilkins has built a career that fuses music, activism, and conservative values.Born in Arkansas, Wilkins spent part of her childhood in England and Switzerland before returning to the US, where she fell in love with country music and the American way of life. She attended Belmont University, one of the country’s top music business schools, and graduated with honors, majoring in business and political science.Her resume boasts prestigious accolades, including the Williams-Murray Writing Award, the Economic Critical Thinking Award, and a spot on Belmont’s Ethics Debate Team—proof that she’s just as sharp in policy discussions as she is on stage.Wilkins made her mark in country music with her debut single, Stand, a patriotic anthem dedicated to veterans that soared into the top ten on iTunes with over 1,000,000 streams. Her music, often infused with themes of American pride, has earned her spots performing alongside country icons like Lee Greenwood, Sara Evans, and Joe Nichols.Her commitment to veterans extends beyond lyrics—she actively collaborates with organizations like Warrior Rounds, Operation Standdown, and Soldier’s Child, using her platform to support military causes. She even pioneered the first live virtual performance program for VA hospital patients, bringing music to those who need it most.Beyond music, Wilkins has positioned herself as a. She’s been a featured speaker at Young America’s Foundation events, appeared at the Reagan Ranch in California, and partnered with PragerU as a media personality.Her podcast, Between the Headlines, airs on Rumble, a platform embraced by conservatives for its anti-censorship stance. And in true Second Amendment fashion, she’s a part of the NRA Country program, which promotes gun rights through country music.Wilkins’ latest move into politics solidifies her status as more than just a performer. As, she’s officially stepping into the world of Washington power players. Though she plans to balance her time between DC and Nashville, it’s clear she’s embracing her new role as a political insider.Patel, a former Trump administration official with growing influence in Republican circles, has found a partner who matches his ambition.Wilkins’ influence continues to expand, whether through music, activism, or her new role on the Hill. And with Patel by her side, the two are set to make waves in both Washington and Nashville. Whether she’s performing for veterans, speaking at conservative events, or strategizing behind the scenes, Alexis Wilkins is proving she’s much more than Kash Patel’s mystery woman—she’s a rising force in her own right.","Alexis Wilkins is a rising country music star, conservative advocate, and now, a Capitol Hill press secretary.

Santorini earthquakes: Greek island Santorini on alert after seismic activity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/over-200-undersea-earthquakes-hit-greeces-santorini-authorities-on-high-alert/articleshow/117883527.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Authorities have stepped up precautions on the volcanic island of Santorini, Greece, following a spike in seismic activity that has raised concerns about a potentially powerful earthquake. As of Monday, more than 200 undersea earthquakes were recorded over the past three days in the Aegean Sea, prompting the government to close schools and send emergency crews to the island.Several nearby islands, including Amorgos, Anafi, and Ios, have also been affected, with schools closed and evacuation protocols in place for residents. Authorities are urging residents to remain vigilant and adhere to safety measures to minimize risk.The earthquakes, with magnitudes up to 4.8, have been ongoing, with the strongest occurring on Sunday afternoon between Santorini and the nearby island of Amorgos, measuring 4.6 in magnitude, as reported by AFP.While experts state the tremors are not related to Santorini’s volcano, the frequency and intensity of the quakes have left residents anxious. Local resident Michalis Gerontakis, director of the Santorini Philharmonic Orchestra, expressed his concern, noting that while the orchestra performed amid the quakes, the constant shaking made the community uneasy. “You cannot contend with nature,” Gerontakis remarked, as quoted by AP.Despite the fear among locals, experts such as Efthymios Lekkas, president of the Organisation of Antiseismic Planning and Protection, have reassured that while a 5.5 magnitude quake could be possible, a quake above magnitude six is not expected.However, Gerasimos Papadopoulos, a prominent Greek seismologist, cautioned that the current earthquake sequence could indicate the potential for a larger event, especially as the tremors continue to intensify and shift toward the northeast.In response to the ongoing seismic threat, authorities have advised Santorini's residents and visitors to avoid large indoor gatherings and steer clear of areas prone to rock slides, such as certain ports and swimming pools.Emergency teams, including firefighters and rescue personnel, have been dispatched to assist, with temporary shelters set up for displaced families.As the potential danger looms, some locals opted to sleep outdoors or leave the island by ferry and plane in response to the tremors.Santorini, a major tourist destination known for its stunning views and whitewashed villages, draws millions of visitors each year.With 3.4 million tourists in 2023 alone, concerns about over-tourism have resurfaced, especially given the island’s limited capacity to handle large-scale evacuations in the event of a disaster.","More than 200 undersea earthquakes have been recorded over the past three days in the Aegean Sea, prompting the government to close schools and send emergency crews to the island.

The recent reports published by Forbes highlight the world's most powerful countries in 2025. The United States ranks at the top followed by China, and at the tenth rank stands Israel. However, the surprise was all over that it missed the list of the superpowers in Asia: India. Though India has the fifth-largest economy, the fourth-largest military and a population surpassing all three combined, the country still can only manage the number 12 slot.The rankings are made considering five critical factors- leadership, economic influence, political power, great international alliances and military strength. This ranking method has been developed by BAV Group researchers led by Professor David Reibstein of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, and associated with US News & World Report.It stands at the top rank with a GDP of $30.34 trillion. It is pointed out as the country with the largest economy, unbeatable military power, and biggest network of overseas alliances. From this aspect, the United States has been placed at the top among the three leading powers in economic, political, and military strengths and has emerged as the world's greatest superpower.China has a GDP of $19.53 trillion and, therefore, is the second strongest country in the world. Its population is humongous at 141.9 crores, hence giving this nation enormous economic as well as military power. This nation is becoming increasingly dominant globally as well as economically besides wielding military might. Despite facing a few tussles with other countries, this powerful nation can still influence geopolitics with ease.The economic size of Russia is $2.2 trillion, way smaller than the US and China, but its army power makes it the third most powerful country in the world. Russia plays an extremely important role in global security matters, and in geopolitical events which bring it up as important in global power politics.The UK and Germany are world powers in both the economy and politics of Europe. The UK possesses a $3.73 trillion GDP and a $4.92 trillion economy, and due to its power in politics and military and in the economic front, Germany upholds the supremacy of the globe.Due to the combination of economic power, technological advancement, and military strength, South Korea is a superpower at $1.95 trillion, France at $3.28 trillion, and Japan at $4.39 trillion. These countries possess a strong regional influence and play a significant role in international trade, foreign policy, and security.Saudi Arabia ranks ninth, with a GDP of $1.14 trillion. As the superpower oil producer, it enjoys much economic power, and strategic alliances and military presence in the Middle East guarantee it a place in world geopolitics.With an economy standing at $550.91 billion, Israel ranks tenth with respect to the country's military power, technological research breakthroughs, and geopolitical positioning in the region.India stands at position 12 among the world’s powerful countries highlighted in the rankings shared by Forbes. However, it does not make the top 10 countries with a GDP of $5.5 trillion. India has emerged as the world's fifth-largest economy with a very powerful military. All of this-political outreach for India, increasing international interactions, and further voice in global affairs-would paint a picture that would make the country emerge as one which could also play more meaningfully in the near future.","The recent reports published by Forbes highlight the world's most powerful countries in 2025.

US treasury says Elon Musk's DOGE team has 'read only' access to payments data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-treasury-says-elon-musks-doge-team-has-read-only-access-to-payments-data/articleshow/117931684.cms,"People protest during a rally against Elon Musk outside the Treasury Department in Washington, Tuesday, February 4, 2025. (AP)

The US Treasury said on Tuesday that Elon Musk ’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team can view data from its payment system but cannot make changes. This statement came after Democratic lawmakers raised concerns and called for an investigation.Musk is leading US President Donald Trump’s federal cost-cutting efforts under the DOGE. As part of this effort, he reportedly pushed for a team led by IT executive Tom Krause to have access to the Treasury’s payment system, which processes transactions like Social Security, Medicare payouts, and federal salaries.As per the news agency AFP, Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden sent a letter to the congressional watchdog agency, asking for an investigation into reports that treasury secretary Scott Bessent personally approved access for Musk and his team.In a letter to Congress, the Treasury confirmed that Krause’s team has access to the system but only in a ""read-only"" capacity for an operational efficiency assessment. The Treasury said this is ""similar to the kind of access that Treasury provides to individuals reviewing Treasury systems, such as auditors.""Musk’s cost-cutting plan has faced opposition from Democratic lawmakers, who have raised legal and ethical concerns.In a separate letter to Trump, other Democratic policymakers voiced concerns about DOGE’s work related to government data and facilities.Labour unions and a grassroots advocacy group have also objected. They filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge to declare it illegal for Musk or DOGE to access taxpayer information and to block the Treasury from allowing it.On X, the social media platform he owns, Musk said Monday that the ""only way to stop fraud and waste of taxpayer money is to follow the payment flows and pause suspicious transactions for review.""According to the lawsuit, Bessent approved Musk’s access after a career official refused and was placed on administrative leave. The official later retired.","Musk is leading US President Donald Trump’s federal cost-cutting efforts under the DOGE.

Trump wants US to ‘take over’ Gaza Strip: New paradigm or unworkable fantasy?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-us-take-over-of-gaza-strip-israel-palestinian-conflict-benjamin-netanyahu/articleshow/117932659.cms,"Driving the news

At a press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Trump suggested that Palestinians in Gaza should be permanently resettled in neighboring Arab countries while the US leads reconstruction efforts.

, Trump suggested that Palestinians in Gaza should be permanently resettled in neighboring Arab countries while the US leads reconstruction efforts. His remarks, made at a White House press event, stunned observers both in the US and internationally. Trump not only insisted that the US could take control of Gaza but also refused to rule out deploying American troops ""if necessary"" to enforce this vision. He described Gaza as a ""demolition site"" that should be cleared and redeveloped, adding that he sees a ""long-term ownership position"" for the US in the region.

This latest proposal follows a series of radical foreign policy statements from Trump, who in the past has floated the idea of buying Greenland, warned Panama over control of the canal, and even joked about Canada becoming the 51st US state.

But his statements on Gaza have been met with immediate condemnation, with critics warning that forcibly relocating its population could amount to ethnic cleansing and violate international law.

Why it matters

Trump’s proposal represents an extraordinary break from traditional US policy, which has historically supported a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For decades, US administrations—both Republican and Democratic—have sought to balance support for Israel’s security with diplomatic efforts to establish a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank.

If implemented, Trump's plan would likely shatter any remaining hopes for Palestinian sovereignty, further alienate Washington’s Arab allies, and increase tensions in the already volatile Middle East.

Beyond the foreign policy implications, the proposal could also have significant domestic political consequences. Trump’s remarks forced his Republican allies to once again defend or downplay his controversial rhetoric, while Democrats quickly condemned the idea as reckless and dangerous. The statement also diverted attention from other pressing political issues, including President Joe Biden’s handling of the ongoing conflict and US military support for Israel.

What they're saying

Netanyahu : “It’s worth paying attention to this … something that could change history.”

: “It’s worth paying attention to this … something that could change history.” Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri: He denounced the proposal as an ""expulsion from their land,"" warning. ""We consider them a recipe for generating chaos and tension in the region because the people of Gaza will not allow such plans to pass.""

""We consider them a recipe for generating chaos and tension in the region because the people of Gaza will not allow such plans to pass."" Democratic US Senator Chris Murphy strongly criticized the idea on X, saying: ""He's totally lost it. A US invasion of Gaza would lead to the slaughter of thousands of US troops and decades of war in the Middle East. It’s like a bad, sick joke.""

Referring to Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, he added: “They want to turn this into resorts.” Jon Alterman, head of Middle East Program at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies, questioned whether Gazans would even consider leaving, given their historical ties to the land: ""Many Gazans descended from Palestinians who fled parts of present-day Israel and have never been able to return to their previous homes. I’m skeptical many would be willing to leave even a shattered Gaza.""

The US will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too. We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs … level the site … and create thousands and thousands of jobs.” Donald Trump

A new paradigm or an unworkable fantasy?

Zoom in: Trump’s real estate vision for Gaza

One of the more bizarre aspects of Trump’s remarks was his claim that Gaza, if rebuilt, could become a tourist and business hub akin to “ the Riviera of the Middle East . ”

” Trump : “This could be something that could be so valuable, this could be so magnificent.”

: “This could be something that could be so valuable, this could be so magnificent.” On redevelopment : “We’ll make sure that it’s done world-class … It’ll be wonderful for the people—Palestinians, Palestinians mostly, we’re talking about.”

: “We’ll make sure that it’s done world-class … It’ll be wonderful for the people—Palestinians, Palestinians mostly, we’re talking about.” Trump’s background as a real estate developer has often shaped his approach to geopolitics, leading him to frame complex diplomatic challenges in terms of property deals and economic development.

However, critics argue that his real estate vision ignores the deep political, historical, and security complexities of Gaza.

While economic revitalization of Gaza is essential for long-term peace, achieving it would require diplomatic cooperation, security guarantees, and buy-in from the Palestinian population—none of which Trump has addressed.

The bottom line

President Donald Trump has proposed that the United States ""take over"" and ""own"" the Gaza Strip, arguing that the region should be completely rebuilt and transformed into an economic hub.Trump’s comments have sparked immediate reactions from key political figures, world leaders, and human rights groups.Trump’s foreign policy has long been defined by maximalist proposals that disrupt conventional diplomatic norms. In his first term, he recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, moved the US embassy there, and brokered the Abraham Accords, normalizing relations between Israel and several Arab states. While some dismissed Tuesday’s announcement as another of Trump’s signature hyperbolic provocations, others warned that it reflects a growing shift in US political discourse toward openly discussing Palestinian displacement.Trump’s vision for Gaza raises more questions than answers. His comments raise immediate logistical and legal questions: How would the US claim sovereignty over Gaza? Who would govern it? What security force would oversee its redevelopment? Would any international body recognize such a move?Yet, in typical Trumpian fashion, the US president seemed unfazed by the details. “Everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land,” he insisted. “We’ll make sure it’s done world class.”Also read: US to 'take over' Gaza; Netanyahu hails Trump as 'greatest friend' of Israel His call for resettling Palestinians echoes the long-held stance of Israel’s far-right politicians, who argue that Gaza’s population should be relocated to neighboring Arab states. However, Egypt and Jordan—two countries already hosting large Palestinian refugee populations—have repeatedly rejected such proposals.The idea of a US military presence in Gaza is also highly controversial. Successive US administrations, including Trump’s own during his first term, have avoided direct military involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict beyond diplomatic and financial support. Deploying US troops to Gaza would not only be a dramatic escalation but could also provoke armed resistance from Palestinian factions and further destabilize the region.Trump’s assertion that regional leaders ""love the idea"" of the US taking control of Gaza has also been met with skepticism. While Netanyahu praised Trump for his ""outside-the-box thinking,"" no Arab leader has publicly endorsed the proposal.Trump’s proposal faces immense hurdles, both legally and diplomatically. Key factors to watch in the coming weeks include:: Republican leaders have largely stayed quiet or downplayed the comments, but divisions could emerge over the idea of a US military presence in Gaza. Democrats have already started condemning the plan, with some warning it could damage US credibility abroad.Countries like Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia have historically rejected any forced displacement of Palestinians. Any serious push for this proposal could severely strain US relations with these key allies.Netanyahu’s embrace of Trump’s ideas could deepen divisions between the Israeli government and the Biden administration. Israel’s far-right factions may push to capitalize on Trump’s rhetoric, making it harder for moderate Israeli voices to advocate for a long-term diplomatic resolution.With Gaza already devastated by war, the focus has been on ceasefire negotiations and humanitarian aid. Trump’s comments could further complicate efforts to secure long-term peace and stability.Trump’s proposal to take over Gaza and resettle its Palestinian population is one of his most radical foreign policy ideas yet. While it aligns with Israel’s far right, it is almost certain to face opposition from US allies, international legal experts, and the Palestinian population itself.His suggestion of a US military role in enforcing the plan raises the stakes even higher, setting up a potential flashpoint in an already volatile region. Whether this is another instance of Trump making extreme statements to shift the debate—or an actual policy he would try to implement—remains to be seen.(With inputs from agencies)","Donald Trump suggested that Palestinians in Gaza should be permanently resettled in neighboring Arab countries while the US leads reconstruction efforts.

"PM Modi, Donald Trump likely to relaunch talks for trade agreement",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pm-modi-donald-trump-likely-to-relaunch-talks-for-trade-agreement/articleshow/117933053.cms,"NEW DELHI: The result of the assembly election could have a telling effect on the seat share of AAP and BJP in MCD as both the parties have nominated several sitting councillors, who, if they win, will have to resign from the civic body.The seat difference bewteen AAP and BJP in the MCD is 2 - AAP has 122 councillors, and BJ. In the 2022 MCD elections, AAP won 134 of the 250 seats, BJP 104, and Congress 9. Three seats went to independents.MCD is also expected to hold its mayoral election in April. AAP won the previous election by a slim margin of three votes, which was attributed to cross-voting. In such a scenario, the performance of the sitting councillors who have got assembly election tickets will become crucial in determining which party will secure the majority in the corporation.For the assembly election, BJP has nominated 12 sitting councillors and two aldermen. AAP has nominated seven councillors, including the leader of the house in MCD, Mukesh Goyal, from the Adarsh Nagar assembly constituency, and former deputy mayor Aaley Mohammad Iqbal from Matia Mahal. Congress has given a ticket to councillor Ariba Khan from the Okhla assembly constituency.The aldermen, who are experts from various fields, cannot vote in the mayoral election.One seat in the MCD is vacant for nearly a year after former BJP councillor Kamaljeet Sehrwat became the MP from Dwarka.Following defections of councillors to BJP in the last two months, the BJP's seat count in MCD has risen to 120, while AAP's tally has dropped to 122. No party has the majority. AAP has the maximum councillors.MCD officials said that it was not manadatory to conduct elections on vacant seats before conducting the mayoral election, according to the DMC Act. However, if a large number of councillors win the assembly elections, the officials said, they may ask the Election Commission to conduct bypolls in those MCD seats in March. ""We will need to have resignations from the elected candidates and then we will pursue the EC,"" an MCD official said.Among the sitting municipal councillors of BJP who got assembly election tickets are Gajendra Daral from Mundka, Priyanka Gautam from the reserved constituency of Kondli, Umang Bajaj from Naraina, Neelam Pehalwan from Najafgarh, Manoj Kumar Jindal from Sadar Bazar, Kamal Bagri from Ballimaran, Urmila Kailash Gangwal from Madipur (SC), and Anil Gaur from Seelampur. Daral won the 2022 civic election as an independent after being denied a ticket by BJP. He returned to the party within a few months. Gautam won the MCD election on an AAP ticket but joined BJP only a few months earlier.On Dec 25, AAP councillor from Ghadoli, Priyanka Gautam, joined BJP along with her supporters.KS Mehra, a former commissioner in the unified MCD, said the situation will become unstable in MCD if the majority of councillors fighting the assembly elections win. ""Already due to the standing committee, many projects are failing to get implemented. People usually complain about the non-completion of tasks, but it is difficult to explain to them the reasons every time,"" Mehra said.Trump had pledged cooperation with India to deepen the strategic partnership, including through Quad in the Indo-Pacific. Trump sought a fair trading relationship with India, in line with his commitment to reduce the trade deficit, and expressed confidence that Modi would do what's right on the issue of irregular migration.Modi will be among a select group of leaders who will visit the White House in the first month of Trump's second term. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu will be the first foreign leader to call on Trump on Tuesday. This is likely to be followed by a meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah II early next week.While there was no official word from either side about the dates for the visit till late in the evening, sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Trump is likely to host a dinner for Modi and that no community event had been planned for the PM till now. As of now, Modi is also not scheduled to travel to any other city. A meeting with business leaders isn't ruled out.While looking to iron out differences over trade, which India sought to address in the budget by slashing import tariffs on high-end motorcycles, the govt will look for a reaffirmation of the US commitment to the initiative on critical and emerging technology that the Biden administration launched to expand the technology partnership and boost defence industrial cooperation. India expects strong convergence in this area as the first Trump administration had pledged support for transfer to India of advanced US military technology.Modi and Trump are also expected to relaunch negotiations for a comprehensive trade agreement that didn't work out last time despite some progress in the initial phase of talks. India will hope to soon have at least a mini deal that will restore Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) benefits that had been revoked by the Trump administration in 2019 because of restricted Indian market access.The visit will also be an important occasion for the two sides to underline the strategic convergence in the Indo-Pacific where a close partnership between the US and India is seen by both as central to a free, open, inclusive, peaceful, and prosperous region. On the illegal migration issue, India has already made it clear it will accept all illegals, like it has in the past too, but after verifying the Indian origin of the people facing deportation.","The seat difference bewteen AAP and BJP in the MCD is 2 - AAP has 122 councillors, and BJ has 104.

US President Donald Trump expressed interest on Tuesday in El Salvador’s offer to house violent US convicts but acknowledged that the move raises significant legal questions.US secretary of state Marco Rubio, who brokered the deal with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, also admitted that constitutional issues must be addressed before the plan can proceed.During a meeting with Bukele on Monday, Rubio secured a commitment that El Salvador would accept deported criminals of any nationality, including American citizens and legal residents convicted of violent crimes. Bukele confirmed the offer on X, saying that his country is willing to “outsource part of the US prison system” for a fee that would be affordable for the US but beneficial to El Salvador.El Salvador’s prison system has been under international scrutiny for its harsh conditions.According to the state department, its facilities suffer from overcrowding, poor sanitation, and inadequate access to basic needs like potable water and ventilation. The country’s new mega-prison (CECOT), built under Bukele’s administration, can house 40,000 inmates and prisoners are subjected to severe restrictions, including no visits or rehabilitation programs.Speaking at the Oval Office, Trump emphasised that he is eager to move forward with the plan if legally permissible. “I’m just saying, if we had the legal right to do it, I would do it in a heartbeat,” he told reporters, according to AP.However, he acknowledged uncertainty over whether US laws allow the transfer of American citizens to foreign prisons.Trump also claimed that “numerous, many” countries have expressed interest in taking American prisoners, although he did not specify which ones, USA Today reported. He argued that outsourcing the incarceration of violent criminals would reduce costs for the US while ensuring these offenders are permanently removed from society.Rubio, speaking alongside Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves, admitted that the legal framework for outsourcing US prisoners remains unclear. “We have a Constitution,” he said, emphasising that any such move would need to be carefully vetted.Critics argue that banishing American convicts to foreign countries could violate their constitutional rights, particularly those concerning due process and humane treatment.Meanwhile, Trump’s aggressive foreign policy shifts have sparked controversy within the US government. Thousands of USAID employees have been laid off amid a sweeping freeze on foreign aid, and Rubio has signalled that the state department may absorb parts of USAID, AP reported. The reorganisation has left aid programs in limbo, further complicating US-Central America relations.Bukele’s proposal comes as El Salvador continues its crackdown on gang violence, which has led to the mass incarceration of over 83,000 people with limited due process.While Bukele’s policies have significantly reduced crime, human rights groups warn of widespread abuses in the country’s prisons.Despite the legal uncertainties, Trump remains eager to outsource prisoners, particularly those convicted of violent and repeat offences. “These people are never going to be any good,” he said, suggesting that once transferred, they would remain in El Salvador permanently, as per USA Today.","US President Donald Trump expressed interest in El Salvador's offer to house violent US convicts.

Senate Committee advances Tulsi Gabbard’s nomination for director of national intelligence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/senate-committee-advances-tulsi-gabbards-nomination-for-director-of-national-intelligence/articleshow/117931072.cms,"File photo: Tulsi Gabbard (Picture credit: ANI)

Tulsi Gabbard's nomination as director of national intelligence (DNI) moved a step closer to confirmation after the Senate Intelligence Committee approved it in a narrow 9-8 vote, with all Republicans supporting her and all Democrats opposing.The decision sets the stage for a full Senate vote, where Gabbard will need near-unanimous Republican backing to secure the position.Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii and 2020 presidential candidate, has sparked controversy due to her past comments sympathetic to Russia, her meeting with Syria’s former leader Bashar al-Assad, and her defence of Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who leaked classified intelligence.These issues made her one of the most divisive picks for US President Donald Trump’s cabinet.During her contentious confirmation hearing, Gabbard attempted to clarify her stance on Snowden, stating that while he ""broke the law,"" his leaks exposed ""illegal and unconstitutional programs"" within the US government. However, she avoided directly calling him a traitor, despite repeated questioning from both Republican and Democratic senators, as per AP.Initial Republican support for Gabbard was uncertain, as some lawmakers raised concerns about her lack of intelligence experience and her history of challenging US intelligence agencies.However, a weekend pressure campaign led by Trump supporters, including Elon Musk, helped secure votes. Musk had initially criticised Sen Todd Young for his tough questioning of Gabbard but later called him an ""ally"" after Young announced his support, The New York Times reported.Young, whose opposition could have stalled Gabbard’s nomination, later explained that he backed her after securing written assurances that she would hold officials accountable for unauthorised disclosures and not intervene in discussions about Snowden’s legal status. Other swing votes, such as Sen Susan Collins, also came around after Gabbard pledged to shrink the size of the ODNI and return it to its original coordinating role among intelligence agencies.Democrats have remained firmly opposed to Gabbard’s nomination. Sen Mark Kelly warned that her ""tendency to embrace poorly supported claims"" over intelligence assessments was ""dangerous"". Sen Martin Heinrich went further, labelling her a ""national security risk"" who ""parrots dictators' talking points"", according to The New York Times.With Republicans holding a narrow majority in the Senate, Gabbard’s confirmation is not guaranteed. A date for the full Senate vote has yet to be scheduled.","Tulsi Gabbard's nomination as director of national intelligence (DNI) moved a step closer to confirmation.

(AP)

Egypt, Jordan reject Idea



Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met US President Donald Trump at the White House late on Tuesday to discuss a truce with Hamas . Trump suggested relocating Palestinians from Gaza to other countries.""It would be my hope that we could do something really nice, really good, where they wouldn't want to return,"" Trump said. ""Why would they want to return? The place has been hell.""Trump earlier said Palestinians would ""love"" a plan to move them to Middle Eastern countries, including Egypt and Jordan. He took credit for securing the Israel-Hamas truce and was expected to ask Netanyahu to move forward with the next phase of the ceasefire.Netanyahu, when asked about the possibility of progress, said, ""We're going to try. That's one of the things we're going to talk about. When Israel and the United States work together, and President Trump and I work together, the chances go up a lot.""Egypt and Jordan rejected Trump's suggestion of relocating Palestinians.Still, Trump, with Netanyahu by his side, said he believes Egypt and Jordan—as well as other countries which he did not name—will ultimately agree to take in Palestinians.“You look over the decades, it’s all death in Gaza,” Trump said. ""This has been happening for years. It’s all death. If we can get a beautiful area to resettle people, permanently, in nice homes where they can be happy and not be shot and not be killed and not be knifed to death like what’s happening in Gaza.”Trump said Palestinians should get a ""fresh, beautiful piece of land"" in another country. ""I think they'd love to leave Gaza if they had an option,"" he said before his meeting with Netanyahu.Israel announced it was sending a delegation to Qatar to discuss the second phase of the ceasefire agreement . Hamas confirmed that negotiations had begun, with spokesperson Abdel Latif al-Qanou saying the focus was on ""shelter, relief and reconstruction.""The first phase of the ceasefire, lasting six weeks, involves the exchange of hostages held in Gaza for prisoners in Israeli custody.Hamas took 251 hostages in its October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israel says 76 hostages remain in Gaza, including 34 who are dead. Families of Israeli hostages are urging for the agreement to continue to secure their release.Trump said he would also work on restarting efforts for a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which were halted after the Gaza war.Discussions with Netanyahu also included Iran, which supports Hamas and Hezbollah. Before the meeting, Trump signed an order reinstating ""maximum pressure"" on Iran over allegations of nuclear weapon development.Since the ceasefire began on January 19, Israel has conducted operations against militants in the occupied West Bank. The UN warned that conditions in the Jenin refugee camp were worsening.On Tuesday, the Israeli military said a gunman killed two soldiers near Jenin before being shot.Under the ceasefire, 18 hostages have been freed, and around 600 Palestinian prisoners have been released. More aid, including food, fuel, and medicine, has entered Gaza. Some displaced people have returned to the north.Hamas's October 7 attack killed 1,210 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to official Israeli figures. Israel’s response has killed at least 47,518 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The UN considers these numbers reliable.","Egypt, Jordan reject Idea of relocating Palestinians from Gaza to other countries.

Subsequently, most donors who had suspended their support resumed their financial contributions.","US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to withdraw US from several UN organisations, including the Human Rights Council.

I never get ahead of the boss, that's why I'm sitting here.""Trump implemented additional 10-percent tariffs on Chinese products, supplementing existing duties against America's primary economic rival. Mexico and Canada had previously faced 25-percent tariffs.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated on Monday that Trump was scheduled to speak with Xi, but stated Tuesday that ""I don't have any updates on when that call will take place.""""He is not going to allow China to continue to source and distribute deadly fentanyl into our country, that was the reason for this tariff,"" Leavitt told reporters outside the West Wing of the White House.Beijing promptly responded by imposing duties on US imports of energy, vehicles and equipment following Trump's implementation of tariffs on Chinese products.China has imposed new tariffs on US imports, with 15-percent duties on coal and liquefied natural gas, whilst 10-percent levies apply to crude oil, agricultural machinery, large-engine vehicles, and pickup trucks.The Chinese authorities announced investigations into US companies, including Google and the corporate owner of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands.Responding to Washington's ""unilateral tariff hike"", Beijing declared these countermeasures and stated its intention to lodge a complaint with the World Trade Organization regarding these ""malicious"" duties.The nation also implemented new restrictions on exporting rare metals and chemicals, including tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, and molybdenum, which are essential for various industrial applications.Meanwhile, financial markets showed uncertainty as investors prepared for potential market turbulence in upcoming weeks regarding Trump's tariff threats against his nation's principal trading partners.While China imported US energy products worth over $7 billion in the previous year, this figure is significantly lower compared to imports from allied nations like Russia, which amounted to $94 billion.Trump has termed tariffs as a crucial diplomatic instrument, stating that 'tariff' is the ""most beautiful"" word in the dictionary. His strategy aims to pressure countries into addressing illegal migration and drug trafficking issues, particularly fentanyl.On Monday, Trump temporarily suspended duties on Mexico and Canada for one month after both nations committed to enhance their efforts against fentanyl trafficking and illegal immigration into the United States.Both Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau secured agreements with Trump, resulting in a 30-day suspension of threatened tariffs, with ongoing discussions planned.Mexico has begun deploying 10,000 troops along its border, as promised in the agreement. ""The deployment has already started,"" Sheinbaum confirmed to reporters.Since Mexico's major anti-drug cartel campaign began in 2006, over 450,000 people have lost their lives nationwide.

The BRI is seen as an attempt by China to further its influence abroad with infrastructure projects funded by Chinese investments across the world.Thousands of Chinese personnel are working in Pakistan on several projects under the aegis of the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC).Several Chinese workers have been killed in suicide attacks by a Baloch insurgent group, which is opposed to China's investments in the resource-rich province.Pakistan said it has constituted a 12,000-strong para-military force to protect Chinese workers in the country.China has asked Pakistan to make efforts to effectively close the security loopholes and demanded more targeted measures to provide full protection for the CPEC and the safety and security of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan.Zardari will also attend the inaugural ceremony of the 9th Asian Winter games in Harbin, Heilongjiang province, at the special invitation of the Chinese government, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.In a statement, foreign office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said the visit underscores the tradition of high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China, reflecting the deep commitment of the two countries to strengthen their all-weather strategic cooperative Partnership, it added.Zardari's trip comes at a crucial time as Pakistan seeks to revitalise its economy and strengthen regional connectivity through CPEC.","Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari will travel to China on Tuesday on a five- day state visit.

PESHAWAR: The Pakistani Taliban claimed the killing of a police officer as he travelled Monday to guard polio vaccinators on the first day of a nationwide immunisation effort after a year of rising cases.The officer was travelling to guard polio vaccinators in the area of Jamrud town in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province when he was killed, local police official Zarmat Khan told AFP.""Two motorcycle riders opened fire on him,"" he said. ""The constable died instantly at the scene."" Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan are the only countries where polio is endemic and militants have for decades targeted vaccination teams and their security escorts.The Pakistani Taliban in a statement claimed responsibility for the ""targeted attack"" and said militants also ""seized"" the slain officer's weapon.Pakistan reported at least 73 polio infections in 2024, compared to just six cases in 2023. The vaccination campaign which started on Monday is the first of the year and is due to last a week.""Despite the incident, the polio vaccination drive in the area remains ongoing,"" Khan said.Abdul Hameed Afridi, another senior police official in the area, also confirmed details of the attack and said officers have ""launched an investigation"".Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif acknowledged the violence in a statement from his office, saying ""the anti-polio campaign will continue with full vigour"".Polio can easily be prevented by the oral administration of a few drops of vaccine, but scores of vaccination workers and their escorts have been killed over the years.In the past, clerics falsely claimed that the vaccine contained pork or alcohol, declaring it forbidden for Muslims.In more recent years the attacks have focused on vulnerable police escorts accompanying the vaccinators as they go door-to-door.Last year, dozens of Pakistani policemen who accompany medical teams on campaigns went on strike after a string of militant attacks targeting them.Pakistan has witnessed rising militant attacks since the Taliban returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan.More than 1,600 people were killed in 2024, the deadliest year in almost a decade, according to the center for research and security studies, an Islamabad-based analysis group.Islamabad accuses Kabul's new rulers of failing to rout militants organising on Afghan soil, a charge the Taliban government routinely denies.In November, at least seven people including five children were killed in a bombing targeting police gathered to guard vaccinators near a school in southwestern Balochistan province.Balochistan, which also neighbours Afghanistan, was the area with the largest number of polio cases in 2024, despite being the most sparsely populated.",The officer was travelling to guard polio vaccinators in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Pakistani troops fought insurgents who set up roadblocks in the restive northwestern region of Balochistan, leaving 18 paramilitaries and 23 rebels dead, officials said on Saturday. Three other Pakistani soldiers were seriously wounded in some of the heaviest clashes in recent years.The onslaught was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organization behind rising violence in the Balochistan province that borders Afghanistan and Iran.A vehicle carrying unarmed border troops ""came under gunfire from 70 to 80 armed assailants who had blocked the road,"" a police official told the AFP news agency. The official was speaking on the condition of anonymity.The Pakistani military said the casualties occurred after troops engaged the insurgents who erected barricades on a key highway in Kalat, near the border with Afghanistan.The security forces ""successfully removed the roadblock"" following the overnight clashes, the military said in a statement.The military confirmed 18 soldiers died in the operation and vowed that ""the perpetrators, facilitators and abettors of this heinous and cowardly act, will be brought to justice."" Security forces recovered the bodies of 12 insurgents, the military said.Troops also killed another 11 insurgents in an operation that was still underway, the military added.Pakistan's Balochistan province is currently witnessing a surge in deadly attacks, fueled by demands for independence and control over local resources.A Sunni Muslim ethnic group who live on both sides of the Iran-Pakistan border, and also in parts of southern Afghanistan, over 10,000 Baloch have disappeared since 2011, according to Amnesty International.Efforts for autonomy or independence have been met with violent suppression on both sides of the border. In Pakistan, such efforts are viewed as attempts to fragment the nation — while in Iran the situation is further complicated by the Baloch being a Sunni Muslim minority in a predominantly Shiite country.The largest Baloch militant group, the BLA, is backed by the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).The TTP are a separate group from the BLA, with the TTP being allied with the Afghan Taliban.Balochistan is rich in natural resources such as gold, diamonds, silver, and copper — yet the local population remains among the poorest in Pakistan.","Pakistani troops fight insurgents who set up roadblocks in restive northwestern region of Balochistan. 18 paramilitaries and 23 rebels dead, three other Pakistani soldiers seriously wounded in some of the heaviest clashes in recent years.

Bilal Shabbir, Kalat’s deputy commissioner, said the attacks took place in Pidrang, Khazeni and Mangochar Bazaar areas of the town, where militants started conducting snap checks of passenger vehicles passing through town.In the first incident, Shabbir said a van carrying 17 soldiers from Panjgur to Quetta came under attack near the mountainous area of Khazeni, where armed men battled the security forces. He said one soldier of the Frontier Corps (FC), a paramilitary force, was separately killed in clashes with the militants.“The bodies of the slain soldiers were shifted to Quetta,” Shabbir said. “We don’t know how many attackers were killed because they took the bodies of their fighters into the mountains in the dark.”He said three FC personnel were also injured in the attack, adding that militants set a private bank on fire in Mangochar Bazaar.Separatist groups like BLA have long been at the forefront of a low-level insurgency in Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province by area and rich in mineral resources.

Just months earlier, in August, the group launched a series of coordinated attacks that left at least 39 people dead, marking one of the deadliest escalations in recent years.Violence has also surged beyond Balochistan, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province witnessing an increase in militant attacks.The Pakistani military reported that in 2024 alone, 383 soldiers and 925 militants were killed in various clashes.","18 paramilitary personnel killed in ambush in southwest Pakistan's Balochistan province.

US policy shift and review timeline



Economic and social consequences for Pakistan



Geopolitical ramifications



Uncertain future for development initiatives



NEW DELHI: Donald Trump has temporarily suspended United States foreign assistance to foreign countries, including Pakistan, for re-evaluation, putting several critical development projects on hold.The decision follows an executive order issued by President Donald Trump, directing a comprehensive review of US foreign aid spending.The US aid suspension is set to impact several key sectors in Pakistan, including energy, economic growth, agriculture, governance, education, health, and cultural preservation. Projects such as the Power Sector Improvement Activity, Pakistan Private Sector Energy Initiative, and Clean Energy Loan Portfolio Guarantee Program face disruptions in the energy sector, as per a Geo news report.Economic growth initiatives, including the Social Protection Activity and Pakistan Private Investment Initiative, may also suffer setbacks. In agriculture, programmes like Water Management for Enhanced Productivity and Recharge Pakistan risk losing funding.The suspension has stalled numerous USAID-funded projects across various sectors, including health, education, agriculture, energy, and governance. The move halts initiatives such as the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP), the Power Sector Improvement Activity, and the Pakistan Private Sector Energy Activity. Economic growth initiatives, such as the Social Protection Activity and Investment Promotion Activity, are also affected.In the education sector, projects aimed at improving girls' education, strengthening higher education systems, and enhancing resilience in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been disrupted. The health sector has also taken a hit, with the suspension of tuberculosis treatment programmes, family health initiatives, and global health security efforts.Tammy Bruce, a spokesperson for the US Department of State, confirmed that all foreign aid funded by the State Department and USAID is under review. Secretary of State Marco Rubio justified the move, stating that every aid dollar must contribute to American security, strength, and prosperity.The White House has clarified that the suspension is temporary, with a 90-day review period. The final decision will be made by the relevant departments in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).The suspension of aid threatens Pakistan’s development trajectory, particularly in regions relying on US-funded initiatives for stability and growth. The decision could delay infrastructural advancements, limit economic opportunities, and disrupt healthcare access for vulnerable populations.Pakistan’s governance and democracy-building programmes are also affected, including projects on electoral reforms, land registration, and local governance. The decision may weaken institutional development efforts and impede progress in human rights and civic participation.The suspension highlights a shift in US-Pakistan relations , with Washington reassessing its financial commitments to Islamabad. Analysts believe this could push Pakistan to seek alternative funding sources, possibly from China or Gulf nations, altering its geopolitical alliances.While the pause in aid does not signify a complete severance of US-Pakistan ties, it raises concerns about future diplomatic engagements and financial support from Washington. The upcoming review will determine whether these programmes will resume, be modified, or face permanent cuts.With crucial projects now in limbo, Pakistani officials and aid-dependent communities await the US review’s outcome. The next three months will be critical in determining whether Washington reinstates its financial commitments or signals a long-term reduction in aid to Pakistan.For now, the suspension leaves Pakistan navigating an uncertain future, with potential setbacks in economic growth, infrastructure development, and humanitarian assistance.","Donald Trump has temporarily suspended United States foreign assistance to foreign countries, including Pakistan.

LONDON: Baloch leader Hyrbyair Marri brought attention to the ongoing horrors that the Pashtun and Baloch communities endure under Pakistan 's repressive control in a stirring statement to the Pashtun National Council (Jirga). Marri brought attention to the Pakiststate's systematic exploitation, enforced disappearances, and violence against various ethnic communities.""The sufferings of the Baloch and Pashtun under Pakistan's occupation are countless and unending,"" Marri stated, emphasizing the urgent need for unity between the two nations to resist colonial oppression.He recalled previous instances of solidarity, such as the treaty of kalat in 1758, in which Afghan and Baloch leaders promised to respect and support one another. He asked both groups to rekindle this spirit in their struggle for independence.Marri compared British imperialism to the colonial strategies that Pakistan acquired. He denounced Pakistan's continuous military actions in Balochistan , pointing to unlawful executions, torture, and enforced disappearances as means of quelling dissent. The Baloch leader cited the targeted profiling of Pashtuns and killings like the 1948 Barbra event in Charsadda, claiming that these practices were continuations of the British heritage of divide and conquer.Recalling how Pashtun tribes were utilized as frontline combatants in 1948 while Punjabi elites remained behind, he also denounced Pakistan's abuse of Baloch and Pashtun youth. He also drew attention to the fact that thousands of Baloch youths were forcibly drafted into the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and sent to die under pretences of religious salvation.Marri condemned Pakistan's racial profiling of Afghan refugees, primarily Pashtuns, and their forced deportation as a pressure tactic against Afghanistan. ""These people have lived here for generations, yet they are treated as disposable,"" he said.Calling for a renewed alliance between the Baloch and Pashtun nations, Marri declared, ""Our unity is the path to freedom.

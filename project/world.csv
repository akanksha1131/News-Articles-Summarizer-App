German govt in crisis as Scholz’s ruling coalition collapses: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/german-govt-in-crisis-as-scholzs-ruling-coalition-collapses-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/115035836.cms,"Here's all you need to know:

Scholz dismissed Lindner following ongoing disputes over budget policies. The chancellor cited Lindner’s opposition to debt relaxation and climate investments as incompatible with his administration’s economic vision.

Scholz announced he would pursue a vote of confidence on 15 January, which could trigger early elections in March, six months ahead of the scheduled date.

Germany’s economy is expected to contract for the second consecutive year. Scholz’s coalition partners struggled to agree on fiscal strategies to revive growth, with Lindner’s FDP demanding tax cuts and deregulation against SPD and Green opposition.

Scholz extended an offer to collaborate with CDU leader Friedrich Merz on issues of national importance, particularly on economic and security policies.

The collapse of Germany’s government amid heightened global tensions, including Trump's re-election and conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, has sent ripples through Europe. Green party leaders called the timing of this crisis “disastrous for both Germany and Europe.”

Germany plunged into political turmoil on Wednesday as Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed finance minister Christian Lindner , leading to the collapse of the ruling coalition. The breakdown of this three-party government is expected to result in early elections, potentially by March 2024, as Scholz seeks a new mandate amid deepening political divisions in Europe’s largest economy.Announcing Lindner's dismissal, Scholz cited irreconcilable differences over fiscal policy and accused his former finance minister of prioritising ""party interests over national stability."" The decision follows months of tensions within the coalition, with the fiscally conservative Free Democrats (FDP), led by Lindner, resisting budget compromises proposed by Scholz’s Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens.In the face of an economic downturn and strained alliances in Europe, Scholz plans to seek a vote of confidence in January. “Germany needs a functioning government, one that can take decisive steps to strengthen our economy and security,” Scholz declared. With Donald Trump’s re-election in the US adding uncertainty to transatlantic relations, Scholz stressed the need for stability.The chancellor also hinted at the possibility of working with opposition leader Friedrich Merz of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on crucial policies. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck indicated that the Greens would remain in a caretaker role, expressing hope for continuity despite the crisis.","Germany plunged into political turmoil on Wednesday as Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed finance minister Christian Lindner.

Former US President Barack Obama on Wednesday congratulated Donald Trump and Senator JD Vance following their election victory and highlighted the importance of upholding democratic values and the peaceful transition of power.""This is obviously not the outcome we had hoped for,"" Obama said. ""But living in a democracy is about recognizing that our point of view won't always win out, and being willing to accept the peaceful transfer of power.""Obama also expressed pride in the campaign efforts of vice president Kamala Harris and her running mate, governor Tim Walz, acknowledging the impact of their work despite the loss. ""Michelle and I could not be prouder of vice president Harris and governor Walz - two extraordinary public servants who ran a remarkable campaign,"" he added, extending gratitude to the volunteers and supporters who dedicated themselves to the Democratic cause.Obama’s statement also acknowledged the complex backdrop of recent years, marked by a pandemic, economic instability, and rapid social changes. ""Those conditions have created headwinds for democratic incumbents around the world, and last night showed that America is not immune,"" he noted.Highlighting the core values that shape American democracy, Obama encouraged citizens to embrace grace and understanding, even amidst deep disagreements. ""In a country as big and diverse as ours, we won't always see eye-to-eye on everything. But progress requires us to extend good faith and grace - even to people with whom we deeply disagree. That's how we've come this far, and it's how we'll keep building a country that is more fair and more just, more equal and more free,"" he said.Shortly after conceding the presidential race to Donald Trump, Vice President Kamala Harris urged supporters to accept the election results and pledged to ensure a peaceful transfer of power to the Republican leader. In an emotional concession speech at her alma mater Howard University, 60-year-old Harris said the ""light of America's promise will always burn bright"" and vowed to keep up the ""fight"" that fuelled her campaign.""My heart is full today - full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country, and full of resolve,"" she said.""The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for.

Bibi's firing of Israel defence chief draws both ire & praise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/bibis-firing-of-israel-defence-chief-draws-both-ire-praise/articleshow/115032167.cms,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's shock firing of his defence chief on Tuesday night removed a cabinet critic, but also deepened anger among opponents about his handling of the country's multi-front conflict. In Yoav Gallant , Netanyahu had a defence minister who challenged many of his plans for the war against Hamas in Gaza and threatened the stability of his fragile coalition. Netanyahu said the trust between him and Gallant had broken down.Gallant, who spoke regularly with Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin and helped Israel and the US weather tensions between Netanyahu and Biden, cited three reasons for being fired. One of them, he said, was to do with the conduct of war in Gaza. Gallant long said the best way to get the hostages released was to accept a phased ceasefire even if it meant withdrawing from parts of Gaza.Another reason was growing divisions over a recent Supreme Court ruling that overturned Orthodox Jews' exemption from military conscription. Gallant said the ruling had to be implemented, while Netanyahu and his Orthodox political allies wanted to bypass it.In recent days, Netanyahu failed to introduce a policy allowing Orthodox men, known as Haredim, to avoid economic sanctions if they refused to serve. Haredi parties, key coalition members, have threatened to topple the government if that doesn't happen.The third point of contention between Gallant and Netanyahu was over the former's call for a commission of inquiry ""to uncover the truth and learn lessons"" about Oct 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel from Gaza, triggering the war. It was the worst day in Israel's history in terms of the number of Israelis killed. Netanyahu says a state inquiry would be a distraction while the conflict continues.For all that Gallant's departure may stabilise Netanyahu's coalition, it weakens him in other ways. Opponents - including a business forum containing CEOs of some of Israel's biggest companies - cried foul and said he was prioritising his political survival over the nation's security and hostages. Protesters took to the streets in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, though they couldn't persuade Netanyahu to change his mind. ""Lawlessness,"" read a headline in Yediot Aharonot, Israel's largest newspaper on Wednesday. ""This is how democracy dies,"" wrote the paper's main columnist, Nahum Barnea.On Wednesday, Israeli strikes on Lebanon killed at least 38 people around the eastern city of Baalbek in the Bekaa Valley, according to the regional governor, and at dusk more strikes hit Beirut's southern suburbs. The attack happened shortly after Hezbollah secretary general Naim Qassem said he did not believe ""political action"" would bring about an end to hostilities.Lebanon renewed its call for a ceasefire and submitted a new complaint to the UN Security Council regarding Israel's attacks on the country. The escalating Israeli attacks against Lebanon have turned into ""crimes"" against humanity, Lebanese PM Najib Mikati said.",Yoav Gallant challenged many of Netanyahu's plans for the war against Hamas in Gaza.

Trump and his loyalists dismiss such criticism, insisting other countries have long taken advantage of the US and he would put a stop to it.How Trump responds to Russia's war in Ukraine could set the tone for his agenda and signal how he will deal with Nato and key US allies. Trump insisted last year that Russian President Putin never would have invaded Ukraine if he had been in the White House, adding ""even now I could solve that in 24 hours"".Trump will also confront a volatile West Asia that threatens to descend into a broader regional conflict.

Although not always true, purveyors of Presidential election trivia say the taller of the two Presidential candidates is usually the winner. Even so, the 6 ' 3"" Donald Trump's victory over the 5'4"" Kamala Harris was overwhelming, thanks in part to an underwhelming performance by the vice-president who could not even rise to the stature of the outgoing President Joe Biden, who ceded the Democratic nomination to her just 14 weeks ago.Throughout the tortured Tuesday night for Democrats, it became apparent that Harris was coming up short in county after county, state after state, polling well below Biden's victory margins in 2020, even as Trump bumped up his vote count in rural areas. Harris once asserted that although she is 5'4"", she is 5' 7"" in heels. Well, she came up 3 percent short of Biden's tally in more than 1000 counties across the country -- sometimes more.Nowhere was the nationwide drag on Harris more apparent than in New York City, a reliably Democratic stronghold. Although Harris won the state and its 29 electoral vote comfortably by 12 per cent, her victory margin was halved from the 23 percent margin Biden won over Trump in 2020. In Manhattan, the most liberal of the city's five boroughs, where Biden won 86-12 in 2020, Kamala Harris' victory margin was 63-35.This was repeated across many cities and states. In New Jersey, Biden's 16 point win in 2020 was whittled down to a 5 point win for Harris. In Virginia, south of Washington DC, a state Biden won by 10 points in 2020, Harris won by only 5 points. While the wins still enabled Harris to win all the electoral votes in NY and NJ in a winner-take-all system, what it also did was allow Trump to win the nationwide popular vote too.At the time of writing, Trump had polled more than 71 million votes (51 per cent of votes cast) compared to Harris' 66 million. Biden polled more than 80 million votes in 2020, leading to Trump's charge that there was a lot of voter fraud, such a tally was impossible, and therefore the election was stolen from him.Harris' underperformance was most damaging to her in battleground states. For instance, in Pennsylvania, she was expected to erase Trump's expected leads from the state's 50+ rural counties by polling 85 percent plus votes in suburban and urban centers such as Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, heavily populated Democratic strongholds. Instead, she came in at sub-80 per cent votes in urban areas, lower than what Biden got. Black and Hispanic male voters decamped to Trump in large numbers, ostensibly for economic, cultural, and gender reasons. At the same time, Trump ramped up his white rural vote count.This dynamic cost Harris the battleground states of Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Minority male voters in the suburban and urban centers did not deliver for Harris to the extent they did for Biden, whereas the white male rural voters in these states plumped for Trump in greater numbers.In doing so, they effectively repudiated Trump's record as a convicted felon who was twice impeached as President, and an adjudicated rapist. Instead, they embraced his pledge to restore America's greatness and stop the flow of illegal immigrants. Even urban voters appeared to have tired of government largesse to immigrants in so-called sanctuary cities on top of inflation.Early on Election Day, a Kamala voter announced on social media: This morning I walked into a polling station at 7:45am and voted for a Black and Indian woman (with Jewish husband from Jersey) to be the 47th President of the United States of America. I am my Ancestor’s wildest dreams.It will remain a dream.","Kamala Harris came up short in county after county, state after state, polling well below Biden's victory margins in 2020.

Monkey wrench in donkey route of Indians,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/monkey-wrench-in-donkey-route-of-indians/articleshow/115036221.cms,"The centrepiece of Trump’s reelection bid was a promise to deport record numbers of undocumented immigrants. If what he calls the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history” becomes reality, it would impact an estimated 11 million people who are in the US without authorisation.According to Pew Research Center, there were about 725,000 undocumented Indians in the US in 2021, making them the third-largest such group in the country. During FY2024, US Customs and Border Protection revealed that an average of 10 Indian nationals were arrested every hour while attempting to illegally cross US borders. Many of them are Gujaratis. Jimmy Patel (name changed on request) from Vijapur, in Mehsana, who is preparing to sneak into the US, said during his previous term, the “Trump Wall” had been unable to keep out illegal immigrants. “Trump had built the wall, but it was porous, with ways to get through. But under Biden, legal entry became nearly impossible due to complicated asylum procedures. Trump now may make the illegal path tougher, but if India and America work closely, the legal route could improve,” Patel said.“Trump administration might make it harder to cross into the US through Mexico or Canada, but we are hopeful Indians might not face the same scrutiny. Trump may not see us as a burden as many Indian immigrants come ready to work and earn our keep, unlike migrants from other countries who must be provided food and lodging till the legalities are worked out,” said Parikshit Patel, a visa consultant from Kalol.Some in Gujarat also cling to the belief that Trump’s strong rapport with PM Narendra Modi will somehow help them avoid scrutiny. According to media reports, Trump and his allies, including Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s immigration agenda, have sketched out an expansive vision that dovetails with the plans laid out in Project 2025, a 900-plus-page presidential transition blueprint led by the rightwing Heritage Foundation.The strategy, as Trump has described it, may involve the extraordinary use of US troops for immigration enforcement and border security and the application of 18th-century wartime powers. Immigration advocates have warned that deportation plans could be costly, divisive, and inhumane.","According to Pew Research Center, there were about 725,000 undocumented Indians in the US in 2021.

Fred, who had founded the real estate company E Trump and Sons, with his mother, Elizabeth, in 1927, was investigated for profiteering in 1954 and 1966. Mary was born to a fisherman father in Scotland, but later migrated to the US. The couple had five children, Donald being the fourth. Among his siblings were Maryanne Trump Barry , a former federal judge who died in 2023, Fred Trump Junior, who died of a heart attack at the age of 42, Robert Trump , who worked in Trump’s businesses and died in 2020 and Elizabeth Trump Grau, a bank professional married to film producer James Grau.Trump has married thrice. His first wife was late model Ivana Marie Trump. They were married in 1977 and divorced in 1992. He had three children from this marriage — Donald Trump Junior, Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump. He married his second wife, actor-television personality-singer-model Marla Maples , in 1993, but the couple separated in 1997 and divorced in 1999. He has a daughter from this marriage, Tiffany Trump. His third and present wife,Melania Trump , was also a model, and the couple has one child, Barron William Trump. Trump also has 10 grandchildren — kids of his three children from his first marriage. Tiffany has recently announced her pregnancy.After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance and Commerce in 1968, Trump joined his father’s business and eventually changed the name of the company to The Trump Organization. Then, in 2004, the real estate mogul appeared on the TV series, ‘The Apprentice’. “My name is Donald Trump and I’m the largest real estate developer in New York. I own buildings all over the place. I’ve mastered the art of the deal and turned the name Trump into the highest-quality brand.” That’s how Trump introduced himself on the show. By then he had already turned his father’s business into a billion-dollar empire. But it was his 11 years on this TV show that many believe cemented his reputation and paved the way for his White House stint in 2016. After losing to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential polls, he announced his candidacy for the 2024 elections in 2022 and went on to win it.Trump invested in luxury hotels and residential properties, reopening New York’s Commodore Hotel as the Grand Hyatt Hotel in 1980. The Trump Tower came in 1983. He also invested in the casino business — Trump’s Taj Mahal, when it opened in 1990, was the largest casino in the world. During this period, Trump also purchased his 118-room Florida mansion Mar-a-Lago, the 282-foot yacht, Trump Princess, and an East Coast air-shuttle service, Trump Shuttle.The US economic recession of 1990 hit Trump’s businesses hard. He shut down his airline business, sold the Trump Princess and took out mortgages on most of his properties. But as the US economy recovered, so did Trump’s fortunes. In 1996, Trump, with NBC TV network, bought the Miss Universe Organization. And then he starred in The Apprentice, from which he reportedly earned nearly $200 millions in base earnings and over $200 million more in licenses.● Passed record tax cuts● Helped US get energy independence● Invested $2 trillion to rebuild the US military● Lowered drug prices● During Covid pandemic, the Trump administration launched Operation Warp Speed to help accelerate the development of vaccines● Brokered normalisation agreements between Israel and Arab countries like UAE, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco, leading to the signing of the Abraham Accords● In 2019, Trump became the first sitting US president to enter North Korea, at the invitation of the country’s leader Kim Jong UnIn Oct 2016, an old video surfaced, purportedly of Trump boasting that “when you’re a star… you can do anything,” including grabbing women by the genitals. Though Trump dismissed it as “locker-room talk”, other women came out to allege harassment by him. As president, he also broke the tradition of releasing tax returns, citing ongoing audit. A 2020 New York Times report alleged Trump had paid only $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017, and none at all in 10 of the 15 previous years, allegedly by claiming that he had lost more money than he had made.Adult actor Stormy Daniels claimed she had sex with Trump in 2006 and that she was paid money to stay quiet about it in the run-up to the 2016 elections. The prosecution argued that Trump’s 2016 campaign sought to benefit from the payment of hush-money to Daniels through Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen , who was reimbursed via a false retainer agreement. In May this year, Trump was convicted in this case — the first former US president to be convicted of felony crimes. Trump has asked for the conviction to be overturned based on a Supreme Court ruling granting ex-presidents broad immunity from prosecution.In Aug 2023, Trump and 18 others were indicted for being party to a scheme to overturn Trump’s loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential polls. While some of the charges against Trump have since been dismissed, a trial date is yet to be fixed. Trump insists he did no wrong.In Aug 2023, Trump was indicted for conspiring to overturn his loss to Biden in 2020. Trial in the case was scheduled to begin in March, but has been put on hold to allow Trump to pursue his claim of presidential immunity from prosecution.In June last year, Trump was indicted for illegally retaining classified documents taken from the White House to his Mar-a-Lago residence after he left office in Jan 2021, and obstructing govt demands to return them.Last year, a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing American journalist and author E Jean Carroll in 1996 and awarded her $5 million in fines. Trump was also found liable for defaming Carroll over her allegations. He claimed on social media that he did not know Carroll and referred to the verdict as “a disgrace” and “a continuation of the greatest witch-hunt of all time”.Only two US presidents had been impeached before Trump, who faced such action not once but twice. The first came in 2019 and stemmed from allegations that he had tried to influence Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky into launching an investigation against Joe Biden, then Democratic frontrunner, to take him on in the 2020 US presidential polls, and his son Hunter. While the House of Representatives impeached him, the Republican-controlled Senate acquitted him. The second impeachment was linked to the insurrection of Jan 6, 2021, in which Republican supporters stormed the US Capitol complex in a bid to overturn the result of the 2020 election that Biden had won. The House of Representatives charged him with “incitement of insurrection” with unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. Again, the Senate cleared him of the charges.The MAGA crowd just loves him. For them, if there’s anyone who can Make America Great Again, it’s Trump. A recent NYT article says, “Trump’s… MAGA pitch resonates with those for whom the issue is not so much a drop in earnings, but a decline in social standing and future prospects”. According to researchers, MAGA voters are those who perceive former Republican leaders as too accommodating and are estimated to comprise 33.6% of all Republicans and 15% of the adult population of the US. According to NYT, Democrats have lost support among white voters in “places most affected by job losses” and “collegeeducated voters have increasingly moved towards the Democratic Party, as voters without a college degree have voted more Republican”. As the results of the 2024 elections showed the popular mandate in his favour, Trump referred to the assassination attempt on him in July, saying, “God saved my life for a reason... And that reason was to save our country and restore America to greatness. And now we’re going to fulfill that mission together.”","Trump was born to real estate developer Frederick (Fred) Christ Trump and Mary MacLeod in New York in 1946. Trump has married thrice.

What will the next 4 years be like? If he keeps his word, he will depart from several US policy consensuses, and each departure, given America’s power, can have major consequencesHe called himself Mr Tariff in his ﬁrst term, he wants to be Master Tariff this time. Trump wants a 60% tariff on all Chinese imports into US, and 100% duty on Chinese cars. And he wants all tariffs, applicable to whichever other country is selling goods to US, to be raised to 20%. This is turbocharged protectionism. If Trump goes through with even a part of it, multilateral trade will be hit, because other major economies will raise tariffs. Bilateral trade treaties will gain even more currency.China was already in Biden administration’s crosshairs, with laws denying export of cutting-edge tech. Trump will double down. Some of his advisers want a total decoupling with China. That may be hard to do. But he’ll likely push for a more hardline stand, not just on trade but also on what many American conservatives call Chinese ‘inﬂuence peddling’ in America.Trump’s victory speech all but made it clear he won’t send weapons for free to Ukraine. And he will put pressure on Ukraine to end the war. That’ll likely mean Kyiv giving up claims on Russian-occupied territory. He may also oppose Ukraine’s Nato membership.Israeli PM Netanyahu, backed with some reservations by Biden, will be backed even more — minus most reservations — by Trump. He was the guy who said he was okay with Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. He’ll likely be okay with Bibi’s being aggressive, especially against Iran, which is enemy Number 2 (China’s ﬁrst) for Trump. Whether Trump will stop Bibi from getting madly aggro – targeting Iran’s nuclear sites, for example – is the question.He’s dissed everything about climate change all over again, and promised to “drill, baby, drill”. He likely won’t join any multilateral deal on emission targets. Will he favour hydrocarbons over green tech domestically, especially given US advantage in developing the latter? Policy wonks will say he won’t. Don’t bet on them.Trump’s unlikely to be preachy about human rights or minority rights in other countries. He’s on record saying he doesn’t think America should spread its “values”. This is good news for some countries. But it’s bad news for Nato’s Europeans, who may have to ﬁnally ﬁnd leadership among their own, especially vis-à-vis Russia.

By Harsh Vardhan Shringla Former Foreign Secretary of India, Ambassador to US

When Prime Minister Narendra Modi proclaimed ‘Ab ki baar, Trump Sarkar’ at the Howdy Modi event in 2019, he foreshadowed a future where India and the US, under Trump’s leadership, would drive forward a robust, dual-powered partnership. Now, with Trump’s return to the White House, that prediction stands to usher in a new chapter in India-US relations.Trump’s second term promises a refreshed approach to India-US trade and economic ties. Though India faced some friction over trade issues in his first term, his renowned deal-making instinct created significant opportunities, and his results-driven pragmatism is likely to open more doors for India. Notably, Trump was vocal about global economic rebalancing even before the pandemic, criticising the distortions caused by China’s policies—an area where India’s concerns strongly resonate.Trump’s regard for India and the Indian diaspora is well known. And where previous US administrations only issued threats to cut military assistance to Pakistan because of its support for terrorism, Trump acted—delivering a strategic shift in support of India’s security needs. His recent tweet on violence against Hindu communities in Bangladesh reflects his acute awareness of the subcontinent’s dynamics and adds to his established goodwill toward India.Trump’s commitment to strengthening defence ties with India was a landmark of his first term, especially given his scepticism toward traditional alliances like NATO. Under Trump’s presidency, in 2018 India was elevated to Strategic Trade Authorisation Tier 1 status which allows it to access military and dual use technologies license-free. Underpinning all of this is the personal bond Trump shares with Prime Minister Modi—a connect that helped steer our ties before and will continue to facilitate diplomatic alignment. Trump accompanied Modi to the Howdy Modi event, one of the most unique and significant events in the India-US relationship, and then he visited India for the ‘Namaste Trump’ event. With Trump’s return to power, the India-US relationship is poised to advance in ways that will benefit both nations, driven by a shared vision and mutual respect under leaders who understand the importance of action over words.India is pivotal to the world today as a powerhouse of economic growth, digital innovation, and democratic stability, shaping global progress and regional security and in the recent past, regardless of party lines, US presidents have treated the ‘India account’ with increasing care, placing the relationship on firmer ground. This was especially visible during Trump’s first term. Trump popularised the term Indo-Pacific and renamed the Hawaii-based US Pacific Command as the Indo-Pacific Command, underscoring the increasing significance of the Indian Ocean in the US’ strategic considerations. Trump also revitalised an otherwise moribund Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) into an initiative promoting peace, collaboration, and stability in the Indo-Pacific.The institutionalisation of the India-US relationship reached new heights with the 2+2 Dialogue initiative. Launched in 2018, the 2+2 Dialogue has marked a shift from sporadic engagement to deep strategic cooperation.Factoring such milestones during Trump’s first term, India approaches Trump’s return with enthusiasm and confidence. The Modi-Trump partnership is expected to focus on significant deliverables in the near future. A potential Free Trade Agreement (FTA) aimed at deepening economic ties and reducing trade barriers between the two countries is a key goal. Both leaders can also focus on aligning their strategies on regional and global issues, particularly in terms of promoting peace and stability. With shared concerns over conflicts in the Indo-Pacific, the Middle East, Africa and Asia, both Modi and Trump are committed to fostering a rules-based international order. With Trump’s comeback to the oval office, the trajectory of India-US relations appears poised for a significant upward trajectory.",Trump’s second term promises a refreshed approach to India-US trade and economic ties.

Thousands ordered to evacuate as powerful wind-fed wildfire burns homes in Southern California,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/thousands-ordered-to-evacuate-as-powerful-wind-fed-wildfire-burns-homes-in-southern-california/articleshow/115035610.cms,"Thousands ordered to evacuate as powerful wind-fed wildfire burns homes in Southern California

California was lashed by powerful winds Wednesday that fed a fast-moving wildfire, which destroyed dozens of homes and forced thousands of residents to flee as forecasters warned of the potential for ""extreme and life-threatening"" blazes.Northwest of Los Angeles, the Mountain Fire exploded in size and prompted evacuation orders for more than 10,000 people as it threatened 3,500 structures in suburban communities, ranches and agricultural areas around Camarillo, according to a statement from Gov. Gavin Newsom. The area east of the Pacific coast city of Ventura will receive federal assistance after a request from Newsom was granted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Wednesday.The blaze was burning in a region that has seen some of California's most destructive fires over the years. A thick plume of smoke rose hundreds of feet into the sky Wednesday, blanketing whole neighborhoods and limiting visibility for firefighters and evacuees. The fire grew from less than half of a square mile to 16 square miles (62 square kilometers) in little more than five hours.Ventura County Fire Captain Trevor Johnson described crews racing with their engines to homes threatened by the flames to save lives.""This is as intense as it gets. The hair on the back of the firefighters' neck I'm sure was standing up,"" he said during a news conference Wednesday afternoon.At one spot, flames licked the burning remains of a home. Its roof was reduced to only a few charred shingles.Two people suffered apparent smoke inhalation and were taken to hospitals, fire officials said. No firefighters reported significant injuries.The erratic winds and limited visibility grounded fixed-wing aircraft, and gusts topped 61 mph (98 kph), said weather service meteorologist Bryan Lewis. Water-dropping helicopters were still flying.First responders pleaded with residents to evacuate. Deputies made contact with 14,000 people to urge them to leave as embers spread up to 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) away and sparked new flames.""This fire is moving dangerously fast,"" Ventura County Fire Chief Dustin Gardner said.Aerial footage from local television networks showed dozens of homes in flames across several neighborhoods as embers were whipped from home to home. Other footage captured horses trotting alongside evacuating vehicles.Jade Katz, who said she is disabled and does not drive, waited for a friend to pick her up near her Camarillo Heights home with a suitcase full of medication and Bella, her Great Dane service dog. But the friend couldn't reach her, so first responders sent a squad car to escort her out Wednesday afternoon as a helicopter dropped water on the house across from her home.""On the way out of the neighborhood, there were five or eight houses that had already burnt to the ground,"" said Katz, 35, who was sitting in a car with housemate Shannon Kelly, 28. They plan to spend the night with a friend in Los Angeles.Officials said they were using all resources, including water-dropping helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft dropping fire retardant, but it was still burning out of control Wednesday afternoon. Andrew Dowd, a Ventura County fire spokesperson, said he did not have details of how many structures had been damaged.Gus Garcia, who owns a ranch south of the fire, said he's waiting to see whether conditions will change to decide if he should evacuate his horses and cattle. Around 12:30 p.m., his animals were still safe and he was trying to stay out of the way as others got their livestock out.His ranch is surrounded by others with horses and alpaca, and Garcia said his neighbors in the canyon did not seem panicked.""The horse community, they prepare for this because it's always a possibility up here,"" he said.Meanwhile to the south, Los Angeles County Fire Department crews scrambled to contain a wildfire near Malibu's Broad Beach as authorities briefly shut down the Pacific Coast Highway as flames burned near multimillion-dollar properties.

Fire officials said two structures burned.The National Weather Service office for the Los Angeles area amended its red flag warning for increased fire danger with a rare ""particularly dangerous situation"" label, and officials in several counties urged residents to be on watch for fast-spreading blazes, power outages and downed trees amid the latest round of notorious Santa Ana winds.With predicted gusts between 50 mph (80 kph) and 100 mph (160 kph) and humidity levels as low as 8%, parts of Southern California could experience conditions ripe for ""extreme and life-threatening"" fire behavior into Thursday, the weather service said.Forecasters also issued red flag warnings until Thursday from California's central coast through the San Francisco Bay Area and into counties to the north, where strong winds were also expected.Utilities in California began powering down equipment during high winds and extreme fire danger after a series of massive and deadly wildfires in recent years were sparked by electrical lines and other infrastructure.

Trump US-India Ties: Trump erratic but US-India ties will get stronger in second term,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-erratic-but-us-india-ties-will-get-stronger-in-second-term/articleshow/115035457.cms,"Ladies in Red

By Arun K Singh (Former Indian ambassador to US)The 2024 US presidential elections revealed the consolidation of some trends in US society with longer term consequences for both domestic politics and international engagements.Trump was in many ways a flawed candidate. Decision making in his first term had been erratic, as was also borne out in subsequent writings and comments of those who had worked closely with him, including his national security advisers H R McMaster and John Bolton. He was twice impeached by the US House of Representatives during his term. He was seen as having egged on the mob to attack the US Capitol in Jan 2021 to prevent the formal certification of his election defeat. He had the dubious distinction of being the first President to be convicted under a criminal charge. Yet he maintained control of the Republican party apparatus over the past four years. Republican congressmen and senators opposed him at the proven peril of losing subsequent primaries. His base remained loyal to him.Kamala Harris was a historic candidacy, of a first time African-American and Indian-American woman aspiring for the post. Yet, unlike in the case of President Obama in 2008, the majority of African-American and Latino males did not show support for her in pre-poll surveys. Even overall Indian American support for the Democratic candidate was seen as declining from 80% in 2016 for Hillary Clinton to 70% in 2020 for Joe Biden and now 60% in 2024 for someone who partially shared their ethnic origin.The answer clearly lay in the issues that were agitating voters. State of the economy (jobs, inflation) and illegal immigration were among the top concerns. Despite the Biden-Harris team having incentivised fresh actual or planned investments, including in semiconductors and other high technology areas through the Chips and Science Act, the Infrastructure and Inflation Reduction Acts, those who had lost jobs during the post-1990 phase of untrammeled globalisation still felt that the country was ""headed in the wrong direction"". Covid-induced infusion of money in the economy to minimise recession led to subsequent inflationary tendencies, leading to voter angst.In this scenario of anxiety, immigrants were seen as competing for jobs and resources. Democrats were seen as weaker in responding to this challenge. The incoming administration will no doubt adopt a tougher approach to illegal immigration. This will have an impact on Indians who have unfortunately been attempting to enter the US through the Mexico or Canadian borders. We will also need to monitor the politics around the H-1B and L visas, despite recognition in US business that they need the continued inflow of skilled persons to remain globally competitive.There will be a reappraisal of US' international engagements to assess costs and benefits. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has led the US to provide more than 100 billion dollars of economic and military assistance to Ukraine instead of more than a billion dollars. With the conflict now seen as a stalemate, some influential writing in US is questioning if search for the best solution can be the enemy of a good solution. Trump is expected to push for an end to active conflict. This will be positive from India's point of view since the India-Russia political, defense and economic relationship cannot come under any adversarial assessments.Trump 1.0 had clearly assessed China as an adversary in its national security and defense strategies. It had revived the Quad, laid out an Indo-Pacific strategy, renamed the Hawaii-based Pacific command as the Indo-Pacific command and declared India as an important partner for the region. It was China that had sucked away US manufacturing jobs through subsidies and built excess capacity, misusing WTO, thus creating Trump's loyal electoral base. Chinese unilateral and assertive actions in South and East China seas and its growing footprint globally are seen as testing US pre- eminence.The US-India relationship can be expected to consolidate further, despite occasional hiccups and differences. It has been on an upward trajectory since 2000, through Republican and Democratic administrations. In Trump 1.0, despite some acrimony and noise on trade issues, US placed India on STA-1 (Strategic Trade Authorization Level 1) for technology releases on par with its Nato partners and allies. In a departure from the past, Trump authorised the sale of armed drones to India. During the Galwan conflict with China in 2020, US shared information and intelligence, leased two drones for our navy, and provided some urgently required winter clothing for our troops. In the Biden-Harris administration, a major new initiative for cooperation on critical and emerging technologies was launched in AI, quantum, biotech, semiconductors, defense and space. Subsequently, six US companies announced investments in India in semiconductors. US authorised an unprecedented 80% technology transfer to India of the GE F414 jet engine. A new India-US defense acceleration ecosystem (INDUS-X) was initiated bringing together defense startups in both countries. Trump can be expected to build on this, since it is in US interest, but will no doubt give it a different branding to distance the continuing effort from the Biden decisions.However, there will inevitably be issues on which the two countries will not agree. The 2020 US agreement with the Taliban, Russia-Ukraine conflict, handling of the Pannun issue are recent examples. Statesmanship will lie in managing the differences, while keeping long-term goals and interest in view.","The 2024 US presidential elections revealed the consolidation of some trends in US society with longer term consequences for both domestic politics and international engagements.

RFK Jr reveals three key tasks Trump wants him to tackle in public health agencies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/rfk-jr-reveals-three-key-tasks-trump-wants-him-to-tackle-in-public-health-agencies/articleshow/115035249.cms,"-

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. revealed the specific mandate that former President Donald Trump has asked him to undertake if he assumes a leadership role within the US health agencies. A key advisor to Trump’s team, RFK Jr. outlined three major goals for the public health sector that focus on reform, scientific integrity, and public well-being.According to Kennedy, Trump has tasked him with three key objectives: first, to ""clean up the corruption"" within the health agencies, specifically addressing the conflicts of interest that have allowed industries, particularly the pharmaceutical and food sectors, to influence regulatory bodies.Second, Trump wants Kennedy to restore these agencies to their ""gold standard"" — a return to evidence-based, empirically grounded science that was the hallmark of American health policy in decades past.Finally, the third priority involves tackling the growing crisis of chronic disease in America, particularly among children, with Trump setting a goal of achieving measurable reductions in these diseases within two years.“The public health system has been captured by the interests it's supposed to regulate,"" Kennedy said in an exclusive interview with NBC News. “Donald Trump wants to see results: a measurable diminishment in chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and asthma among America’s kids. He’s clear that this is an urgent priority.”The surprising alignment between RFK Jr. and Donald Trump is rooted in their shared anti-establishment rhetoric. Kennedy, an environmental attorney and the son of the late Robert F. Kennedy, has long positioned himself as a maverick voice in US politics, especially with his outspoken opposition to vaccination policies. His controversial stance on the link between vaccines and autism, despite overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary, has made him a divisive figure in public health debates. However, his critique of government overreach and corporate influence in public policy resonates with Trump’s populist supporters.The potential appointment of Kennedy to a major health role in Trump’s administration — would mark a significant shift in public health policy. Trump’s campaign has made it clear that addressing the country’s epidemic of chronic diseases, particularly childhood illnesses, is a central part of his agenda. Kennedy’s stance against the influence of large corporations in public health policy aligns with Trump’s broader goal of reducing government regulations and reforming federal agencies.Despite his controversial views on vaccines, Kennedy has also been an advocate for environmental health, particularly in combating the detrimental effects of pollution and toxic chemicals on public health.","Robert F.

"Nikki Haley likely to be part of Trump team, feels Indian American Republican supporter Jiten Agarwal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nikki-haley-likely-to-be-part-of-trump-team-feels-indian-american-republican-supporter-jiten-agarwal/articleshow/115035182.cms,"She may have run against Donald Trump in the Republican presidential primary race, but former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley may still be a part of the President Elect’s team when he takes charge at White House next year, feels Jiten Agarwal, a prominent Indian American business and community leader and CEO of QuantAi, a global data and AI company.“I think Haley will have a place in Trump’s Cabinet. She has supported Trump over Kamala Harris after she dropped out of the presidential race. She was invited to speak at the Republican National Convention in the presence of Trump, who has also mentioned in an interview that Haley will have a place in his administration,” Agarwal, who had hosted high-profile fund-raising receptions for Trump and Vice-President elect J.D. Vance in Houston, Texas; and also supported Haley’s campaigns, told the Times of India.He feels that Indian Americans have emerged an influential community in the USA and played a significant role in the election of Trump for the second term. “Trump’s post on a social media platform on the attacks on the Hindus in Bangladesh and protecting their rights did mobilise the community to go out and vote,” Agarwal said. He added that there is a perception among the Indian American community that US foreign policy under the Trump administration is more favourable to India than the Democrats. “The recent Canada-India diplomatic fiasco led to a perception that the current administration in USA is not helping India at all. Many people do not like the Republican party’s stand on abortion and guns but it seems that other promises by the Trump-Vance team took the precedence,” Agarwal felt.A successful entrepreneur in Texas, Agarwal feels that Trump’s policies in his last tenure helped businesses tremendously and he hopes there will be a continuity this time too. “One of the most likely tax proposals to become a reality would be an extension of the tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first administration, which are set to expire in 2025. Those cuts lowered the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, reduced individual income tax rates, and increased the standard deduction. To lower housing costs, Trump has said he would allow homes to be built on federally protected land, something that could help increase the supply of homes in places like Nevada and Arizona,” Agarwal said. He feels that many Indian Americans who own large real estate businesses are upbeat about Trump’s proposal to promote home ownership through tax incentives.Agarwal feels that while Indian Americans were not an influential vote bloc until recently and their support did not matter to either Democrats or Republicans, significant efforts, by several community organisations such as HinduPact, Disha and Indian American PAC, to motivate and encourage Indian Americans to vote, are helping lift the visibility of the community. “We have been educating the community on the need to vote so that elected officials give more weight to our interests and views. People understand this and hence the voting percentage of Indian Americans has increased recently,” Agarwal said.","Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley may still be a part of the President Elect’s team when he takes charge at White House next year.

Bernie Sanders blasts democrats for abandoning working class voters after 2024 US election results,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bernie-sanders-blasts-democratic-party-for-abandoning-working-class-voters-after-2024-us-election-results/articleshow/115034925.cms,"Bernie Sanders

Senator Bernie Sanders has delivered a stinging rebuke of the Democratic Party ’s failure to address the needs of working-class Americans, claiming that the party’s abandonment of its core base has led to a significant loss of support among voters. Following the 2024 US elections, Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont, issued a statement accusing the party’s leadership of defending the status quo at a time when the American people are increasingly frustrated and calling for real change.“It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working-class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,” Sanders said in a statement following the election results. He highlighted the loss of support among not only white working-class voters , but also Latino and Black communities, whose backing has been crucial to Democratic victories in previous years.As the country braces for a likely Republican-controlled Senate and House of Representatives, with Donald Trump consolidating power, Sanders lamented the Democratic Party’s lack of a bold, transformative agenda. “While the very rich are doing phenomenally well, 60% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck,” he said, underscoring the growing economic inequality in the country. He also pointed to the stagnation of wages, noting that after accounting for inflation, real weekly wages for the average American worker are lower now than they were five decades ago.Sanders, who chairs the Senate health, education, labor and pensions committee, has long been a staunch advocate for government-funded universal healthcare, higher taxes on the wealthy, and ambitious solutions to tackle climate change. Despite his tireless efforts, he said the Democratic leadership has failed to enact significant policy changes that would improve the lives of working-class Americans. He also pointed to the challenges facing young people, many of whom are worried about a future marked by job insecurity and the rising threat of automation and artificial intelligence.A consistent critic of military intervention, Sanders also took issue with the Democratic Party’s foreign policy, particularly its continued support for Israel in its ongoing conflict with Hamas. He has repeatedly sought to block U.S. arms sales to Israel and has been outspoken in his opposition to the year-long war.""Today, despite strong opposition from a majority of Americans, we continue to spend billions funding the extremist Netanyahu government's all out war against the Palestinian people which has led to the horrific humanitarian disaster of mass malnutrition and the starvation of thousands of children,"" Sanders said in his statement.While Sanders endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race after Biden defeated him in the Democratic primaries, he made it clear in the past that he would not seek another run for the presidency. Instead, he chose to focus on endorsing progressive causes and working within Congress to achieve his policy goals.Looking ahead, Sanders called for a serious reassessment of the Democratic Party’s direction. ""Those of us concerned about grassroots democracy and economic justice need to have some very serious political discussions,"" he said.",Bernie Sanders has delivered a stinging rebuke of the Democratic Party ’s failure to address the needs of working-class Americans.

SRINAGAR: Pakistan has tested various artillery systems including a replica of the SH-15 and a 155 mm truck-mounted howitzer developed by a Chinese firm along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, according to officials. This comes as the neighbouring country strengthens defence ties with Gulf and Western European countries, and its long-standing ally Turkiye, the officials said.The movement of the 155 mm guns, produced in collaboration with a Gulf nation under the supervision of a state-owned Chinese defence company , along the LoC was observed recently, they said.The guns -- a variant of SH-15 that is known for its 'shoot and scoot' capability -- can fire a range of munitions, including high-explosive, armour-piercing and smoke rounds, boasting of a maximum range of approximately 30 kilometres and a firing rate of up to six rounds per minute.Among the arsenal being tested is the refurbished M109, which has a firing range of 24 kilometres and can launch six shells in just 40 seconds. Initially acquired from a Western European country, this artillery system is now undergoing trials in its enhanced version, the officials said.Turkiye has contributed to this military enhancement with the deployment of a modern 105 mm artillery piece manufactured by a Turkish defence company, FNSS, they said.This medium-weight tank is equipped with a two-man turret armed with a standard 105 mm rifled gun capable of firing both armour-piercing and high-explosive ammunition.China has also been instrumental in bolstering Pakistan's military capabilities along the LoC, according to the officials.This assistance includes construction of fortified bunkers, provision of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), combat aerial vehicles, and advanced communication systems, the officials said.Early this year, China's North Industries Group Corporation Limited (NORINCO) delivered the second batch of 56 SH-15 155 mm calibre wheeled self-propelled howitzers to the Pakistan army.Chinese support has also extended to the installation of encrypted communication towers and underground fibre optic cables along the LoC, the officials said.","Pakistan has tested various artillery systems including a replica of the SH-15 and a 155 mm truck-mounted howitzer developed by a Chinese firm.

DHAKA: Around 200 Bangladeshis abducted by security forces during toppled premier Sheikh Hasina's rule are still missing, a commission tasked with investigating enforced disappearances said Tuesday.Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India in August as a student-led uprising saw protesters flood streets of the capital Dhaka, bringing a dramatic end to her iron-fisted tenure.Her government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killing of hundreds of political opponents and the unlawful abduction and disappearance of hundreds more.A commission of inquiry set up by the caretaker government now running the country said that five people had been released from secret detention centres after Hasina's ouster, but that many more were still unaccounted for.""There is no trace of at least 200 people. We have been working to locate them,"" commission member Noor Khan said.The commission said it had identified at least eight secret detention centres in Dhaka and its outskirts, some with cells as small as three by four feet (90 by 120 centimetres).It said the walls of these cells had engravings that appeared to show their occupants having kept tally of the number of days they had been detained.One commissioner said there had been efforts by unnamed law enforcement agencies to erase evidence of these secret detention centres after Hasina's overthrow.Commissioners said most disappearance cases brought to its attention blamed the elite Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) police unit.The RAB was sanctioned by Washington in 2021 alongside seven of its senior officers in response to reports of its culpability in some of the worst rights abuses committed during Hasina's rule.Commission chair Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury said that institutional breakdowns in the government and judiciary had also allowed a climate of impunity to flourish under Hasina.""They used the law enforcement agency not in the public interest, but for their own agenda and political interest,"" he said.The commission was established by the interim government of Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus as part of its efforts to implement far-reaching democratic reforms.Yunus has previously said he inherited a ""completely broken down"" system of public administration that needed a comprehensive overhaul to prevent a future return to autocracy.","Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India in August as a student-led uprising saw protesters flood streets of the capital Dhaka.

MANDALAY: Sculptor Aung Naing Lin has spent decades carving Buddha statues to help guide Myanmar's faithful -- but getting the marble he needs from rebel-held quarries in the midst of civil war is now a perilous task.Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been mired in bloody conflict since the military toppled the government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021, terminating a 10-year experiment with democracy and sparking a widespread armed uprising.In recent months, opponents of the military have advanced with rocket and drone attacks on Mandalay -- the country's second-biggest city, with a population of 1.5 million.The rebels have also seized the hillside quarries that have for generations provided the marble that adorns Mandalay's palaces and monasteries, as well as the shrines in ordinary homes.Now, moving the precious stone and roughly carved statues by truck across the divide of the civil war, from rebel to junta-held territory, is expensive, difficult and dangerous.""The situation around the Madaya township (where the quarries are located) is not very good,"" Aung Naing Lin told AFP at his noisy workshop in Mandalay, his face and hair speckled with white dust.""It is not easy to go, and we cannot bring the stones back.""Surrounded by dozens of blank-faced Buddha statues waiting to be given eyes, ears and lips, Min Min Soe agreed.""Sales are not that bad, but the challenge is bringing the statues here,"" he said.""We can sell only the statues we have here and we cannot bring new raw statues in.""The owner of another workshop, who did not want to be named, said associates of his were recently arrested when taking a shipment of marble from rebel-held Madaya.""They were detained by the local military column and were asked how they brought the stones out from the village as that area was controlled by the PDF,"" they said.""People's Defence Forces"" are units made up of former students, farmers and workers who have left their lives behind to take up arms and oppose the junta's coup.There are dozens of PDFs across the country, and they have dragged the junta into a bloody stalemate.The junta has designated them as ""terrorists"", and contact with them can bring years in prison.""Later, they released the people who had been detained and gave the stones back,"" the workshop owner said.""It's like a warning to all. We dare not to bring stones from the village under this situation.""The quarries of Madaya have long been interwoven with the cultural and religious history of Myanmar.In the 1860s, following two disastrous wars with the British, then-king Mindon commissioned craftsmen in Mandalay to transfer Buddhist scriptures from palm leaf manuscripts onto 720 blocks of solid marble to ensure they survived any further destruction.The stone also resonates with the military that has ruled Myanmar for much of its history since independence from Britain in 1948.In 2020, it sanctioned the building of a 25-metre (82-foot) high statue of the Buddha made from Madaya marble to adorn its custom-built capital Naypyidaw.Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing declared the statue finished last year and a visit has since become a stock feature of the itineraries of the few foreign delegations that visit the isolated junta.While the fighting continues north of Mandalay, Min Min Soe and others work to put the finishing touches on the dozens of roughly hewn statues.Their forefathers used chisels, but nowadays, craftsmen use drills to etch everything from Buddha's face, the folds in his robe, fingernails and the lotus flower he sits on.The laborious final stages of smoothing the rough edges are done by women using sandpaper, said Min Min Soe.""Women are better at this as they are more patient,"" he said.A finished statue around 25 centimetres (10 inches) high fetches between 100,000 - 200,000 Myanmar kyat ($50-$100 at the official exchange rate), he said.Outside one of the workshops on the busy street, workers packed a sitting Buddha statue into a wooden protective frame before shipping it off to a customer.Min Min Soe says looking after the dozens of his creations still in stock helps him find his own peace amid rumours of an attack on Mandalay.He considers them ""living Buddhas"".""I clean the statues at 4 am every day... This is not only for my business but also to gain merit,"" he said.""I want them to be clean and good-looking no matter if they are sold or not.""",Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been mired in bloody conflict since the military toppled the government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021.

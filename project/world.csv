Bola Tinubu offers condolences:

Why is flooding so dangerous in Nigeria?





The death toll from widespread floods in central Nigeria rose to more than 150 people on Saturday, local emergency services reported.After torrential rains earlier in the week, flood waters have swept away more than 50 homes in the market town of Mokwa in the central Niger State.Ibrahim Audu Husseini, spokesperson for the Niger State emergency agency told AFP on Friday that he ""expected the toll to rise considerably because there are different rescuers at different locations.""Additionally, more than 3,000 people have been displaced.Nigerian President Bola Tinubu offered his condolences to those affected and said federal agencies had been instructed to help with the emergency response.""I extend my heartfelt condolences to the affected families and the good people of Niger State at this difficult time,"" he said on social media.""Search-and-rescue operations are ongoing, and all relevant federal agencies have been mobilized to support the state government’s efforts,"" Tinubu added.""Relief materials and temporary shelter assistance are being deployed without delay.""Mokwa is a key local hub for traders from the south of the country and farmers from the north.It is located around 220 kilometers (140 miles) west of the capital Abuja.The flooding was triggered by several hours of heavy rain, with the collapse of a nearby dam exacerbating the situation.Nigeria's Meteorological Agency warned of possible flash floods in 15 of Nigeria's 36 states, including Niger State, between Wednesday and Friday.Nigeria's rainy season has only just started and normally lasts around six months.The annual occurrence regularly kills hundreds of people. A lack of drainage, the construction of homes on waterways and the dumping of waste in drains and water channels all make the flooding worse.Nigeria suffered one of its worst disasters in decades in 2024, with flooding killing more than 1,200 people and displacing another 1.2 million.The flooding, which impacted 31 of the country's 36 states, also destroyed more than 1.4 million hectares (3.5 million acres) of farmland.","Flood waters have swept away more than 50 homes in the market town of Mokwa in the central Niger State.

Poland holds knife-edge vote with EU role at stake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/poland-holds-knife-edge-vote-with-eu-role-at-stake/articleshow/121545184.cms,"Rafal Trzaskowski (left) and Karol Nawrocki (right) (File Photo)

Ukraine:







Poles are set to vote on Sunday in a knife-edge presidential election with major implications for the country's role in Europe and for abortion and LGBTQ rights.Warsaw's pro-EU mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, 53, an ally of the centrist government, faces off against nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki, 42.Opinion polls predict an extremely close race with Nawrocki on 50.1 per cent and Trzaskowski on 49.9 per cent, a tiny difference within the margin of error.Polls are open between 0500 GMT and 1900 GMT in the EU and Nato country, which borders Ukraine and has been a key supporter of its neighbour against Russia.An exit poll is expected as soon as ballots close and election officials predict the final result will be known on Monday.A victory for Trzaskowski would be a major boost for the progressive agenda of the government led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, a former European Council president.It could mean significant social changes such as the introduction of civil partnerships for same-sex couples and an easing of the near-total ban on abortion.Presidents in Poland, a fast-growing economy of 38 million people, have the power to veto legislation and are also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.Victory for Nawrocki would embolden the populist Law and Justice (PiS) party, which ruled Poland between 2015 and 2023, and could lead to fresh parliamentary elections.Many Nawrocki supporters want stricter curbs on immigration and advocate for conservative values and more sovereignty for the country within the European Union ""We should not give in to European pressure,"" 40-year-old Agnieszka Prokopiuk, a homemaker, said ahead of the vote.""We need to make our own way... and not succumb to trends from the West,"" she told AFP in the city of Biala Podlaska in eastern Poland near the Belarus border.Tomasz Czublun, a 48-year-old mechanic, said: ""The European Union is important but the sovereignty of our country is much more important.""Anna Materska-Sosnowska, a politics expert, called the election ""a real clash of civilisations"" because of the wide policy differences between the candidates.Many Trzaskowski voters support greater integration within the EU and an acceleration of social reforms.Malgorzata Wojciechowska, a tour guide and teacher in her fifties, said Polish women ""unfortunately do not have the same rights as our European friends"".""I hope that Rafal Trzaskowski will relaunch the debate on abortion so that we can finally live in a free country where we can have our own opinion,"" she told AFP.The election is also being closely watched in Ukraine, which is seeking to bolster international diplomatic support in its negotiations with Russia as its resistance to Moscow's invasion grinds on.Nawrocki, an admirer of US President Donald Trump, opposes Nato membership for Kyiv and has called for curbs on benefits for the estimated one million Ukrainian refugees in Poland.He used his last campaign hours on Friday to leave flowers at a monument to Poles killed by Ukrainian nationalists during World War II.""It was a genocide against the Polish people,"" he said.The election's final result is expected to hinge on whether Trzaskowski can mobilise enough supporters and whether far-right voters will cast their ballots for Nawrocki.Far-right candidates got more than 21 per cent of the vote in the election's first round, which Trzaskowski won by a razor-thin margin of 31 per cent against 30 per cent for Nawrocki.","Warsaw's pro-EU mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, 53, faces off against nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki, 42.

Museum backs director's return





The Art Institute of Chicago's director, James Rondeau, is set to return to his position Monday after being temporarily sidelined due to a bizarre and embarrassing incident on an international flight that saw him reportedly strip naked mid-air.Rondeau, who earns more than $1 million annually as the museum's highest-paid employee, was detained by German authorities on April 18 upon landing in Munich. According to reports, he became intoxicated after consuming alcohol and prescription medication, eventually disrobing in-flight aboard a United Airlines flight from Chicago.The 55-year-old museum chief was taken into custody by German police after the plane touched down, sparking an internal crisis at one of the nation's most respected art institutions. Rondeau later took a voluntary leave of absence while the museum launched an independent investigation into the incident.In a statement released through CBS News, Rondeau expressed remorse for the ordeal, ""I deeply regret this incident and the impact it has had on the museum and me and on my colleagues. I have dedicated the past 27 years of my professional career to the Art Institute and I am grateful to have the opportunity to continue furthering its mission.""Despite the public embarrassment, the Art Institute has decided to reinstate Rondeau, citing confidence in his leadership.""Board leadership of the Art Institute of Chicago has conducted an independent investigation of this incident and is confident in James Rondeau’s leadership and ability to continue as the president and director of the museum,"" a museum spokesperson told CBS News.Rondeau has been with the Art Institute since 1998, when he began as an associate curator.

A 58-year-old Oklahoma man, Rodney Shippy, fatally shot his 10-year-old son and the family dog before taking his own life inside their home.Police made the grim discovery on Wednesday while serving a search warrant after relatives reported Rodney’s 20-year-old daughter, Alyssa Shippy, missing since November.Officers initially found the bodies of Rodney, his son Logan, and the dog. Alyssa’s body was later discovered inside the same home. Due to the condition of the house, her remains were not immediately visible, police said. A medical examiner is working to determine her cause of death.""We are heartbroken to share that two beloved members of our family, Alyssa and Logan (brother and sister) passed away tragically and unexpectedly,"" their family wrote on a GoFundMe page.""Their loss has left our family in deep grief and unprepared for the financial burden that comes with arranging their funerals,"" they added.This is the latest in a string of tragedies to hit the family. In August 2022, Rodney’s wife, Lisa Shippy, died by suicide at the same residence. Five months later, Lisa’s mother, Diane Carpenter, was stabbed to death by her husband, Kenny Carpenter, who later took his own life during a police standoff in January 2023, according to the New York Post.A motive behind the tragic killings remains unknown. However, public records indicate that Rodney Shippy was facing serious financial difficulties. The home, which he and his wife purchased in 2021, was at risk of foreclosure.In January, the US Bank national association filed a foreclosure notice, citing $135,000 in unpaid principal. Court documents show Shippy was given until June to respond to the notice.As the investigation continues, neighbors shared that 10-year-old Logan Shippy had autism and was nonverbal. They described the family’s home as ""not suitable"" for children, pointing to poor living conditions.""Not suitable for a child, no running water, trash - looked like a completely different house,"" said relative Patti Williams.She also said that after wife Lisa’s death, Rodney tried to keep it together however, over time he began estranging himself from everyone.","Rodney Shippy, 58, fatally shot his 10-year-old son and the family dog before taking his own life inside their home.

"Russia an 'immediate' threat, China a 'sophisticated' one: What UK defence review warns against",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/russia-an-immediate-threat-china-a-sophisticated-one-what-uk-defence-review-warns-against/articleshow/121544911.cms,"



The United Kingdom's defence review has warned against “immediate and pressing” threat from Russia, meanwhile, China poses a “sophisticated and persistent challenge”. The government's strategic review is set to be concluded on Monday, the Guardian reported.A 130-page document authored by three advisers to UK PM Keir Starmer also suggested on drawing extensively on lessons from the war in Ukraine. While Russia was the central concern, the document also highlighted China, that has at times cooperated with Moscow. It further identified Iran and North Korea as smaller but significant “regional disruptors.”According to the report, Britain was entering “a new era of threat,” as drones, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies were transforming the nature of warfare more profoundly than ever before.The analysis is not expected to announce new defence spending commitments but will reaffirm Starmer’s February pledge to raise the defence budget to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, and to 3% in the following parliament. However, the document is likely to support a major medium-term spending increase—potentially exceeding £50 billion in real terms—that may be agreed at the upcoming Nato summit in June.There, Western allies are considering a proposal to raise core defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2032, with an additional 1.5% dedicated to cyber and infrastructure efforts, partly in response to mounting pressure from US President Donald Trump.It is also expected to address the issue of British army size, as tensions continue between the ministry of defence and the treasury over whether to commit to increasing troop numbers beyond the current target of 73,000. This comes amid fresh figures revealing that the army's strength has fallen to 70,860 full-time trained soldiers as of 1 April—its lowest level since the Napoleonic era—marking a 2.3% decline over the past year.Meanwhile, US defense secretary Pete Hegseth has also warned Indo-Pacific allies of an ""imminent threat"" from China, reassuring them that they would not face growing military and economic pressure from the country alone.","Britain's defence review has warned against “immediate and pressing” threat from Russia.

Poll What do you think about the appropriateness of political speeches at graduation ceremonies? They are important for raising awareness. They should focus solely on the graduates.

Viral: MIT Grad Wears Arab Headscarf; Torches Alma Mater’s Israel Ties In Viral Speech |Megha Vemuri





At an already fractious time in US academia, an Indian-American undergrad at the famed Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) torched her own alma mater's ties to the Israeli military and spoke up for Palestine in the face of growing pressure from the Trump administration on US institutions to clamp down on criticism of Israel.Megha Vemuri, a senior class president at MIT, did not hold back during a graduation ceremony on Thursday, accusing Israel of trying to ""wipe Palestine off the face of the earth,"" and lamenting ""it is a shame that MIT is a part of it.""""Right now, while we prepare to graduate and move forward with our lives, there are no universities left in Gaza,"" Vemuri, who completed her undergraduate degree in computer science, neuroscience, and linguistics and served as president of the graduating class, said in remarks that was greeted with cheers from students at the convocation.Vemuri trained her guns on MIT itself and recalled that students scored a major victory earlier this year, forcing MIT to end its partnership with Elbit Systems, who are Israel’s largest weapons manufacturer, whose drones and surveillance systems are said to have been widely used in Israeli attacks on Gaza.""The Israeli occupation forces are the only foreign military that MIT has research ties with. As scientists, engineers, academics, and leaders, we have a commitment to support life.Support aid efforts, call for an arms embargo, and keep demanding that MIT cuts the ties,"" Vemuri said.MIT President Sally Kornbluth, who spoke immediately after Vemuri, ignored her criticism of MIT, and while acknowledging the institution valued freedom of expression, she said, ""Today is about the graduates,"" a sentiment shared by critics who accused her of political grandstanding instead of focusing on academics.""Graduation speeches are meant to inspire, not divide. Turning a shared moment into a personal political stage, especially with such a charged issue, is unfair to fellow students,"" one critic wrote on social media, where clips of her speech went viral.Others found her remarks courageous and inspirational. ""Her speech makes me proud as an Indian! Well done here, on the right side of history,"" read one of hundreds of reactions on X, even as more extreme critics doxxed her and warned that she would never be able to get a job.Vemuri's remarks came even as US secretary of state Marco Rubio had announced that the Trump administration would deny visas to foreign nationals who come to the United States to foment hatred against the Jewish community.While few details are available on the young undergrad, she appears to be a US-born daughter of immigrants from India. Her social media profile shows she went to school in Alpharetta, Georgia, home to many healthcare, insurance, and manufacturing companies.","Megha Vemuri, a senior class president at MIT, did not hold back during a graduation ceremony on Thursday.

Vice President JD Vance broke his silence amid the ongoing H-1B row and the controversy over the Donald Trump administration's crackdown on universities. In an interview with the Newsmax, Vance dismissed criticisms that the crackdown will lead to an academic brain drain in the US.""First of all, I've heard a lot of the criticisms, the fear that we're going to have a brain drain,"" Vance said. ""If you go back to the '50s and '60s, the American space program, the program that was the first to put a human being on the surface of the moon, was built by American citizens — some German and Jewish scientists who had come over during World War II, but mostly, by American citizens who built an incredible space program with American talent,"" Vance said.""This idea that American citizens don't have the talent to do great things ... do you have to import a foreign class of [students] and professors to do these things? I just reject it. I just think we should invest in our own people. We can do a lot of good.""Vance's comments came amid a fresh row over H-1B as the USCIS revealed that they have selected 120.141 H-1B visa applications for 2026. Several companies, including Walmart, announced job cuts, enraging US workers as they allege that the administration is not doing enough to put Americans first -- as companies are still relying on cheap labor from outside.Moving on to his second point, Vance defended the crackdown on universities and said, ""These institutions do an important job; but if you back up and look at American higher education over the past 20 or 30 years, there are a few incontrovertible facts.""""No. 1, the hard sciences, particularly biology, we have a terrible what is called a reproducibility crisis, meaning most of the papers that are published in biology don't replicate; they're not good science. So even our elite universities are not often doing good science.""Second important point, these institutions — sometimes by their own admission — are engaging in explicit racial discrimination, often against whites and Asians in explicit violation of the Civil Rights Act. If the people's government can't come in, given those problems, and say, 'Look, we've got to have some accountability here; you can't violate the Civil Rights Act,'"" he continued.""We've got to make sure that if we're funding science with federal money, you're actually doing good science. That's called accountability.""Vance said this is not 'fascism' and if the American taxpayer is frustrated with these universities, they have got to reform. ""What they're doing instead, what too many of them are doing and saying, 'Aw, the Trump administration, this is dictatorial, this is fascism.' No, this is democratic accountability, and I think universities ought to see it as an opportunity. If they do that, they're going to get better, and the American people will be better off because of it,"" he said.","Vice President JD Vance broke his silence amid the ongoing H-1B row and the controversy over the Donald Trump administration's crackdown on universities.

The Bluesky post on Katie Miller, Stephen Miller and Elon Musk went viral.





Katie Miller was one of the advisors who decided to work for Elon Musk full time as Musk exited the White House wrapping his DOGE work up. Katie Miller was working as DOGE's spokesperson and as the bridge between DOGE and the administration. But her exit from the White House led to wild rumors though she was not alone in choosing Elon Musk over White House. Steve Davis, James Burnham too reportedly left their DOGE roles for Elon Musk.Katie Miller is the wife of Stephen Miller, the deputy chief of staff of the White House. Since the rumors involve Elon Musk, the rumor-mongers chose Bluesky as their safe haven to gossip about what they called a 'throuple'.A viral post on Bluesky claimed that Stephen Miller user his wife Katie to have an eye on Elon Musk when Musk was working in the White House. It claimed that Stephen even claimed to people that he runs Elon Musk. But now Katie is choosing Musk over him, not only workwise but also in their relationships and that led to Stephen Miller's meltdown on X as he defended Donald Trump's 'Big, beautiful bill' that Elon Musk didn't like.But Stephen praised Elon Musk too. Reposting Elon Musk's announcement that he would be exiting DOGE, Miller wrote: ""The work DOGE has done to eliminate government waste and corruption — the rot embedded deep within Washington — is among the most valuable services ever rendered to government.And the work has only just begun.""Katie Miller posted a quote that Elon Musk once said when he was asked about what would happen to DOGE once he leaves. ""DOGE is a way of life, like Buddhism,"" Elon Musk said. Katie Miller repeated that though social media users already conjectured that she is going to be the next 'baby mama'.","Katie Miller was one of the advisors who decided to work for Elon Musk full time as Musk exited the White House wrapping his DOGE work up.

Conservative pushback





Former First Lady Michelle Obama is drawing criticism after saying that creating life is ""the least"" of what a woman's reproductive system does. The remarks came during the latest episode of her podcast 'IMO with Michelle Obama & Craig Robinson. 'In a wide-ranging discussion on women's health and abortion rights, Obama said the conversation around reproductive issues has been unfairly narrowed. ""Women's reproductive health is about our life,"" she said. ""It's about this whole complicated reproductive system that the least of what it does is produce life. It's a very important thing that it does, but you only produce life if the machine that's producing it — if you want to whittle us down to a machine — is functioning in a healthy, streamlined kind of way. ""The former first lady emphasised that the lack of medical research and understanding of women's health often leads to narrow or misguided political decision-making, particularly among male lawmakers. She also criticised Republican men for inaction on abortion rights, accusing them of ""trading out women's health for a tax break or whatever it is.""Additionally, Obama aimed at GOP women, suggesting some had voted for US President Donald Trump because of their husbands' influence.""There are a lot of women who vote the way their man is going to vote,"" she said. ""It happened in this election.""Her comments quickly ignited backlash on social media and from conservative figures, who accused Obama of diminishing the importance of motherhood.""Motherhood is the most beautiful and powerful gift God gave women. Creating life isn't a side effect, it's a miracle,"" wrote Danielle D'Souza Gill, a prominent pro-life advocate and wife of Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas. ""Don't let the Left cheapen it.""Isabel Brown, a conservative author and influencer, also lashed out. ""I am SO sick and tired of celebrities and elitists attempting to convince you that your miraculous superpower ability to GROW LIFE from nothing is somehow demeaning and ‘lesser than' for women,"" she posted.Social media users echoed those sentiments, with some questioning whether Obama's comments reflected her views on her own children.

It was unclear whether Musk used drugs while leading the department of government efficiency (DOGE), the agency Trump created in January.Musk first avoided a question about his drug use during a farewell appearance with Trump in the Oval Office on Friday, where he was seen with a visible black eye.The event marked the end of his role as Trump's chief cost-cutter at the department of government efficiency, DOGE, which oversaw the dismissal of tens of thousands of civil servants.He explained the injury came from playing with his young son, named X, saying he told the child to hit him, and the boy did.

US President Donald Trump is pulling back his nomination of tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to serve as Nasa administrator just days before he was set to receive a confirmation vote in the senate, said a person familiar with the decision on Saturday.The individual spoke on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, says AP.Trump had announced last December during the presidential transition that Isaacman was his pick for Nasa administrator. Isaacman, founder and CEO of the payment processing company Shift4, has been closely linked to Elon Musk since he purchased his first SpaceX flight in 2021.Isaacman has flown multiple missions with SpaceX and took part in the first private spacewalk. He testified at his senate confirmation hearing on April 9, and a committee vote on his nomination had been expected soon.During his committee hearing, Isaacman distanced himself from Musk by pledging to prioritize a lunar landing if confirmed as Nasa administrator—a goal Musk had dismissed as a “distraction.”Nasa has been without a senate-confirmed administrator since January 20, when Bill Nelson stepped down.SpaceX is owned by Musk, a Trump supporter and adviser who recently stepped down from his role as head of the department of government efficiency, or DOGE. The agency, created by Trump, aimed to reduce the size of government.Semafor was the first to report the decision to pull Isaacman’s nomination.","Jared Isaacman, founder and CEO of the payment processing company Shift4, has been closely linked to Elon Musk since he purchased his first SpaceX flight in 2021.

The judge's data dilemma in the Google search case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-judges-data-dilemma-in-the-google-search-case/articleshow/121544315.cms,"Liz Reid, of Google, speaks about new search AI capabilities in Mountain View, Calif, on May 20, 2025.





Data played a starring role in the government's successful antitrust suit against Google accusing it of illegally protecting its monopoly in online search. Now, steps to force Google to unlock its data trove could figure prominently in a ruling on how to address the tech giant's dominance, antitrust experts say.On Friday, the federal judge overseeing the case, Amit P Mehta, heard closing arguments in federal court in Washington on what corrective measures, known as remedies, he should order to restore competition. The government's requests include forcing Google to share its search engine results and advertising data with rivals.Justice Department lawyers have repeatedly described data as ""the oxygen"" for search engines. And in his ruling against Google in August, Mehta recounted in detail how the company harvests vast amounts of data from user searches and web crawling, then stores and analyzes the data to rule the lucrative market for internet search.Google, he noted, collects nine times as much user search data every day as all its rivals combined. And as more data is fed into Google's software, the results that the search engine returns on everything from biology to bluejeans become more accurate and relevant to the person seeking information.Better search performance, in turn, attracts more users and more advertisers, Mehta wrote. It's a flywheel that steadily enhances Google's search and acts as a barrier to competition.""At every stage in the search process,"" the judge wrote, ""user data is a critical input that directly improves quality.""His decision on how to fix Google's monopoly has the potential to reshape competition on the internet, particularly as a new age of generative artificial intelligence takes off and is expected to overhaul the way people search for information online. Tech companies are racing to win consumers over with chatbots and other tools that can answer more sophisticated questions, drawing from vast pools of data.Mehta has already indicated that AI may factor into his deliberations, noting during a recent hearing the rapid development of the technology since the lawsuit went to trial in the fall of 2023.To fix Google's search monopoly, the Justice Department and the group of states that brought the case have recommended a range of sanctions, from simply prohibiting anticompetitive deals with companies that Google pays to make it the automatic search engine to forcing the company to sell off its market-leading Chrome browser.The government's data-related proposal falls somewhere in between. It includes requiring Google to share user search information and license its search index, a database of hundreds of billions of webpages scored by popularity, quality and relevance.In late April, Mehta said he looked at his job as weighing actions across a ""remedy spectrum."" At one end was a breakup order, he said, while at the minimalist end was a ban on illegal deals with browser and smartphone companies.In the middle were ""forward-looking remedies,"" he said, without elaborating on his thinking.Given the evidence in the case, a data-sharing order would be ""a conceptually appropriate remedy,"" since the exclusive deals increased Google's data advantage, said Douglas Melamed, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division and now a visiting fellow at the Stanford Law School.Still, a data-sharing project raises its own set of questions. In court testimony, Google emphasized the privacy concerns of passing user search data along to other companies.The government's data proposal also calls for access to software that uses data as an ingredient but was built by Google's engineers.""It looks like an administrative headache -- how much data, how often, and access to Google's crown jewel?"" said John Yun, an economist at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University.Google has described the government's data-sharing plan as the equivalent of a breakup -- a forced surrender of its intellectual property, allowing competitors to reverse-engineer its technology.""The proposal on data sharing is so far-reaching, so extraordinary,"" that it ""feels like de facto divestiture of search,"" Sundar Pichai , CEO of Alphabet, Google's parent company, testified in court last month.The history of forced asset sharing as a solution for monopolistic behavior is mixed. In 1956, as part of an antitrust settlement with the government, AT&T agreed to license its patents, including for transistors, the tiny switches that are the building blocks of electronic circuitry. That opened the door to an independent semiconductor industry in what became Silicon Valley.But the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which was intended to increase competition for local telephone service by mandating that companies share network capacity, didn't result in much innovation.Eventually, genuine competition emerged, but it came from mobile wireless and cable broadband companies, said Jon Nuechterlein, a telecom expert and former general counsel of the Federal Trade Commission. Landline voice service has fallen from nearly 100% of households in 1996 to about 25% today.""Outside competition emerged independent of all the regulatory churn,"" said Nuechterlein, a distinguished scholar at George Washington University's Competition Law Center.Today, AI is the big unknown in search. Chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude, the AI-powered search engine Perplexity, and others are potential Google disrupters. Google itself is investing heavily in AI-enhanced search, which Pichai recently described as ""a total reimagining of search.""While Mehta has more recently acknowledged the rapid advance of AI, his ruling in August noted that the technology had yet to overtake traditional search.""AI has not supplanted the traditional ingredients that define general search,"" he wrote. ""Importantly, generative AI has not (or, at least, not yet) eliminated or materially reduced the need for user data to deliver quality search results.""Some antitrust experts say Mehta's decision could affect search and AI.""The explosion of AI makes it even more important to have strong data-sharing remedies,"" said Gene Kimmelman, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division. ""AI and search overlap, and both ride on data.""","Google collects nine times as much user search data every day as all its rivals combined.

Family’s unwavering hope





Devarjaye 'DJ' Daniel, the 13-year-old Texas boy who captured hearts across America with his courage in battling terminal brain cancer and his dream of becoming a police officer, has been diagnosed with three new tumours, the White House confirmed on Friday.DJ, who was sworn in by US President Donald Trump earlier this year during a joint session of Congress, became a national symbol of resilience and hope. Despite receiving a grim prognosis in 2018, doctors then said he had less than five months to live. DJ has undergone numerous brain surgeries and defied expectations, thanks in part to a clinical research program.His father, Theodis Daniel, shared the news with White House officials.“We’re lifting up Agent DJ Daniel in prayer after his dad, Theodis, shared that DJ is now facing three new tumors,” the White House posted on X. “DJ is one of the strongest, bravest young men—and has now been sworn into 1,351 law enforcement agencies across the country. Agent Daniel, you're a true legend.”DJ’s dream of becoming a police officer has taken him on a cross-country journey of honour. With the support of law enforcement agencies nationwide, he has been ceremonially sworn in by over 1,300 departments, surpassing his original goal of 1,000 and setting a new benchmark of inspiration.His most recent swearing-in was with the Williamson County sheriff’s office in Texas. Deputy Jeffrey Combs recalled the emotional moment: “I saw Theodis pick his son up. I felt that unconditional love, and I just knew I had to find DJ. So, it all worked out.”In April, DJ was also named an honorary officer of the United States park police by interior secretary Doug Burgum, himself a cancer survivor.Speaking to FOX 7 Austin, Theodis Daniel described the toll the new diagnosis has taken on the family. “It’s rough. There isn’t a class that can teach you how to deal with it. You’re hearing that your child has a nasty disease,” he said. “We’re just winging it day by day.”Despite the worsening prognosis, DJ’s family continues to spread a message of unity and compassion. “We're just going around showing people, ‘Hey, you do care for one another,’” Theodis said. “Let’s give compassion, and let’s try to join and help each other get through things.”","Devarjaye 'DJ' Daniel, 13, has been diagnosed with three new tumours.

(AP)





NEW YORK: The latest crime thriller gripping New York is the alleged kidnapping of a wealthy Italian man whose captors attempted to torture the crypto millionaire into giving up his bitcoin password.It began amid the backdrop of wild parties, immortalized in pop culture through films like ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" in a posh Manhattan nightclub where the nouveau riche and flashy Wall Street bros congregate.It ended on the morning of May 23, when a man ran to a police officer near Mulberry and Prince streets in the Soho district of Manhattan.The barefoot man claimed he had just escaped a luxurious apartment where he was held captive for 17 days after entering the United States.Police arrived at the scene and arrested John Woeltz, 37, dubbed ""the crypto king of Kentucky"" by tabloids, who is facing charges of kidnapping, criminal possession of weapons, assault and unlawful imprisonment.Woeltz's 24-year-old assistant was also detained but does not face the same charges.A second man, William Duplessie, 33, who is the founder of the startup Pangea Blockchain International, turned himself in on Tuesday and was charged similarly to Woeltz.Duplessie, who originally hails from Miami, appeared in court Friday wearing a jail uniform.- Philosophy degree -According to details reported by local media, the presumed victim is Italian cryptocurrency entrepreneur Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, who visited John Woeltz's rented home -- which goes for $30,000 a month -- upon arriving from Italy on May 6.Once there, Woeltz and Duplessie confiscated his electronic devices and passport, and demanded the access code to his bitcoin assets, police said.After his refusal, the two men allegedly tortured Carturan, striking him with a rifle, pointing the weapon in his face and taking him to the building's fifth floor, where they threatened to throw him out the window, local media reported.""He's a 37-year-old man with no prior criminal record. He's a college graduate with a degree in philosophy. He has been very successful in the technology world,"" Woeltz's lawyer Wayne Ervin Gosnell said during a court hearing Thursday.The defense requested Woeltz's conditional release in the state of New York in exchange for a $2 million bond.Gosnell also noted that it has been said Woeltz ""owns a private jet, he owns a helicopter. That is not true.""- Lavish lifestyle -Though Woeltz has neither a jet nor a helicopter, he leads an exceedingly lavish lifestyle, according to the New York Post and TMZ, which published racy images of the suspects partying at The Box, a New York nightclub.The Post also mentioned frequent parties at the Soho apartment that is the scene of the alleged kidnapping.In recent months, cases of kidnappings or attempted abductions in the cryptocurrency world have multiplied globally as bitcoin, the most capitalized cryptocurrency, has grown to historical peaks.For Adam Healy, CEO of Station70, a firm specializing in crypto protection, these crimes are not new -- he worked on a case years ago when an American traveling to Egypt was kidnapped for his crypto assets.""I think that the frequency and the ruthlessness is increasing,"" Healy said.In the last six to eight months, he has seen ""a significant uptick in those that are known to hold crypto or executives at crypto firms, things along those lines, getting targeted by a wide range of different criminals.""Healy attributed part of the uptick in crime to the rising price of bitcoin.""It's a bigger target,"" he said, and they are boosted by the ease with which massive payloads can be transferred with no oversight -- as long as the crypto user can log in.""Historically, if you wanted to kidnap something that was high net worth and they had, I don't know, ten million dollars in their JP Morgan account, it was kind of hard to get to,"" Healy said.""You couldn't just go to the bank and get a million dollars out.""","The alleged kidnapping of a wealthy Italian man is the latest crime thriller gripping New York.

'There is really no way': Kristi Noem's story of immigrant threatening Trump is fake?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/there-is-really-no-way-kristi-noems-story-of-immigrant-threatening-trump-is-fake/articleshow/121542562.cms,"Kristi Noem





US homeland security secretary Kristi Noem 's claim that an undocumented immigrant had threatened to assassinate US President Donald Trump is now under scrutiny, as new evidence suggests the man may have been falsely accused to force his deportation.Noem had announced the arrest of 54-year-old Ramon Morales Reyes, alleging he had sent a letter vowing to shoot Trump and then flee to Mexico. The letter, shared by Noem and later highlighted by the White House and Trump allies on social media, was written in light blue ink and appeared to express fury over immigration policies.However, a person familiar with the investigation told the AP that authorities now believe Morales Reyes did not write the letter. Instead, law enforcement suspected that he was framed, possibly to prevent him from testifying in an upcoming trial in which he is listed as a victim of assault. The source said that the handwritten threat did not match Morales Reyes' writing style after which officials concluded that the threat was not credible.Despite this, the department of homeland security issued a statement naming Morales Reyes as the author and describing him as a threat, a move that has drawn criticism and confusion.The department has since said the investigation remains “ongoing,” and that Reyes is in the country illegally and has a criminal record.His legal team disputed those claims, saying he is not currently facing any charges and has no knowledge of past convictions.“There is really no way that it could be even remotely true,” said Kime Abduli, Morales Reyes’ immigration lawyer. “We're asking for a clarification and a correction from DHS to clear Ramon’s name of anything having to do with this.”Morales Reyes, a dishwasher in Milwaukee, was arrested on 21 May and is currently being held at a county jail in Juneau, Wisconsin. He lives with his wife and three children and had recently applied for a U visa, which offers protection to undocumented immigrants who have been victims of serious crimes.The immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera has called for his release, and Morales Reyes is expected to appear before a Chicago immigration court next week for a bond hearing.Meanwhile, Milwaukee police have launched a separate investigation into possible identity theft and witness intimidation in connection with the case. The local district attorney’s office confirmed the matter is under active review.Morales Reyes had been due to testify in a July trial involving a man accused of assaulting him, a case that may now be further complicated by his sudden detention.","Kristi Noem announced the arrest of Ramon Morales Reyes, alleging he had sent a letter vowing to shoot Trump and then flee to Mexico.

Joe Biden's son Hunter spotted parking rental car in South Africa after losing security detail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/joe-bidens-son-hunter-spotted-parking-rental-car-in-south-africa-after-losing-security-detail/articleshow/121542220.cms,"Joe Biden's son Hunter spotted parking rental car in South Africa (Image credit: Fox News)





Former US President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, was spotted in Cape Town, South Africa, on Friday, enjoying a low-key outing with his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, and their young son, Beau Biden Jr. The family was seen driving a modest rented Toyota sedan, a stark contrast to the black Chevy Suburbans that once accompanied him during his father's presidency.Hunter, now without Secret Service protection, was photographed strolling along Sea Point Main Road, a popular and affluent area in Cape Town. The family paid for street parking and made a stop at a local butcher, with no visible security in tow.This marks Hunter Biden’s first public sighting since Biden, now 82, revealed his cancer diagnosis. It also follows Donald Trump’s controversial move in March to revoke Hunter’s extended Secret Service protection, a benefit his father had granted him during his time in office. Usually, children of former presidents only have such protection till they turn 16, Fox News reported.Trump's decision came during Hunter’s previous visit to South Africa. His absence of security detail this time suggests the order has since been enforced.Meanwhile, back in Washington, Republicans are intensifying efforts to investigate what they claim is a deliberate cover-up of Joe Biden’s alleged cognitive decline. Senators Eric Schmitt and John Cornyn announced a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing set for 18 June. The panel will explore claims that Biden’s aides and media allies hid his deteriorating mental state during his presidency.Witnesses for the hearing are still being finalised, but it is expected to be the first full congressional session dedicated to the issue.","Former US President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, was spotted in Cape Town, South Africa, on Friday, enjoying a low-key outing with his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, and their young son, Beau Biden Jr. The family was seen driving a modest rented Toyota sedan, a stark contrast to the black Chevy Suburbans that once accompanied him during his father's presidency.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121542248,imgsize-916992,width-400,resizemode-4/121542248.jpg"
Indian-origin man pleads guilty to marriage fraud in West Virginia; he claimed domestic violence to get green card,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-man-pleads-guilty-to-marriage-fraud-in-west-virginia-he-claimed-domestic-violence-to-get-green-card/articleshow/121542186.cms,"Indian man, Akaash Prakash Makwana, admits to marriage fraud in West Virginia, US.





29-year-old Aakash Prakash Makwana, an Indian citizen, has pleaded guilty to a marriage fraud which also involved identity theft -- as part of a scheme to evade US immigration laws. US Justice Department said Makwana arrived in the US on a J-1 nonimmigrant visa to work in hotel hospitality and culinary services. This visa is valid for one year and so he conspired with others to marry a US citizen to remain in the US.Makwana arrived in the US in 2019 and continued to stay even though his visa expired in 2020. In 2021, he married a US citizen for $10,000 so that he could apply for a Green card. But in doing so, he falsified a residential lease agreement to make it appear that he and the US citizen whom he married lived together and also added the US citizen's name to his bank accounts and utility bills.Makwana admitted that he committed identity theft when he included the name and signature of the residential property's manager on a false lease agreement.When this marriage scheme failed, Makwala filed a Form I-360 with the USCIS claiming that he suffered domestic violence and emotional abuse at the hands of his US citizen partner. He has now admitted that he filed the petition to continue to stay in the US while his claimed were being considered.Kalee Ann Huff, a 28-year-old US citizen, also pleaded guilty to this marriage fraud. Huff's brother-in-law Joseph Sanchez was part of the conspiracy and he also pleaded guilty. “This case reflects another unacceptable attempt to undermine our nation’s immigration laws, and the commitment of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of West Virginia to enforce those laws to uphold public safety, national security, and the rule of law in our country,” said Acting United States Attorney Lisa G Johnston.","29-year-old Aakash Prakash Makwana, an Indian citizen, has pleaded guilty to a marriage fraud.

'He inspired me': Stranger’s TikTok helps teen worker at Burger King raise over $130K for college,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/he-inspired-me-strangers-tiktok-helps-teen-worker-at-burger-king-raise-over-130k-for-college/articleshow/121542124.cms,"



A Georgia teenager who clocked into his Burger King shift just hours after graduating high school saw his college hopes transformed, thanks to an outpouring of generosity that has raised over $130,000 (£102,000) and counting.Mykale Baker, 18, became the face of quiet determination when a stranger spotted him working at a Burger King in Dacula, Georgia, still wearing his graduation stole and medal. That moment, shared by Maria Mendoza in a TikTok video she posted “without thinking,” captured hearts online, and sparked the creation of a fundraiser called 'From Burger King to a College Dream'.The campaign had a goal of $60,000, but smashed through that target in just ten days. Fuelled by thousands of donations, most from complete strangers, the total climbed past $130,000 by Saturday afternoon.“I feel happy,” Baker told 11 Alive. “I just want to say thank you to my parents and all the people that see the good in me and believe in me, and donated all that money to me.”The teen said he had been unsure about his next steps after graduation due to financial constraints, and had hoped to attend trade school.Now, those dreams look within reach.Mendoza, who started the fundraiser, said she was struck by Baker’s kindness and work ethic, The New York Post said.“He was so kind, so polite,” she recalled. “Radiating joy, even after such a big day. His dedication and quiet strength really moved me. I felt called to do something to recognise that.”One anonymous donor left a note with their contribution, writing, “Remember, this money is for you. Not for mama, the church, or others in need. It’s an investment in your future. Invest it in yourself wisely and you’ll have much more to share with others down the road!”When Mendoza returned to the Burger King days later to share the news of the donations, Baker was overwhelmed and brought to tears.“I’m just grateful I got to do something for him,” Mendoza added. “He inspired me.”","Mykale Baker, 18, was working at Burger King in Dacula, Georgia.

More concerned about teeth than constituents: Gale Brewer faces backlash over demanding dental care for migrants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/more-concerned-about-teeth-than-constituents-gale-brewer-faces-backlash-over-demanding-dental-care-for-migrants/articleshow/121541158.cms,"



Upper West Side councilwoman Gale Brewer is facing backlash after calling for free dental care for migrants, after she revealed already have paid up to $10,000 out of her own pocket to cover their dental expenses.The 73-year-old Democrat made the plea during a budget hearing with the NYC Health Department on May 23, where she criticised the lack of attention to migrants’ full health needs.“Is someone paying attention to all of their health needs?” she demanded. “They have a lot of health needs. Forget the dental! I’m already out $8,000–$10,000 on the dental. So who is paying attention to them?”Brewer, who earns $148,500 as a council member, later told The New Post that she has been covering the cost of procedures such as root canals and cavity fillings for several migrants, especially young people she supports personally.“I’ve been doing this kind of stuff for years, especially helping younger people,” said Brewer, who, along with her late husband Cal Snyder, fostered 35 children. “This is nothing new for me.”She also pressed acting health commissioner Dr Michelle Morse to improve awareness among migrants about the city’s existing free healthcare options. Brewer said many asylum seekers, particularly young delivery workers, are enrolled in city-funded health insurance schemes like NYC Care but have no idea how to use them.“And I assume you can’t do dental, because you can’t get dental for Americans — let alone for anybody else. They all have dental issues.”Brewer added, “I happen to know a lot of asylum seekers and support them.”“These are young guys. They’re pretty lost” she said, referring to what benefits the immigrants qualify for.However, her remarks have sparked criticism from some in her own district. Longtime Upper West Side activist Maria Danzilo accused Brewer of ignoring her constituents.“This is another example of misplaced priorities from Gale Brewer,” Danzilo said.“It’s unfortunate that Gale feels migrants’ dental problems are more important than the needs of her own constituents. What is she doing about the healthcare needs of her community? Plenty of New Yorkers also lack medical coverage.”Morse responded by promising that the Health Department would work with city hospitals to improve outreach efforts about available healthcare services under NYC Care.City law already requires all hospitals to treat emergency patients regardless of their immigration status or ability to pay. Migrants seeking asylum are eligible for Medicaid, while minors, seniors, and pregnant women can access free healthcare regardless of immigration status.The health department declined to say whether Brewer could have referred migrants to more affordable city options rather than paying out of pocket.This isn’t the first time Brewer has made headlines during budget hearings. In March, she told correction officials that the food served at Rikers Island made her sick — and suggested the city should serve inmates “farm-to-table” meals like those at high-end Manhattan restaurants.","Upper West Side councilwoman Gale Brewer is facing backlash after calling for free dental care for migrants.

200 miles of sublime pain on a Hindu pilgrimage in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/200-miles-of-sublime-pain-on-a-hindu-pilgrimage-in-pakistan/articleshow/121544180.cms,"Pilgrims, arriving by bus, camp overnight on the desert plain in front of the Chandragup mud volcano during their journey to the Hinglaj Devi temple in the Balochistan Province of Pakistan, May 1, 2025. (NYT News Service)





HINGOL NATIONAL PARK, PAKISTAN: When Amar Faqira's 3-year-old son abruptly lost movement in his foot last year, doctors offered little hope.As panic gripped his family, Faqira made a vow - if the boy recovered, he would make a 200-mile pilgrimage through blistering plains and jagged terrain to the Hinglaj Devi temple, a site sacred to the Hindu minority in Pakistan. It is also where Pakistan's largest annual Hindu festival is held, usually in mid-April.When the child regained strength a year later, Faqira set off in late April on a seven-day walk to the temple, nestled deep in the rust-coloured mountains of the restive Balochistan . The goddess ""heard me and healed my son,"" Faqira said before the trek, as he gathered with friends and family in his neighbourhood in Karachi. ""Why shouldn't I fulfill my vow and endure a little pain?""Faqira and two companions, wearing saffron headscarves and carrying a ceremonial flag, joined thousands of others on the gruelling journey to Hinglaj Devi. Along a winding highway and sun-scorched desert paths, groups of resolute pilgrims - mostly men but also women and children - trudged beneath the unforgiving sky, in heat that reached 45Celsius. Some bore idols of the deity, and all chanted ""Jai Mata Di"" .The pilgrimage is an act of spiritual devotion as well as cultural preservation. Pakistan's Hindus number about 4.4 million and make up less than 2% of the country's population, which is more than 96% Muslim.Hindus are often treated as second-class citizens, systemically discriminated against in housing, jobs and access to govt welfare.For many, the pilgrimage to Hinglaj Devi is comparable in significance to the Haj in Islam, a once-in-a-lifetime obligation of faith. The yearning to make the journey is also strong among Hindus in India though it is very difficult for Indians to receive visas to travel to Pakistan. States bordering Pakistan have deep spiritual links to Hinglaj Devi that are rooted in traditions predating the Partition.For much of the 20th century, the Hinglaj Devi temple remained inaccessible. The pilgrimage gained momentum only in the 1990s. A transformative shift came in the early 2000s with the construction of the Makran Coastal Highway, which links the rest of Pakistan to the Chinese-operated Gwadar deep-sea port.The highway brought unprecedented access to the temple -- it became possible to make the bulk of the journey by vehicle, taking some of the sweat out of the endeavour. Still, thousands continue to make the journey by foot. They are considered the more spiritually devoted. ""The real pilgrimage is in the pain, the feeling,"" said Faqira on the fourth day of his trek.One of his two companions collapsed from heat exhaustion after walking nearly 70 miles and had to return home by bus. Faqira carried on, his feet blistered and bandaged. Each pilgrim walks with a personal vow.Minakshi, part of a group of women dressed in yellow and red, undertook the journey to ask the goddess for a son. Nearby, 60-year-old Raj Kumari was making her seventh pilgrimage, praying for her grandson's well-being. Also on the trek was a childless couple, married since 2018.Hinglaj Devi temple is one of the sites where the remains of Sati, goddess of marital devotion and longevity, fell to Earth after her self-immolation. For many of the faithful, the pilgrimage begins with a symbolic trek to a sacred mud volcano rising from the barren landscape near the Makran Coastal Highway. At the summit, devotees toss coconuts and rose petals into the bubbling crater to seek divine permission to proceed. Many also smear volcanic clay on their faces and bodies. The next stage takes pilgrims to the Hingol River for a ritual bath. From there, they continue 28 miles to the Hinglaj Devi temple, set within a natural cave.The complex houses four shrines, the most revered being the Nani Mandir. After reaching the shrines, devotees complete the pilgrimage with an arduous, hourslong trek across seven mountains, before returning to the temple to pray.","Hinglaj Devi temple is a site sacred to the Hindu minority in Pakistan.

Shehbaz Sharif’s Tajikistan visit caps diplomatic tour amid India tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/did-india-hits-impede-pak-move-to-retaliate/articleshow/121499612.cms,"Photo/Agencies





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wrapped up a five-day, four-nation diplomatic tour in Tajikistan on Thursday, aiming to bolster regional ties and challenge India’s terrorism accusations.The tour, spanning Iran, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan, came after a tense military standoff with India earlier this month. Joined by Field Marshal Asim Munir and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, Sharif sought to project Pakistan as a peace-seeking nation amid rising regional friction.The tour’s backdrop was a May 9-10 clash. Media outlets posted on Thursday videos of Sharif, during his Azerbaijan visit, purportedly admitting to India’s preemptive BrahMos missile strikes on Pakistani military sites impeding Pakistan’s attempts to retaliate. However, neither Pakistani outlets nor Azerbaijan’s govt have confirmed Sharif’s statement about BrahMos. TOI was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the video.Sharif’s mission was clear: counter India’s global push — visiting over 30 countries to brand Pakistan a terror sponsor, a charge Islamabad rejects. In Azerbaijan, he stressed Pakistan’s willingness to discuss Kashmir and terrorism with India, saying, “If India engages sincerely, we’re ready.”This stance, reiterated in Tajikistan, framed Pakistan as a peace broker while painting India as belligerent. Talks with Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev aimed to lock in support against India’s rhetoric.In Tajikistan, Sharif shifted focus to economic and security ties with Central Asia, a region where India and Pakistan compete for sway. The tour, just two weeks after the standoff, reflects Pakistan’s haste to reshape its image. Yet, India’s narrative of counterterrorism retains global traction.With a fragile ceasefire extended to May 18 hanging in the balance, Sharif’s peace calls face an uphill battle against India’s military-first approach. Meetings in Türkiye and beyond highlighted Pakistan’s reliance on allies to offset India’s influence. Still, the tour’s success hinges on whether these overtures can pierce India’s diplomatic armor.The broader India-Pakistan rivalry played out vividly here — diplomacy and perception as fiercely contested as their borders. Sharif’s tour, while crisp in intent, navigates a murky web of unverified claims, strategic posturing, and regional ambitions, leaving the path to peace as elusive as ever.","Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wrapped up a five-day, four-nation diplomatic tour in Tajikistan on Thursday.

Pak SSG Loaned Commando To Lashkar? Probe Reveals ISI’s Hand in Pahalgam Attack | Watch





NEW DELHI: Top Lashkar-e-Taiba commander and one of the plotters of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack Saifullah Kasuri made inflammatory remarks against India at a rally in Lahore on Wednesday. Surrounded by Pakistani security forces, fellow terrorist commanders and officials of Pakistan's intelligence agency, ISI, Kasuri seemed to relish the infamy he had attracted for the massacre of innocent civilians marked out on the basis of their faith.""I have become more famous since being accused of the attack,"" he gloated, as per information reaching here.Kasuri, who had earlier disclaimed responsibility for the slaughter in Pahalgam, was sharing the stage with US-designated terrorist Talha Saeed, son of Lashkar chief Hafiz Saeed , along with Malik Ahmad Khan, speaker of the Punjab assembly - something that once again laid bare Pakistan's claim of having taken action against terrorists.Talha publicly lauded Pakistan's so called Bunyan al-Marsoos operation, in retaliation to India's Operation Sindoor. ""Allah loves those who engage in jihad,"" he said while Kasuri and others cheered.The speeches appeared to be meant to rally members of the jihadi outfit after India's successful precision strikes on the Lashkar headquarters in Muridke which killed several terrorists.In an apparent reference to PM Narendra Modi's remarks a few days ago, Kasuri said they were not afraid of bullets.""Narendra Modi samajhta hai hum goliyon se darne wale hain? Ye uski bhool hai (Modi is mistaken if he thinks we are scared of bullets),"" he said. Addressing at a rally at Bhuj earlier this week, the PM had said Pakistan should be ready to face India's bullets if it did not stop using terror as a weapon.Kasuri had earlier claimed that he had no role to play in the Pahalgam carnage. On Wednesday, he was all fire and brimstone.While claiming that Pakistan had avenged the 1971 war and the vivisection of Pakistan by the then PM Indira Gandhi, Kasuri went on to praise Pakistan's cyber team for 'targeting' India's critical infrastructure pertaining to communications and railways.During the rally, he also referenced the upcoming elections and asked the people of Kasur (his hometown) if they'd support him running against Modi in the next election. He styled himself as a thorn in India's side. ""Main rehta hun Hindustan ke dil me kaante ki tarah. Apne rab ka shukr karta hu. Agla election Modi ke muqable mai na lad lun,"" he said.He also said that India had tried a lot to isolate Pakistan and specific individuals, but now it was they who stood isolated. Kasuri was spotted in Kanganpur army base in Punjab in the run-up to the Pahalgam attack where he exhorted Pakistani soldiers and spewed venom against India.On Hafiz Saeed's instructions, Kasuri, Talha and Sheikh Sajjad Gul of The Resistance Front are learned to have sent in highly trained terrorists for a ""spectacular attack' in Pahalgam.Kasuri, who was earlier president of Milli Muslim League, was also part of Jamaat-ud-Dawa's coordination committee, the 'charity' wing of Lashkar. Since the Pahalgam attack, the outfits have intensified public rallies to gather funds in the name of supporting the jihad in Kashmir.",LeT commander Saifullah Kasuri made inflammatory remarks against India at a rally in Lahore on Wednesday.

Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has publicly admitted, once again that Indian missiles, including the supersonic BrahMos, struck multiple locations deep inside Pakistan, including an airport in Rawalpindi.Speaking at a trilateral summit in Lachin, Azerbaijan, Sharif described how Indian strikes hit multiple targets in Pakistan before it could mount its planned retaliation.Speaking at the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit in Lachin, Azerbaijan, Sharif described the sequence of events and Pakistan's intended response. ""We on 9th and 10th night we decided to respond in a measured fashion to Indian aggression,"" he said.""And we had decided that at 4:30 in the morning after Fajr prayers, Pakistan armed forces led very ably by our Field Marshal Chief Army Staff sitting here, Syed Asam Munir to teach a lesson to our enemy. But before that hour reached India again launched missile attacks, BrahMos and hit Pakistan's various provinces including airport in Rawalpindi and other places.""This is not the first time that Sharif has confirmed that Operation Sindoor caused severe damage in Pakistan, earlier speaking at a ceremony the Pakistani PM had acknowledged that Indian missiles struck Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi and other locations.Earlier, speaking at a ceremony, he said, “At around 2.30am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles have hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas.”Operation Sindoor, launched by India on May following the Pahalgam terror attack, targeted terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK, killing over 100 militants. The strikes targeted nine terror launchpads in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, and was followed by the destruction of 11 Pakistani airbases after failed attempts by Pakistan to target Indian military positions.The situation de-escalated only after both sides agreed to a halt in military actions during a meeting between the Directors General of Military Operations on May 10.In the aftermath, Sharif had also made repeated appeals for dialogue, calling for talks on peace, terrorism, water, and Kashmir. Speaking in Tehran earlier this week, Sharif had said, “We want to resolve all disputes, including the Kashmir issue and the water issue, through negotiations and are also ready to talk to our neighbour on trade and counter-terrorism.” However, he warned, “But if they choose to remain aggressors, then we shall defend our territory… like we have done a few days ago. ”India has firmly rejected these overtures. At a press briefing, mministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal reaffirmed New Delhi’s position, stating, “Terrorism and talks cannot go together… Talks on J&K will be held only on the vacating of PoK and when Pakistan hands over the territory to us.”He also confirmed that the Indus Waters Treaty will remain suspended until Pakistan “credibly and irrevocably abjures its support to cross-border terrorism”, adding, “Water and blood cannot flow together.”","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif has publicly admitted, once again that Indian missiles, including the supersonic BrahMos, struck multiple locations deep inside Pakistan. Sharif described how Indian strikes hit multiple targets in Pakistan before it could mount its planned retaliation.

In a video which has gone viral on social media, Pakistani actor Hina Bayat highlighted the issue of lack water at Pakistan's busiest Jinnah International Airport, in the country's largest city, Karachi.In the video, Bayat said, ""Today is Youm-e-Takbir. I am standing here at Karachi International Airport, and on a day when we should be celebrating Pakistan’s achievements, I see that there is no water in any of the washrooms here. People want to perform prayers, parents are taking their children to the restroom — but there is no water.""Pakistan celebrates Youm-e-Takbir (the day of greatness) as a national day to commemorate the nuclear tests it conducted on May 28 and 30, 1998.While Bayat emphasized that her country should celebrate its ""achievements"" on Youm-e-Takbir, she also drew attention to the ""alarming situation"" at the airport.""Why have our airports, our institutions, and our systems deteriorated so much? And no one is willing to admit these are mistakes which need to be fixed. So many new projects are being launched, new trains are being discussed — but the old systems, like availability of water in the washrooms of an international airport, are being ignored.It’s truly unfortunate,"" she added.The video went viral on Indian social media, as it comes in the backdrop of India putting in abeyance the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan.Putting the water agreement in abeyance is among several diplomatic and military steps taken by India in retaliation to the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam. On April 22, Pakistan-backed terrorists shot dead 26 men, including 25 tourists and a local, in Pahalgam.","Pakistan celebrates Youm-e-Takbir (the day of greatness) as a national day to commemorate the nuclear tests it conducted on May 28 and 30, 1998.

'Talks Only On Return Of PoK': India Rejects Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif's Call For Dialogue | Kashmir





Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday repeated his call to hold talks with India, urging both nations to sit down ""for peace"" and resolve long-standing issues, including Kashmir, water sharing, and terrorism. The change of tone in Pakistan's language can be noticed after India's punitive diplomatic steps and strong military counterterror action under Operation Sindoor against Pakistan, in retaliation of Pahalgam terror attack.His remarks came during the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit in Lachin, Azerbaijan, where he was joined by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev.This was Sharif’s second call for dialogue in a week. On Monday, while in Tehran, he expressed a similar willingness to engage with India “to resolve all disputes.”“We must sit together and talk for the sake of peace… There are issues that demand immediate attention and must be addressed through dialogue,” Sharif said, according to Dawn.He added, “I have said in all humility that we want peace in the region[…] and that requires talks on the table on issues which need urgent attention and amicable resolution, that is the issue of Kashmir according to the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council and as per the aspirations of the people of Kashmir.”Sharif also expressed openness to discussing counterterrorism with India, saying, “I have said in all earnest that if India wants to talk on countering terrorism in sincerity of purpose, Pakistan would be willing to talk to India on this issue as well.” He further stated his desire to resume trade ties, and criticised India’s decision to suspend the Indus Water Treaty , calling it a vital resource for Pakistan's drinking and agricultural needs.However, India has made its stance unequivocally clear: talks with Pakistan will only focus on two issues, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and terrorism.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his first statement following Operation Sindoor, said: “Today, I would also like to tell the global community that our stated policy has been: if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on terrorism; and if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).”Tensions between the two countries have intensified since the April 22 terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, which left 26 dead.In retaliation, India launched Operation Sindoor, a coordinated military campaign that began on May 7, targeting nine terror launchpads in Pakistan and PoK.The Indian Air Force also destroyed 11 Pakistani airbases in response to Pakistan's failed attempts to strike Indian military positions on May 8, 9, and 10.The conflict de-escalated after both sides agreed to halt military actions following a meeting between their directors general of military operations on May 10.","Pakistan's PM Shehbaz Sharif calls for talks with India to resolve long-standing issues, including Kashmir, water sharing, and terrorism.

Poll Do you believe that climate change is contributing to extreme weather events in Pakistan? Yes No





At least 14 people were killed and more than 100 injured after powerful windstorms swept across central and northern Pakistan following a days-long heatwave, officials confirmed on Sunday.The storms, described as “particularly destructive” by authorities, battered the provinces of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa as well as Islamabad on Saturday afternoon and evening.Mazhar Hussain, spokesperson for the Punjab disaster management authority, was quoted by news agency AFP as saying, “This windstorm was particularly destructive. The wind speed was very high. There was so much dust in it that visibility was greatly reduced.”According to him, the extreme weather followed several days of intense heat, with temperatures exceeding 45°C. “There were three to four days in the recent heatwave where temperatures went up quite a lot,” he added, attributing the sudden storm to the intense build-up of heat.The majority of casualties were caused by collapsing roofs and walls, while at least two people died after being struck by solar panels dislodged by high-speed winds.In one tragic incident, lightning claimed the life of one man and injured three others.The storms uprooted trees, knocked over electric poles, and caused significant damage to vehicles and infrastructure. Social media was flooded with dramatic videos showing the aftermath, including a viral clip filmed inside a passenger plane struggling to land in Lahore before being diverted to Karachi amid severe turbulence.Islamabad and surrounding areas have also seen multiple unusual hailstorms over April and May, damaging vehicles and solar panels—marking a growing trend of erratic and extreme weather events in the country.Pakistan is widely recognised as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, with early summers and intense heatwaves becoming increasingly common.India is also battling extreme temperatures. According to news agency ANI, Rajasthan's Jaisalmer hit 48°C, forcing locals indoors. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) warned that severe heatwave conditions will continue in Rajasthan until May 27 and in Punjab, Haryana, and Jammu and Kashmir until May 26.Meanwhile, heavy monsoon rainfall has already arrived on India’s west coast, with IMD forecasting intense downpours over Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Goa in the coming week.Back in Pakistan, the Meteorological Department has predicted more storms on Sunday, raising concerns about further damage and casualties.","Powerful windstorms swept across central and northern Pakistan following a days- long heatwave.

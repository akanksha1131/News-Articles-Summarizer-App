Mongolia: Young Mongolians demand PM resign over corruption claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/young-mongolians-demand-pm-resign-over-corruption-claims/articleshow/121329035.cms,"Mongolian Prime Minister Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene (Image credit: https://www.parliament.mn/en/cv/112/)

Counter protests:







Hundreds of young Mongolians turned out this week in the country's capital calling for the prime minister's resignation on allegations of corruption, a longstanding source of deep public anger in the landlocked democracy.Mongolia has for decades struggled with endemic graft and the widespread view that the proceeds of a coal mining boom are being hoarded by a wealthy elite has sparked frequent protests and unrest.Under Prime Minister Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene -- in power since 2021 -- Mongolia has plummeted in Transparency International 's Corruption Perceptions Index.Now fuelling public outrage are allegations that the prime minister's family are enjoying wealth far beyond that expectation of a civil servant on the public dime -- claims sparked by a social media post by his son's girlfriend showing a lavish birthday gift.In a statement to AFP, the prime minister's office said it ""vehemently"" denied allegations of impropriety, describing them as a ""smear"".But hundreds of mostly young protesters have gathered for eight consecutive days at the capital Ulaanbaatar's Sukhbaatar Square, also known as Genghis Khan square, demanding the premier's resignation.""The prime minister has to resign,"" protest organiser O. Ulamsaikhan, 24, told AFP.""What we are trying to achieve is to establish a new political culture in which unethical behaviour by public officials leads to accountability and resignation,"" he said.Also deepening anger in the country are worries over the economy and cost of living. Inflation, which soared following neighbouring Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 -- reached nine percent last year, according to national news agency Montsame.""Young people are working hard to make a living,"" said university freshman O Khulan, 19, who counted among the crowd holding placards declaring ""it's easy to resign"" and ""the natural resources of Mongolia belong to the Mongolians"".""Yet it is unfair that the prime minister's son and his girlfriend have a lavish lifestyle, while I'm buying my bag from a thrift shop,"" she said.""The youth are the future of Mongolia, and we have to stand up for a better one. That's why I wanted to come to the protest and express my opinion,"" she explained.Rejecting the charges, a spokesperson for the prime minister said he is ""on record that everyone must live equally before the law and be able to prove their income"".The spokesperson also pointed to efforts by his government to strengthen anti-corruption efforts and more equitably distribute proceeds from the country's vast natural resources.And counter protesters on the streets of Ulaanbaatar -- overwhelmingly older than their pro-opposition counterparts -- said they supported the prime minister and were sceptical that his resignation would change anything.""While young people are calling for the prime minister's resignation, it raises an important question: 'What then'?"", D Magsarjav, 65, told AFP.""I don't think there is a better candidate for the next prime minister,"" he said.""It is easy to criticise and call for resignation, but much harder to do the job and deliver results,"" 63-year-old D. Oyunchimeg added.But protest organiser Ulamsaikhan vowed to push on with the rallies until Oyun-Erdene steps down.""We will continue our protest until his resignation.""",Mongolia has for decades struggled with endemic graft. Allegations that the proceeds of a coal mining boom are being hoarded by a wealthy elite has sparked frequent protests and unrest.

PANAMA CITY: top union leader involved in protests against Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino scaled the fence of the Bolivian embassy to seek asylum Wednesday, authorities said, following the arrest of a colleague.The powerful Suntracs construction union is fighting the Panamanian government on several fronts, including pension reform.Saul Mendez's asylum plea came after authorities recently detained another union leader, Jaime Caballero, on suspicion of money laundering.According to Panama's foreign ministry, ""in the early hours of Wednesday morning, Mr Mendez climbed over the fence of the diplomatic mission, knocked on the door, and with a note in hand requested political asylum.""The embassy informed Panama that the request would be considered by Bolivia's national refugee council, the ministry said in a statement.Following Mendez's asylum plea, prosecutors announced it had issued an arrest warrant against ""Panamanian citizens"" as part of a probe into Suntracs for suspected aggravated fraud, money laundering and illicit association.The statement did not mention any names, but local media reported the warrants targeted Mendez and former union leader Genaro Lopez.Masked police also raided several Suntracs offices, including its headquarters in Panama City.Mulino has branded the left-wing union ""a mafia.""The organization often leads protests against his right-wing government focused on issues ranging from social security reforms, an agreement allowing US troops to deploy to bases along the Panama Canal, and moves to reopen a contested copper mine.Suntracs is one of the organizers of an indefinite strike by construction workers launched almost a month ago.","Saul Mendez's asylum plea came after authorities recently detained another union leader, Jaime Caballero, on suspicion of money laundering.

More than 50,000 people on Thursday were left stranded as torrential rain continued to lash eastern Australia.At least three people are missing, with a 63-year-old found dead in the rural hamlet of Moto, 400 km northeast of Sydney. Authorities dispatched drones, boats and helicopters to rescue the victims, news agency AFP reported citing local authorities.In just two days, some parts of New South Wales got more than four months’ worth of rain. Rivers overflowed, roads were flooded, and many people had to climb onto their roofs to stay safe.“We’ve got a lot of people getting rescued from rooftops and from upper levels of houses,” said emergency chief Byrne as reported by the country's national broadcaster ABC.The town of Taree, 300 km north of Sydney, was hit hard. It got 415 millimeters of rain—more than four times the usual amount for May.In the nearby town of Kempsey, about 20,000 people are stuck with little access to food, water, and medical help.Australia has been dealing with strange and extreme weather in recent months. The Australian National University said sea temperatures were the highest ever recorded in 2024. Warmer oceans can cause more rain and stronger storms. Emergency management minister Kristy McBain warned that the rain isn’t over yet and some rivers may still rise.","At least three people are missing, with a 63-year-old found dead in the rural hamlet of Moto, 400 km northeast of Sydney.

Is Hamas leader Muhammad Sinwar dead?

Who is Mohammad Sinwar?







Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in his first press conference since December, has hinted that Israel probably had killed Hamas leader Muhammad Sinwar.Addressing a Jerusalem press conference, Netanyahu claimed that 20 hostages remain alive in Gaza, while ""up to 38"" have perished and assured the public, ""We will bring everyone back. ""Netanyahu stated that Israel maintains a well-structured plan for its military objectives in Gaza, emphasising that the conflict serves a distinct and warranted purpose, Times of Israel reported.""To defeat Hamas, which carried out the atrocities of October 7; to bring back all of our hostages; and to ensure that Gaza does not present a threat to Israel.""He maintained these objectives are interconnected and require complete fulfilment.""We eliminated tens of thousands of terrorists. We eliminated the leaders of the murderers Deif, Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar and probably Mohammad Sinwar ,"" CNN quoted Netanyahu saying.Regarding potential negotiations, he indicates openness to a ""temporary ceasefire"" if it facilitates the return of additional hostages, whilst emphasising such an arrangement would be time-limited.Mohammed Sinwar, the younger brother of slain Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, has emerged as a prominent figure in the group's leadership, becoming a key strategist for Hamas during one of its most challenging periods, reports the New York Post.Israel's military campaign over the past 15 months has resulted in the deaths of over 17,000 Hamas members, while Mohammed Sinwar has played a key role in rebuilding the group and reinforcing its control over Gaza, particularly following the death of his brother Yahya last October.'Nicknamed “the shadow” by Israeli officials, Mohammed Sinwar was born in 1975 in a Khan Younis refugee camp and has risen to prominence within Hamas' leadership. Following the death of his brother Yahya Sinwar in October last year, Hamas established a governing council to make it harder for Israel to target its leaders. Mohammed has become the council's key leader, working to rebuild and strengthen the group after its losses.Mohammed’s influence was witnessed during the recent hostage exchange in Gaza City. Hamas fighters in uniforms paraded four Israeli hostages through Palestine Square as supporters cheered and threw confetti. Critics argued that the exchange showed Israel's inability to fully dismantle Hamas despite over a year of continuous conflict, with Sinwar credited for the group's revival.","Mohammed Sinwar is the younger brother of slain Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar.

From Zelenskyy to Ramaphosa: How Trump has turned Oval Office into an ambush office,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-zelenskyy-to-ramaphosa-how-trump-has-turned-oval-office-into-an-ambush-office/articleshow/121328571.cms,"PTI photo

Staging a conspiracy theory

LIVE: Trump and South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa hold meeting

Grace under fire

A presidency of performance

Ramaphosa’s balancing act

An office transformed

When South African President Cyril Ramaphosa arrived at the White House this week, he knew it wouldn’t be a warm visit. The US president had already accused his government of enabling a “white genocide.” But nothing could have fully prepared Ramaphosa-or the global audience watching-for what happened next.The lights in the Oval Office dimmed. A television monitor, wheeled in just for the occasion, flickered to life. The screen played a four-minute video showing grainy protest footage, firebrand chants, and white crosses meant to symbolize slain white farmers. The message was clear, if fantastical: South Africa, according to President Trump , was persecuting its white minority-and he had brought his guest here to confront it.“You do allow them to take land, and then when they take the land, they kill the white farmer,” Trump said. “And when they kill the white farmer, nothing happens to them.”It was not a conversation. It was a show.In Donald Trump’s second term, the Oval Office has become less a room for diplomacy and more a studio set. The confrontation with Ramaphosa followed a similar “ambush” earlier this year, when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy walked into what was expected to be a routine alliance-strengthening meeting-and left after a shouting match with Trump and Vice President JD Vance.Now, the template appears set: lights, spectacle, confrontation, and humiliation-preferably televised.“This is literally being watched globally right now,” Trump adviser Jason Miller posted on X, complete with a screenshot of the encounter. “Ratings GOLD.”If the message to the world’s democracies is “play ball or face the glare,” the signal is coming through loud and clear. Cameron Hudson, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, called the Ramaphosa meeting “a circus,” though one that “didn’t go off the cliff.”Former US Ambassador to South Africa Patrick Gaspard was less diplomatic: “Trump turned the meeting with Ramaphosa into a shameful spectacle,” he wrote. “Engaging on Trump’s terms never goes well for anyone.”Trump’s tactics are redefining what a presidential meeting means - turning diplomatic engagements into political theater with real global consequences.1. Diplomacy becomes deterrent: What used to be a coveted invitation for world leaders - the Oval Office - now resembles a stage-managed gauntlet. Trump’s aggressive posture, public confrontations, and nationalist messaging may make foreign leaders wary of future visits, especially those from smaller or non-aligned countries.2. Undermines alliances: Trump’s treatment of allies like Ramaphosa and Zelenskyy undermines US credibility at a time when competition from China and Russia for global influence is intensifying. As one Western diplomat told Reuters, ""This kind of public ambush is something you'd expect from a talk show host, not a US president.""3. Weaponizing the presidency: Trump has effectively turned the Oval Office - historically a symbol of mutual respect and diplomacy - into a live set for reinforcing narratives that energize his political base. Wednesday's display wasn’t about South Africa’s actual crime data or trade. It was about reaffirming Trump’s alignment with white nationalist talking points that resonate with key segments of his support.4. Risks isolating the US: Trump’s readiness to embarrass foreign leaders on live television - especially those from nations the US has strategic interests in - could backfire diplomatically. South Africa, China’s top trading partner on the continent, is being courted by both global powers. Trump’s behavior risks pushing Pretoria further into Beijing’s sphere.The centerpiece of Trump’s presentation was an old, debunked conspiracy theory: that white South African farmers are being hunted and murdered en masse by a Black-majority government. This narrative, popular in far-right internet circles and championed by Trump ally Elon Musk-who was present during the meeting-has long been dismissed by experts.South Africa recorded over 26,000 murders last year, and 44 were linked to farming communities. Just eight of those victims were farmers. The majority of victims, as Ramaphosa calmly explained, are Black. Yet Trump flipped through printed headlines, muttering “death, death, death,” and waved the clippings in front of his guest. One of the images, journalists later confirmed, was actually from the Democratic Republic of Congo.Still, Trump doubled down: “People are fleeing South Africa for their own safety. Their land is being confiscated, and in many cases, they’re being killed.”Ramaphosa tried to interject: “These are concerns we are willing to talk to you about.”But Trump wasn’t interested in dialogue. “The farmers are not Black,” he snapped back.Despite the bait, Ramaphosa remained composed. “If there was Afrikaner farmer genocide, I can bet you these three gentlemen would not be here,” he said, motioning to pro golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen, and billionaire Johann Rupert-three white South Africans who had joined his delegation.Observers described the South African president’s performance as tactful, even statesmanlike. “You could see he was being provoked,” said his spokesman, Vincent Magwenya . “He did not fall for the trap.”After the encounter, Ramaphosa tried to reframe the visit. “You wanted to see drama and something big happening,” he told South African reporters. “I’m sorry that we disappointed you somewhat.”Yet for many South Africans, the damage was done. “I don’t understand why Ramaphosa is even in the US,” said a university student in Johannesburg. “Trump has made it very clear how he feels about us.”This was no diplomatic misstep. It was a deliberate performance. “If anybody doubts that the Zelenskyy incident was not completely stage-managed by the White House,” British analyst Tim Marshall said, “the scales should fall from their eyes.”Trump’s new Oval Office doctrine is simple: humiliate to dominate. He’s applied the same strategy to allies and rivals alike. He mocked Canadian PM Mark Carney and suggested Canada should become the 51st US state. He goaded French President Emmanuel Macron on climate and taunted Zelensky over NATO aid. Even Benjamin Netanyahu, one of Trump’s closest allies, was stunned when Trump announced backchannel talks with Iran without warning.The formula is consistent: unpredictability, aggression, and spectacle over substance.The South African president had come to Washington with pragmatic goals. He hoped to lower the temperature on bilateral tensions, reboot stalled trade talks, and repair damage caused by Trump’s earlier decisions to cancel aid, impose tariffs, and recognize Afrikaners as refugees while restricting asylum seekers from other regions.Following the meeting, Ramaphosa tried to salvage the narrative, telling reporters that discussions on liquefied natural gas and critical minerals were “very encouraging.” He even claimed he’d persuaded Trump to consider attending the G20 summit in Johannesburg this November. “I believe we’ve started to change his mind,” he said.But the images of the meeting-of Ramaphosa, politely silent under the harsh glow of Trump’s Oval Office spotlight-will likely overshadow any diplomatic gains.The Oval Office was once a place where history was shaped, where presidents forged treaties and built global alliances. Today, it feels more like a game show set. Gold-plated decor. Televised confrontations. Foreign leaders put on the defensive by a man who treats geopolitics as theater.“We were taught by Nelson Mandela,” Ramaphosa said softly during the meeting, “that whenever there are problems, people need to sit down around the table and talk about them.”In today’s White House, the table has become a stage. The cameras are always rolling. And there’s always a trap.(With inputs from agencies)","US President Donald Trump met with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa this week.

Movies like prison break





Two women have been arrested for allegedly helping inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in a daring jailbreak last week, Louisiana State Police said on Wednesday, according to Fox8Live.Courtnie Harris, 32, from New Orleans, and Corvanntay Baptiste, 38, from Slidell, are both accused of acting as accessories after the fact to the escape that took place in the early hours of May 16. The pair were booked into the Plaquemines Parish Detention Centre following their arrests.According to investigators, Harris was in phone contact with one of the five escapees still at large and is accused of driving two of them to several places around New Orleans. Though police did not name the inmate she assisted, a law enforcement source told Fox 8 that Harris was helping Leo Tate.Meanwhile, Baptiste was allegedly supporting escapee Corey Boyd, who was caught on Tuesday night in the 1400 block of Iberville Street. Officials say she kept in touch with Boyd through phone calls and social media, and even brought him food while he was hiding.“Those who choose to assist or conceal these individuals are violating the law and will be held accountable,” Louisiana State Police said in a statement.“Harbouring fugitives threatens the safety of our communities and will not be tolerated.”If convicted, both women face up to five years in a state prison.The breakout has raised serious questions about conditions at the jail. Around 1 am on May 16, ten inmates escaped through a hole behind a toilet. The gap was just wide enough to crawl through. On the wall above it, graffiti taunted staff with messages like “To Easy LOL” and “Catch us when you can”, along with a cartoon face sticking its tongue out.Jail staff only realised the prisoners were missing during an 8:30 a.m. headcount. Surveillance footage later showed the men slipping out a door near a loading dock, scaling a wall, and crossing Interstate 10. They had swapped their orange jumpsuits for civilian clothes to avoid detection.Around five inmates have been recaptured, while five others remain on the run. Authorities have warned that the fugitives may be armed and dangerous, and are urging anyone with information to come forward.","Courtnie Harris, 32, from New Orleans, and Corvanntay Baptiste, 38, from Slidell, are both accused of acting as accessories after the fact to the escape.

Donald Trump's ally Laura Loomer who is against American jobs going to immigrants, said the administration should restrict H-1B visas -- after the US Monday announced bans on travel agents from India who are allegedly facilitating illegal migration. H-1B, the program that allows US companies to hire skilled employees from foreign countries, has again become a flashpoint as the US immigration revealed that they selected 120,141 H-1B visa applications for the fiscal year 2026.H-1B registrations experience a remarkable decline this time owing to an increased fee, and the figure 120,141 is the lowest since 2021. But MAGA activists, US tech workers are pushing for reduction/abolition of the programs. They say the continuation of programs that hire immigrants goes against Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration and his promise of America First.The US administration imposed visa restrictions on travel agencies, their owners, executives and senior officials if these agencies have any link with illegal immigration.A US Department of State notification said its diplomatic and consular staff in India are working to identify and hold the individuals who are involved in promoting unauthorised migration to the US accountable.In April this year, the US Embassy in India canceled 2,000 visa appointments due to fraud concerns. The latest move is an expansion of its probe into travel agents who are misusing the system.The move was lauded by many MAGA activists who asked for a similar crackdown on H-1B visa programs.The H-1B program operates under an annual cap of 65,000 new visas. However, an additional 20,000 petitions are exempt from this limit for applicants who hold a U.S. master's degree or higher.That the department has already selected 120,141 H-1Bs for the next financial year has sparked concern that companies have already identified people who will be fired to accommodate this people in the US workforce as new jobs are not being created."," MAGA activist urges administration to ban H-1B after US announced visa restrictions for Indian travel agents with alleged links to trafficking.

The government calls the deported people 'true national security threats'



Lawsuits on immigration issues are everywhere



The countries of origin vary







WASHINGTON: The White House violated a court order on deportations to third countries with a flight linked to the chaotic African nation of South Sudan , a federal judge said Wednesday, hours after the Trump administration said it had expelled eight immigrants convicted of violent crimes but refused to reveal where they would end up. The judge's statement was a notably strong rebuke to the government's deportation efforts.In an emergency hearing he called to address reports that immigrants had been sent to South Sudan , Judge Brian E. Murphy in Boston said the eight migrants aboard the plane were not given a meaningful opportunity to object that the deportation could put them in danger. Minutes before the hearing, administration officials accused ""activist judges"" of advocating the release of dangerous criminals.""The department actions in this case are unquestionably in violation of this court's order,"" Murphy said Wednesday, arguing that the deportees didn't have a ""meaningful opportunity"" to object to being sent to South Sudan. The group was flown out of the United States just hours after getting notice, leaving them no chance to contact lawyers who could object in court.Government attorneys argued that the men had a history with the immigration system, giving them prior opportunities to express a fear of being deported to a country outside their homeland. They also pointed out that the judge had not specified the exact time needed between notice and deportation, leaving room for misunderstanding.The migrants' home countries - Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and South Sudan - would not take them back, according to Todd Lyons, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who spoke to reporters in Washington.He later said the migrants either came from countries that often do not take back all their deported citizens or had other situations that meant they could not be sent home.""These represent the true national security threats,"" Lyons said at a news conference. Behind him was a display of photos of men he said had been convicted of rape, homicide, armed robbery and other crimes.Administration officials, who have repeatedly clashed with the courts over their attempts to deport large numbers of immigrants, made their displeasure clear Wednesday.President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ""are working every single day to get these vicious criminals off of American streets - and while activist judges are on the other side, fighting to get them back onto the United States soil,"" said Tricia McLaughlin, a department spokesperson. She pointed to the photographs and described them as ""the monsters"" that Murphy ""is trying to protect.""Homeland Security officials released few specific details about the deportation flight. They said it left Tuesday with eight people on board and said they remained in the department's custody Wednesday. Officials said they could not disclose the migrants' final destination because of ""safety and operational security.""The case comes amid a sweeping immigration crackdown by the Republican administration, which has pledged to deport millions of people who are living in the United States illegally. The legal fight is the latest flashpoint as the administration rails against judges whose rulings have slowed the president's policies.With Congress largely silent or supportive, opponents of Trump's agenda have filed hundreds of lawsuits, and judges have issued dozens of orders against the administration. Immigration has been the most contentious issue. There was the mistaken deportation of an immigrant who was living in Maryland to a prison in El Salvador, as well as Trump's push to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without a court review.The administration officials insisted that the deported men had received due process, but did not provide details. Immigration-rights attorneys argue they violated Murphy's order, first handed down in March, that says people must have a chance to argue that going somewhere outside their homeland would put them in danger before being deported, even if they've otherwise exhausted their legal appeals.""The government is still refusing to provide due process to our clients, which means they are not giving them notice of the country to which they're being deported, proper notice in a language that they understand, and not giving them a meaningful opportunity to claim fear based on those countries,"" Trina Realmuto, the executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, said outside court.""These are countries that the State Department doesn't want Americans to travel to. They are categorically not safe,"" she added.In court, Realmuto asked the judge to return the individuals to the United States. ""They are no less deserving of protection than any other human beings on this planet,"" she said.The government argued that the interviews with the men over their fears could be done where they are currently being held and confirmed with Murphy that they can be arranged. Realmuto called this a ""logistical nightmare"" that penalizes the men because the government violated the judge's order. She said it would prove a challenge to get the men legal counsel and interpreters, an effort complicated by the time difference.Murphy, who raised the prospect of criminal contempt for anyone ""involved in an illegal deportation,"" later Wednesday ordered the government to conduct a new set of interviews with the migrants if an appropriate place with appropriate privacy can be found. He said the government was welcome to bring the migrants back, but did not order them to do so.On Twitter late Wednesday, DHS's McLaughlin called the order ""deranged.""Attorneys for the immigrants told the judge that immigration authorities may have sent as many as a dozen people from several countries to Africa.The apparent removal of one man from the troubled Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar was confirmed in an email from an immigration official in Texas, according to court documents. He was informed only in English, a language he does not speak well, and his lawyers learned of the plan hours before his deportation flight, they said.A woman also reported that her husband, from Vietnam and up to 10 other people were flown to Africa on Tuesday morning, attorneys from the National Immigration Litigation Alliance wrote.Murphy, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, previously found that any plans to deport people to Libya without notice would ""clearly"" violate his ruling.South Sudan says it's unaware of any arrivals South Sudan's police spokesperson, Maj. Gen. James Monday Enoka, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that no migrants had arrived in the country and that if they do, they would be investigated and ""redeported to their correct country"" if found not to be South Sudanese.Edmund Yakani, executive director of the South Sudanese group Community Empowerment for Progress Organization, questioned why people convicted of crimes in the United States would be sent there. ""Is South Sudan a land of fewer humans who deserve to receive perpetrators of human rights violations? Without any public explanation?"" he asked.Some countries do not accept deportations from the United States. That has led the administration to strike agreements with other countries, including Panama, to house them. The US has sent Venezuelans to a notorious prison in El Salvador under an 18th-century wartime law, an action being contested in the courts.South Sudan has endured repeated waves of violence since gaining independence from Sudan in 2011 amid hopes it could use its large oil reserves to bring prosperity to a region long battered by poverty. Just weeks ago, the country's top UN official warned that fighting between forces loyal to the president and a vice president threatened to spiral again into full-scale civil war.The State Department's annual report on South Sudan, published in April 2024, says ""significant human rights issues"" include arbitrary killings, disappearances, torture or inhumane treatment by security forces and extensive violence based on gender and sexual identity.The Homeland Security Department has given Temporary Protected Status to a small number of South Sudanese already living in the United States, shielding them from deportation because conditions were deemed unsafe for return. Noem recently extended those protections to November to allow for a more thorough review.The US is one of the biggest donors to South Sudan's humanitarian aid programs, with the total funding in 2024 standing at over $640 million.","Judge says deportees didn't have a ""meaningful opportunity"" to object to being sent to South Sudan. The group was flown out of the United States just hours after getting notice, leaving them no chance to contact lawyers who could object in court.

US President Donald Trump lashed out at NBC reporter , calling him ""disgrace"" and ""jerk"" on Wednesday after he asked about accepting a luxurious Qatari jet and modifying it as a future Air Force One Fuming over the question, Trump said that the reporter Peter Alexander is a disgrace and directed him not to ask any more questions.Trump, while having a tense meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the White House, accused the reporter of diverting attention from more pressing issues, such as the violence and racist laws against white farmers in South Africa.""You get out of here. What does this have to do with the Qatari jet? They're giving the United States Air Force a jet. Okay. And it's a great thing. We're talking about a lot of other things. It's NBC trying to get off the subject of what you just saw. You are a real. You know, you're a terrible reporter, number one. You don't have what it takes to be a reporter. Not smart enough. But for you to go onto a subject about a jet that was given to the United States Air Force, which is a very nice thing, they also gave $5.1 trillion worth of investment in addition to the jet,"" Trump said.""Go back. You ought to go back to your studio at NBC because Brian Roberts and the people that run that place, they ought to be investigated.They are so terrible the way you run that network. And you're a disgrace. No more questions from you. Go. Go ahead. Talk about that. His name is Peter something. He's a terrible reporter. Quiet, quiet, quiet. Let's go,"" he added.Despite Trump's warning over the question, Alexander persisted in questioning the president. ""Why extend a White House invitation to [Ramaphosa] if genocide is occurring?"" he inquired.""Quiet, quiet,"" responded the president, before acknowledging another journalist.The Qatar aircraft question continued to irritate Trump later, following responses from both leaders regarding allegations of genocide in South Africa.“If the news wasn’t fake, like NBC, which is fake news, one of the worst like ABC, NBC, CBS, if they weren’t fake news like this jerk that we have here,” the president said, pointing to Alexander, “If we had real reporters, they’d be covering it.”""White farmers are being killed and buried, yet his concern is about an aircraft donation. You should feel disgrace. Your reporting is absolutely dreadful,"" Trump stated.“‘So why did they give us a plane to the United States Air Force?’” he continued, mocking Alexander once again. “That’s what that idiot talks about after viewing a thing where thousands of people are dead.”Ramaphosa attempted to lighten the atmosphere by offering a humorous apology for arriving without an aircraft gift.""I regret not bringing a plane for you,"" the South African leader remarked.""I wish you had,"" Trump replied. ""Should your nation offer an aircraft to the United States Air Force, I would accept it.""","US President Donald Trump lashed out at NBC reporter Peter Alexander after he asked about accepting a luxurious Qatari jet and modifying it as a future Air Force One.

The atmosphere in South Africa was tense ahead of President Cyril Ramaphosa 's meeting with US counterpart Donald Trump , worrying that its leader might face public humiliation similar to what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy experienced. Even a local newspaper captured the mood with the headline ""Into the mouth of Trump hell"".Despite Trump presenting unfounded claims about widespread killings of white farmers and showing a video of a marginal South African politician's inflammatory chants, Ramaphosa maintained his composure. The meeting proved less contentious than anticipated.""You wanted to see drama and something big happening,"" Ramaphosa told reporters afterwards. ""I'm sorry that we disappointed you somewhat.""In South Africa, Ramaphosa is known for his composed demeanour and level-headed approach to politics. His significant political achievement includes serving as the African National Congress party's primary negotiator during the early 1990s talks that dismantled apartheid's racial segregation system.Although initially considered a potential successor to Nelson Mandela, he stepped away from politics before returning and assuming the presidency in 2018.The meeting's purpose was to address US misrepresentations of South Africa and establish new trade agreements . However, many South Africans opposed the visit, given the U.S. administration's serious false allegations about their nation.""I honestly don't understand why Ramaphosa is actually in the United States when Trump has made it very clear how he feels about South Africa,"" said college student Dumisani Mnisi in Johannesburg.Ramaphosa's office described the public confrontation as “an orchestrated show for the cameras,” and the real business was the closed-door meeting afterwards, suggesting the subsequent private meeting was more productive. The South African president cited several positive outcomes, including potential progress in changing Trump's perspective on South Africa and initiating trade discussions.The visit concluded with an exchange of books and White House souvenirs, which Ramaphosa viewed positively, stating, ""So that was good.""","South African President Cyril Ramaphosa met with US counterpart Donald Trump.

Institute of Peace reclaims its headquarters after court win over Musk's cost-cutting team,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/institute-of-peace-reclaims-its-headquarters-after-court-win-over-musks-cost-cutting-team/articleshow/121327440.cms,"The headquarters are located in Washington DC, US (Image: AP)





The US Institute of Peace retook control of its headquarters Wednesday, two days after a federal judge said the firing of its board and employees by Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency was illegal.The institute's acting president, George Moose , entered the organization's headquarters with private security and the institute's outside attorney for the first time since being escorted off the premises during the DOGE takeover. Moose and most of the institute's board were fired in March, part of the mass slashing of the federal workforce spearheaded by Musk.The institute and many of its board members filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration soon after, seeking to prevent their removal and stop DOGE from taking over its operations. US District Court Judge Beryl A Howell's opinion on Monday reversed DOGE's actions.Speaking after a short examination of the headquarters, Moose said all appeared to be in order.""We just did a quick walk-through - externally, visibly, things look to be in pretty good shape,"" he said. ""I didn't see anything, any destruction, if you will, no damage that I can see that is visible.""Moose, a former ambassador and career member of the US Foreign Service, said a team of employees from human resources, technology and finance would be in the building Thursday getting the nonprofit ready to welcome back its workforce.He expected to bring back all the staff who want to return.In an email Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly did not comment on workers returning to the building, but signaled that the administration may challenge the decision.""President Trump is right to reduce failed, useless entities like USIP to their statutory minimum, and the rogue judge's attempt to impede on the separation of powers will not be the last say on the matter,"" she said.The administration filed a motion of appeal Wednesday evening and requested a stay of the judge's ruling while that appeal is considered, arguing in part that Howell ""erred"" in concluding that the institution's functions were not executive functions.Agencies across the federal government have been slashed or dismantled by Musk's DOGE team. Wednesday's low-key scene at the institute's headquarters marked a rare moment when a DOGE-targeted agency or organization has been able to begin reestablishing itself.The judge's ruling said the Trump administration did not have authority to unilaterally dismantle the institute, which was established by Congress in 1984 as an independent organization that would promote peace and seek to end conflicts around the world. It was operating in more than two dozen conflict zones at the time Musk's team took it over and shut it down.The saga began when Trump issued an executive order in February that targeted the institute and three other agencies for closure in an effort to deliver on campaign promises to shrink the size of the government. The first attempt by DOGE to take over the headquarters led to a standoff. Members of Musk's DOGE group returned days later with the FBI and District of Columbia Metropolitan Police to help them gain entry.DOGE installed new leadership, ordered a mass firing of nearly all the staff through their private emails, and handed over the institute's headquarters to the General Services Administration.The institute, concerned about liability and security of the building in the aftermath of the judge's ruling, reached out to the government attorneys earlier this week and again on Wednesday. George Foote, the institute's outside attorney, said the exchange was very smooth and orderly.Moose said the goal now is to get back to the work the institute was created to do 40 years ago and ""projects, ideas that are, we believe, of interest to the American people.""","The US Institute of Peace retook control of its headquarters Wednesday, two days after a federal judge said the firing of its board and employees by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency was illegal.

New Orleans Jailbreak: Lawyer says maintenance worker was 'not aware' of New Orleans jail inmates' plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-used-him-as-a-tool-lawyer-says-maintenance-worker-was-not-aware-of-inmates-plan-to-escape-from-new-orleans-prison/articleshow/121327202.cms,"Maintenance worker Sterling Williams

Inmates used Williams as a ‘tool’ to escape, lawyer says

‘A scapegoat’





The lawyer of Sterling Williams , a maintenance worker charged with and arrested for allegedly helping 10 inmates escape a New Orleans prison facility, on Wednesday countered the official version that Williams ""wilfully and maliciously"" assisted the group.The worker had ""no idea"" about the men's plan and was not involved when they cut a pipe behind the toilet to create an opening for their escape, his attorney Michael Kennedy told news agency AP.According to authorities, one of the inmates had instructed the 33-year-old to turn off the water to a toilet, leading to one of the largest jailbreaks in the recent US history.While five have been re-captured , the others are still on the run.As per Kennedy, the attorney, Williams found a toilet overflowing after being called by a deputy to check it.“This was clearly all part of an orchestrated plan. Sterling was nothing more than the tool the men used to turn off the water, which they knew would have to happen after clogging the toilet,” he said.An arrest affidavit which made no mention of a clogged toilet, stated that Williams was “initially very evasive and untruthful” during an interview but ultimately told investigators an inmate had threatened to “shank” (stab) him if he did not turn off the water.Williams could have reported the threat and the escape plan, authorities say. They asserted that because the water was turned off, the group was “able to successfully make good” on their plan, the affidavit mentioned.On this, Kennedy stated that Williams did not report the escape because the latter was “not aware” it was happening. The lawyer also addressed authorities’ statements that his client was ""threatened"" into helping the escape.“He was not aware that there was going to be an escape. He was not conspiring with them. He had no knowledge that he was being used.”Kennedy further claimed he was only able to meet with Williams for around 30 minutes via Zoom.“The most important thing I’ve learned is that these charges are ridiculous and the sheriff’s office is trying to use him as a scapegoat to minimize their own embarrassment. Sterling did nothing more than the job they pay him to do and now they’re attempting to sacrifice him for it,” he alleged.The maintenance worker is charged with 10 counts of principal to simple escape and one count of malfeasance in office.","Sterling Williams, 33, is accused of helping 10 inmates escape from a New Orleans prison.

The Archdiocese of New Orleans has agreed to pay nearly $180 million to victims of clergy sexual abuse under a settlement announced Wednesday, the latest in a string of settlements by the Catholic Church.The archdiocese, its parishes and several insurers will pay $179.2 million into a trust to benefit survivors, according to a statement by the committee that negotiated the agreement. The money will be distributed after the church emerges from bankruptcy, it said.But many of the survivors were not on board with the agreement, their lawyers said.""This proposed settlement was made in a secret backroom deal that the Archdiocese, the creditors committees and the mediators knew the overwhelming majority of victim-survivors would never agree to and will undoubtedly vote down,"" attorneys Soren Gisleson, Johnny Denenea and Richard Trahant said in a statement to The Associated Press. ""It makes no sense and is a continuation of the lifetime of abuse the Archdiocese has inflicted on these folks. ""The agreement, which would settle a lawsuit filed in 2020, requires approval from the survivors as well as the bankruptcy court and other Archdiocese creditors.Aaron Hebert, who says he was abused by a priest in the 1960s as an eighth grader, called the deal ""an insult and a slap to the face.""""The Archdiocese of New Orleans and Archbishop (Gregory) Aymond are throwing this offer out to prevent victims and survivors from taking their claims to state court,"" Hebert said.The committee's statement said the deal also includes what the statement called ""unprecedented"" provisions and procedures to safeguard against future abuse and provide services to survivors, including a survivors' bill of rights and changes to the Archdiocese's process for handling abuse claims.""I am grateful to God for all who have worked to reach this agreement and that we may look to the future towards a path to healing for survivors and for our local church,"" Aymond said in a statement.The suit involves more than 500 people who say they were abused by clergy. The case produced a trove of church records said to document years of abuse claims and a pattern of leaders transferring clergy without reporting their alleged crimes to law enforcement.","Archdiocese of New Orleans agrees to pay nearly $180 million to victims of clergy sexual abuse.

"Google unveils AI chatbot, signalling a new era for search",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/google-unveils-ai-chatbot-signalling-a-new-era-for-search/articleshow/121326870.cms,"Sundar Pichai, Google CE





MOUNTAIN VIEW: Google became the gateway to the internet by perfecting its search engine. For two decades, it surfaced 10 blue links that gave people access to the information they were looking for.But after a quarter century, the tech giant is betting that the future of search will be artificial intelligence. On Tuesday, Google said it was introducing a new feature in its search engine called AI Mode. The tool will function like a chatbot, allowing people to start a query, ask follow-up questions and use the company's AI system to deliver comprehensive answers.""It's a total reimagining of search,"" said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, in a press briefing before the company's annual conference for software developers. In tests of the feature, he said people dramatically ""changed the nature of how they are interacting with search.""The new feature headlined a list of new AI abilities, including more personalised and automated email replies and a shopping tool to automatically purchase clothing after it's put on sale.With the introduction of AI Mode, Google is essentially trying to disrupt its traditional search business before upstart AI competitors can disrupt it. The search giant has been nervous about that possibility since declaring a ""code red"" two years ago after the arrival of ChatGPT, a chatbot from OpenAI that ignited a race to add generative AI into tech products.But Google has been hesitant to fully embrace AI because it has so much to lose. The company's search business generated nearly $200 billion last year, more than half of its total sales. And the bedrock of that business has been how it has reliably provided people with the best answers to questions.Though they are a technical leap, AI systems have one big shortcoming: They are prone to giving incorrect answers, like recommending people eat rocks, which one of Google's AI systems did last year.AI might have already begun to cut into Google's popularity as the default for finding digital information. During testimony in a justice department antitrust case against Google this May, one of Apple's top executives, Eddy Cue, said Google search traffic declined for the first time in 22 years because more people are using AI. Google said afterward that it continued to ""see overall query growth"" in search.""They hesitated on this for a long time because they didn't think the quality was good or know how to monetise it,"" said Pete Meyers, the principal innovation architect at Moz, a software company focused on search engine optimization that tracks changes to Google Search. ""Now they're doing what they think they have to do to compete, and it's uncomfortable."" AI Mode, which launched in the US on Tuesday, won't serve ads initially. Google is holding an event for marketers and advertisers on Wednesday where it could unveil more.","Google is introducing a new feature in its search engine called AI Mode.

ISLAMABAD: At least six people, including four children, were killed and dozens injured when a suicide car bomb tore through a school bus in Khuzdar district of Pakistan's restive southwestern Balochistan province Wednesday.The explosion occurred around 7.40 am local time. The bus was carrying nearly 40 students to an Army Public School when an explosives-laden vehicle rammed into it, leaving a trail of devastation. Four children, the bus driver's assistant and another person died, while 38 others were injured, some critically. The wounded were rushed to Khuzdar's Combined Military Hospital, with the most severe cases transferred to Quetta and Karachi for further treatment.Pakistani military's media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), swiftly attributed the attack to ""Indian proxies"", claiming it was a desperate attempt to ""spread terror and unrest"" after Pakistan's alleged battlefield successes. The accusation came days after a fragile ceasefire between the two nations following four days of military clashes earlier this month.Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack as ""sheer barbarism"", vowing that perpetrators, whom he called ""beasts targetting innocent children"", would face justice.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, though suspicion has fallen on the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army.","Suicide car bomb rams into school bus in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province.

Pakistan Supreme Court upholds death penalty in beheading case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-supreme-court-upholds-death-penalty-in-beheading-case/articleshow/121300483.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Tuesday upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer , convicted of the gruesome 2021 murder of Noor Mukadam, the 27-year-old daughter of a former Pakistani diplomat.The decision, delivered by a three-member bench led by Justice Hashim Kakar, reaffirmed the judiciary’s stance on a case that has gripped the nation and exposed deep-seated issues of gender violence and privilege in Pakistan’s elite circles. The ruling, however, also raises questions about the consistency of justice in a country where systemic inequalities often shield the powerful.The case, one of the most high-profile in Pakistan’s recent history, stems from the horrific events of July 20, 2021, when Noor Mukadam was found tortured and beheaded at Jaffer’s residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4.Jaffer, a Pakistani-American and son of a wealthy industrialist, was arrested at the scene, covered in blood. Investigations revealed that Mukadam, a childhood acquaintance, was held hostage for two days, tortured with a knuckleduster, raped, and ultimately decapitated after allegedly rejecting Jaffer’s marriage proposal. The brutality of the crime, coupled with the elite status of both the victim and the perpetrator, sparked nationwide outrage and reignited debates over violence against women in Pakistan.The apex court’s verdict dismissed Jaffer’s appeal, which claimed “erroneous appreciation” of evidence and questioned the fairness of the trial due to media influence. The court upheld the death penalty for murder but converted Jaffer’s second death sentence for rape to life imprisonment, citing legal considerations.“This is not just my daughter’s case; it is a case for all the daughters of Pakistan,” said Shaukat Mukadam, Noor’s father. The ruling has been hailed by many as a victory for accountability, with social media posts on X reflecting public relief: “I hope Noor’s parents will sleep a little better tonight,” wrote one user, while another called it a “win for humanity.” Yet, the decision also exposes uncomfortable truths about Pakistan’s legal and social landscape.Critics argue that the case’s prominence owes much to the victim’s elite background, highlighting a stark disparity in how justice is pursued. “Mukadam’s status as a diplomat’s daughter shone a spotlight on her murder,” said women’s rights activist Tahira Abdullah, noting that countless similar cases involving less privileged women rarely garner such attention or swift judicial action. Pakistan ranks 153 out of 156 countries in the World Economic Forum’s 2021 gender gap index, and domestic violence remains a pervasive issue, with 28% of women aged 15-49 reporting physical violence, according to the ministry of human rights.","The Supreme Court of Pakistan upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer.

Pakistan promotes army chief Munir to 5-star rank of Field Marshal for ‘crushing enemy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-promotes-army-chief-munir-to-5-star-rank-of-field-marshal-for-crushing-enemy/articleshow/121300334.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: The Shehbaz Sharif govt in Pakistan promoted Tuesday army chief Syed Asim Munir from general to the five-star rank of Field Marshal in recognition of what it described as “exemplary leadership” while responding to India’s Operation Sindoor and bringing “great honour to our motherland”.For a country that has had four military rulers at different periods in its history, Field Marshal Munir is only the second Army chief to have been elevated to the apex rank, modelled on the British army’s structure. The first one, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, assumed the rank in 1959 while he was President, citing “requests” from Pakistani civil society.PM Shehbaz’s office announced that the cabinet unanimously decided to also continue the services of Air Chief Marshal Zahar Ahmed Babar Sidhu after his term ends.The statement also claimed that Pakistan downed five Indian jets and thwarted “further incursions”, leading to a US-mediated pause in military operations from May 10. Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, quoted Field Marshal Munir as dedicating the honour to “the nation, armed forces, and martyrs”.In a congratulatory statement on X, Shehbaz credited Field Marshal Munir with orchestrating a “high strategy” during the conflict with India, which escalated with the latter’s May 6-7 airstrikes targeting nine terrorist sites.Operation Sindoor was India’s response to 26 deaths in the April 22 terrorist attack on tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam.Without naming India, Shehbaz said that under Field Marshal Munir, the army “crushed the enemy’s nefarious designs”.With Pakistan’s history of military coups looming large, newly coronated Field Marshal Munir is widely seen as the kingmaker behind Shehbaz’s premiership. Critics of the move within Pakistan argue the promotion strengthens the military’s grip over civilian governance, especially amid domestic challenges like the Baloch insurgency and economic woes.The timing of the promotion, coinciding with Pakistan seeking US and EU’s support to counter “India’s terrorism narrative”, suggests a bid to project strength.While the PM's office and ISPR frame Field Marshal Munir’s elevation as a tribute to national resilience, its political undertones and opaque military claims raise concerns about democratic backsliding and regional instability.","Shehbaz Sharif govt in Pakistan promoted Tuesday army chief Syed Asim Munir from general to the five-star rank of Field Marshal. Field Marshal Munir is only the second Army chief to have been elevated to the apex rank, modelled on the British army's structure.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121300326,imgsize-12008,width-400,resizemode-4/121300326.jpg"

A 4.7-magnitude earthquake hit Pakistan's Swat district and nearby regions on Sunday, according to ARY News.The quake struck at a depth of 205 kilometres, with its epicentre in the Hindukush mountain range — a known seismic zone spanning parts of Afghanistan and northern Pakistan.Tremors were felt across several areas of Swat, including Mingora and its outskirts. Authorities confirmed there were no immediate reports of damage.Earlier, on May 12, a 4.9-magnitude earthquake had shaken Quetta, the capital of Balochistan.The National Seismic Monitoring Centre (NSMC) confirmed that the 4.9-magnitude tremors affected Quetta and neighbouring regions. The quake's epicentre was situated west of Quetta, according to NSMC data.The tremor came just two days after Pakistan was hit by two consecutive earthquakes on Saturday — a 5.7-magnitude quake in the morning and a 4.0-magnitude tremor later in the day, according to Reuters.Pakistan's geographical position makes it particularly vulnerable to seismic activity, as it sits at the intersection of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The country's territory is traversed by numerous significant fault lines, resulting in frequent and potentially damaging earthquakes.","A 4.7-magnitude earthquake hit Pakistan's Swat district and nearby regions on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan late Saturday revealed that it too would launch a diplomatic campaign led by foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to present its narrative to the world. This comes after India announced it would dispatch seven all-party delegations to key capitals to brief global leaders on Operation Sindoor and its counter-terrorism efforts “I was contacted earlier today by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who requested that I lead a delegation to present Pakistan's case for peace on the international stage. I am honoured to accept this responsibility and remain committed to serving Pakistan in these challenging times,” Bhutto-Zardari wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday.However, there was no official confirmation of the campaign from the Pakistan government.The announcement follows India’s decision to send seven all-party delegations to key global capitals to brief foreign governments on its precision military strikes under Operation Sindoor. Launched on May 7 in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, the operation targeted nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Over 100 terrorists affiliated with groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed Lashkar-e-Taiba , and Hizbul Mujahideen were reportedly killed.Following the strikes, Pakistan retaliated with cross-border shelling and attempted drone incursions. In response, India launched secondary strikes targeting Pakistani military infrastructure, including radar systems and communication nodes.To consolidate international backing, union minister Kiren Rijiju announced that delegations led by prominent leaders such as Shashi Tharoor, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Sanjay Kumar Jha, Baijayant Panda, Kanimozhi Karunanidhi, Supriya Sule, and Shrikant Eknath Shinde will visit UN Security Council member states and strategic allies.“In moments that matter most, Bharat stands united.

Human rights violations in Sindh





Jeay Sindh Freedom Movement ( JSFM ), a political group advocating for Sindhu Desh, staged a peaceful sit-in protest on a highway in Pakistan on Friday, demanding the release of missing and jailed Sindhi nationalists. With traffic halted and slogans echoing through the air, the group sought global attention to enforced disappearances , illegal detentions, and human rights abuses in Sindh and Balochistan.JSFM leaders, including chairman Sohail Abro, Zubair Sindhi, and Amar Azadi, called for the immediate release of Zahid Channa, Sajad Channa, Adnan Baloch, Badshah Baloch, Rafiqat Manghanhar, and Shahid Soomro. They also demanded that false charges against them be withdrawn and that all forcibly arrested persons be freed.""This peaceful sit-in serves as a protest against the unlawful arrests of our nationalist activists, the abuses occurring in jails, and the enforced disappearances. Our effort is peaceful and democratic, and we will persist until our people are free,"" the collective statement read.The protestors warned the Hyderabad Jail authorities against further mistreatment of detainees and threatened to block the prison’s main gate if abuse continued.They also called out to international organisations like the UN, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch, urging intervention and global condemnation of Pakistan's rights violations.A 2022 US State Department report, had pointed out widespread cases of extrajudicial killings and the recovery of mutilated bodies across Sindh.In 2024, Abro had also appealed for help in the case of Priya Kumari, a missing Hindu girl, stressing rising cases of forced conversions and marriages to Muslim men.Sindhis have been historically struggling for identity and autonomy. They accuse the Pakistani state of erasing local culture through systemic oppression—citing Urdu imposition, the ‘One unit’ policy, and historic land grabs like the removal of Karachi from Sindh.Meanwhile, in related developments, Balochistan declared independence from Pakistan this week. On social media, hashtags like #RepublicOfBalochistan trended, with users sharing proposed flags and maps.","Jeay Sindh Freedom Movement (JSFM) staged a peaceful sit-in protest on a highway in Pakistan on Friday, demanding the release of missing and jailed Sindhi nationalists.

Decreasing day by day



Use less water







KABUL: Every week, Bibi Jan scrapes together some of her husband's meagre daily wage to buy precious water from rickshaw-drawn tankers that supply residents of Afghanistan's increasingly parched capital.Kabul faces a looming water crisis, driven by unruly and rapid urbanisation, mismanagement over years of conflict, and climate change, meaning people like Bibi Jan are sometimes forced to choose between food and water.""When my children have only tea for a few days, they say, 'You bought water and nothing for us',"" the 45-year-old housewife told AFP, describing reusing her supplies for bathing, dishes and laundry.Experts have long sounded the alarm over Kabul's water problems, which are worsening even as many international players have backed off big infrastructure projects and slashed funding to Afghanistan since the Taliban government took power in 2021.""There could be no ground water in Kabul by 2030"" without urgent action, the UN children's agency Unicef warned last year.Other experts are more cautious, citing limited consistent and reliable data, but say the situation is clearly deteriorating.A 2030 cliff is a ""worst-case scenario"", said water resources management expert Assem Mayar.But even if slated development projects are completed in a few years, it ""doesn't mean the situation would become better than now"", Mayar said.""As time goes on, the problems are only increasing,"" he added, as population growth outstrips urban planning and climate change drives below-average precipitation.The Taliban authorities have launched projects ranging from recycling water to building hundreds of small dams across the country, but larger interventions remain hampered by financing and technical capacity.They remain unrecognised by any country since they ousted the Western-backed government and imposed their severe interpretation of Islamic law, with restrictions on women a major sticking point.They have repeatedly called for non-governmental groups to reboot stalled projects on water and climate change, as Afghanistan faces ""some of the harshest effects"" in the region, according to the United Nations.The water and energy ministry wants to divert water from the Panjshir river to the capital, but needs $300 million to $400 million. A dam project near Kabul would ease pressures but was delayed after the Taliban takeover.For now, Kabul's primary drinking water source is groundwater, as much as 80 percent of which is contaminated, according to a May report by Mercy Corps.It is tapped by more than 100,000 unregulated wells across the city that are regularly deepened or run dry, the NGO said.Groundwater can be recharged, but more is drawn each year than is replenished in Kabul, with an estimated annual 76-million-cubic-metre (20-billion-gallon) deficit, experts say.""It's a very serious problem... Water is decreasing day by day in the city,"" said Shafiullah Zahidi, who heads central Kabul operations for the state-owned water company UWASS.Water systems designed decades ago serve just 20 percent of the city's population, which has exploded to around six million over the past 20 years, said Zahidi.At one of Kabul's 15 pumping stations, maintenance manager Mohammad Ehsan said the seven-year-old well is already producing less water. Two others nearby sit dry.""The places with shallower water levels are dried out now,"" said 53-year-old Ehsan, who has worked in water management for two decades, as he stood over an old well.It once produced water from a depth of 70 metres (230 feet), but a newer well had to be bored more than twice as deep to reach groundwater.At one of the two large stations in the city, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) recently procured four new pumps where only one had been functioning.""If that pump collapsed for any reason, that means stopping the service for 25,000 beneficiary households,"" which now have uninterrupted water, said Baraa Afeh, ICRC's deputy water and habitat coordinator.Everyone in Kabul ""should have 24-hour service"", said Zahidi, from the state water company.But in reality, Bibi Jan and many other Kabulis are forced to lug water in heavy jugs from wells or buy it from tankers.These suppliers charge at least twice as much as the state-owned utility, with potable water even more pricy in a country where 85 percent of the population lives on less than a dollar a day.Bibi Jan said she has to police her family's water use carefully.""I tell them, 'I'm not a miser but use less water.' Because if the water runs out then what would we do?""","Kabul faces a looming water crisis, driven by unruly and rapid urbanisation, mismanagement over years of conflict, and climate change. The Taliban authorities have launched projects ranging from recycling water to building hundreds of small dams across the country.

Breeding ground for violence

Nowruz holiday declared 'un-Islamic'

Women's rights in decline

Afghans deported from Iran





Amid many other global crises, the human rights situation in Afghanistan has been overshadowed in the international media. Millions of people continue to suffer from systemic rights violations under the Taliban-run government, a UN report has found.Tasked with assisting the people of Afghanistan, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) monitors the human rights situation in the country, issuing regular reports. In its latest update on the human rights situation in Afghanistan, UNAMA not only documented cases of gender-based violence and public floggings but also the growing persecution of the Ismaili community.Ismailism is a branch of Shia Islam, while Sunni Islam is the dominant religion in Afghanistan. Most members of the Ismaili community live in the country's northern provinces, such as Badakhshan or Baghlan. In the former, there have been at least 50 cases of members of the Ismaili community being forced to convert to the Sunni faith. Those who refused to do so were subjected to physical assaults, coercion and death threats.""They are only accepted as Muslims if they profess the Sunni faith by force,"" Yaqub Yasna, a professor and member of the Afghan Ismaili community, told DW.Yasna himself was accused of blasphemy after the Taliban takeover of 2021 because he advocated enlightenment and tolerance in society. He was forced to step down from his position at his university and went into exile for fear of reprisals.Yasna said that even before the Taliban's return to power, tolerance toward the Ismaili minority in Afghanistan was limited but that the political system had at least protected their civil rights.He said that under the Taliban, tolerance had continued to decline steadily. ""When their rights are violated today, they don't know who they can turn to. Their children are forced to profess the Sunni faith,"" he explained. ""Under Taliban rule, only one faith is considered legitimate. Anything that deviates from their interpretation of Islam is rejected and thus creates a breeding ground for violence against religious minorities. ""Afghan human rights activist Abdullah Ahmadi confirmed there was increasing pressure on one of the last remaining religious minorities in Afghanistan. ""We have received several reports showing that children from the Ismaili community are being forced to attend Sunni-run religious schools. If they refuse to do so, or do not attend classes regularly, their families have to pay heavy fines,"" he said.Ahmadi complained that the international community had responded only hesitantly to the human rights violations in his country. He called for targeted sanctions against Taliban officials, saying they ""must be held accountable.""Historically, the country was a significant center of religious diversity, but there are very few members of non-Muslim communities left in Afghanistan today.The last members of the Jewish community left the country in September 2021. Those Christians who still live there tend to practice their faith in secret. And the Hazaras, another ethnic minority in Afghanistan who are predominantly Shiite, continue to be persecuted.The Taliban only accept one interpretation of religion and have banned certain rituals and festivals, including Nowruz, which marks the beginning of spring and a new year. They declared the holiday ""un-Islamic"" and said that nobody in Afghanistan should observe the celebration.The situation of all women is also getting worse, which means that half of society is subject to systematic oppression. According to the UNAMA report, girls continue to be ""barred from participating in education beyond grade six"" and there has been ""no announcement made by the de facto authorities regarding the reopening of high schools and universities to girls and women.""In the western city of Herat, the Taliban has confiscated several rickshaws and warned drivers not to transport women who were unaccompanied by a ""mahram,"" a close male relative.Despite this disastrous situation, Afghans who fled to neighboring countries are being expelled en masse. According to the United Nations, around 110,000 people, including women and children, were forced to return in April. Large numbers of people are also being deported from Iran.""We live in fear of being deported to Afghanistan every day,"" Afghan journalist Marzia Rahimi told DW. ""What am I supposed to do with my children there?""Rahimi said that only misery and terror awaited her in Afghanistan if she returned, explaining that she had left because she was unable to continue working as a journalist under Taliban rule and would not have been able to provide her daughter with an education.Most independent media outlets have been banned or placed under the control of the state. Journalists who criticize the regime risk being arrested and tortured.Under the Taliban, the country has also been plunged into an even more catastrophic socioeconomic crisis. Some 64% of the population of 41.5 million lives in poverty, according to the UN, with 50% dependent on humanitarian aid for survival and 14% suffering from acute hunger.","The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) monitors the human rights situation in the country.

Afghanistan hit with fourth earthquake in as many days,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/afghanistan-hit-with-fourth-earthquake-in-as-many-days/articleshow/121260335.cms,"An earthquake struck Afghanistan on Monday morning (Image: ANI)





An earthquake of 4.2 magnitude has jolted Afghanistan in the early hours of Monday, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS). The tremors occurred around 08.54 am IST and were recorded at a depth of 140 kms.The NCS posted the details of the earthquake on its X account. The epicenter was located at a latitude of 36.41 N and longitude of 70.94 E. This is the fourth consecutive earthquake to hit the country in the last four days.Earlier on Sunday, a 4.5-magnitude earthquake shook Afghanistan. According to the NCS, it occurred at a depth of 150 kilometres.Previously on 17 May, an earthquake of magnitude 4.2 struck the region.On 16 May, another earthquake of magnitude 4.0 struck the region.Experts suggested that deeper earthquakes are less dangerous than shallow earthquakes because the seismic waves travel a longer distance before reaching the earth's surface due to which they lose their energy.Afghanistan has a history of powerful earthquakes. According to the Red Cross, the Hindu Kush region is a geologically active area where earthquakes occur every year.Afghanistan is situated on several fault lines between the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates, making it a seismically active region. A major fault line also runs directly through Herat. These plates meet and collide resulting in frequent seismic activity.According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( UNOCHA ), Afghanistan remains highly vulnerable to natural disasters. This also includes seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.UNOCHA noted that these frequent earthquakes in Afghanistan can cause damage to vulnerable communities that are already struggling with decades of conflict and under-development. These challenges have left them with limited capacity to cope with multiple disasters at once.","Afghanistan is situated on several fault lines between the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates, making it a seismically active region.

At least five local media outlets in Hong Kong and multiple journalists had their taxes from years ago audited on ""unreasonable grounds"", a press association said Wednesday.Hong Kong's press freedom ranking has plummeted since Beijing cracked down on dissent after huge, sometimes violent pro-democracy protests in 2019.The Hong Kong tax authorities alleged that a group of online outlets, reporters and some of their family members had failed to report their income from 2017 to 2019 in full.Backdated demands have been issued as a result, according to the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA).The association told reporters it believed the audits ""were not based on sufficient evidence or reasonable grounds.""The impacted media outlets listed by the HKJA include Hong Kong Free Press, Inmedia and The Witness, a news site focused on covering court cases, as well as two others.HKJA said the tax department had claimed back money for ""bizarre"" reasons, including calculating non-existent income from before one of the outlets was founded.Selina Cheng, the HKJA's chair and a former Wall Street Journal reporter, said the association, herself and her parents were also impacted.Hong Kong's Inland Revenue Department (IRD) said it followed the legal process and that its actions were not aimed at specific industries, according to local media.IRD added that it would not comment on ""individual cases"".Hong Kong journalists rated the city's press freedom lower than ever in an annual survey last year, citing fears around sweeping national security laws.More than 90 percent of journalists surveyed said the city's press freedom was ""significantly"" impacted by a domestic security law enacted in March 2024 that punishes crimes like espionage and foreign interference.Colloquially known as Article 23, it was the second such law enacted for the financial hub, following one imposed by Beijing in 2020 after the pro-democracy protests.China's foreign ministry said that Hong Kong's security laws ""target a very small number of individuals who severely endanger national security, not law-abiding media reporters"".","Hong Kong tax authorities alleged that a group of online outlets, reporters and some of their family members had failed to report their income from 2017 to 2019 in full.

Grammy-winning singer Chris Brown was released on 5 million-pound ($6.7 million) bail Wednesday while facing allegations he beat and seriously injured a music producer with a bottle in a London nightclub in 2023.The decision by a London judge to grant bail will allow Brown to launch a world tour next month that had been thrown into doubt last week when a district judge in Manchester ordered him into custody after he was charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent.Judge Tony Baumgartner in Southwark Crown Court said that Brown could go on tour, including several stops in the UK., but would have to pay the bail to guarantee his court appearance.Brown, who was not in court for the hearing, was released in the late afternoon from a jail in Salford, outside Manchester, where he had been arrested at a hotel last week.Brown was initially scheduled to return to court on June 13. Had he remained in custody, he would have missed the first two nights of his upcoming European tour, which starts next month.Brown, 36, is accused of an unprovoked attack on producer Abe Diaw at a bar in the Tape nightclub in the swanky Mayfair neighborhood in February 2023 while he was on his last tour.Prosecutor Hannah Nicholls said last week in Manchester Magistrates' Court that Brown struck Diaw several times with a bottle and then punched and kicked him in an attack caught on surveillance camera in front of a club full of people.American musician Omololu Akinlolu, 38, who performs under the name ""Hoody Baby"" and is a friend of Brown, was also charged in the assault.Neither Brown nor Akinlolu have entered a plea yet. Both men were ordered to appear in court again on June 20.Brown, who burst onto the music scene as a teen in 2005, won his first Grammy for best R&B album in 2011 for ""F A M E"" and then earned his second in the same category for ""11:11 (Deluxe)"" earlier this year.His hits include songs such as ""Run It,"" ""Kiss Kiss"" and ""Without You.""His tour is due to kick off June 8 in Amsterdam before starting North America shows in July.",Singer Chris Brown freed on $6.7 million bail in assault case.

Why UK suspended free trade talks with Israel as tensions escalate over the Gaza war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-uk-suspended-free-trade-talks-with-israel-as-tensions-escalate-over-the-gaza-war/articleshow/121317283.cms,"Israeli Ministers’ “purify Gaza” comments trigger tensions



UK Government ’s concerns over the Gaza aid



Israel’s response

Trade and diplomatic ties reassessed

Growing political divide in the UK parliament





The United Kingdom has suspended free trade negotiations with Israel amid mounting tensions over the ongoing war in Gaza, marking the most serious diplomatic rift between the two countries in decades. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced the decision in Parliament, condemning what he called “repellent” and “monstrous” rhetoric by senior Israeli ministers, including calls to “purify Gaza” by forcibly expelling Palestinians. Lammy also criticized Israel for blocking humanitarian aid from entering the besieged strip, calling the actions morally unjustifiable and warning that such policies are damaging Israel’s global reputation and standing.David Lammy’s strongest condemnation was aimed at extremist rhetoric from within the Israeli government. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and other senior figures reportedly used language calling to “cleanse” or “purify” Gaza, suggesting the displacement of Palestinians to third countries. Lammy described these remarks as “monstrous, repellent, and extremist,” warning that such views have no place in international diplomacy and are “dangerously inflammatory.The UK government expressed deep concern over Israel’s refusal to allow thousands of humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza, where civilians are facing mass displacement, starvation, and trauma. Lammy stated that fewer than 10 trucks had been allowed through recently, despite UN and WHO warnings of a looming humanitarian catastrophe. The UK joined international calls urging Israel to lift the blockade and allow aid to reach the most vulnerable populations.Israel’s Foreign Ministry responded harshly, accusing the UK of “anti-Israel obsession.” Spokesperson Oren Marmorstein claimed Britain was harming its own economy for political optics and dismissed the move as symbolic. He asserted that Israel would not be swayed by external pressure in its military and security operations, defending the ongoing actions as necessary for national defence against Hamas.In addition to suspending the trade talks, the UK is now reviewing its broader strategic roadmap with Israel. L ammy indicated that further actions, including sanctions and arms export restrictions, are being considered in coordination with international partners. Three Israeli settlers and four West Bank-based entities have already been sanctioned for human rights violations. However, some MPs are pressing for even more decisive action, including a recognition of Palestinian statehood and a total arms embargo.Lammy’s statement received strong backing from Labour backbenchers and some Conservative MPs, though others expressed frustration that the UK government’s response remained largely symbolic. Calls were made for concrete steps such as halting arms sales and taking a tougher stance at the United Nations. Critics argued that powerful rhetoric must be backed with meaningful policy changes to influence Israeli behavior and alleviate Palestinian suffering.The UK’s decision to suspend free trade talks with Israel highlights growing international concern over the intensifying conflict in Gaza and the worsening humanitarian crisis. Diplomatic relations between the two countries have reached a low point, with strong criticism of Israeli ministerial comment and aid restrictions. While the UK cites moral and humanitarian obligations, Israel defends its actions as necessary for national security. This marks a significant moment in their bilateral ties, raising questions about the future direction of diplomacy. Whether this pause results in constructive dialogue or deepens divisions will depend on actions taken by both sides in the coming weeks.","The United Kingdom has suspended free trade negotiations with Israel amid mounting tensions over the ongoing war in Gaza.

What is the Dartmoor wild camping dispute? UK Supreme Court restores public right to the camp,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/what-is-the-dartmoor-wild-camping-dispute-uk-supreme-court-restores-public-right-to-the-camp/articleshow/121315152.cms,"The legal battle over wild camping at Dartamoor

Supreme Court clarifies “open-air recreation”

Public reaction and campaigner response

Calls for national access reform

A victory for Dartmoor and public access





In a landmark decision, the UK Supreme Court has ruled that wild camping is legal on Dartmoor , restoring a long-standing public right that had been challenged by a wealthy landowner. The ruling concludes a two-year legal battle initiated by hedge fund manager Alexander Darwall, who sought to ban camping on his 4,000-acre estate in Dartmoor National Park. The court held that the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985 allows for wild camping as a legitimate form of “open-air recreation.” This decision marks a significant victory for land access rights in England.Alexander Darwall, Dartmoor’s sixth-largest landowner, purchased the Blachford estate in 2013. He objected to people camping on his land without permission, citing concerns about conservation and livestock safety. In 2023, Darwall won in the High Court, which ruled that wild camping was not covered under existing public access rights. This triggered widespread backlash and an appeal from the Dartmoor National Park Authority (DNPA), supported by public protests and land rights activists.The case hinged on the interpretation of the term “open-air recreation” under the Dartmoor Commons Act. Darwall’s legal team argued for a narrow definition limited to walking and horseback riding.In contrast, the DNPA and campaigners contended that activities like camping, picnicking, and bird watching were valid recreational uses. The Supreme Court ultimately agreed with the broader interpretation, concluding that wild camping is a legitimate form of enjoying Dartmoor’s natural beauty.The ruling has been celebrated by activists and local communities. Thousands had camped in protest over the past year to assert their right to access Dartmoor. Campaigners from the Right to Roam group hailed the decision as a “relief,” while highlighting the fragility of access laws in England. MP Caroline Voaden called the judgment a “vindication” and urged further legislative action to extend wild camping rights across the UK.Following the decision, campaigners are pushing for a new Right to Roam Act that would expand public access to nature beyond Dartmoor. Labour had previously promised such reforms while in opposition but has yet to include them in its current manifesto. The Supreme Court’s verdict has renewed pressure on the government to ensure that public access rights are protected and expanded for future generations.Kevin Bishop, CEO of the DNPA, welcomed the ruling, emphasizing that national parks are meant to serve all people, not just a privileged few. He assured that responsible access would be promoted, balancing the needs of landowners and the public. The Supreme Court’s decision secures the unique tradition of wild camping in Dartmoor and sets a precedent for broader land access rights in England.","The UK Supreme Court has ruled that wild camping is legal on Dartmoor.

Will the agreement boost UK economic growth ?



Could the defence pact shift the landscape?



Does the deal mean a loss of UK sovereignty?

What comes next?







LONDON: Britain has hailed Monday's strategic partnership agreement with the European Union as the start of a new era, but the effects of the deal on defence and trade remain unclear.That is one of Prime Minister Keir Starmer 's key arguments for restoring closer ties with the EU.This deal, along with those signed earlier in May with the United States and India, ""release us from the tired arguments of the past and, as an independent sovereign nation, allow us to seize the opportunities of the future"", the Labour leader told parliament on Tuesday.The 2021 post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreement did not reinstate tariffs between the UK and EU, but introduced new trade barriers.The easing of veterinary checks and rules on food and drink trade, agreed on Monday, could increase UK exports to the EU by more than 22 percent, according to a study by the universities of Bristol and Aston.The deal also exempts UK businesses from the EU's carbon border tax, saving more than £800 million ($1.07 billion) a year, according to Starmer's office.Industry body UK Steel called it ""a significant step in reducing trade frictions in steel with the EU"".The UK government expects estimated economic gains of ""nearly £9 billion"" by 2040 -- but that amounts to less than 0.3 percent of the country's GDP.London and Brussels signed a pact to deepen defence cooperation, aimed at strengthening dialogue.The stakes are high given Russia's threat to European security, cyber dangers and concerns that the United States is disengaging from Europe.But Ed Arnold of the UK defence think tank RUSI said the agreement sets out ""no tangible deliverables or milestones, instead relying on vague commitments to talk more"".""To 'consider' participation is not a commitment to deploy, and as such does not compromise government sovereignty in any way,"" he said.""The real meat, the question of UK participation in defence industrial cooperation, is left still to be done,"" said Ian Bond, deputy director at the Centre for European Reform.""That's not a surprise but this is an indication that there is still a lot of work,"" he added.Conservatives and the Eurosceptic Reform UK party accused the government of handing over sovereignty to the EU.Opposition leader Kemi Badenoch on Tuesday described the deal as a ""betrayal"" and a ""failure"".The Sun tabloid accused Starmer of agreeing to adopt Brussels' rules, ""bow down to EU judges"" and criticised its agreement to allow French boats to continue fishing in UK waters for another 12 years.On sanitary and phytosanitary standards, the UK will have to align with EU regulations and adapt to future changes. Any disputes will ultimately be settled by the European Court of Justice.The UK will have little influence over future rules affecting its own territory, said Tom Bradshaw, president of the main farming union NFU.""Despite the benefits this deal brings, full dynamic (regulatory) alignment comes at a significant cost of committing to future EU rules, in which the UK will have little say,"" he said.While London conceded more than expected on fisheries -- extending EU access to British waters due to expire next year for 12 years until June 2038, the sector accounts for just 0.03 per cent of UK GDP.British fishers already export three-quarters of their catch to the EU, and the standards agreement will be ""hugely beneficial"", said Bond.Several issues remained unresolved after Monday's summit, including an EU-backed youth mobility scheme and the UK's potential return to the Erasmus student exchange programme , both priorities for Brussels.London, for its part, is seeking relaxed visa rules for touring artists and mutual recognition of professional qualifications.The two sides agreed to hold a bilateral summit every year.Some observers see the outlines of a relationship similar to Switzerland's, based on multiple bilateral agreements with the EU.The idea, particularly on mobility, is to strike specific arrangements in areas where the EU also sees a mutual benefit, said Bond.","UK and Brussels signed a pact to deepen defence cooperation, aimed at strengthening dialogue.

Tommy Robinson case: Why was he jailed and why is he being released early?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/tommy-robinson-case-why-was-he-jailed-and-why-is-he-being-released-early/articleshow/121293523.cms,"Why was Robinson jailed?

Why he’s being released early





Far-right figure Tommy Robinson is set to be released from prison four months early after the UK high court reduced his 18-month sentence for contempt of court . Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon , was jailed in October 2023 for repeatedly breaching an injunction banning him from spreading false claims about a Syrian refugee. His early release follows a court ruling that accepted he had shown a willingness to comply with the order, despite lacking any clear signs of remorse.Robinson, was jailed in October 2023 for breaching a court order that prohibited him from repeating libellous claims about a Syrian teenager. The case stemmed from false allegations Robinson made in 2018, when he described then-schoolboy Jamal Hijazi as a violent bully in videos shared online. These claims were later proven to be untrue, with Hijazi successfully suing Robinson for libel in 2021 and being awarded £100,000 in damages.Following the libel ruling, an injunction was issued to prevent Robinson from repeating the defamatory statements. However, he went on to breach the order multiple times through interviews, online videos, and a speech at a public rally, which led to his conviction for contempt of court.He admitted to ten breaches of the injunction. Robinson’s actions triggered further abuse directed at the teenager, who was forced to leave school and whose family had to relocate.The sentencing judge in October imposed an 18-month prison term, which included a 14-month punitive element and a four-month coercive element—designed to pressure Robinson into complying with the injunction. He was jailed at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes.On Tuesday, the high court in London ruled that Robinson's sentence should be reduced, potentially allowing for his release within days. Mr Justice Jeremy Johnson, who oversaw the hearing, said Robinson had shown a “change in attitude” and accepted that he had given clear assurances not to breach the injunction again.Robinson’s legal team argued that he had taken steps to remove the offending content and had demonstrated his commitment to complying with the court’s order. His lawyer, Alex Di Francesco, said each breach capable of being “purged” had been acted upon, with most material removed from online platforms.While the judge acknowledged Robinson’s ongoing lack of remorse, he accepted that the coercive portion of the sentence had served its purpose. As a result, Robinson will only be required to complete the punitive element, which ends this week. He had originally been due for release on 26 July.",Far-right figure Tommy Robinson is set to be released from prison four months early.

A 37-year-old jeweller from Windsor, Berkshire, has been handed a 21-month prison sentence, suspended for two years,by a UK court, for his involvement in the 2019 theft of an 18-carat gold toilet valued at £4.8 million from Blenheim Palace, the birthplace of Winston Churchill.Frederick Doe, also known as Frederick Sines, was convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property after attempting to broker the sale of the stolen artwork, titled ""America,"" by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan.The theft occurred in September 2019, when a group of masked thieves armed with sledgehammers and crowbars broke into the palace, removed the fully functioning gold toilet, and fled the scene in stolen vehicles. The heist, which lasted just five minutes, caused significant damage to the historic property due to flooding from the plumbed-in installation. The toilet, weighing approximately 98 kilograms, was never recovered and neither was any gold, which is believed to have been melted down.Doe's role in the crime was as a foolish middleman attempting to facilitate the sale of the stolen gold, said Judge Ian Pringle.“You had a limited function, you had no personal gain, you had no wider involvement and you were involved for a short period,"" he said, according to a report by AFP.He added that the perpetrators of the “audacious heist"" clearly aimed to offload the artwork without delay.He was found to have communicated with one of the burglars, James Sheen, about finding a buyer for the gold, referring to it using the code word ""cars."" Despite his limited involvement, Doe was convicted due to his attempts to convert the stolen property into cash.Judge Ian Pringle noted that while Doe's actions were ""foolish,"" he had been exploited by the actual thieves and did not benefit financially from the crime. The judge also considered Doe's previously good character, family responsibilities including caring for a sick wife and four children and his charitable work running a boxing club for underprivileged youth. These factors contributed to the decision to suspend his sentence and order him to complete 240 hours of unpaid community service.Two other men, James Sheen and Michael Jones, who played more direct roles in the crime, are due to be sentenced next month. The 39-year-old Jones was convicted along with Doe who was found guilty of burglary. While Sheen, pleaded guilty to charges of burglary and money laundering.The theft has been widely discussed due to the high-profile nature of the artwork.The case has drawn attention to the issue of art theft and the lengths to which individuals will go to profit from stolen cultural artifacts. Authorities continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding the theft and the fate of the stolen toilet.","Frederick Doe, 37, handed 21-month prison sentence, suspended for two years.

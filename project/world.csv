Satellite systems bypass these limitations by bringing connectivity directly overhead, often the only viable option where fibre lines can’t reach. With broadband speeds sufficient for video conferencing, real-time collaboration and interactive education platforms, students can participate in live classes, access global resources and engage with educators and peers across borders.

Connectivity alone is not enough. By combining satellite internet with a comprehensive educational platform like The Digital School, the model ensures that teachers are equipped, content is relevant and learning pathways are structured rather than simply providing access without curriculum support.

Challenges in UAE's partnership with Elon Musk's Starlink and the path ahead

While the initiative is promising, several challenges remain in scaling global digital education -

Device Availability: Ensuring that students have the appropriate devices (computers, tablets) to use satellite internet effectively.

Ensuring that students have the appropriate devices (computers, tablets) to use satellite internet effectively. Digital Literacy: Training teachers, learners and communities to make optimal use of digital tools and platforms.

Training teachers, learners and communities to make optimal use of digital tools and platforms. Sustainability: Funding long-term operations, maintenance and support for remote deployments.

However, the UAE’s strategy of combining connectivity infrastructure with education design, teacher training and local partnership frameworks seeks to address these factors holistically. The UAE–Starlink digital education partnership reflects a global vision where access to quality education transcends physical and economic barriers.

By combining one of the world’s most advanced satellite networks with a structured digital learning ecosystem, the initiative pushes toward an inclusive model that could reshape how underserved communities learn, connect and participate in the 21st-century economy. This effort also signals how public-private collaboration in technology and education can unlock new opportunities, aligning with broader global dialogues, such as those at the Future of Education Forum, about the future of learning and the importance of equitable access at scale.

The UAE’s partnership with Starlink to expand digital education worldwide is more than a connectivity project; it is a strategic push to bridge the education divide, empower remote learners and innovate how learning is delivered globally. By leveraging satellite technology and structured digital platforms, the initiative could set a blueprint for the next era of education access.





By partnering with Starlink, the UAE is positioning itself at the forefront of a 21st-century education revolution, championing a model where geography no longer limits a child’s access to learning.Under the initiative, Starlink will provide the underlying satellite broadband connectivity, while The Digital School (a UAE-driven digital learning platform operated under the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives) will supply structured education, platforms and curriculum support.Already, pilot implementations in Lesotho have seen schools equipped with Starlink terminals alongside digital learning systems, teacher training programmes, and tools for systematic education access. The partnership aligns with broader global efforts to bridge the digital divide in education, an issue highlighted by technology deployments in other countries where Starlink has boosted learning access.For instance:These examples show how satellite internet is increasingly being used to fill connectivity gaps, making online education, from basic courses to advanced collaboration, more widely available. Traditional broadband expansion can be slow and expensive, especially in mountainous, rural or sparsely populated regions.","UAE has announced a strategic global partnership with Starlink, the satellite internet service operated by SpaceX.

In a major step for the UAE’s digital infrastructure ambitions, telecom provider du has announced a strategic partnership to land and invest in the Singapore-India-Gulf (SING) submarine cable system, a next-generation undersea fibre-optic network that will link the Middle East with South Asia and Southeast Asia. The deal reinforces the UAE’s role as a regional data hub and is poised to support future digital growth, artificial intelligence workloads, cloud services and global connectivity.The SING (Singapore-India-Gulf) cable is a planned high-capacity submarine fibre-optic network designed to create a direct east–west digital corridor connecting six strategic landing points:This system is designed to provide high-capacity, low-latency connectivity and strengthen network resilience by diversifying data routes beyond traditional paths such as the Red Sea corridor. It will play a key role in supporting increasing global bandwidth demands driven by cloud computing, streaming, e-commerce and real-time digital services.Under the new partnership, du, one of the UAE’s leading telecom and digital services providers, will host the SING cable at its Kalba cable landing station and also participate financially in its rollout. This means that when completed, the system will have a physical connection to the UAE’s digital ecosystem, allowing faster, more resilient connectivity between the Gulf region and Asia.Karim Benkirane, Chief Commercial Officer at du, said the project will “reinforce the UAE’s role as a global hub for data, cloud and artificial intelligence” by providing the connectivity scale, performance and reliability needed for hyperscalers, tech innovators and enterprise customers.The SING subsea cable is part of a broader renaissance in global submarine infrastructure. Projects like SEA-ME-WE 6, another major submarine cable ongoing between Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Europe, have highlighted the growing need for redundancy, capacity and network reliability. In recent years, disruptions to undersea cables in the Red Sea, a critical data conduit, have shown how vulnerable global internet routes can be to outages, emphasising the need for alternative pathways like SING that can mitigate service impacts if certain routes are compromised.By diversifying connectivity pathways, the UAE and its partners aim to ensure stable data routes that underpin everything from corporate cloud services to consumer streaming and real-time financial systems. The UAE’s investment in SING coincides with global trends in subsea cable deployment. For example, projects like the SEA-ME-WE 6 system, which connects Southeast Asia to Europe with high capacity, are enhancing global data traffic infrastructure and helping meet surging demand.Although the exact ready-for-service date for the SING cable is not yet announced, project progress has accelerated after a major investment by Cerberus Capital Management, which resolved longstanding funding challenges and propelled the system toward execution with planned deployment by 2030. Once operational, the SING network is expected to deliver tens of terabits per second of capacity, providing scalable flexibility for future data needs from businesses, cloud operators, AI research initiatives and cross-continent platforms.Additionally, major alternative cable initiatives such as USTDA-supported efforts for trusted India-to-Southeast Asia routes underline increasing international collaboration on building secure, high-performance subsea networks that serve billions of users worldwide.This positions the UAE and the wider Gulf region at the forefront of next-generation connectivity infrastructure for global scale digital services. As digital economies expand and data traffic grows exponentially, projects like the Singapore-India-Gulf subsea cable system represent critical investments in the future of global connectivity.By partnering with Datawave and investing in the SING cable, du and the UAE are strengthening their role as a strategic gateway between continents, enhancing digital resilience, supporting AI-ready infrastructure and unlocking new opportunities for economic and technological growth.",Dubai-based telecom operator du has joined the Singapore-India-Gulf submarine cable system.

From imperial religion to global majority

From 2010 to 2020, Christianity grew by 6%, from 2.1 billion to 2.3 billion, remaining the world’s largest religion.

The geographic shift: Africa rises as Europe declines

Sub-Saharan Africa: 697 million Christians (up 31%)



697 million Christians (up 31%) Europe: 505 million (down 9%)



505 million (down 9%) North America: 238 million (down 11%)

Europe: 67% (down 8 points)



Latin America–Caribbean: 85% (down 5 points)

The mechanism: switching out of religion





A changing religious landscape





Christians: 28.8% (2.3 billion)



28.8% (2.3 billion) Muslims: 25.6%



25.6% Religiously unaffiliated: 24.2%



24.2% Hindus: 14.9%



14.9% Buddhists: 4.1%



The unaffiliated now make up 24.2% of the global population, driven largely by Christian disaffiliation.

For nearly two millennia, Christianity expanded outward from a small Jewish sect in the eastern Roman Empire to become the world’s largest religion. Imperial endorsement in the 4th century, medieval missionary networks across Europe and later colonial-era evangelisation in the Americas, Africa and parts of Asia steadily widened its reach. By 2020, it still accounted for the biggest share of humanity, 28.8% of the global population, or about 2.3 billion people.Yet the newest demographic analysis from the Pew-Templeton Global Religious Futures project shows a quieter transformation beneath that headline dominance. Christianity is still growing in raw numbers, but shrinking proportionally, losing followers in dozens of countries while expanding rapidly in others, and shifting geographically away from its historic European base toward sub-Saharan Africa.The findings draw on more than 2,700 censuses and surveys across 201 countries and territories, tracking religious change between 2010 and 2020 and examining the forces driving it, especially fertility patterns and religious “switching,” people leaving the faith in adulthood.Christianity’s early spread relied on itinerant preachers and tightly knit communities offering social support and the promise of universal salvation.Its trajectory changed dramatically after Emperor Constantine legalised the faith in 313 AD, and later when it became the Roman state religion. Medieval missions carried it across Europe, and from the 15th century onward European expansion exported it worldwide.Colonial powers, Spain, Portugal, Britain, France and Belgium, often paired territorial expansion with conversion. Missionaries established schools and medical services, translated scripture and, in some regions, used coercive systems of taxation and law to suppress indigenous religions. By the modern era, Christianity had become a global majority faith across multiple continents.That long expansion explains its contemporary scale. Between 2010 and 2020 the number of Christians still rose by 122 million, from 2.1 billion to 2.3 billion, a 6% increase. But the global population grew faster, and non-Christians grew by 15%, causing Christianity’s share to fall from 31% to 28.8%, with all Christians counted under a single category, including Catholics, Orthodox Christians, and Protestant denominations such as Baptists, Lutherans, Anglicans, Methodists, and Pentecostals.The decade’s most striking change is geographic rather than numerical. Christianity’s historic centre of gravity, Europe, no longer holds the largest Christian population. The number (or count) of Christians fell in two regions. In Europe, Christians declined to 505 million (down 9%). In North America, they shrank to 238 million (down 11%). In every other region, the number of Christians grew. The count increased most in sub-Saharan Africa, to 697 million (up 31%).By 2020, 31% of all Christians lived in sub-Saharan Africa, compared with 22% in Europe. Latin America and the Caribbean accounted for 24% of global Christians, and North America 10%.The share of populations identifying as Christian also shifted:In Asia-Pacific and Middle East–North Africa regions, Christians remained under 10% of the population, declining by less than one point.However, when measured by individual countries rather than regions, the United States still has the largest Christian population in any single nation. About 64% of Americans identified as Christian in 2020, roughly one-tenth of all Christians worldwide.Substantial change (defined as at least a five-percentage-point shift) occurred in 41 countries, more than for any other religion. In all but one, Christianity declined.The largest drops:In several countries Christianity lost majority status:In each case, religiously unaffiliated people rose to 40% or more of the population.Mozambique was the only country with a substantial increase, rising 5 points to 61%, following the end of an anti-religious government campaign in the 1980s.Overall, Christians remained the majority in 120 countries and territories, down from 124 in 2010.The central driver of change was not birth rates alone but religious switching.Christians experienced the largest net losses:For every 1 person who joined Christianity, 3.1 left it.Most did not join another religion; they became religiously unaffiliated. This movement explains both Christianity’s declining share and the simultaneous growth of the “nones”.Globally, religious switching shows a clear direction: more people leave religion than adopt one. Among adults aged 18–54, 3.2 people leave religion for every one who joins.Fertility still matters, Christians have relatively high birth rates, but switching offsets it. By contrast, Muslim population growth is driven mainly by a young age structure and higher fertility, not conversion.By 2020:Globally, 75.8% of people identified with a religion, while 24.2% did not.The data shows Christianity remaining the world’s largest religion, but increasingly concentrated in the Global South and increasingly shaped by disaffiliation in the West. Over the past century it spread across continents; in the past decade, its centre quietly moved.","Between 2010 and 2020, Christianity in sub-Saharan Africa grew 31%, reaching 697 million adherents.

Epstein ranch twist: MAGA candidate Don Huffines named as mystery buyer of Jeffrey Epstein's New Mexico home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-ranch-twist-maga-candidate-don-huffines-named-as-mystery-buyer-of-jeffrey-epsteins-new-mexico-home/articleshow/128394820.cms,"Jeffrey Epstein Files Blow Apart Hidden Camera Denials And Trigger Global Alarm | WATCH

Who is Don Huffines?





The mystery owner of one of Jeffrey Epstein 's most famous abodes, a ranch in New Mexico, was revealed to be MAGA millionaire and Texas Comptroller candidate, Don Huffines. The real-estate mogul purchased the convicted child sex offender's ""Zorro Ranch"" in 2023, using a limited liability company he created just weeks before the purchase, reported Santa Fe New Mexican. His wife is listed as a trustee and his son as LLC manager, The Center Square reported.“Four years after Mr. Epstein’s death, the Huffines family purchased property in New Mexico listed at public auction whose proceeds benefited his victims. Prior to the auction listing, they had never visited the property,” Huffines’ campaign spokesperson Allen Blakemore said in a statement on Friday.Spanning across 7,600 acres in Southern Santa Fe County, the ranch was at the centre of Epstein's alleged plan to ""seed the human race with his DNA by impregnating women,"" reported the New York Times previously. Among the more than three million documents released with the Epstein Files, the ranch is mentioned 4,200 times.Renamed by the millionaire as ""Rancho de San Rafael,"" the ranch apparently has bodies of at least ""two foreign girls,"" buried at the property, both of whom died by strangulation, as per an email in the recent database of Epstein files, released by the Department of Justice. On Friday, a New Mexico official called for an investigation into the property due to the email.“If you are buying a piece of land, the first thing that should be done is total transparency. If the property is suspected of criminal activity, why not be transparent with state officials in New Mexico? Huffines wants to run the finances of Texas, yet he won’t be transparent with his own dealings with former Epstein assets,” said Wayne Hamilton, former executive director of the Republican Party of Texas, to The Center Square. ""What an odd piece of property to purchase,"" questioned journalist Molly Jong-Fast in an X post.Huffines is a proud Republican and Trump supporter according to his campaign website. A former GOP state senator from Dallas County's District 16, the 67-year-old is now running for comptroller, a statewide office in Texas overseeing the state's financial matters. Not just the politician, his son Russell Huffines was hired by the Trump administration in June 2025 as associate director of agency outreach and is being paid $83,500 annually for the position he still holds today, as per RealClear Investigations.In 2022, he unsuccessfully challenged Governor Greg Abbott and is currently facing competition from Acting Comptroller Kelly Hancock, a former state senator appointed to the job last summer by Abbott, Michael Berlanga and Railroad Commissioner Christi Craddick in the March 3 Republican primary.As per his campaign mentioned on LinkedIn, he plans to implement DOGE for Texas by ""cutting government waste and increasing efficiency."" He co-owns and runs Huffines Communities, a real estate land development company in North Texas and graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in Finance. He and his wife Mary Catherine have four sons and one daughter and he is also a grandfather as per his social media profile.The revelation of his ownership of one of the disgraced financier's personal properties, which also forms a major centre of his scandalous criminal affairs raises numerous questions. The late criminal was found dead in his New York jail cell in 2019, but the release of the files by the DOJ has revealed his enormous network, encompassing elected leaders, tech billionaires and even Hollywood celebrities.","Don Huffines is a MAGA millionaire and Texas Comptroller candidate.

UAE Property Market 2026: What's Driving the First-Time Buyer Surge and How is it Changing Ownership?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





In 2026, the UAE’s property market is entering a new chapter of demand, innovation and opportunity and first-time home buyers are playing a big part in reshaping how residents approach property ownership. Once inclined to rent or invest secondarily, many long-term residents are now turning their focus to buying their first homes. This shift reflects a maturing market with evolving priorities, government support programmes and changing buyer psychology.One of the biggest structural shifts encouraging first-time buyers is the Dubai First-Time Home Buyer (FTHB) Programme, launched in July 2025. This initiative, a collaboration between the Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism (DET) and the Dubai Land Department (DLD), has already helped over 2,000 residents purchase their first homes within six months, generating more than AED 3.25 billion in residential transactions.The programme’s tools, priority access to new developments, tailored mortgage plans, and preferential pricing, are designed to simplify and democratise access to property ownership, especially for mid-income residents and long-term renters finally taking the leap. Over 41,000 residents have registered so far, nearly half of whom were previously long-term renters.While incentives and support programmes matter, buyers themselves are becoming much more discerning and long-term oriented in how they choose properties.Real estate professionals say the biggest difference in 2026 is that first-time buyers are no longer chasing deals or speculation, they are focused on liveability, long-term comfort and value preservation.Spending priorities have shifted from purely financial calculations to a blend of comfort, sustainability and future growth potential, marking a maturing outlook among UAE buyers.Affordability remains a central theme. Many first-time buyers are balancing budget caps and financing options, shaping bespoke payment plans and mortgage structures to fit their circumstances. With lenders offering up to 80% loan-to-value (LTV) for expats on certain properties and 85% for UAE nationals, entry thresholds are becoming more accessible.On the tech front, mortgage applications and advisory services have seen rapid innovation. Mortgage solutions are shifting from “fast” processing to smarter financing decisions using AI tools, helping first-time buyers better compare plans, forecast long-term costs and select tailored payment terms. This trend, part of broader fintech integration, is helping reduce barriers to homeownership and improve financial confidence among buyers.Overall demand in the UAE property market continues to be strong and even draws end-user buyers, many of them first-timers, into transactions traditionally dominated by investors. That is reflected in stable market growth, strong residential sales and a broader trend where buyers seek stability and predictability in long-term housing choices, rather than short-term speculation.This shift aligns with wider property market attitudes across the Gulf, where buyers now focus on delivery timelines, developer credibility, operating costs and quality of life factors rather than rushing into purchases for potential price spikes.Additionally, remote working and lifestyle changes are reshaping preferences like many buyers across the UAE now consider villa and townhouse communities, areas that offer space, privacy and proximity to nature, over smaller apartments in crowded districts. Transportation infrastructure and community planning, including schools and green spaces, are influencing where first-time buyers choose to plant roots.Despite strong interest, some potential first-time buyers are being priced out of central and premium locations due to high values. As residential prices increase in sought-after areas like Downtown Dubai, Palm Jumeirah and Emirates Hills, buyers are having to prioritise affordability and practicality over prestige.This dynamic is leading many to consider emerging or secondary locations where homes offer better price per square foot and more space, while still providing attractive community fundamentals. The increasing focus of first-time home buyers in the UAE on livability, quality, location, sustainability and long-term value is reshaping the real estate landscape in 2026.Government-driven programmes, tech-enhanced mortgage solutions and informed buyer behaviour are converging to make homeownership more accessible, meaningful and strategic.

'We were not consulted': Imran Khan’s sister

Pakistan’s information minister Ataullah Tarar on Saturday announced that imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan will undergo treatment for an eye condition at a specialised medical facility, days after the Supreme Court ordered a medical evaluation amid growing concerns about the cricketer-turned-politician’s eyesight.Tarar wrote on X that an examination would be conducted by leading eye specialists as part of Khan’s ongoing treatment, which began in late January after the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder-chairman claimed ""partial loss of vision"" in his right eye.The minister, however, did not specify the medical facility or the date of treatment and urged the public to avoid speculation.“A detailed report will also be submitted to the Supreme Court. Conjecture, speculations, and efforts to turn this into political rhetoric and mileage for vested interests may please be avoided,” Tarar posted.Earlier this week, Khan’s lawyer and PTI member Salman Safdar told the Supreme Court that the ex-premier had lost roughly 85% of vision in his right eye. The court subsequently directed authorities to arrange a medical assessment by a panel of doctors and facilitate a telephone call between Khan and his two UK-based sons before February 16.PTI supporters have staged protests in the capital, Islamabad, and other cities, demanding that their party chief be shifted from prison to a hospital for specialised treatment. Some lawmakers from PTI and its allies are also staging a sit-in outside Parliament.Meanwhile, Khan’s sister Aleema Khan reacted angrily to Tarar's announcement, saying the family had not been consulted and demanding that family members and his personal physician be present during any future procedures.She confirmed that, following the Supreme Court’s directive, authorities had arranged a call between her brother and his two sons, who live with their mother and his former wife, British screenwriter and producer Jemima Goldsmith.Khan was removed from office in a parliamentary no-confidence vote in April 2022. He has alleged that his ouster was the result of a US-backed “conspiracy” involving political rivals and Pakistan’s then army chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa — allegations denied by Washington, Pakistan’s military, and Khan’s political opponents.The issue of Khan’s partial vision surfaced in late January when the federal government said the former prime minister had undergone a medical procedure for an eye condition and was in ""good health.""The PTI made a strong showing in the February 2024 parliamentary elections but did not secure a majority in the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament. The party alleged the vote was “rigged,” a claim the government has denied.","Pakistan’s information minister Ataullah Tarar on Saturday announced that imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan will undergo treatment for an eye condition.

The transfer follows:

A nearly week-long hunger strike protesting prison conditions

Hospitalisation due to health complications

Reports of physical abuse during arrest and interrogation

New prison sentence and internal exile

Six years for “gathering and collusion to commit crimes”

One-and-a-half years for propaganda activities

Two years of internal exile to Khosf in South Khorasan province

A two-year ban on leaving the country

Growing health concerns

Who is Narges Mohammadi?

Iran’s use of the death penalty

Solitary confinement in prisons

Mandatory hijab laws for women

Restrictions on political freedoms

Nobel Peace Prize recognition

A life marked by repeated imprisonment





Iranian authorities have transferred Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi without prior notice to a prison in northern Iran, raising fresh concerns over her health and treatment in detention.Her family says the move, from a detention facility in Mashhad to Zanjan prison, was carried out without informing her lawyer or relatives, news agency AFP reported. The sudden relocation comes amid rising international alarm about reports of physical abuse, deteriorating medical conditions, and prolonged isolation.Mohammadi was arrested on December 12 in Mashhad after publicly criticising Iran’s clerical authorities during a funeral ceremony. She was initially held at a detention facility run by the intelligence ministry.According to her husband, Taghi Rahmani, who lives in Paris, the transfer to Zanjan prison was intended to “exile and displace” her. Her lawyer, Mostafa Nili, said she was only able to reveal details of the move days later during a brief phone call.Her lawyer has alleged she suffered severe blows to the head, resulting in dizziness, double vision, and blurred eyesight.Bruises and marks of assault were reportedly still visible.In February 2026, Mohammadi was sentenced to more than seven years in prison:Her legal team says the verdict is not final and may be appealed. They have expressed hope she could be temporarily released on bail for medical treatment.Health worries have followed Mohammadi for years. In November 2024, she underwent complex surgery in Iran in which part of a bone in her right leg was removed over cancer fears. Despite the seriousness of the procedure, she was reportedly returned to prison immediately afterward.Earlier this year, she launched another hunger strike to protest restrictions on contacting her family and lawyers. Her foundation described her physical condition as “deeply alarming.”Born April 21, 1972, in Zanjan, Mohammadi is one of Iran’s most prominent human rights activists. She serves as deputy director of the Defenders of Human Rights Center, an organization co-founded by Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi.Over more than two decades, she has campaigned against:She became a leading voice during unrest following the 2022 death of Jina Mahsa Amini, which triggered nationwide protests.In October 2023, while imprisoned, Mohammadi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize “for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all.”The Norwegian Nobel Committee later said it was “deeply appalled” by reports of mistreatment during her detention. Iran’s foreign ministry condemned the award.Mohammadi has been repeatedly arrested and jailed over the past 25 years. In 2016, she was sentenced to 16 years in prison on charges related to her activism. Though released in 2020, she was re-arrested in 2021 and has since continued reporting alleged abuse of detained women from inside prison.At 53, she has become both a symbol of resistance inside Iran and a globally recognised advocate for women’s rights and human dignity, even as she remains behind bars.Her latest transfer to Zanjan prison, the city where she was born, highlights the ongoing tensions between Iranian authorities and one of the country’s most internationally visible critics.","Narges Mohammadi was transferred without prior notice to a prison in northern Iran.

University statement and clarification





A Sikh student was assaulted on the campus of San Jose State University after being mistaken for Hindu, prompting condemnation from Hindu advocacy groups and renewed calls for stronger campus security. The incident, which occurred on 7 February, is being investigated by campus and local authorities as a possible hate crime.According to university officials, the student was attacked by a group of individuals who allegedly forced him to the ground and tore off his turban. During the assault, the attackers reportedly used the word “Hindu” as a slur, indicating a case of misidentification paired with bias-driven language. The suspects are believed to be non-students, and no arrests have been announced so far. Authorities say surveillance footage is being reviewed and witnesses interviewed.The CoHNA Youth Action Network (CYAN), the youth wing of the Coalition of Hindus of North America, condemned the attack in a statement issued on 13 February. While acknowledging that the victim is Sikh, the group said the alleged use of “Hindu” as a slur alongside physical violence points to anti-Hindu bias.CYAN said it stands in solidarity with the Sikh student and the Sikh community on campus, while also urging authorities to accurately identify the bias involved. The group argued that naming the prejudice correctly is essential for accountability, prevention, and student safety.San Jose State University president Cynthia Teniente-Matson condemned the assault, calling hate crimes “evil acts that harm entire communities.” She said the university does not tolerate hate, discrimination, or violence and is committed to supporting affected students, faculty, and staff.The university also acknowledged errors in its initial campus communication, which misidentified the victim’s religious identity, and later issued a clarification. Officials said the correction was made once more accurate information became available.CYAN and other advocates said the incident should not be viewed in isolation. The group cited data from the California Civil Rights Department, noting that a significant share of religion-based hate incidents reported in California in 2024 targeted Hindus. While the victim in this case was Sikh, CYAN said the alleged slur reflects overlapping vulnerabilities faced by Sikh and Hindu students.The organisation also raised concerns about campus security, pointing to the reported involvement of non-students as a sign of potential gaps. It urged university leadership to strengthen protections, engage directly with Hindu and Sikh student organisations, provide trauma-informed support services, and implement awareness programmes addressing religious bias.San Jose State University has said it continues to cooperate with law enforcement and treats hate crimes with seriousness. As the investigation remains ongoing, student groups and community organisations are calling for transparency, accountability, and steps to ensure the safety of religious minorities on campus.","A Sikh student was assaulted on the campus of San Jose State University after being mistaken for Hindu.

UAE's new AI school policy

Using AI during formal examinations or official assessments is completely banned.

Students cannot submit AI-generated assignments, essays, or projects as their own work. Any use of AI must be explicitly disclosed and approved by a teacher beforehand.

Simply rephrasing what a bot says isn't enough. Students must demonstrate a genuine personal understanding of the content. If a student cannot explain the ""why"" behind an AI-assisted answer, it’s a violation.

UAE's strict content controls

Violent or psychologically disturbing imagery.

Hate speech, discrimination, or misinformation.

Promotions of unsafe or illegal behavior, such as cyberbullying or substance abuse.

""Deepfakes"" or any content intended to impersonate others or spread false rumors.

Data privacy in UAE schools

The future





The UAE has officially drawn a line in the digital sand. As artificial intelligence becomes as common as a calculator, the Ministry of Education has released the ""Safe and Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence in Classrooms 2026"" guide.This comprehensive framework introduces 25 specific prohibitions designed to ensure that while students learn about the future, they don’t lose their ability to think for themselves today.The most significant change is a firm age limit. Students under the age of 13, or those enrolled in any grade below Year 7 (Grade 6), are now strictly prohibited from using generative AI tools like ChatGPT.The Ministry’s reasoning is clear: early education must be built on human interaction, tactile creativity, and independent problem-solving. By keeping AI out of primary classrooms, the government aims to prevent younger learners from developing a ""digital crutch"" before they have mastered the fundamentals of critical thinking and social-emotional skills.For older students who are permitted to use AI, the rules are rigorous. The Ministry has made it clear that AI is a ""tutor,"" not a ""ghostwriter.""The UAE is ensuring that AI tools reflect the country’s unique cultural fabric.The guidelines prohibit creating or sharing any AI content that contradicts Islamic values, national identity, or cultural ethics.Beyond cultural safeguards, the rules ban AI-generated material that includes:In an era of data harvesting, the Ministry has turned schools into a ""data fortress."" There is a total ban on uploading personal information, including names, photos, audio recordings, or ID details, of students, teachers, or parents into any AI platform.Furthermore, schools are prohibited from using unapproved AI services. This means no bypassing school firewalls with VPNs and no creating student accounts on external platforms that require personal data without official Ministry clearance. Even recording or transcribing a classroom discussion using AI now requires the explicit consent of everyone in the room.The ministry’s manual reinforces that AI should function as a support tool, not a shortcut. Students must critically review and verify AI-generated content before using it in their work, ensuring accuracy and relevance. Teachers are expected to guide students on ethical AI practices and help them understand both the capabilities and limitations of generative tools.While these rules seem strict, they aren't about fearing technology, they’re about mastering it. Starting in the 2025-2026 academic year, the UAE is making AI a mandatory subject from Kindergarten to Grade 12.Taught by over 1,000 specially trained educators, this curriculum focuses on the ethics and mechanics of AI. The goal is to graduate a generation that doesn't just know how to prompt a bot, but understands the algorithms, data privacy, and ethical responsibilities that power the modern world.In the UAE, the message is loud and clear: technology will support the teacher, but it will never replace the human mind.","UAE bans under 13s from using generative AI tools like ChatGPT in schools.

Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton exchanged sharp remarks with the Czech Republic’s deputy prime minister Petr Macinka during a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Saturday.Macinka criticised what he called “woke” politics, including gender identity debates and climate activism, while Clinton challenged his comments, prompting a pointed exchange.Macinka said, “we saw the woke revolution. I don’t agree with the gender revolution, the climate alarmism,” to which Clinton responded, “Which gender? Women having their rights?”In response to Macinka’s statement that there were two genders and that other identities were a “social construct that had gone too far,” Clinton asked, “How about half of us? Can we have our rights?”Clinton argued that debates over gender did not justify withdrawing support for Ukraine, where people were fighting on the front lines.""But does that justify selling out the people of Ukraine, who are on the front lines, dying to save their freedom — and their two genders if that's what you're worried about,"" she said.The deputy prime minister told Clinton she seemed nervous about his comments and said, “can I finish my point? I’m sorry it makes you nervous.”Speaking about US President Donald Trump , Macinka said Clinton did not appear to like him.""I think you really don't like him,"" Macinka said.""You know, that is absolutely true,"" Clinton responded. ""But not only do I not like him, but I don't like what he's actually doing to the United States and the world, and I think you should take a hard look at it if you think there is something good that will come of it.""Macinka described Trump’s actions in the US as a reaction to policies he said had strayed too far from ordinary people, prompting Clinton to ask for examples.The exchange took place during the panel where Clinton addressed US immigration, saying the system had “gone too far.” She added that it had been ""disruptive and destabilizing"", and called for reforms that are humane, with secure borders, protection of human life, and support for strong family structures.Clinton acknowledged the use of barriers in certain locations but opposed expanding the border wall on a large scale during her 2016 campaign.At the time, Clinton supported then-President Barack Obama’s executive actions that deferred immigration enforcement for millions of undocumented children and parents and sought to end family detention.She also intended to continue the policy of deporting ""violent criminals"" while scaling back immigration raids, which she said caused “unnecessary fear and disruption in communities,"" as reported by Fox News previously.","Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton exchanged sharp remarks with the Czech Republic’s deputy prime minister Petr Macinka during a panel discussion.

The architect of a new education order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-architect-of-a-new-education-order/articleshow/128403415.cms,"Stephen Turban & Dhruva Bhat, builders of Lumiere

How

Stephen Turban

is building a global classroom, and why his latest acquisition signals a deeper shift in how the world learns





When Stephen Turban speaks about education, he sounds like a thoughtful cartographer trying to redraw the map of how young people grow up.On a recent afternoon from Vietnam, where he has been spending time building, thinking, and operating, Turban reflected on his latest move: the acquisition of UK-based Immerse Education by Lumiere Education Group, the company he co-founded with Dhruva Bhat.For decades, the dominant model of success was to attend a good school, score well on standardized tests, enter a prestigious university, and step onto a predictable ladder of achievement. Turban’s work suggests that this ladder is no longer enough and that a different kind of scaffolding is emerging around it.Lumiere began as an experiment in intellectual apprenticeship. Rather than focusing on test preparation, it paired high school students with researchers (faculty and scholars embedded in leading institutions) who guided them through short, intensive research projects.The idea was exposure: giving teenagers a taste of what serious thinking actually feels like.“The goal isn’t to turn every student into a mini-academic,” he explained. “It’s to help them understand how knowledge is created, not just consumed.”Over time, Lumiere has grown into a truly global platform. Today, no single city accounts for more than 10% of its students. Its largest markets are America, India, and China, with significant participation from the UAE, Singapore, South Korea, Brazil, Turkey, and the UK.The acquisition of Immerse Education is about complementarity. If Lumiere represents the cerebral side of learning through rigorous research, mentorship, and intellectual depth, Immerse represents its social and experiential dimension. Immerse runs short residential programs on university campuses in New York, Boston, Berkeley, Toronto, Singapore, and Tokyo, as well as in the UK.Students live together, collaborate, debate, and inhabit academic environments. Learning becomes immersive, quite literally and metaphorically.Turban sees this as essential.“One of the limitations of online learning is that it can isolate students,” he said. “But real intellectual growth also happens in conversations, shared struggles, and the experience of being part of a community.”By bringing Immerse under the Lumiere umbrella, Turban is effectively stitching together two halves of the same vision: deep thinking and shared experience.Together, they form what he calls a more “rounded” model of education, one that mirrors how adults actually learn in professional and intellectual life.A key concept Turban invoked is a Chinese term: “Juan”(卷), roughly translated as “rolling competition.” It describes a cultural dynamic in which everyone feels compelled to work harder because everyone else is working harder. In education, this manifests as an escalating arms race of extracurriculars, internships, certifications, and achievements.Families today are far more intentional about how students spend their time outside school. Summers are planned like investment portfolios; extracurriculars are evaluated for their signaling value.“Competition isn’t going away,” he noted. “The question is: Can we channel it toward something genuinely meaningful rather than purely performative?”This is where Lumiere and Immerse converge. Instead of encouraging students to accumulate shallow credentials, they invite them to engage deeply with real ideas, real problems, and real mentors.In doing so, Turban is attempting to reframe what “competitive advantage” looks like in education, away from box-ticking and toward intellectual substance.Turban’s perspective is deeply shaped by his own background. He often speaks about his father, a middle school professor with an almost childlike curiosity about the world. Learning, in his household, was not a means to an end; it was an end in itself.His co-founder, Dhruva, had a formative experience in high school debate in India, which changed his confidence, thinking style, and life trajectory. Both men were shaped by experiences at the margins of school: clubs, research, debates, and independent exploration.That ethos is now baked into Lumiere’s DNA.One of the most striking aspects of both Lumiere and Immerse is their international reach.While many elite educational programs are concentrated in a handful of Western cities, Turban’s ecosystem draws students from every continent. Immerse, for instance, serves students from Turkey, Brazil, China, India, the US, and across Europe, even as it retains a strong U.K. academic orientation.For Turban, this is a moral project.“We live in a world where young people will increasingly work across borders,” he said. “It makes sense that their education should prepare them for that reality.” In this sense, Lumiere is less a company than a prototype of a borderless intellectual community.Turban’s current base in Vietnam is itself symbolic. Rather than anchoring himself in Silicon Valley or London, he has chosen a location that reflects his global outlook. It is a reminder that the future of education, and innovation more broadly, will not belong to one country alone. From Southeast Asia, he is thinking about students in Mumbai, Seoul, Palo Alto, São Paulo, and beyond.At its core, Turban’s work forces a deeper reckoning with what education is for.Is it primarily about credentials? Economic mobility? Social status? Or is it about cultivating curiosity, resilience, and intellectual independence? His answer leans toward the latter, even if the former still matters. By combining Lumiere’s research-driven model with Immerse’s experiential approach, he is attempting to balance both.In a world awash in information yet starved for wisdom, Turban’s model suggests that the most valuable resource is community, mentorship, and meaning. The acquisition of Immerse Education is one more step in that direction.","Stephen Turban, co-founder of Lumiere Education Group, has acquired Immerse Education.

Pannun murder plot: Guilty plea may reduce Indian national Nikhil Gupta's jail term substantially,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pannun-murder-plot-guilty-plea-may-reduce-indian-national-nikhil-guptas-jail-term-substantially/articleshow/128396651.cms,"'DON'T MESS WITH AMERICA': Shock U.S. Warning After Indian Man Nikhil Pleads Guilty In Pannun Case





NEW DELHI: By admitting to murder-for-hire and money laundering charges, Indian national Nikhil Gupta may have secured a substantial reduction in the 40-year maximum sentence the charges entail through an ""acceptance of responsibility"" credit. The guilty plea not only reduces his jail-time but also helps him avoid a high-profile trial, besides limiting his trial testimony.Gupta, who has been at a Brooklyn detention centre since his 2024 extradition from Prague, has pleaded guilty before US magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn on three counts: murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and conspiracy to commit money laundering. He is scheduled to be sentenced by US district judge Victor Marrero on May 29, 2026, according to a statement by FBI and DEA.While the combined charges carry a maximum statutory punishment of 40 years in prison, a guilty plea typically triggers a reduction in the offence level under federal sentencing guidelines for ""acceptance of responsibility"". Legal experts pointed out this often results in a 20% to 30% reduction in the maximum exposure, though the final decision will rest solely with the sentencing judge.""Gupta is likely to receive a 2- to 3-level reduction, the standard reward for saving the court the time and expense of a trial,"" said a source.Going by the US prosecutors' recommendation, a 20-year sentence or less seems likely, sources said. There could be further reduction if the state files such a motion by May 29 when the sentencing will be announced.Gupta (54) may still have to serve around 80% of the awarded jail time with all mitigating parameters like good behaviour in place. Under US law, if he receives a sentence longer than 12 months, he would be eligible for up to a 15% reduction (roughly two months a year) for good behaviour while incarcerated.Legal experts also said that it was yet to be ascertained whether Gupta's plea deal included ""substantial assistance"", which means he will become a cooperating witness against other individuals. Pleading guilty in a US court does not necessarily require the person to provide information or testify against anyone.","Nikhil Gupta pleads guilty to murder-for-hire and money laundering charges.

White House border czar Tom Homan said a “small” security force will remain in Minnesota’s Twin Cities, including Minneapolis and St. Paul, even as more than 1,000 immigration agents withdraw from the region following a weeks-long enforcement surge.Speaking on CBS’ Face the Nation on Sunday, Homan said the reduced contingent would temporarily protect remaining personnel and respond “when our agents are out and they get surrounded by agitators and things got out of control.”He did not define what constituted “small,” but added that several hundred more officers would leave by Monday and Tuesday, returning operations to their “original footprint.”The drawdown marks the wind-down of “Operation Metro Surge,” which saw thousands of officers deployed to Minneapolis and St. Paul under the direction of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.The Department of Homeland Security described it as the largest immigration enforcement operation in its history. Homan said authorities had already removed “well over 1,000 people,” with several hundred more deportations expected before the surge formally concludes.Homan also dismissed a recent Wall Street Journal report suggesting friction between him, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and her adviser Corey Lewandowski over deportation strategy under President Donald Trump, calling internal policy differences routine professional debates.The operation drew growing criticism as tensions escalated following the fatal shootings of two US citizens, Renee Nicole Good and ICU nurse Alex Pretti, by federal immigration agents. The deaths sparked widespread protests across several US cities, with demonstrators demanding accountability and changes to enforcement practices.In Minneapolis and St. Paul, residents organised to warn immigrants of approaching agents and document ICE activity.Homan said investigations into the shootings and related fraud cases would continue. Unlike Noem, who publicly defended the officers, Homan refrained from commenting on their conduct, saying he would “let the investigations play out.”He reiterated that enforcement would continue nationwide and said future large-scale deployments would “depend on the situation,” even as Minnesota’s controversial surge winds down amid lingering public anger and scrutiny.","More than 1,000 immigration agents will leave Minnesota's Twin Cities by Monday and Tuesday.

Who was Ofelia Torres? Chicago teen who fought for father’s release from ICE detention dies of cancer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-was-ofelia-torres-chicago-teen-who-fought-for-fathers-release-from-ice-detention-dies-of-cancer/articleshow/128396056.cms,"Huge Crisis In US: Shutdown Hits DHS Amid Immigration Ops; Dems Block Funding Over ICE Actions





Ofelia Torres, the 16-year-old Chicago student who publicly appealed for her father’s release from immigration detention while battling a rare cancer, has died, reports NBC news.Ofelia passed away on Friday from Stage 4 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare and aggressive cancer that affects soft tissue. She had been diagnosed in December 2024 and had spent months in treatment.Her death comes months after she drew attention online when her father, Ruben Torres Maldonado, was arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on October 18, 2025. At the time, Ofelia was home from hospital receiving care and spending time with her family.Soon after his arrest, she posted a video on Instagram calling for his release and speaking about families facing similar situations. In the video, she described her father as a devoted parent.“My dad, like many others, is a hardworking person who wakes up early in the morning and goes to work without complaining, thinking about his family,” Ofelia says in the video.She adds, “I find it so unfair that hardworking immigrant families are being targeted just because they were not born here.”The video included photographs of her father with the family and images of Ofelia during hospital treatment.Torres Maldonado was released from ICE detention about two weeks later on a $2,000 bond. According to a family spokesperson, a judge considered his daughter’s medical condition during a hearing before granting release.In an earlier statement about his arrest, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said: “He’s been charged multiple times with driving without insurance, driving without a valid license, and speeding. During his arrest he did not comply with instructions from the officers and attempted to flee in his vehicle and backed into a government vehicle.”Shortly before Ofelia’s death, a Chicago judge ruled that her father qualified for cancellation of removal, finding that his deportation would negatively affect his US citizen children. A family representative said the decision could provide a pathway to permanent residence and eventually citizenship.Ofelia was a junior at Lake View High School in Chicago and attended the immigration hearing via Zoom three days before she died.Her father’s lawyer, Kalman Resnick, said: “Ofelia was heroic and brave in the face of ICE’s detention and threatened deportation of her father. We mourn Ofelia’s passing, and we hope that she will serve as a model for us all for how to be courageous and to fight for what’s right to our last breaths.”","Ofelia Torres, the 16-year-old Chicago student who publicly appealed for her father’s release from immigration detention while battling a rare cancer, has died.

‘This is bigger than me’





A veteran Chicago-area teacher has spoken out after resigning from his position over a Facebook post that read “GO ICE,” describing the fallout as “professionally and personally devastating and surreal. ”In his first public comments since stepping down from Gary Elementary School in West Chicago, Heidorn told Fox News Digital that the backlash over his two-word post has left him grappling with shock, grief and uncertainty about his future.“I’ve spent 14 years building my career, pouring my heart into teaching kids, building relationships and being a positive role model,” he told Fox News Digital. “To see it all upended over two simple words… felt like a severe blow to my career.”Heidorn said the emotional toll has been heavy, describing “sleepless nights” and a deep sense of loss after abruptly leaving the classroom.“Emotionally, it’s been a roller coaster, shock, sadness, anger and frustration at how quickly things escalated,” he said. “The hardest part has been losing daily contact with my students and not getting to say a proper goodbye.”He stated that his comment was a personal expression of support for law enforcement and was not directed at students or families.Beyond his personal setback, Heidorn framed the controversy as part of a broader debate about free speech.“Most importantly, this is bigger than me: it’s about whether personal opinions expressed outside of work can cost someone their livelihood without due process,” he told Fox News Digital.He said teaching has defined his life and that he had even pursued a master’s degree in educational leadership to grow in the profession. Now, he acknowledged, his future in education is uncertain.Despite the turmoil, Heidorn said he is trying to focus on his family and on support he has received from members of the community.Heidorn’s post came at a time when the nation was sharply divided over immigration enforcement, with widespread protests erupting across several US cities following the fatal shootings of Renee Nicole Good and ICU nurse Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis earlier this year.Those deaths sparked demonstrations calling for accountability and changes to how agencies like ICE operate.",Heidorn resigned from Gary Elementary School in West Chicago.

MacKenzie Scott donated $26 billion over the past seven years, including a record $7.2 billion in 2025, a pace of giving that makes her the third-largest philanthropist of all time by total lifetime donations, according to Forbes.Scott is a novelist and the former spouse of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. She has distributed the funds primarily through large, unrestricted grants to non-profit organisations across the United States and internationally. Her total giving since 2019 now stands at $26 billion, according to publicly disclosed figures compiled by philanthropy trackers and financial publications.The $7.2 billion she gave in 2025 marks the largest single-year amount of her philanthropic career. The record year accelerated her overall total and pushed her ahead of most living donors in cumulative lifetime contributions.With $26 billion in lifetime giving, Scott ranks as the third-biggest philanthropist of all time in absolute dollars donated. Only two individuals in modern history have given more in total lifetime contributions.Her 2025 giving alone exceeded the combined lifetime donations of several prominent billionaires, including Tesla and SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk, Google co-founder Larry Page, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, and her former husband Jeff Bezos.Scott’s philanthropic strategy has differed from many large-scale donors. Rather than establishing a traditional foundation with extensive application processes, she has relied on advisory teams to identify organisations and has provided grants with few restrictions on how the money must be used. Recipients have included charities focused on education, racial equity, public health, housing, food security and community development.Since announcing her intention in 2019 to give away the majority of her wealth, Scott has moved at an unusually rapid pace compared with other billionaires. The $26 billion total represents one of the fastest large-scale philanthropic distributions in modern history.Most of her wealth comes from her divorce settlement with Jeff Bezos in 2019, when she received a stake in Amazon. She has since sold portions of those shares to fund her charitable donations.The comparison is based on the total amounts Musk, Page, Ellison and Bezos have publicly donated over their lifetimes. Although they have promised large sums and set up charity foundations, the money they have actually given so far is still less than what Scott donated in 2025 alone.Scott has not publicly indicated a fixed end date for her giving. However, her pace over the past seven years suggests she intends to continue distributing large portions of her wealth.","Scott is a novelist and the former spouse of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

A labour of Love, built between shifts

TikTok fame to museum walls

And he’s not finished yet





It started as a simple idea to build a small model of Rockefeller Center, but over 21 years it grew into a massive handmade replica of New York City, now on display at the Museum of the City of New York.Joe Macken, 63, a Queens-born truck driver now living in Clifton Park, never imagined his basement hobby would end up filling a museum gallery.Yet his 50-by-27-foot wooden metropolis, crafted painstakingly from balsa wood, cardboard, glue and acrylic paint, is now the centrepiece of the exhibition “He Built This City: Joe Macken’s Model.”“It's almost like coming in on an airplane when you're looking out the window at 4,000 feet,” Macken told news agency AFP.The journey began in 2004 after Macken, inspired by childhood memories of seeing the Panorama model at the Queens Museum, decided to carve 30 Rock. One structure led to another. Midtown followed. Then Manhattan. Eventually, the five boroughs, and even parts of neighbouring suburbs, took shape under his steady hand.Today, the model boasts an estimated 700,000 to nearly one million individual structures, from skyscrapers and row houses to bridges and boats, all scaled meticulously using a millimetre-to-10-feet formula he devised with a home ruler.“I was just going to look at it myself,” Macken has said in interviews. “I never imagined it being in a museum.”Balancing two jobs, truck driving and limousine services, along with family life, Macken carved out time late at night and early in the morning. He worked in one-foot square sections, stacking finished grids in a storage unit.Though largely accurate, the city bears Macken’s personal imprint. Handwritten notes line the waterfront edges.The skyline includes the Twin Towers alongside One World Trade Center, reflecting the view he once saw from his childhood bedroom in Middle Village, Queens. There are even charming quirks, such as a misspelled “Verazanno” Bridge, left intentionally untouched.Curators say the imperfections are part of its power. “You can see the hand of the artist,” said Elisabeth Sherman, chief curator at the museum. “It’s not machine-made precision, it’s personal.”The project gained fresh momentum when Macken’s daughter began posting videos of the miniature city on TikTok, where they garnered millions of views.The viral attention eventually led museum officials to track him down, reportedly even reaching out to an upstate bar where he was showcasing the model.Now occupying the Dinan Miller Gallery, the installation runs through August 31, 2026. Visitors are encouraged to bring binoculars, spotting a specific street among nearly a million structures can be a challenge.If the current model seems monumental, Macken insists it’s only a chapter. He is already expanding outward, building Long Island, New Jersey and Connecticut, with ambitions of a 90-foot tri-state replica that could take another decade.“I’ll just keep going,” he has said. “It relaxes me.”For a man who never attended art school, Macken’s painstaking tribute to the Big Apple stands as a testament to perseverance, and to how one building can quietly become an entire city.","Joe Macken, 63, a Queens-born truck driver now living in Clifton Park, never imagined his basement hobby would end up filling a museum gallery.

Why it is celebrated?







Some Americans had an extra day off to look forward to this weekend as Presidents Day, a federal holiday in the United States, fell on the third Monday of February.Presidents Day in 2026 was on Monday, February 16. The holiday, originally created to celebrate George Washington's birthday, was now seen as a day to honour every person who held the United States’ high office, giving govt and some non-govt workers a day off in winter, US Today reported.Presidents Day, the third Monday of February, was a federal holiday and it was a federal holiday since 1879. Presidents Day still technically had the formal title of ""Washington's Birthday.""Government offices will be closed on Monday, February 16, as were US Postal Service post offices, and mail was not delivered that day. The stock market and banks, including branches of Capital One, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, PNC, Chase, Truist and Citibank, among others, were also closed.Retailers, grocery stores and pharmacies could be closed or have modified hours for the holiday. People were advised to check their nearest location for holiday hour information before stepping out to shop on February 16.Presidents Day was created by Congress in 1879 to celebrate the birthday of George Washington, the first president of the United States, according to the Library of Congress. In 1968, the Uniform Holidays Act changed the date of celebration from Washington's actual birthday, February 22, to the third Monday of February.With Abraham Lincoln's birthday falling on February 12, the holiday soon evolved to be known colloquially as Presidents Day in honour of all U.S. presidents. However, no law or act was ever passed to change the holiday's official name, which was still formally designated as Washington's Birthday by the OPM.President Lyndon B. Johnson mandated that the holiday, along with Memorial Day and Veterans Day, occur on Mondays to avoid mid-week shutdowns. Through the signing of the Uniform Holidays Act, Johnson created longer weekends to enable Americans ""to travel farther and see more of this beautiful land of ours,"" according to The American Presidency Project.","Presidents Day was created by Congress in 1879 to celebrate the birthday of George Washington, the first president of the United States.

Power struggle over deportation strategy





Amid reports of tensions within the Department of Homeland Security, Border Czar Tom Homan has acknowledged disagreements with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem , but insisted the administration remains united in its immigration crackdown.In back-to-back television interviews, Homan declined to either criticise or explicitly defend Noem, even as questions mounted over internal tensions within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).Speaking on State of the Union with Jake Tapper, Homan brushed aside a claim by a Minnesota official that Noem and former Border Patrol commander-at-large Greg Bovino were “insane” and more focused on optics than coordination with local authorities.Rather than addressing the remark directly, Homan pivoted to his own approach. “You can’t fix problems talking in an echo chamber. You got to talk to the people that you may disagree with,” he said, adding that Minnesota and Minneapolis were “safer” due to improved coordination with local jails.He also admitted he does not agree with Noem on everything. “Do me and Secretary Noem agree on everything? No,” Homan said, while rejecting suggestions that DHS faces a credibility problem.“It’s one team, one fight.”In a separate interview with Ed O'Keefe on CBS News, Homan was pressed on a recent Wall Street Journal report detailing alleged leadership concerns involving Noem and her chief adviser Corey Lewandowski.The report claimed Homan rarely speaks with Noem or Lewandowski and has complained about them to the White House.Homan declined to validate those claims. “Look, it’s one team, one fight. I’m not playing in that media. They’re trying to divide this administration,” he said.He acknowledged policy differences but characterised them as routine professional debates rather than deep divisions. “I want to do it this way. Someone wants to do it this way. Then we talk about what works best in this situation. We all come to agreement in the end,” he said.Homan emphasised what he described as record enforcement outcomes, claiming the US has “the most secure border in history” and record numbers of criminal undocumented immigrants arrested and deported.Behind the scenes, however, officials say Homan and Noem have differed over how aggressively to execute President Donald Trump’s deportation agenda.Homan has reportedly pushed to prioritise individuals with criminal records, while Noem has advocated broader enforcement sweeps targeting all illegal immigrants.The tensions surfaced during “Operation Metro Surge” in Minnesota, where thousands of federal personnel were deployed following a major fraud scandal and subsequent shootings involving federal officers. Homan recently announced the end of the operation.Notably, he has refrained from publicly defending Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol officers involved in the shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, saying he would “let the investigations play out.” Noem, by contrast, has publicly defended the officers.Homan also distanced himself from Noem’s recent comments suggesting DHS would ensure “we have the right people voting, electing the right leaders.” Asked about the remark, he responded, “That’d be a question for the secretary.”‘Results speak for themselves’Despite the apparent differences in tone and approach, Homan repeatedly returned to the theme of unity and outcomes.“We have different opinions. Well, those different opinions are worked out, and we move forward,” he said. “The results speak for themselves.”Whether the public message of unity masks deeper strategic divides remains unclear. But for now, Homan’s line is firm: disagreements may exist — but the administration, he insists, is moving in one direction.",Border Czar Tom Homan has acknowledged disagreements with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Trump's Board Of Peace Hits NATO Wall; Poland Issues Chilling Statement; ‘NOT YOUR PET...’





US President Donald Trump on Sunday hailed his newly formed initiative, the “Board of Peace”, describing it as his self-designed effort to advance global peace negotiations. Boasting of his role as chairman, Trump said the body has “unlimited potential” and asserted that his vision for ending the conflict in Gaza was “unanimously adopted by the United Nations Security Council.” He also announced that member states have pledged more than $5 billion for humanitarian aid and reconstruction in Gaza.In a lengthy post on his platform Truth Social, Trump said the board had facilitated humanitarian aid “at record speed” and secured the release of all hostages, both living and deceased. He added that last month, “two dozen distinguished founding members joined me in Davos, Switzerland, to celebrate its official formation, and present a bold vision for the civilians in Gaza, and then, ultimately, far beyond Gaza — world peace!”Trump also announced that he will be joined by board members at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C., on February 19 where he expects to declare that member states have pledged “more than $5 billion towards the Gaza humanitarian and reconstruction efforts.”He said thousands of personnel have committed to the International Stabilization Force and local police “to maintain security and peace for Gazans.”Emphasizing that “Hamas must uphold its commitment to full and immediate demilitarisation,” the US President described the Board of Peace as “the most consequential international body in history” and said “it is my honour to serve as its chairman.”According to Trump’s 20‑point plan, first announced in September and paving the way for the current ceasefire, the Board of Peace “will set the framework and handle the funding for the redevelopment of Gaza.”The plan, which was later endorsed by the UN Security Council under Resolution 2803 in November 2025, envisions a multinational International Stabilization Force being deployed once Hamas lays down its weapons and a transitional Palestinian governance committee overseen by the board takes over day‑to‑day administration of the enclave.More than 20 countries have reportedly joined the Board of Peace, and Donald Trump will serve as its chairman., the New York Times reported.According to AFP, while the US president has repeatedly characterised the initiative as a major milestone in his foreign policy agenda to restore long sought peace in the region, its creation and structure have drawn broad international scrutiny. Some Western allies had declined to join or expressed caution about its governance model.Critics note that Hamas has historically resisted disarmament, calling it a red line in negotiations even while signalling possible conditional cooperation with a future Palestinian authority.","US President Donald Trump hails his newly formed initiative, the “Board of Peace” He described it as his self-designed effort to advance global peace negotiations.

Pakistan Army Chief Asim Munir was briefly stopped and asked to produce his identity card by security staff at the Munich Security Conference in Germany.A video that went viral on social media showed a security officer asking the Pakistani army chief to keep his identity card visible. Just steps away from the conference entry, a security official is heard saying, “Stop… where is your ID? Please flip your ID card. ”The Munich Security Conference, widely regarded as a key platform for dialogue and conflict resolution, annually brings together world leaders, diplomats, and security experts to address international peace and security challenges.Meanwhile, Munir’s visit was also objected to by Germany-based Sindhi political organisation Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), which called the invitation “deeply regrettable.” Members of the JSMM protested outside the venue, highlighting alleged human rights violations in Pakistan.In a formal statement addressed to the United Nations, the European Union, the German government, and international human rights bodies, JSMM Chairman Shafi Burfat expressed what he described as “deep shock and regret” over Munir’s presence at the high-level global forum.JSMM alleged that Pakistan’s military establishment has a historical record of human rights violations and political interference.The group referred to the 1971 events in former East Pakistan that led to the creation of Bangladesh, describing them as genocide.

The process reportedly began after a two-and-a-half-hour wait and a report is expected to be compiled soon.Shortly after the examination ended around 5.30 pm, PTI issued a statement on X rejecting the procedure and objecting to the absence of Imran’s family and personal physicians.“Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf categorically rejects the recent conduct of the government and jail administration regarding the medical examination of former prime minister Imran Khan's eye in Adiala Jail. The government's claim that a message was sent to the party leadership to arrive at the jail at the time of the examination is, in fact, a crude attempt to divert attention from the core issue,” the party said.Explaining its objection, the statement added, “This matter was never about the presence or absence of the party leadership.In such sensitive and delicate medical matters, the constitutional, moral, and legal right to make decisions belongs to Imran Khan's family. The family cannot make an informed decision until Imran Khan's personal doctors are present for the examination. Therefore, inviting the party leadership symbolically has neither any moral rationale nor any legal justification. ”Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum also said that no medical board would be accepted without the approval of his personal doctors.Referring to reports that he might be shifted to Al-Shifa Eye Hospital in Rawalpindi, she reiterated, “Our demand has been clear from the beginning. Imran Khan shall not be given any treatment without the presence and approval of his personal doctors and family members.”She further said, “We do not accept any medical board they set up and control! We do not accept any reports or results they manufacture.”Questioning the exclusion of family members and doctors recommended by Imran’s team, she asked, “Why are they rejecting the supervision by Imran Khan's personal doctors? Why are they rejecting the presence of Imran Khan's family members? Why such fierce resistance? Are they hiding something?”The examination was carried out after the Supreme Court directed the formation of a medical board to assess Imran’s condition. The order followed his claim on February 12 that his right eye retained only 15 per cent vision. The court also allowed him to speak with his children before February 16.Although government officials had indicated on Saturday that Imran might be transferred to a hospital, no shift had taken place by Sunday afternoon. At 3.45 pm, his sister Noreen Khanum said that an ambulance had arrived at the jail to move him.“But, this is unacceptable to us without us and Khan sahib's personal doctors being taken into confidence,” she said.The jail superintendent dismissed reports of a transfer as a “rumour” and clarified that only a medical examination was underway.“The medical team will examine Imran's eyes, conduct different tests, and decide whether there is a requirement to move him to a hospital or if he can be retained in jail and continue the treatment here,” the superintendent said.Imran had earlier undergone a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad on the night of January 24, a development that was confirmed later amid limited information shared with his family.Imran’s personal physicians, Aasim Yusuf and Faisal Sultan, also called for a comprehensive evaluation at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad, news agnecy PTI reported citing Dawn.In a joint video statement they said, “In addition to urgent retina specialist care for his central retinal vein occlusion and severe vision loss, Imran Khan needs a full multidisciplinary evaluation of his underlying conditions at a tertiary hospital like Shifa International Islamabad.”Meanwhile, the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) alliance continued its sit-in at Parliament House for the third day, demanding that Imran be treated at a hospital chosen by his personal doctors.PTI MNA Asad Qaiser told reporters, “We will not compromise on Imran's health.”A TTAP leader said that the initial understanding to shift Imran to Shifa International collapsed due to demands to change the composition of the medical board. The alliance also alleged that access to food, water and medicines inside Parliament House had been blocked for the third day.Describing the reported denial of medicine to Senator Abbas as an “extreme and condemnable act,” the alliance said, “Prioritising any political disagreement over human compassion and medical needs is the worst form of oppression.”Vowing to continue the protest, TTAP stated, “History bears witness that tyrannical tricks, sieges, and oppression have never suppressed movements, nor forced those standing firm on the right side to back down from their demands.”The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan expressed grave concern over the health of PTI-affiliated prisoners, particularly Imran Khan and Yasmin Rashid and urged authorities to ensure immediate independent medical examinations and uninterrupted access to treatment.",Imran Khan underwent an eye examination at Adiala Jail on Sunday following a Supreme Court order.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) on Sunday claimed it has detained 17 Pakistani soldiers, releasing 10 while giving the Pakistani government one week to arrange a prisoner swap for the remaining seven.In a purported statement attributed to the BLA’s media wing, Hakkal, spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch described the move as the “second phase of Operation Herof.”According to the statement, the 10 released soldiers were identified as ethnic Baloch men affiliated with local policing structures and were freed after being “warned.” The group maintained that the move reflected “ground realities” and the “broader interests” of the Baloch population.“The remaining detainees are members of regular units of the Pakistan Army. Proceedings were convened in a Baloch National Court, where the captives faced accusations ranging from involvement in actions against civilians to aiding enforced disappearances and taking part in the genocide of the Baloch people. During the hearing, the men were allowed to respond to the allegations, evidence was presented, and statements were recorded before a guilty verdict was delivered,” the statement read.Despite the reported “convictions,” the BLA stated it was granting Islamabad seven days to formally express readiness for a prisoner exchange. It asserted that should such willingness be demonstrated within that period, the seven detainees could be swapped for Baloch prisoners.The statement also accused Pakistani authorities of ""failing to act"" on previous exchange proposals and, in doing so, not prioritising the lives of their personnel. It added that the “court sentence” would be carried out if no tangible progress is made within a week.There was no immediate official response from the military or the government.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claims it has detained 17 Pakistani soldiers, releasing 10 while giving the Pakistani government one week to arrange a prisoner swap for the remaining seven.

Baloch Leader Akhtar Mengal Stuns Pakistan, Says Balochistan's 'Separation Is The Only Option Now'





The recent disappearances of several people in Balochistan have been linked to Pakistan’s security apparatus, sparking fear and anxiety among families.At least seven individuals are reported missing in incidents connected to Panjgur and Karachi.Residents of Pulabad, a locality in Panjgur, described a recent raid where armed personnel searched homes and detained at least six people. Witnesses said those taken were transported to unknown locations. Locals mentioned two names, Inayat and Rasheed, while the identities of the other detainees could not be independently confirmed, reported ANI citing The Balochistan Post.In a separate case, 23-year-old Zulfiqar, son of Hameed and a resident of Tasp, was reportedly seized from a marketplace on February 13, 2026. Locals alleged that men linked to a state-backed armed faction, commonly described as a “death squad,” carried out the detention. Family members have not received any information regarding his condition since the incident.Another case raising alarm involves Zakir Noor, a student from Panjgur, who was allegedly detained in Karachi on December 30, 2025.The Baloch rights organisation Paank said he was taken by security personnel without legal documentation.Noor has not contacted his family since, fueling fears he may have been transferred to an undisclosed detention site.Paank said secret confinement places detainees at serious risk and violates international safeguards against arbitrary arrest. Activists added that the pattern disproportionately affects students and young men, especially those who migrate to major cities for education or work.","At least seven individuals are reported missing in incidents connected to Panjgur and Karachi.

Imran Khan’s Family Stages Prayer Protest After Being Barred From Meeting Him At Adiala Jail





The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Thursday directed authorities to constitute a medical board to assess the health of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan after reports surfaced about a loss of vision in one of his eyes.A bench comprising Chief Justice Yahya Afridi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan also instructed officials to facilitate communication between Khan and his two sons, who live in the United Kingdom with his former wife, British producer and screenwriter Jemima Goldsmith.“The issue of Imran’s health is most important. Intervention is necessary. His phone calls with his son are also important,” Chief Justice Afridi said during the hearing.The order came after the bench resumed hearing a case about the jail conditions of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder-president and ordered a detailed medical check-up before February 16. During the hearing, Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan said it was the state’s responsibility to provide the former prime minister with medical care.The order also came two days after the court asked PTI leader and lawyer Salman Safdar to meet Khan at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where the cricketer-turned-politician has been held since August 5, 2023, following his conviction in a corruption case.Safdar later submitted his report to the court after meeting Khan. It was the first meeting with the jailed leader since December 2, when his sister, Uzma Khan, was allowed to see him for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, Dawn newspaper, citing the report, noted that it detailed Safdar’s meeting with Khan, the condition of his cell, the facilities provided to him, a description of his living area and the process the lawyer followed to reach the jail.In the report, Safdar quoted Khan as stating that despite receiving treatment, including an injection, he has only 15% vision left in his right eye.Khan reportedly told Safdar that until October 2025, he had normal vision in both eyes. He later began experiencing constant blurred and hazy vision, which he repeatedly reported to the then jail superintendent, but no action was taken.The report added that Khan eventually suffered a sudden and complete loss of vision in his right eye. An eye specialist from Pims Hospital, Dr Muhammad Arif, was then called to examine him.He was diagnosed with a blood clot that caused serious damage. Despite treatment, including an injection, his vision in the right eye remains at only 15 per cent.A day earlier, Safdar denied making any statement about Khan’s health on Tuesday, clarifying that anything attributed to him on the matter had been misrepresented or misreported.However, on the day he met Khan, Safdar told reporters that the jailed leader was “fine and healthy.”","The Supreme Court of Pakistan has ordered a medical board to assess the health of Imran Khan.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has delivered a scathing assessment of his country’s past alliances with Washington, telling the National Assembly that Islamabad had been “used like toilet paper and then discarded” after serving American interests in Afghanistan.Speaking during a debate on terrorism following a deadly suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Islamabad, Asif said Pakistan had repeatedly joined “superpower wars” that were never its own.“We took part in two wars that were fought on the soil of Afghanistan,” Asif told lawmakers. Referring to the Soviet intervention in 1979, he claimed it was carried out “at the invitation of the government in Kabul” and that the narrative of an outright invasion was shaped by the United States.Pakistan, he said, entered those conflicts “in the name of Islam and religion”, but in reality two former military dictators sought legitimacy and the backing of a global power.“These were not our wars; they were superpower wars,” he said, adding that Pakistan and its land were used and then discarded ""like toilet paper.""Asif went on to describe terrorism in Pakistan as the “blowback of mistakes committed by dictators in the past”.He added that Pakistan had failed to learn from history, continuing to shift between Washington, Moscow and London in pursuit of short-term interests.""For our own interests, we sometimes turn to Washington, sometimes to Moscow, and sometimes to Britain. We have built strong franchises here, which was not the case 30 or 40 years ago,"" Asif said.Recalling then US President Bill Clinton’s brief stop in Islamabad in 2000, a visit lasting only a few hours at the end of a longer India trip, Asif said it underscored how transactional the relationship had become. Clinton’s engagement with then military ruler Pervez Musharraf was framed by US demands on democracy, non-proliferation and militancy, reinforcing.Asif’s remarks came as parliament passed a resolution condemning the attack on Imambargah Qasr-e-Khadijatul Kubra in Islamabad’s Tarlai area, where a suicide bomber killed 31 people and wounded 169 during Friday prayers. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. Thousands attended funerals across the capital as grieving families demanded accountability. “What happened yesterday has left us extremely angry and deeply hurt,” said Bushra Rahmani, whose brother was among the wounded.The minister urged political unity, lamenting what he called a lack of consensus even in condemning terrorism. “It is very important that we have a national identity on which no one disagrees,” he said, criticising those who, for political reasons, avoided attending the funerals of victims.","Defence minister Khawaja Asif criticises Pakistan's past alliances with the U.S. and Russia.

Foreign policy under fire

‘China no longer trusts us’

Backdrop of deadly Islamabad attack





Pakistan’s Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday launched a sharp attack on Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy, questioning how extremist elements continue to cross the border even as trade remains blocked.Speaking at a public gathering in Rawalpindi, Rehman highlighted what he described as a glaring contradiction in Islamabad’s approach towards Afghanistan. “In all these decades, we never paused to ask why our Afghan policy failed so miserably. Not a single pomegranate or melon can enter Pakistan, yet terrorists keep crossing the border,” he said, smiling as he made the remark.Referring to repeated claims by Pakistani authorities that militants were entering from Afghanistan, Rehman added, “Authorities say terrorists are coming from there. If they are coming, stop them. If they are coming, eliminate them. The Afghan government has never objected to your actions.”The JUI-F leader also criticised Pakistan’s broader foreign and economic policies, calling them “complete failures”. He said Islamabad’s diplomatic approach had left the country increasingly isolated.“India is our enemy, Afghanistan is our enemy, and even Iran and China are upset with us,” Rehman said, adding that the public deserved answers.“A nation cannot survive when its policies produce only isolation, mistrust and insecurity.”He argued that Pakistan’s foreign policy was being driven not by elected governments but by the military establishment. “One general comes and says we will negotiate; another comes and says we will wage war,” he said.Rehman also took aim at the government’s handling of the China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC), claiming that the flagship infrastructure project had stalled due to declining Chinese confidence.“CPEC has seen no real progress during this tenure because China no longer trusts us,” he said, questioning whether “even a single brick” had moved under the current government. He claimed Beijing had expected the Pakistan democratic movement (PDM) government to stabilise relations and revive projects, but remained dissatisfied.Rehman’s remarks come amid heightened tensions following a suicide bombing at a mosque in Islamabad on Friday that killed 69 people and injured more than 170, according to local media reports citing hospital officials. The blast occurred during Friday prayers at Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra in the Tarlai area, Dawn reported.After Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif suggested on X that preliminary findings pointed to the attacker having travelled to and from Afghanistan, Kabul rejected the allegation. Afghanistan’s ministry of national defence termed the claim “irresponsible and baseless” and urged Pakistani authorities to take responsibility for internal security lapses, Afghan media outlet Ariana News reported.The Afghan ministry said similar accusations had been made in the past following attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, without conclusive evidence.","Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman criticises Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy.

'Not Vassals Of Trump & Elon Musk': Spain's Deputy PM Makes Blistering Exit From 'Place Of Hate' X





Pakistan’s decision on granting a licence to Starlink to operate in its satellite internet market has been delayed amid data security concerns, geopolitical sensitivities and competition from Chinese firms, local media reported on Sunday.Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk , is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan. However, officials say unresolved security considerations and broader geopolitical factors have slowed the clearance process.According to the Express Tribune, the government has raised concerns that Starlink’s services could allow certain data transmissions to bypass Pakistan’s monitoring, regulatory and safety checks. “We cannot allow a license to Starlink without ensuring a safety check to ensure the safety of the data of consumers in Pakistan,” a senior government official was quoted as saying by Express Tribune.Sources cited by the newspaper said authorities had tested scenarios in which Starlink was expected to pick up sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services. “But the real reason is that the government has tested some cases in which Starlink was supposed to pick up some sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services,” sources said.Officials added that the government is working to address these issues, which have delayed the approval process.The report also cited the fallout between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk as a factor being weighed by the Pakistani establishment. While Trump and Musk had enjoyed a close relationship in the past, they later drifted apart. Officials indicated that Pakistan, which has seen improved ties with the United States since Trump returned to power last year, is cautious about taking steps that could draw scrutiny from Washington.At present, Pakistan maintains control over internet data traffic largely through Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited, which holds a majority stake in the country’s undersea cable infrastructure. Authorities are concerned that similar oversight may not be feasible with satellite-based services, raising fears of potential data breaches or loss of regulatory control.Satellite internet services are expected to focus primarily on remote and underserved regions, including Balochistan, where conventional broadband infrastructure remains limited. Currently, authorities are able to monitor internet traffic and suspend connectivity when required for security reasons. Officials have expressed concern that enforcing similar controls over satellite-based networks could prove more challenging.The Pakistan Space Activities Regulatory Board has confirmed that five companies, including Starlink and China-based Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology Limited, have shown interest in entering the satellite internet market. Chinese firms already have a strong presence in Pakistan’s telecommunications sector and are viewed as direct competitors to US-based companies such as Starlink.While consultations with stakeholders have been completed, the PSARB has yet to finalise the licensing framework. According to officials, additional time is needed to establish safety mechanisms before satellite-based internet services are permitted to begin operations.","Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday.

Amaq claimed over 200 casualties in contrast to the official Pak govt admission of 36 deaths and injuries to scores.The suicide bomber was identified by Amaq as Saifullah Ansari. His photograph taking the bayah (oath of allegiance) was also posted by the IS mouthpiece. The statement also mentioned that hundreds of Pakistani Shias had joined the pro-Iran 'Zaynabiyoun brigade' militia in Syria.The claim by Amaq followed an official denial by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which strongly rebutted any involvement in the incident.The blast, which occurred during prayers at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque in Tarlai area, was the deadliest in Islamabad since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.The explosion coincided with the visit of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to Pakistan. The attack is being seen as a result of growing sectarian tensions in the country.Earlier in Jan, ISKP had claimed responsibility for a blast in Bajaur district that killed a senior Lashkar commander named Najibullah.","Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday.

'Home-Grown Ills': Islamabad Mosque Blast Triggers Blame Game As India Rejects Pakistan's Blame





The Islamic State on Saturday claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad, which killed at least 36 people and injured many others.In a statement released through its Amaq News Agency, the Islamic State in Pakistan, an offshoot of Daesh, said the bomber opened fire at security guards when they tried to stop him at the entrance and then exploded inside among worshippers.The group also said Shiite Muslims in Pakistan were a target, claiming they provided recruits to militias fighting the Islamic State in Syria.The blast took place on Friday at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque-cum-shrine in the Tarlie area of the capital. The attacker, identified as 32-year-old Yasir from Peshawar, entered the mosque while worshippers were offering weekly prayers and detonated explosives.Authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said they arrested four suspects, including three alleged facilitators and the mastermind, during intelligence-based raids in Peshawar and Nowshera.Investigators said an identity card recovered during the probe confirmed the attacker’s identity. Official records showed his permanent address in Abbas Colony on Charsadda Road in Peshawar.Officials also said the attacker had spent around five months in Afghanistan before the bombing, where he allegedly received training in weapons handling and suicide attacks.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif had earlier claimed that India and Afghanistan were involved in the attack, without presenting any evidence.India had strongly rejected the allegations, saying, ""It is unfortunate that, instead of seriously addressing the problems plaguing its social fabric, Pakistan should choose to delude itself by blaming others for its home-grown ills.

Newly elected members of Bangladesh parliament are set to take oath on February 17, Dhaka Tribune reported on Saturday. The cabinet members are scheduled to be sworn in later the same day, the the report said, citing Election Commission secretary Akhtar Ahmed.The 13th parliamentary election took place on February 12, with polling conducted in 299 of the country’s 300 constituencies. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) emerged dominant, securing 209 seats, while Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami won 68. The National Citizens Party (NCP), a member of the 11-party alliance, captured six seats, and Bangladesh Khelafat Majlis, contesting under the same coalition, won two.Earlier, in his first address to the nation post victory in polls, BNP chief Tarique Rahman talked about ""Bangladesh First"" policy when it comes to the foreign relations with its neighbours.""We have cleared ourselves regarding the foreign policy which is in the interest of Bangladesh, and the interest of the Bangladeshi people comes first. By protecting the interest of Bangladesh and the Bangladeshi people, we will decide our foreign policy,"" he said.He also said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should be invited for the swearing-in.His return to Bangladesh signals a major realignment in Dhaka’s political landscape. After spending 17 years in exile, the 60-year-old leader is set to assume the prime minister’s office following the BNP’s sweeping electoral victory.His ascent is likely to reshape India-Bangladesh ties, which had strengthened during Sheikh Hasina’s rule but experienced friction after her removal. Rahman has indicated a practical, measured stance toward New Delhi, underscoring the need for “mutual respect and understanding” in bilateral engagement.Several core issues are expected to define the next phase of relations: border management, allegations of illegal migration and insurgent activity across frontiers; the sharing of transboundary river waters, particularly the Teesta and Padma; the safety of Hindus and other minorities amid recent incidents; and economic cooperation, including prospects for expanded trade and investment.","The 13th parliamentary election took place on February 12, with polling conducted in 299 of the country’s 300 constituencies.

A mandate with strategic implications





Bangladesh’s 13th national parliamentary elections have handed the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) a commanding mandate, marking a decisive political shift after months of turbulence.But beyond the scale of victory, the outcome has drawn attention for another reason, the return of several controversial leaders whose past convictions, later acquittals and anti-India links are likely to shape regional calculations.The polls, which saw BNP chief Tarique Rahman secure a two-thirds majority, were widely viewed as a reset following the mass uprising that led to the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.The BNP-led alliance won 212 seats, securing more than a two-thirds majority in Parliament, while the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance won 77 seats. Hasina’s Awami League was barred from contesting the elections.Hasina fled to India in 2024 amid the unrest, after which Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus headed an interim administration. Since her departure, relations between Dhaka and New Delhi have remained strained.While Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Rahman on his party’s “decisive victory” and expressed hope of strengthening ties, the electoral success of figures such as Lutfozzaman Babar, Abdus Salam Pintu, ATM Azharul Islam and Hasnat Abdullah adds a more complex layer to India-Bangladesh engagement.Former state minister for home affairs Lutfozzaman Babar, contesting on a BNP ticket, secured a sweeping win in the Netrokona-4 (Madan–Mohanganj–Khaliajuri) constituency..Babar received 160,351 votes, defeating Jamaat-e-Islami candidate Al Helal Talukder, who polled 39,309 votes, a margin of 121,042 votes. He was unofficially declared elected.“This victory is the victory of the people. I will continue to work for the development of the area, strengthening infrastructure, and fulfilling the expectations of the people,” Babar said, thanking voters for a peaceful poll, according to Dhaka Tribune.His return marks a dramatic reversal of fortune. In 2014, a special tribunal sentenced him to death in the 10-truck arms haul case, one of the largest arms smuggling cases in Bangladesh’s history.The case stemmed from the seizure of 10 truckloads of weapons at the Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Limited jetty on April 1, 2004.Investigators had believed the consignment was intended for the Indian separatist group ULFA.However, in 2024, the Bangladesh high court acquitted Babar and several others in the case, overturning the earlier death sentences.The sentences of others, including ULFA chief Paresh Baruah, were reduced. Former Jamaat chief Motiur Rahman Nizami, also convicted in the case, was executed in 2016.Former BNP vice-chairman Abdus Salam Pintu has also returned to Parliament after securing 1,98,867 votes in Tangail-2, the highest tally in the district, reported The Daily Star.He defeated his Jamaat rival by a margin of 1.38 lakh votes. His younger brother, Sultan Salahuddin Tuku, won from Tangail-5.Pintu’s political comeback follows nearly 17 years behind bars. He was arrested in 2008 in connection with the 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally that killed 24 people and injured more than 300. In 2018, a trial court sentenced him and 18 others to death.In December 2024, he was released from prison after the high court acquitted him.However, his name has also surfaced in connection with alleged anti-India activities. Pintu was accused of aiding the Pakistan-based militant group Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI) in carrying out attacks against India.He was also accused of funding extremist elements operating from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Bangladesh. There was, however, no official confirmation of these specific allegations.The grenade attack case itself is regarded as one of the most heinous political crimes in Bangladesh’s history. Despite the acquittal, Pintu’s past continues to attract scrutiny, particularly in the context of India-Bangladesh security cooperation.Following his electoral win, Pintu and his brother pledged to work for the welfare of the people.Jamaat-e-Islami leader ATM Azharul Islam won the Rangpur-2 seat with 135,556 votes, defeating BNP candidate Mohammad Ali Sarkar, who secured 80,538 votes.Azharul had been sentenced to death in 2014 after being convicted by the International Crimes Tribunal for crimes against humanity during the 1971 Liberation War, including charges of rape, murder and genocide.In 2025, Bangladesh’s Supreme Court overturned his conviction, terming the earlier judgment flawed. He was released after more than a decade in custody.His acquittal triggered polarised reactions. Jamaat supporters welcomed the ruling, while student groups at Dhaka University and Rajshahi University staged protests, accusing the interim administration of “rewriting history”. Clashes were reported between rival student groups following the verdict.Azharul had been a senior Jamaat leader at a time when the party opposed Bangladesh’s independence in 1971, a deeply sensitive chapter in the nation’s history that continues to shape political narratives.In Cumilla-4, National Citizen Party (NCP) candidate Md Abul Hasnat, widely known as Hasnat Abdullah, won with 1,66,583 votes, defeating his nearest rival, who secured 49,885 votes.Hasnat has drawn attention in India for his sharp rhetoric. In late 2025, he warned that India’s northeastern states could be “isolated” and suggested offering refuge to separatist groups if Bangladesh were destabilised.He described India’s northeast as geographically “vulnerable” due to its reliance on the narrow Siliguri Corridor, often referred to as the “Chicken’s Neck”.His remarks came at a time of heightened tensions following the killing and subsequent death of student activist Sharif Osman Hadi, whose death sparked large protests in Dhaka.Prior to the attack on him, Hadi had shared a controversial map related to India on social media, which drew criticism. In the aftermath of his death, anti-India slogans were heard during some protests and sections of public discourse increasingly reflected nationalist sentimentAmid these developments and reported threats near the Indian High Commission in Dhaka, India summoned Bangladesh’s High Commissioner Riaz Hamidullah, conveying “strong concerns” over the deteriorating security situation and the activities of certain extremist elements around the mission.In a recent video, he was seen calling for a ban on ISKCON and saying that Chinmoy Krishna Das, a Bangladeshi Hindu monk, should be hanged.Abdullah’s rise indicates the growing political space occupied by figures who adopt overtly nationalist or anti-India positions, a development closely watched in New Delhi.In addition to the electoral success of these leaders, the return of the BNP to power has also revived Dhaka’s demand for the extradition of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina from India, creating an early diplomatic challenge for New Delhi.Soon after the party’s landslide win, senior BNP leader Salahuddin Ahmed made it clear that the new government would pursue her return. “The foreign minister has already placed the case for her extradition, and we also support it,” he said, adding that the matter should be handled “according to the law” between the foreign ministries of both countries.Hasina has been in New Delhi since August 2024 after being removed from office during a mass uprising. In November 2025, a special tribunal in Bangladesh sentenced her to death in absentia for crimes against humanity linked to the violent crackdown on protesters during the 2024 unrest.She is also facing multiple other cases filed by the interim administration.India has confirmed that Dhaka sent an official request for her extradition, including a note verbale and a formal letter. The MEA has said the request is being “examined”.External affairs minister S Jaishankar earlier stated that Hasina’s stay in India was her personal decision following developments in Bangladesh.Hasina, however, has rejected the charges, calling them politically motivated. She has said she was not given a fair opportunity to defend herself and claimed she was denied lawyers of her own choice during the trial in absentia.She has also expressed willingness to face proceedings in what she described as a neutral and fair international forum.In its election manifesto, unveiled by Tarique Rahman, the BNP outlined a firmer foreign policy approach under the slogan “Friend Yes, Master No” and a doctrine described as “Bangladesh Before All”.While India was not explicitly mentioned, the document emphasised taking a stricter stand on issues such as alleged “border killings”, “push-ins”, smuggling, and securing Bangladesh’s fair share of water from shared rivers including the Teesta and the Padma.Senior BNP leader Salahuddin Ahmed said Dhaka sought normal relations with all neighbours, including India, but on the basis of equality and mutual respect.Rahman reinforced that message in his first public address after the results were declared. He said Bangladesh’s foreign policy would be guided by the principle that “people come first”, stressing that national interest would determine the country’s external engagement, including with New Delhi.“The interests of Bangladesh and its people comes first and it will determine our foreign policy,” Rahman said.Calling for unity after the decisive mandate, he described the victory as belonging to “freedom loving pro-democracy people” and urged political forces to work together despite differences.Even as Rahman adopted a measured tone, his adviser Humayun Kabir made pointed remarks about regional radicalisation. In an interview with news agency PTI, Kabir said extremism was a broader South Asian challenge, referring to “Hindu extremism and far-right intolerance” in India and extremist elements in Pakistan.He added that Bangladesh would pursue balanced relations and would not limit its partnerships to any single country, an apparent reference to criticism that the previous administration was overly aligned with New Delhi.Soon after the results were announced, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Rahman and reaffirmed India’s commitment to a “democratic, progressive and inclusive Bangladesh”.The two leaders also spoke over the phone, signalling an intent to maintain engagement despite policy differences.With the BNP holding a strong mandate and Hasina remaining in India, the extradition question is likely to become one of the first major tests of how the two sides recalibrate ties after Bangladesh’s political shift.The BNP’s emphatic victory may restore electoral legitimacy after a turbulent political chapter. However, the composition of the new Parliament introduces uncertainty about the direction of policy.The return of leaders once sentenced in major criminal cases, alongside figures associated with hardline rhetoric on India, complicates the diplomatic landscape at a sensitive moment in bilateral ties.The renewed push for Sheikh Hasina’s extradition adds further pressure to an already delicate equation.For India, which, under Hasina, developed close security coordination and counter-insurgency cooperation with Dhaka, the transition will require careful diplomatic calibration.Issues such as border management, cross-border militancy, water sharing and minority safety are likely to resurface more prominently in the coming months.Whether the BNP’s mandate translates into substantive policy shifts or remains anchored in domestic political positioning will determine the trajectory of India-Bangladesh relations.What is clear is that the political reset in Dhaka has introduced new variables into a relationship that both sides describe as strategically important.","Bangladesh's 13th national parliamentary elections have handed the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) a commanding mandate. The polls were widely viewed as a reset following the mass uprising that led to the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The electoral success of figures such as Lutfozzaman Babar, Abdus Salam Pintu, ATM Azharul Islam and Hasnat Abdullah is likely to shape regional calculations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128350742,imgsize-1113838,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-2026-02-14t195044.jpg"

BNP Demands Sheikh Hasina's Extradition From India After Bangladesh Poll Win

Adviser’s remarks on ‘Hindu extremism’

PM Modi congratulates Rahman

What the BNP’s victory means for India





Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chief Tarique Rahman on Saturday said that Dhaka’s foreign policy would be guided by the principle that “people come first,” including in its ties with India.In his first address after the party’s sweeping electoral victory, Rahman said that the country’s national interest would remain the central focus of his government’s external engagement.Responding to a question on relations with New Delhi, Rahman said: “The interests of Bangladesh and its people comes first and it will determine our foreign policy,” he said.Rahman also used his first address to call for national unity following the decisive mandate. The BNP secured more than a two-thirds majority in the parliamentary elections, the first since the 2024 uprising that led to the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.According to the Election Commission, the BNP-led alliance won 212 seats, while the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance secured 77 seats. Hasina’s Bangladesh Awami League was barred from contesting the polls.In his speech, Rahman dedicated the victory to those who, he said, had sacrificed for democracy.“Freedom loving pro-democracy people of the country have once again brought victory to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party,” he said.“This victory belongs to Bangladesh, belongs to democracy, this victory belongs to people who aspired to and have sacrificed for democracy,” he added.He urged political forces to work together despite differences. “Our paths and opinions may differ, but in the interest of the country, we must remain united,” Rahman said.Even as Rahman adopted a measured tone on foreign policy, his adviser Humayun Kabir made pointed remarks about radicalisation in the region.In an interview with PTI, Kabir said, “Radicalisation is a problem in South Asia. We see Hindu extremism and far-right intolerance growing in Indian society, and in Pakistan, we also hear of extremist elements. In Bangladesh, it is not at that level, but there are some issues.”He called for stronger regional cooperation and information sharing to counter extremism and said a BNP government would seek “balanced relations” with all countries, including India.“What we want are balanced relations. We will not limit our relationships to a single country,” Kabir said, referring to criticism that the previous government was overly aligned with New Delhi.Soon after the results were declared, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Rahman on his party’s victory and reaffirmed India’s commitment to strong bilateral ties.In a post on X, PM Modi wrote: “I convey my warm congratulations to Mr Tarique Rahman on leading BNP to a decisive victory in the Parliamentary elections in Bangladesh. This victory shows the trust of the people of Bangladesh in your leadership.” He added, “I look forward to working with you to strengthen our multifaceted relations and advance our common development goals.”PM Modi also spoke with Rahman and reaffirmed India’s commitment to close bilateral ties. In a post on X, PM said, “Delighted to speak with Mr. Tarique Rahman. I congratulated him on the remarkable victory in the Bangladesh elections.”He added, “I conveyed my best wishes and support in his endeavour to fulfil the aspirations of the people of Bangladesh.”The BNP, in turn, thanked India for recognising the electoral verdict and expressed hope that relations would strengthen under the new government.Rahman’s return marks a significant political shift in Dhaka. The 60-year-old leader returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain. He is the son of former president Ziaur Rahman and former prime minister Khaleda Zia.Under Sheikh Hasina’s tenure, India and Bangladesh developed close strategic and security ties. However, relations saw strains after her ouster.The BNP’s earlier terms in office were marked by periodic friction with India, particularly during its 2001–06 coalition with Jamaat-e-Islami, when New Delhi raised concerns about insurgent groups allegedly operating from Bangladeshi territory. In contrast, India viewed Hasina as a dependable partner on security cooperation.Despite that history, Rahman has recently signalled a pragmatic approach. In previous remarks, he has emphasised “mutual respect and mutual understanding” in ties with India.Several sensitive issues are expected to shape the next phase of bilateral relations — including border security, alleged illegal migration, water-sharing of transboundary rivers such as the Teesta, and the safety of minorities.The safety of the Hindu community, in particular, remains a closely watched issue. Just days before the elections, a 62-year-old Hindu trader, Susen Chandra Sarkar, was hacked to death in Mymensingh district. Authorities have said investigations are ongoing. India has previously expressed concern over attacks on minorities in Bangladesh, calling them a matter of grave concern.","BNP secured more than a two-thirds majority in the parliamentary elections, the first since the 2024 uprising that led to the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.

BNP's Tarique Rahman Set To Become Bangladesh PM After Sweeping Victory In Historic Comeback





Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairman Tarique Rahman’s adviser Humayun Kabir on Saturday said that ""Hindu extremism and far-right intolerance"" are growing in India, describing radicalisation as a wider South Asian concern.He also called for balanced and cooperative ties with New Delhi as the BNP prepares to form the next government following its sweeping electoral victory.In an interview with PTI, Kabir said, “Radicalisation is a problem in South Asia. We see Hindu extremism and far-right intolerance growing in Indian society, and in Pakistan, we also hear of extremist elements. In Bangladesh, it is not at that level, but there are some issues,” he said.He emphasised that regional governments must work together instead of functioning in isolation.“That is why all of us need to share counter-terrorism evidence and assessments and strengthen cooperation. Sitting in isolation and not engaging in information exchange or security cooperation only hinders progress,” Kabir said.“It is important to have cooperation at all levels, which is the norm of diplomacy, especially between elected governments in our region.Going forward, information sharing and working together will build confidence in detecting and tracking terrorists and extremists in the region,” he added.Kabir also responded to questions about India’s concerns regarding the safety of minorities, especially Hindus in Bangladesh.Referring to the previous government led by Sheikh Hasina, he said, “For the last 15 years under the Hasina regime, there have been deep and disturbing concerns that the foreign policy was more aligned with India’s foreign policy rather than Bangladesh’s. These concerns will continue to exist.”He said that the BNP would pursue what he described as a more balanced foreign policy.“What we want are balanced relations. We will not limit our relationships to a single country, and we will not accept any agreements that prevent us from doing business with others. We will avoid such agreements and disclosures,” he said.On allegations of minority violence, Kabir maintained that communal harmony prevails in Bangladesh.“The minority violence seen in India does not exist in the same form in Bangladesh, where communal harmony prevails,” he said.Providing context on the political transition, he added, “After the 5th August uprising, Bangladesh was without a government for five days, yet no one attacked minorities, as our leader, Tarique Rahman, urged people to remain calm and not take the law into their own hands.”“He provided calm leadership to ensure stability until the interim government was formed. In Bangladesh, Muslims and minorities live together peacefully, and communal harmony is strong,” Kabir said.The remarks come as the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) secured a sweeping victory with more than two-thirds majority in the parliamentary elections held after the 2024 uprising that led to the ouster of Sheikh Hasina.The issue of minority safety has been under renewed focus following recent incidents of violence. Just days before the parliamentary elections, a 62-year-old Hindu trader, Susen Chandra Sarkar was hacked to death inside his shop in Mymensingh district. Police said unidentified assailants attacked him with a sharp weapon and later fled the scene.","Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairman Tarique Rahman’s adviser Humayun Kabir on Saturday said that ""Hindu extremism and far-right intolerance"" are growing in India.

Jamaat wins in Bangla border areas spark worries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/jamaat-wins-in-bangla-border-areas-spark-worries/articleshow/128334768.cms,"BNP Demands Sheikh Hasina's Extradition From India After Bangladesh Poll Win





Concerns have deepened after Friday’s Bangladesh poll results showed hardliner Jamaat-e-Islami and its allies winning many of their 68 seats in areas bordering India. The total tally is Jamaat’s highest in over 25 years.Jamaat’s historical and ideological proximity with Pakistan raises the risks for India, a peril flagged by BJP. The saffron party had bagged in 2021 more than 16 Bengal assembly constituencies that share borders with the areas of Bangladesh where Jamaat has made inroads. “Bangladesh is a different country. We expect the newly formed govt to maintain law and order and ensure minorities will not be persecuted. But Jamaat’s victory along the border is worrying. It clearly shows there has been strong radicalisation on both sides of the border,” Union minister Sukanta Majumdar of BJP said.South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas, Nadia, Murshidabad, Malda and Alipurduar are among the Bengal districts that share borders with Bangladesh zones where Jamaat has come up trumps. Broadly, Jamaat has put its footprint on much of western Bangladesh, including Satkhira, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur and Gaibandha.Functionaries of exiled former PM Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League indicated that Jamaat, banned earlier, started spreading its influence over the past year. “Jamaat is a radical outfit which believes in hardlines which was never acceptable to democratic parties like Awami League. Unfortunately, they spread their organisation during the tenure of the interim govt,” said Salim Mahmud, former Awami League MP of Chandpur (1).In the 2001 election, Jamaat won 17 seats. In 2008, it was reduced to two. In 2013, Jamaat’s registration was cancelled by Bangladesh’s Supreme Court. While Hasina banned Jamaat, the interim govt lifted it in 2024.",Jamaat-e-Islami and its allies won many of their 68 seats in areas bordering India. The total tally is Jamaat’s highest in over 25 years.

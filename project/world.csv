China’s central bank rolled out major monetary easing measures on Wednesday, slashing a key interest rate and lowering the reserve requirement for banks as the economy reels under the pressure of renewed US tariffs and domestic weakness.The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) announced a 0.25 percentage point cut to its lending rate for commercial banks, bringing it down to 1.5%, according to news agencyThe central bank also reduced the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), the amount of money banks must hold in reserve, by 0.5 percentage points in a bid to spur more lending.The move marks one of the most significant policy interventions by Beijing since September 2024, and comes as US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, as high as 145% on many Chinese imports, begin to weigh heavily on China’s export-driven economy,reported.Pan Gongsheng, governor of the PBOC, confirmed the rate cuts at a news conference, saying the central bank would also lower its seven-day reverse repurchase rate to 1.4% from 1.5%.The lending rate for first-time homebuyers taking out loans over five years will be reduced from 2.85% to 2.6% in an effort to revive demand in the struggling property sector.Pan said the changes are part of broader efforts to “support technological innovation, boost consumption, and promote inclusive finance.”China is grappling with multiple economic challenges. Domestic consumption remains weak post-Covid, the once-booming real estate sector is still in crisis, and a global slowdown has further dampened demand for Chinese goods. Beijing has also retaliated to Washington’s tariff hike with 125% duties on US imports.Last month, China’s manufacturing output slumped, a downturn the government blamed on a “sharp shift” in global economic trends, while exports in March saw a sharp 12% surge as companies raced to beat Trump’s latest tariff round.China has set a 2025 GDP growth target of around 5%, the same as last year — a goal economists view as ambitious amid growing risks of a global slowdown and rising trade friction.While Beijing introduced several stimulus efforts last year, including interest rate cuts, eased homebuying restrictions, and debt limit hikes for local governments, analysts believe the growing impact of trade disruption may push Chinese authorities to unveil more aggressive economic support in the months ahead.",The People’s Bank of China announced a 0.25 percentage point cut to its lending rate for commercial banks.

US President Donald Trump lashed out at New York Attorney General Letitia James on Tuesday, calling her “a total crook” after the justice department received a criminal referral accusing the Democrat of mortgage fraud Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump claimed James was “a disaster for New York” and “a horrible, horrible human being,” adding, “I think she’s a total crook, there’s no question about it — but that’s just my opinion,” as quoted by theHe insisted that US attorney general Pam Bondi would “do what’s right” with the referral, though he distanced himself from the decision. “Pam’s gonna have to do what she wants... She always does. I’ve known her a long time.”Trump’s remarks came shortly after Bondi declined to confirm whether her office would act on the April 14 criminal referral sent by federal housing finance agency director William Pulte. “We don’t discuss anything pending or not within my office,” she told reporters.Pulte’s letter alleges James falsified financial documents to secure more favourable mortgage terms.According to the referral, James allegedly misrepresented a Norfolk, Virginia home as her primary residence despite listing her New York address elsewhere, a tactic that would reduce her interest rate. She also allegedly listed a five-unit Brooklyn building she owns as having only four units, a move that would qualify the property for more favourable government-backed loan terms.“Primary residence mortgages receive more favourable loan terms,” Pulte wrote, adding that multifamily buildings with more than four units face higher interest rates and stricter requirements.James has denied any wrongdoing. Her personal attorney, Abbe Lowell, told Bondi in an April 24 letter that James’ niece was intended to live in the Norfolk home, and that the “mistaken” filing shouldn’t be seen as fraud.Regarding the Brooklyn property, Lowell argued that it has functioned as a four-unit residence since James purchased it in 2001, and its basement has remained unoccupied.A spokesperson for James also dismissed Trump’s attacks and said, “AG James is focused every single day on protecting New Yorkers and upholding the law – not personal attacks, no matter who they come from,”reported.James famously led the 2023 civil fraud case against Trump, which concluded with a $364 million judgment against him and a combined $8 million penalty against his sons Eric and Donald Jr.As of last month, that figure had grown to over $500 million due to interest, as Trump appeals the ruling.As per the, the White House confirmed that no charges have been filed against James yet, but acknowledged further action could follow if the Justice Department proceeds.James’ office, meanwhile, has accused the Trump administration of using federal power for political revenge. “She will not be intimidated by bullies — no matter who they are,” a spokesperson was quoted by","US President Donald Trump lashed out at New York Attorney General Letitia James on Tuesday, calling her “a total crook” after the justice department received a criminal referral accusing the Democrat of mortgage fraud.

DHAKA : The interim govt, headed by Muhammad Yunus , is set to finalise an ordinance within a week that will abolish nine controversial provisions of the cyber security act-2023, including one related to the liberation war and father of the nation, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman One of the provisions abolished during the drafting of the new ordinance is punishment for carrying out any “hateful, misleading or defamatory propaganda” against the liberation war, the spirit of the liberation war, Mujibur Rahman, the national anthem, or the national flag.” Law adviser Asif Nazrul said this provision had often been misused in the past to “harass” people.At a meeting held Tuesday, the council of advisers approved the draft of the new ordinance, titled ‘Cyber Surokkha Adhyadesh-2025 (cyber protection ordinance-2025), fulfilling the interim govt’s promise to repeal the cyber security act-2023.

Trump says the US will stop bombing Yemen's Houthis after rebels say they'll stop targeting ships,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-says-the-us-will-stop-bombing-yemens-houthis-after-rebels-say-theyll-stop-targeting-ships/articleshow/120948284.cms,"Trump says US to stop strikes on Houthis in Yemen (Image credits: AP)





WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he's ordering a halt to nearly two months of US airstrikes on Yemen's Houthis, saying the Iran-backed rebels have indicated that ""they don't want to fight anymore"" and have pledged to stop attacking ships along a vital global trade route.""We're going to stop the bombing of the Houthis, effective immediately,"" Trump said at the start of his Oval Office meeting with Canadian prime minister Mark Carney.Trump said the Houthis had indicated to US officials that ""they don't want to fight anymore. They just don't want to fight. And we will honor that, and we will stop the bombings.""That likely means an abrupt end to a campaign of airstrikes that began in March, when Trump promised to use ""overwhelming lethal force"" after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing off Yemen in response to Israel's mounting another blockade on the Gaza Strip.At the time, they described the warning as affecting the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea.Trump's announcement came the same day that Israel's military launched airstrikes against the Houthis that it said fully disabled the international airport in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa. Israel's attacks were its second round of airstrikes on targets in Yemen in retaliation for a Houthi missile strike Sunday on Israel's international airport.A US official said the administration had not notified Israel of the agreement with the Houthis before Trump's announcement.Israel, according to this official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic talks, was irked by the unexpected news, particularly because the Houthis have continued to launch attacks on Israel proper and other Israeli targets.Israel does not appear to be covered by the US-Houthi agreement.Trump said the Houthis had ""capitulated but, more importantly, we will take their word that they say they will not be blowing up ships anymore. And that's what the purpose of what we were doing,"" Trump said.""I think that's very positive,"" Trump added. ""They were knocking out a lot of ships.""Asked how the Houthis had communicated that they were looking to stop being targeted by US bombs, Trump offered few details, saying only with a chuckle that the information came from a ""very good source.""A short time later, Omani foreign minister Badr al-Busaidi, confirmed that the US bombing campaign was ending, posting on X that discussions involving the US and Oman, as well as negotiators in Yemen, ""have resulted in a ceasefire agreement between the two sides.""""In the future, neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping,"" he wrote, calling the agreement a ""welcome outcome.""Defense secretary Pete Hegseth said on social media that Trump's ""objective from Day One: 'ensuring freedom of navigation.' PEACE THRU STRENGTH in action.""Despite Trump's framing of the deal as a way to reopen the Red Sea to commercial shipping without fear of Houthi attack, ""the Houthis have not fired on a commercial ship since December,"" Gregory Brew, a senior analyst with the Eurasia Group risk-analysis firm, said on X.""They are likely, however, to continue shooting at Israel,"" Brew noted.The Houthis had been waging persistent missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group's leadership has described as an effort to end Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.From November 2023 until January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.The Houthis paused attacks in a self-imposed ceasefire until the US launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March.Those strikes Trump had ordered were similar to ones carried out against the Houthis multiple times by the administration of his predecessor, democratic president Joe Biden.The Trump-ordered airstrikes gained a higher profile in the public consciousness when The Atlantic revealed that Hegseth had texted sensitive plans for a military strike against the Houthis on a group chat in the messaging app Signal that mistakenly included the magazine's editor-in-chief.Trump stood by Hegseth and downplayed the breach as a ""glitch."" But national security adviser Mike Waltz, who created the group chat on Signal, left his post last week and has been nominated by Trump to be the US ambassador to the United Nations.","President Donald Trump says he's ordering a halt to nearly two months of US airstrikes on Yemen's Houthis.

Two Indian children missing as migrant boat capsizes in California leaving 3 dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/two-indian-children-missing-as-boat-accident-leaves-three-dead-near-san-diego/articleshow/120914888.cms,"



A small boat believed to be carrying migrants capsized off the coast of San Diego on Monday morning, leaving three people dead, four injured, and seven missing. The US Coast Guard responded promptly, deploying a helicopter and boat to search for the missing individuals. Among the affected individuals is an Indian family, with two children still unaccounted for, while the parents are receiving medical treatment at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla.The Consulate General of India in San Francisco has expressed their sorrow over the tragedy and is providing assistance to the family in coordination with local authorities.The incident occurred about 35 miles north of the Mexico border near Torrey Pines State Beach, shortly after sunrise. The boat, a panga—an open fishing vessel commonly used by smugglers—flipped in the ocean, according to US Coast Guard Petty Officer Chris Sappey. Authorities believe the passengers were migrants, noting that such vessels are often used to evade heavily patrolled land borders. Migrants frequently rely on smugglers to navigate the dangerous seas in an effort to avoid detection.The injured were taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, where they are being treated for respiratory issues.Among the injured are three adults in their 30s and one teenager. The hospital did not provide further details on their conditions. Winds in the area were light, with waves reaching approximately six feet, making the conditions hazardous but not extreme.Hikers at Torrey Pines State Beach reported seeing the boat capsize at around 6.30am (local time). A doctor hiking nearby rushed to the scene, offering assistance and performing CPR on the victims. The search continues for the remaining missing individuals, while authorities investigate the cause of the tragedy.This incident is another in a series of deadly maritime smuggling cases along the US West Coast. In 2023, eight people died when a migrant smuggling boat capsized near San Diego, one of the deadliest such incidents in recent history. Last year, the UN reported a record high number of fatalities among migrants attempting to cross borders, with nearly 9,000 people losing their lives worldwide.","A small boat believed to be carrying migrants capsized off the coast of San Diego on Monday morning, leaving three people dead, four injured, and seven missing.

US secretary of state Marco Rubio after India's Operation Sindoor on Pakistan, said that he is closely monitoring the unfolding situation between the nuclear-armed nations, expressing hope for a swift de-escalation and reaffirming Washington’s commitment to promoting peace in the region.Posting on social media platform X, Rubio said, “I am monitoring the situation between India and Pakistan closely. I echo @POTUS’s comments earlier today that this hopefully ends quickly and will continue to engage both Indian and Pakistani leadership towards a peaceful resolution.”Rubio’s remarks followed India’s launch of Operation Sindoor, a targeted military campaign against terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir. The action was in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 26 civilians—including one Nepali national.According to a statement from the Indian embassy in Washington, “India’s actions have been focused and precise. They were measured, responsible and designed to be non-escalatory in nature. No Pakistani civilian, economic or military targets have been hit. Only known terror camps were targeted.”The embassy also confirmed that NSA Ajit Doval had briefed Rubio on the operation shortly after the strikes.The US has urged restraint from both sides. US President Donald Trump, responding to the situation, told reporters, “It’s a shame. We just heard about it as we were walking in the doors of the Oval. Just heard about it... I hope it ends very quickly.” He noted that tensions between the two nations have persisted for “many, many decades… centuries, actually”.Rubio had earlier spoken to both Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif following the Pahalgam attack . In that call, Rubio urged both nations to “de-escalate tensions, re-establish direct communications, and maintain peace and security in South Asia,” as per a statement from his office.The US has also stressed the importance of holding terrorists accountable. “The Secretary spoke of the need to condemn the terror attack on April 22… He also encouraged Pakistan to work with India to de-escalate tensions,” his office added.India, meanwhile, continues to brief international stakeholders on its counter-terrorism actions.","US secretary of state Marco Rubio said that he is closely monitoring the unfolding situation between the nuclear-armed nations.

AMERICAN-BORN CONFIDENT DESIS

“Give me your tired, your poor,Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free…”





While caste has become a prickly topic in America – particularly with Dismantle Global Hindutva campaigns and the zeal to uncover casteism where it doesn’t exist – comedian Nimesh Patel once offered a succinct explanation of the real Indian-American hierarchy. At the top, he joked, were the doctors, engineers, and CEOs — the men who made Indian-Americans the model minority. But they all came to drown their sorrows with the Indians at the bottom of the hierarchy: the liquor store Patels. Of course, Nimesh Patel’s social critique skipped over the Jhumpa Lahiri-reading diaspora of upper-middle-class ennui, but that’s an ontological discussion for another day.Which brings us to the one Patel who simply doesn’t fit into any version of the Indian hierarchy. Kashyap ‘Kash’ Pramod Patel — the breaker of every Indian-American stereotype — who became the first Hindu and Indian-origin man to lead the FBI.When Donald Trump visited India in 2020 and rattled off Indian names and cultural references like your neighbourhood WhatsApp uncle, the speech was written by Patel — Trump’s close aide, future National Security Council staffer, and now FBI Director. One of the most powerful men in the US, if not the world.And what makes Patel so extraordinary is precisely how he doesn't conform to any of the standard Indian-American tropes — not Apu , not Sundar Pichai , not Bobby Jindal in his final form. His parents fled Idi Amin’s tyranny in Uganda, first moving to East Africa, then Canada, before finally settling in the US. Patel was raised in a household deeply rooted in Hindu faith, imbibing Swami Vivekananda ’s teachings of universal tolerance and interfaith respect — values that, ironically, Trump would later butcher while mispronouncing Vivekananda’s name in Ahmedabad. While most Indian-American kids were pushed toward medicine, engineering, or safe corporate jobs, Patel became a public defender — the most thankless, least glamorous legal role in the American system. He wasn’t billing hours at a Wall Street firm; he was defending drug dealers and murderers in Miami-Dade.Then, like Johnny Lawrence in Cobra Kai, he flipped the script.In 2014, Patel joined the Department of Justice as a national security prosecutor, going after terrorists. The brown guy who once defended the accused now hunted them down in the maze of post-9/11 national security law.From there, he jumped into the political deep end — not as a hopeful Democrat who is Hindu lite, but as a Republican staffer helping Devin Nunes dismantle the Russiagate narrative. Most Indian-Americans dream of bipartisan approval. Patel wanted war. He authored the infamous Nunes memo, became the bane of MSNBC, and the darling of Trumpworld. And unlike the typical desi backstage operator, Patel wanted to be seen. Loud, pugnacious, unrepentant. There were whispers he’d become CIA Director. Or National Security Advisor. Instead, he took over the FBI — the very agency whose leadership he once called a “gang of thugs.”In any other world, that would’ve been disqualifying. For Patel, it became the brand. And what a brand it is. A brand where he could date a country singer, win the hearts of Christian MAGA diehards, and still chant “Jai Shree Krishna” while touching his parents’ feet. He’s both the destroyer of Russiagate and the hero of his own children’s book s — literally starring in them. He’s one of the few mainstream figures who’ll say without flinching that a temple stood in Ayodhya before the Babri Masjid.He’s also reportedly fonder of parties than policy meetings , and wants FBI leakers to undergo polygraph tests. Because why not?What makes his rise even more fascinating is how he subverted both his faith and his ethnicity into political weapons — in ways that would make the average Ivy League-trained desi activist squirm. Bobby Jindal and Nikki Haley sanitised their names and background for approval. Patel doubled down. He shares articles on how Hindu dharma shaped his worldview. He’s not asking to be let in. He’s kicking down the door.Mainstream media has mostly ignored his ascent — because immigrant stories are only celebrated when they colour within the lines.But for a community that prides itself on respectability politics — think Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, or even Kamala Harris — Patel is a slap in the face. He didn’t make it by being inoffensive. He made it by being incendiary. He’s not trying to represent brown America. He’s trying to dominate Washington. He doesn’t want validation. He wants power.And in that, Kash Patel might just be the mostIndian-American of them all.Because the American Dream was never about gratitude. It was about domination. And Patel — Trump’s dharma warrior — understood that better than most. He’s ready for war. Always.He’s not the final form of Indian-American evolution. But he is a fork in the road. A rogue signal. A reminder that you don’t need to code-switch, bow politely, or marry within your community to succeed. You can wear your sacred threads, punch left on Fox News, and still walk into Quantico or Langley like you own the building.The Patel parents who fled Idi Amin’s brutality couldn’t have imagined their son would one day run the FBI. But even more unimaginable is how he did it — not by code-switching or checking boxes, but by blowing up the boxes altogether.Kash Patel didn’t just succeed. He broke the algorithm. He rewrote the narrative. Loud, proud, and absolutely off-script.And that, more than anything, is his legacy. In his world, the model minority is obsolete. The rogue operative reigns. He isn’t here to fit in. He’s here to take over. Whether that’s good or bad for the community is debatable.But the idea that one must become palatable to be powerful — that immigrant success must come pre-wrapped in humility and gratitude — Patel shattered that myth like a man kicking in the doors of Langley.And maybe that’s why his story rattles so many.For decades, Americans have pointed to the Statue of Liberty and quoted Emma Lazarus’ immortal lines:The poem, written in 1883, was meant to welcome the tempest-tossed and the rejected — the exiles who believed in starting anew at the golden door.But what if one of those huddled masses grew up, stormed the gates, and decided he didn’t just want to breathe free — he wanted to run the damn place?That’s Kash Patel.His rise doesn’t come with violins or teary-eyed monologues about belonging. It comes with polygraphs, podcasts, and political warfare. It’s messy, polarising, and, in its own chaotic way, quintessentially American. How Patel’s story is as remarkable as any immigrant who has come to America — whether liberals swear by it or not — is a different matter.

Pete Hegseth orders 20% cut in senior generals across the Pentagon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hegseth-orders-20-cut-in-senior-generals-across-the-pentagon/articleshow/120914638.cms,"



US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced a 20% cut to the number of four-star generals and admirals across all military branches. The move, which applies across all military branches, comes amid wider efforts to reduce the federal government’s size and restructure its leadership along ideological lines.The directive, revealed in a memo signed by Hegseth, also calls for a 20% cut to top-ranking officers in the National Guard and an overall 10% reduction in general and flag officers across the military. These cuts follow a wave of firings in recent months, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. CQ Brown Jr., and the only two women serving as four-star officers. Hegseth defended the firings as necessary to align military leadership with the administration’s national security agenda The Pentagon has about 900 general and flag officers, with just 44 holding four-star rank. Congress was not given advance notification of the cuts, raising further concern. Representative Seth Moulton, a Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee and a former Marine, accused the administration of deliberately trying to politicise the military, warning it could erode confidence in the chain of command.Hegseth has been vocal in his disdain for what he calls the military’s “social justice agenda,” including diversity and inclusion efforts, transgender service policies, and climate programmes.In recent podcasts, he accused senior officers of catering to ideological trends in Washington and vowed to dismantle what he sees as “redundant bureaucratic layers.”The cuts come alongside a broader overhaul of the defence establishment. Last week, Hegseth ordered the Army to eliminate outdated equipment, shut down headquarters, and reassign thousands of Pentagon staff to frontline units. A military parade to mark Trump’s birthday and the Army’s 250th anniversary is also being planned, reportedly at significant expense.Meanwhile, intelligence agencies are facing similar downsizing. Around 1,200 CIA positions are being cut, largely through early retirements. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, led by Tulsi Gabbard, has already reduced staff by 25%.",Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced a 20% cut to the number of four- star generals and admirals across all military branches.

'Genocidal language': JD Vance blasts Ilhan Omar's call to 'profile white men',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/genocidal-language-jd-vance-blasts-ilhan-omars-call-to-profile-white-men/articleshow/120915138.cms,"



Vice President JD Vance sharply condemned Congresswoman Ilhan Omar ’s remarks calling for the profiling and monitoring of white men in the United States, labelling them as “genocidal language.” The controversy stems from a resurfaced 2018 interview in which Omar suggested that the US should be more focused on the threat posed by white men, arguing that they were responsible for the majority of deaths in the country.Omar, speaking to journalist Mehdi Hasan, explained her stance on national security, saying: “I would say our country should be more fearful of white men across our country because they are actually causing most of the deaths within this country.” She continued, “And so if fear was the driving force of policies to keep America safe, Americans safe inside of this country, we should be profiling, monitoring, and creating policies to fight the radicalisation of white men. ”Vance, did not hold back in his condemnation. He referred to Omar’s comments as “genocidal language,” adding, “What a disgrace this person is.”In response, Omar pushed back, defending her remarks in a statement. She clarified, “In this nearly 8-year-old clip, I am referring to the rise of white nationalism in an annual report issued by the Anti-Defamation League that said white supremacists were responsible for 78 percent of ‘extremist-related murders.’”Omar also took the opportunity to challenge Vance’s use of the term “genocidal,” suggesting he should “look up what ‘genocidal’ actually means when you’re actively supporting a genocide taking place in Gaza. ”This comment, which resurfaced when conservative activist Laura Loomer shared the video again, reignited the debate over Omar’s views. Loomer, who has previously criticised Omar for her alleged ties to extremist groups, posted the video with the caption: “Ilhan Omar, a jihadist member of Congress who has documented ties to HAMAS, the Muslim Brotherhood and ISIS, says jihadists aren’t a threat and we should instead be creating policies and databases here in the US to ‘profile white men,’ who she says are the biggest terror threat.”This controversy comes on the heels of a separate incident where Omar found herself under fire for an expletive-laden response to a reporter. When asked about a controversial deportee, Omar angrily told the journalist, “I think you should f**k off,” before later defending the exchange online.","Congresswoman Ilhan Omar called for the profiling and monitoring of white men in the United States.

Will Alberta get separated from Canada?







Canada will face the challenge of keeping all its provinces together in 2026 as Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said she will hold a referendum on the province's separation from Canada next year if a petition manages to get the required number of signatures. ""Should Ottawa, for whatever reason, continue to attack our province as they have done over the last decade, ultimately that will be for Albertans to decide,"" she said. ""I will accept their judgement."" The demand for separating from Canada intensified after the Liberal Party won the election last week.Danielle said she didn't want to presume that a referendum will certainly take place but she said she will honor the voting process. Smith said her government has no plans to put the question of Alberta separating from Canada to Albertans, but her government is taking steps to demand respect from Ottawa.""I do not support Alberta separating from Canada,"" Smith said.""I personally still have hope that there is a path forward for a strong and sovereign Alberta within a united Canada. So I am going to do everything within my power to negotiate a fair deal for Alberta with the new Prime Minister.""""In the months ahead, there will be many who will try to sow fear and anger among us. Those who would like to see Alberta divided,"" Smith said.Alberta introduced legislation which would cut the threshold required to trigger a provincial referendum, if passed. Under the proposed bill, a petition would need signatures from 10 per cent of the eligible voters in a previous general election — down from 20 per cent of total registered voters. Applicants would also get 120 days, rather than 90, to collect the required 177,000 signatures to open a referendum vote. She said there has always been frustration in Alberta against Ottawa and that frustration has only increased in recent years.

The meeting between President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House was the most anticipated amid the ongoing US-Canada strife and Trump's dogged persistence to make Canada the 51st state of the US. Mark Carney was stern in delivering the message that Canada is not up for sale, but Trump added 'never say never' with a mischievous smile on his face.Social media went berserk over their conversation as MAGA commentators claimed that Carney was stuttering showing signs of panic, when he said that Canada was not up for sale. Canadian social media users pushed back and said he was not stuttering but was just speaking respectfully without being ""unnecessarily aggressive"".Carney told Trump that there are some places that are never for sale. And he gave the example of the White House, the Buckingham Palace. ""As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,"" Carney said. ""We're sitting in one right now, Buckingham Palace that you visited, as well. And having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign the last several months, it's not for sale, it won't be for sale, ever.But the opportunity is in the partnership and what we can build together.""Social media users wondered what he meant by the owners of Canada and who are the owners of Canada. While he probably meant the people of Canada whom he met during the election campaigning and who are against dead against merging with the US, Canada js a constitutional monarchy and their head of state is King Charles III.Several expressions of Carney from the meeting went viral and Canadians praised how much restraint he showed when Trump went on 'lying'.

MUMBAI:





The cost to operate, sustain, and modernize current nuclear forces and purchase new ones in the US will shoot up to $946 billion over the 2025-2034 period — 25% higher than the 2023 estimate — which works out to an average of about $95 billion a year, according to the latest estimate of the US Congressional Budget Office The report released in April shows that the estimate includes $357 billion to operate and sustain current and future nuclear forces and other supporting activities; $309 billion to modernize strategic and tactical nuclear delivery systems and the weapons they carry; $72 billion to modernize facilities and equipment for the nuclear weapons laboratory complex; $79 billion to modernize command, control, communications, and early-warning systems, and $129 billion to cover potential additional costs in excess of projected budgeted amounts estimated using historical cost growth.The report states that the current estimate of costs for the 2025-2034 period is 25% (or $190 billion) larger than its 2023 estimate of $756 billion, which covered the 2023-2032 period. The report states that nuclear weapons have been an important component of US national security since they were developed during World War II.During the Cold War, nuclear forces were central to US defence policy, and a large arsenal was built.Since that time, nuclear forces have figured less prominently in defence policy than conventional forces have and, for several decades, the US did not develop and field new nuclear weapons or delivery systems, choosing instead to sustain or extend the life of existing ones.The report also points out that the nation’s current nuclear forces are reaching their end-of-service period. US nuclear forces comprise submarines that launch ballistic missiles (SSBNs), land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), long-range bomber aircraft, and shorter-range tactical aircraft capable of delivering both conventional bombs and nuclear warheads.It states that over the next two decades, these legacy weapon systems will have to be refurbished or replaced with new ones if the US were to continue fielding those capabilities. In addition, it says, many of the capabilities that support those nuclear forces — including the command, control, communications, and early-warning systems that DoD (department of defence) operates and the complex of laboratories and production facilities that DOE (department of energy) operates — are slated to be modernized.The report also says the Sentinel ICBM programme has encountered significant cost growth in recent years.","The cost to operate, sustain, and modernize current nuclear forces and purchase new ones in the US will shoot up to $946 billion over the 2025-2034 period.

Past criminal record of Mahendra Patel







After spending 49 days at the Cobb County Jail in Georgia, Indian-origin engineer Mahendra Patel was granted a $10,000 bond on Tuesday in the high-profile Walmart 'attempt to kidnap' case in which Patel was 'wrongly' arrested and incarcerated.On March 18, Mahendra Patel went to the Cobb County Walmart looking for Tylenol medicine for his mother. He asked a woman, Caroline Miller, for help. Miller was on a motorized cart with her two children. When Miller showed him the direction where he would find his medicine, Patel grabbed her two-year-old son in an attempt to kidnap him; Miller accused. But Patel said he was just making sure that the child did not fall. Patel was arrested after Miller lodged a complaint and was behind bars, but his attorney recently released surveillance footage showing that there was no force, no tug-of-war between them over the kid.The prosecution on Tuesday opposed to Patel's release citing his previous arrests for fraud and DUI. “To clarify, the defendant is not entitled to bond as a matter of right. It is entirely at the court’s discretion whether to grant bond,” assistant district attorney Jason Evans said. “However, the court is not required to grant it, and the defendant’s bond status was initially set at ‘no bond” by a magistrate judge based on the sufficiency of the evidence at the warrant stage.” The prosecution argued that Patel was previously convicted of conspiracy to defraud the US and served federal prison time, apart from being charged for reckless driving.Judge Murphy ruled that Patel would be granted bond and he was not a flight risk or a danger to the community. He also did not have history of sexual assault, the judge added and referred to the surveillance footage that he did not flee Walmart and was not running away.As part of the bond conditions, Patel is not allowed to use drugs or alcohol and cannot contact the alleged victim or her family, or visit Walmart.","Mahendra Patel, an Indian-origin engineer, has been granted bail in a high- profile 'attempt to kidnap' case in Georgia.

The suspected terrorist who allegedly planned to attack Lady Gaga 's record-breaking concert in Brazil has been identified as Luis da Silva , a 44-year-old man, who was deported from the US last month. Silva wanted to live stream the execution of children and set up bombs close to the stage during Gaga's Saturday performance on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro.Da Silva was taken into custody just hours before the concert along with a 17-year-old boy. They allegedly used Discord to plan their attack, and try radicalize others including teenagers to carry out attacks. Brazillian authorities said they planned to use Molotov cocktails and explosive backpacks.“Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks. Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.”Da Silva told police that Lady Gaga is a Satanist and so he was going to perform a Satanist ritual by killing a child during the show. Da Silva was arrested on an illegal gun possession charge but was released on bail Monday.His teen accomplice was arrested for possession of child pornography in Rio de Janeiro.“It was an integrated action that saved hundreds of lives. These groups, which are organized, have goals to achieve notoriety, to gather more spectators, more participants, the majority of whom are teenagers, many of them children,” Rio de Janeiro Civil Police Chief Luiz Lima, who oversees the Department for the Repression of Computer Crimes, told reporters.The revelation that the man was deported from the US comes as a massive victory for the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigrants, which came on the radar as several lawsuits have been filed against deportations, claiming that the Trump administration deported many innocent people, calling them gangsters. Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador as the Trump administration called him a member of the MS-13 gang but the Supreme Court ordered to bring him back to the US.","Luis da Silva, a 44-year-old man, was deported from the US last month.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday sparked speculation by promising a major announcement ahead of his upcoming Middle East trip , calling it “as big as it gets” but refusing to share any specifics.“We're going to have a very, very big announcement to make. Like, as big as it gets, and I won't tell you on what. And it's very positive,” Trump said in the Oval Office during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.“It'll be one of the most important announcements that have been made in years about a certain subject,” he added, offering no clues as to the content. Carney, seated beside him, responded with a dry quip: “I'm on the edge of my seat.”The statement came just days before Trump is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates — his first major foreign trip of the term, following a brief stop in Rome earlier this year for the funeral of Pope Francis.Diplomatic sources suggest the US hopes to make progress on the situation in Gaza ahead of the trip. Israel’s ongoing siege and bombardment of the territory, now in its second month, has cut off food and essential supplies, raising concerns about humanitarian collapse.Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Tuesday said Gaza “will be entirely destroyed,” reiterating plans to forcibly displace much of the population following Hamas’s October 2023 attacks.Trump, like his predecessor Joe Biden, has sought a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, but Riyadh has maintained it will not recognize Israel without significant movement toward Palestinian statehood . US officials believe progress on hostage releases and humanitarian access could be key to unlocking talks.Beyond diplomacy, Trump is also expected to pursue major energy and defense deals with the oil-rich Gulf states. The administration has hinted that announcements related to economic cooperation and security alignments could be on the agenda.Qatar, which has served as a critical intermediary in hostage negotiations, has indicated it will continue its mediation efforts, even as talks remain fragile.","US President Donald Trump says he will make a ""very, very big announcement"" about the Middle East.

It takes a lot of pressure off of that moment,"" Corrie Loeffler, the bee's executive director, told The Associated Press. ""We can keep going with regular competition, rather than saying, 'It's 9:50, we're going to a spell-off.'""Last year, the top two spellers were tossed into the spell-off without even competing head-to-head in the traditional spelling bee format, a move that rankled former champions and other bee aficionados. Bruhat Soma, who said afterward that he practiced the tiebreaker every day for six months, easily defeated Faizan Zaki Faizan returns for another crack at the title in this year's bee, which begins May 27.""Once you reach a certain point in the finals, the drama is really in watching the spellers take on the dictionary word by word,"" said Scott Remer, a prolific spelling coach who works with Faizan. ""Traditionally, the idea behind the spelling bee has been that you use the information you're given, you gather the clues, you process the information, you think about the word, and then you take all of that synthesis of information and you provide a spelling. The spell-off obviously tests a different set of skills.""The spell-off was first used in 2022. Harini Logan beat Vikram Raju during that contest, but only after the pair had a traditional, lengthy duel in which each misspelled four words. Dev Shah didn't need a spell-off to win two years ago, and he was outspoken about the 2024 edition, saying, ""I don't think it was a good bee.""There was no tiebreaker throughout most of the 2010s, and the bee had co-champions in three straight years from 2014-16. Then came the infamous 2019 bee, which ended in an eight-way tie when Scripps ran out of words difficult enough to challenge an unusually strong group of competitors.The 2020 bee was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it returned the next year under new leaders who made it clear they wanted a sole champion.Another rule change has already proven popular among the spelling community: the return of a written test during the preliminary rounds.Spellers who spell one word correctly and get one multiple-choice vocabulary question right on stage will then sit for a 40-question written test at the end of the first day. Results of that test will be used to pare the field to about 100 quarterfinalists - and Scripps will also use the test scores to gauge the strength of the remaining spellers and inform the difficulty of words used in subsequent rounds.Current and former spellers say the written test is a fairer way to move the competition along than doing everything at the microphone during lengthy rounds with wild variations in word difficulty.""I think having a written test as well as oral rounds allows for a better snapshot of a speller's holistic skills,"" Shah said.During the 2010s, a written test reduced the field to about 50 spellers, making it even higher-stakes. Scripps editorial director Molly Becker believes this version, with a ""gentler cut,"" strikes the right balance.""We've heard from spellers that we like the fairness of the test because they're all being examined on the same exact words,"" Becker said. ""Also, the primary driver for bringing back the test is that the program can continue to grow with the number of spellers.""","Scripps has eliminated its requirement that the tiebreaker known as a ""spell- off"" be used when the bee finals are nearing the end of their two-hour broadcast window. Instead, judges will have more discretion to let the bee play out, even if it runs into overtime.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120939362,imgsize-1168273,width-400,resizemode-4/120939362.jpg"

Days after empty rhetoric that threatened bloodshed if India stopped the Indus waters, Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has struck a more conciliatory note, saying Pakistan seeks peace, not conflict.Speaking in Pakistan’s National Assembly on Tuesday, Bhutto said Pakistan is a victim of terrorism and does not export it, ANI news agency reported quoting Dawn.“If India wishes to walk the path of peace, let them come with open hands and not clenched fists. Let them come with facts and not fabrication. Let us sit as neighbours and speak the truth,” Bhutto said.His remarks mark a stark departure from his earlier outburst in Sukkur, where he lashed out at India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Pahalgam terror attack . At that time, Bhutto had accused PM Modi of making false allegations and said India had no right to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty Standing by the Indus River, he had said, “The Indus is ours and will remain ours. Either water will flow in this Indus, or their blood will.”The April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, which claimed 26 lives, mostly tourists, was carried out by Pakistan-backed terrorists, triggering one of the most serious spikes in India-Pakistan tensions in recent years.","Bilawal Bhutto said Pakistan is a victim of terrorism and does not export it.

""During the night of May 5-6, Pakistan Army initiated unprovoked small-arms fire across the LoC in areas opposite Kupwara, Baramulla, Poonch, Rajouri, Mendhar, Naushera, Sunderbani, and Akhnoor.The Indian Army responded promptly and proportionately,"" said a defence spokesperson in Jammu.Following the attack, India on April 23 announced a series of punitive measures against Pakistan, including the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, closure of the sole operational land border at Attari, and downgrading of diplomatic ties, citing cross-border links to the attack.In retaliation, Pakistan closed its airspace to Indian airlines and suspended all trade with India, including via third countries. Meanwhile, Pakistan carried out back-to-back missile tests, successfully launching the 'Fatah series' surface-to-surface missile with a 120-kilometre range on Monday, following Saturday’s successful training launch of the Abdali Weapon System, a surface-to-surface missile with a 450-kilometre range.","The government is slated to present the 2025-26 budget in the first week of next month, ahead of the new fiscal year commencing on July 1.

Prolonged tension to hurt Pakistan's economy: Moody's,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/prolonged-tension-to-hurt-pak-eco-moodys/articleshow/120913945.cms,"



NEW DELHI: A sustained escalation in tension with India could hurt Pakistan's growth, impact its fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stability, Moody's Rating warned on Monday. In contrast, it does not expect a significant impact on India, apart from higher defence spending weighing on govt's fiscal consolidation plan.Pakistan was on the brink of bankruptcy until the International Monetary Fund bailed it out once again, provided it met several conditions. Its credit rating, Caa2+ according to Moody's, is speculative grade, signalling its weak fundamentals.""Pakistan's macroeconomic conditions have been improving, with growth gradually rising, inflation declining and foreign-exchange reserves increasing, amid continued progress in the IMF programme. A persistent increase in tensions could also impair Pakistan's access to external financing and pressure its foreign-exchange reserves, which remain well below what is required to meet its external debt payment needs for the next few years,"" Moody's said.Apart from assistance from multilateral agencies, including IMF and the World Bank, Pakistan had also managed to roll over debt from Saudi Arabia, China and UAE to tide over the foreign exchange and debt crisis.The weak sentiments are also reflected in stock market indices. Pakistan's benchmark KSE-100 index fell another 635 points on May 5. Since April 23, the index has lost over 7,500 points, or 6% due to fears of a conflict.Indian markets have, however, held up. ""Comparatively, the macroeconomic conditions in India would be stable, bolstered by moderating but still high levels of growth, amid strong public investment and healthy private consumption. In a scenario of sustained escalation in localised tensions, we do not expect major disruptions to India's economic activity because it has minimal economic relations with Pakistan (less than 0.5% of India's total exports in 2024),"" Moody's said.Moody's is not budgeting for a broad-based military conflict. ""Our geopolitical risk assessment for Pakistan and India accounts for persistent tensions, which have, at times, led to limited military responses. We assume that flare-ups will occur periodically... but that they will not lead to an outright military conflict.""","A sustained escalation in tension with India could hurt Pakistan's growth, impact its fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stability.

Thai prosecutors dropped royal defamation charges on Thursday against an American scholar accused of insulting the monarchy over an article published on a political website.Paul Chambers a longtime Southeast Asia politics scholar in Thailand, was arrested last month in Phitsanulok province, north of Bangkok, under the kingdom's strict lese-majeste laws .The case marked a rare instance of a foreign national being charged under Thailand's lese-majeste law, which bans criticism of King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his close family and carries sentences of up to 15 years in jail per offence.The Office of the Attorney-General said on Thursday it had decided ""not to indict"" Chambers.""The director-general had decided not to indict the suspect,"" the statement said, adding that prosecutors would seek to dismiss the case in court and coordinate with police.The Thai army, a staunch defender of the monarchy, filed the complaint over a short blurb posted on a political think tank website this year.A military spokesperson last week defended the decision to file the case following criticism that the army had no legal standing to do so under the Thai law.Trade talks between Thailand and the United States have been indefinitely postponed, fuelling speculation that the arrest may have strained diplomatic ties between the two countries.International watchdogs have expressed concern over the use of the lese-majeste laws, known as Article 112 against academics, activists and even students.One man in northern Thailand was jailed for at least 50 years for lese-majeste last year, while a woman was given a 43-year prison sentence in 2021.In 2023, a man was jailed for two years for selling satirical calendars featuring rubber ducks that a court said defamed the king.","Paul Chambers a longtime Southeast Asia politics scholar in Thailand.

A Bangladesh court on Wednesday granted bail to former Iskcon leader Chinmoy Krishna Das in a sedition case , reported Bangladesh's The Daily Star.Das was arrested following a controversy that erupted when a sedition case was filed against him and 18 others in Chittagong on October 30 last year.The charges were linked to the hoisting of a saffron flag above Bangladesh's official flag during the October 25 rally at Laldighi Maidan in Chattogram.Das was presented before a Chittagong court on Tuesday, where his bail plea was denied, and he was sent into custody. The arrest has triggered widespread outrage, with many demanding his immediate release.Das serves as the spokesperson for the Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote , a group that champions the rights and security of minorities. He has been a vocal advocate for the Hindu (Sanatani) community in Bangladesh, calling for key reforms such as a minority protection law, a tribunal for fast-tracking cases of minority persecution, and the establishment of a dedicated ministry of minority affairs.He gained widespread attention for organising large public rallies, including one in Chittagong on October 25 and another in Rangpur on November 22, which sparked significant socio-political discussions across the country.Das hails from Satkania Upazila in Chittagong. From 2016 to 2022, he was the Chittagong divisional secretary of Iskcon. He gained popularity at an early age for his religious speeches and earned the nickname of ‘Shishu Bokta’, or ‘child orator’, reports Bangladeshi media.",Chinmoy Krishna Das is a former Iskcon leader.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remain unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu's presence in public memory. The Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120714881,imgsize-779298,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-71.jpg"

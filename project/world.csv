US Olympic body bans trans women: Trump rule enforced; begins on August 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-olympic-body-bans-trans-women-trump-rule-enforced-begins-on-august-1/articleshow/122845401.cms,"File photo





United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has updated its rules to ban transgender women from competing in women’s Olympic sports. The change was made quietly on Monday and follows an executive order by president Donald Trump, signed in February this year.The new rule appears under the “Athlete safety policy” section on the USOPC website. It does not directly mention the word “transgender” or the name of Trump’s order — “Keeping men out of women’s sports.” Instead, it refers to it as “Executive order 14201.” No details have been shared yet about how the ban will be enforced.This policy change means that all sports federations in the US, including those for youth and amateur athletes, will now have to follow the same rule. Leaders of several Olympic sports confirmed that national bodies must now comply with the USOPC’s decision. The Olympic committee has 54 member organisations, according to its website.The USOPC confirmed the rule change in a statement on Tuesday. It said it had been in talks with federal officials since the executive order was signed. “As a federally chartered organisation, we have an obligation to comply with federal expectations,” the statement said as quoted by New York Times.The committee also said it would help national sports bodies to follow the new rule.USA Fencing, one of the sports bodies under the Olympic umbrella, has already updated its policy. Starting 1 August, transgender women can no longer compete in the women’s category and must join the men’s events. The same rule applies to nonbinary, transgender men, and intersex athletes.The Olympic committee said it aimed to “protect opportunities for athletes” and would coordinate with global bodies like the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee to ensure women’s sports remain “fair and safe.”Until now, the USOPC had left decisions on transgender athletes to each sport’s governing body. It had earlier said it would rely on “real data and science” instead of ideology and that decisions should be made on a sport-by-sport basis.The IOC has also struggled with the issue over the years. It currently lets international sports bodies like World Athletics or the International Cycling Federation decide how to handle transgender participation in global events.","United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has updated its rules to ban transgender women from competing in women’s Olympic sports.

Columbia University students expelled: Action over anti-Israel protests; nearly 80 punished,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/columbia-university-students-expelled-action-over-anti-israel-protests-nearly-80-punished/articleshow/122845143.cms,".





Columbia University said on Tuesday that it has punished several students for their role in anti-Israel protests held on campus in 2024. The actions include expulsions, suspensions, and even revoking degrees. While the university did not share exact numbers, a student group said nearly 80 students have been targeted.These punishments are linked to two specific protest events — a sit-in at the university library in May and a protest encampment during alumni weekend in spring. Columbia said the library protest disrupted hundreds of students during exam preparation time. Disciplinary measures included probation, suspensions lasting from one to three years, degree cancellations, and permanent expulsions.This crackdown comes as Colombia negotiates with the Trump administration to regain $400 million in federal funds that were cut. Trump has accused top universities like Columbia and Harvard of not doing enough to stop alleged anti-Semitism during protests against Israel’s war in Gaza. Columbia, which was at the centre of last year’s campus protests, has now agreed to introduce several policy reforms as part of the funding talks.Some students say these changes are giving in to political pressure.Meanwhile, Harvard is challenging the funding cuts in court. Columbia said this was the final set of disciplinary actions related to last spring’s protests.The student group Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), which supports cutting financial ties with Israel, said the punishments for the library protest were far harsher than those for past demonstrations. “We will not be deterred,” the group said, adding that they remain committed to supporting Palestine.","Columbia University said on Tuesday that it has punished several students for their role in anti-Israel protests held on campus in 2024.

‘Not the flex you think it is’: Kamala Harris mocked after presidential campaign anniversary post; critics call out 'Biden-erasure',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-the-flex-you-think-it-is-kamala-harris-mocked-after-presidential-campaign-anniversary-post-critics-call-out-biden-erasure/articleshow/122827496.cms,"Image posted by Kamala Harris on X commemorating her presidential campaign launch a year ago

Kamala Harris Makes A Fiery Comeback; 'Mr. Trump, White House Is Not Yours...' | Watch

Where is Kamala Harris now?





Social media erupted with criticism on Monday after former US Vice President Kamala Harris commemorated the anniversary of her presidential campaign launch.Exactly one year ago, on July 21, then-President Joe Biden announced via social media that he would not seek re-election. He subsequently endorsed Harris, who went on to secure the Democratic nomination for the 2024 presidential election To mark the anniversary, Harris shared a post on X featuring photos from her campaign. ""One year ago today, I began my campaign for President of the United States. Over the 107 days of our race, I had the opportunity and honor to travel our nation and meet with Americans who were fighting for a better future. And today, millions of Americans continue to stand up for our values, our ideals, and our democracy. Their courage and resolve inspires me. Whether you are attending a protest, calling your representatives, or building community, I want to say: Thank you. We are in this fight together,"" Harris wrote.The post drew sharp reactions online, with many users mocking Harris for commemorating a campaign that did not win a single primary vote. Others noted the complete absence of Joe Biden from both the photographs and the message.Twitchy's Amy Curtis responded, ""You didn't get a single primary vote.How very democratic."" The RNC Research, run by the Republican National Committee, added, ""Becoming the presidential nominee without getting a single vote is not the flex you think it is.""Washington Free Beacon investigative reporter Chuck Ross commented, ""lol. complete Joe Biden erasure.""Political commentator Link Lauren remarked, ""No mention of Biden again. Really trying to erase her association with him. She was there in lockstep with that failing administration. I don't have amnesia.""National Review senior writer Dan McLaughlin questioned, ""I wonder what caused that campaign to begin on July 21.""""'One year ago today, I began my campaign for President of the United States.' Oh wow, I remember that. What did Drew Barrymore call you? Momala? Oooh, and Beyonce endorsed you, right? How did you work out? Did you win?"" author John Hawkins wrote.Since leaving Washington in January, Harris mostly stayed out of the public eye, settling back into her Brentwood home in California with her husband, Doug Emhoff, and spoke to close friends and confidantes about her next steps.She weighed whether to leave politics, run for governor or run for President for a third time. She is expected to make a decision about the gubernatorial race by the end of summer, as reported by LA Times.Harris’s limited public appearances this year- including visits to a high school graduation in Compton, a DNC fundraiser in the Bay Area, and a meeting with firefighters in Altadena — have fueled speculation about her political plans.Her absence from the California Democratic Party convention and her husband Doug Emhoff’s new teaching role at USC have added to the intrigue. Harris recently canceled a planned two-week vacation and has been spotted in New York attending Broadway shows and the Met Gala, as well as dining and shopping in San Francisco and Los Angeles.","Former US Vice President Kamala Harris commemorated the anniversary of her presidential campaign launch on Monday.

The Donald Trump administration Monday released records of FBI's surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr and his assassination in 1968. “Today, after nearly 60 years of questions surrounding the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., we are releasing 230,000 MLK assassination files,” Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard wrote on X. Gabbard said that the documents, released in partnership with the Justice Department, Central Intelligence Agency, National Archives and the FBI, detail the federal investigation into the shooting at Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn., which resulted in 39-year-old King’s death.“The American people have waited nearly sixty years to see the full scope of the federal government’s investigation into Dr. King’s assassination,” Gabbard said. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we are ensuring that no stone is left unturned in our mission to deliver complete transparency on this pivotal and tragic event in our nation’s history.”“I extend my deepest appreciation to the King family for their support.”King’s family, including his two living children, Martin III, 67, and Bernice, 62, were given advance notice of the release and had their own teams reviewing the records ahead of the public disclosure.They issued a lengthy statement after the government's release and said their father's assassination captivated public curiosity for decades. But they said that these files are personal and must be viewed within their full historical context.“As the children of Dr King and Mrs Coretta Scott King, his tragic death has been an intensely personal grief — a devastating loss for his wife, children, and the granddaughter he never met -- an absence our family has endured for over 57 years,” they wrote. “We ask those who engage with the release of these files to do so with empathy, restraint, and respect for our family’s continuing grief.”President Donald Trump promised as a candidate to release files related to President John F. Kennedy’s 1963 assassination. When Trump took office in January, he signed an executive order to declassify the JFK records, along with those associated with Robert F. Kennedy’s and King’s 1968 assassinations. The government unsealed the JFK records in March and disclosed some RFK files in April.","The documents detail the federal investigation into the shooting at Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn., which resulted in 39-year-old King’s death.

"Secret deportation: 82-year old lost after ICE office visit to replace green card; family was told he died, later found alive in Guatemala",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/secret-deportation-82-year-old-lost-after-ice-office-visit-to-replace-green-card-family-was-told-he-died-later-found-alive-in-guatemala/articleshow/122805010.cms,"



Luis Leon, an 82-year-old Pennsylvania resident, was unexpectedly deported to Guatemala after visiting a US immigration office to replace his lost green card.Leon had been living in Allentown for decades after being granted political asylum in the US in 1987, following torture under Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet’s regime.He had lost his wallet containing the physical card that confirmed his legal residency, according to The Morning Call report cited by the Guardian. Therefore, Leonus and his wife had booked an appointment at an immigration office for 20 June to have the card replaced.However, upon arrival, Leon was suddenly handcuffed by two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and led away without explanation, his wife said. She was allegedly held inside the building for 10 hours before relatives came to collect her. The family said they then heard nothing about Leon’s whereabouts, despite numerous attempts to contact authorities.Days later, they received a phone call from a woman claiming to be an immigration lawyer who said she could assist, but she did not explain how she knew about the case or where Leon was being held. On 9 July, the same woman contacted the family again and told them Leon had died.However, in a shocking twist, the family learned a week later through a relative in Chile that Leon was, in fact, alive, but hospitalised in Guatemala, a country with which he has no known connection. The relative said Leon had initially been detained in an immigration facility in Minnesota before being deported, although his name did not appear on any public ICE deportation lists.His family remains in the dark about how and why he was removed to Guatemala. A recent US Supreme Court ruling had allowed the Trump-era policy permitting deportations to third countries, not just countries of origin, to stand.Leon, who had spent nearly four decades in the US working at a leather manufacturing plant and raising a family, had since retired. His medical condition remains unclear, but relatives say that he suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and a heart condition. They now planning to travel to Guatemala to be by his side.The case is currently under investigation.","Luis Leon, 82, was granted political asylum in the US in 1987 following torture under Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet’s regime.

Suspect on run after stealing firetruck, causing massive amount of damage





A fire truck theft in Washington state on Friday night led to extensive damage and multiple vehicle collisions.The incident occurred when an Everett Fire Department vehicle was taken from Hoyt Avenue, situated 30 miles north of Seattle, whilst firefighters attended a medical emergency at an apartment building's fifth floor, according to the department's update on Saturday morning, quoted by NBC News.The thief drove the fire engine at high speeds through north Everett's residential areas, causing considerable damage to parked vehicles and landscaping across five locations before abandoning the vehicle. The theft was discovered after 11 pm (Local time) when the first 911 call reported a hit-and-run incident. Witnesses reported that the fire truck had struck two parked vehicles at high speed before leaving the scene.The vehicle eventually came to a halt in the 1000 block of E Marine View Drive after colliding with at least ten parked vehicles. The Everett Police Department responded to at least six locations where damage to parked cars, trees, directional signs and grass was reported. Fortunately, no injuries occurred at any of the sites.“Losing a fire engine in such a reckless manner not only jeopardizes the safety of our first responders but also puts our community at risk,” said Everett Police Chief John DeRousse said in a statement, quoted by NY Post.The 2018 Pierce Enforcer pumper truck, which retailed between Rs 4 crore and Rs 8 crore, was severely damaged and had to be taken out of service.The stolen vehicle, a 2018 Pierce Enforcer Pumper weighing approximately 35,000 pounds, sustained significant damage and has been impounded as evidence. The fire truck, one of the department's newer engines, is particularly dangerous when moving due to its substantial weight.Everett Police Chief John DeRousse said, ""Losing a fire engine to such a reckless person not only jeopardizes the safety of our first responders but also puts our community at risk. We are committed to ensuring the safety of our residents, and any information that helps us resolve this incident is crucial. It is imperative that we hold the suspect accountable for their actions, and we will work diligently to bring them to justice. ""The police are seeking public assistance with information or footage of the incident. Fire Chief Dave DeMarco confirmed they are investigating preventive measures for the future, stating: ""We are thankful that no one was injured in this event, and we remain focused on safeguarding our community and our emergency response capabilities.""","Suspect on run after stealing firetruck, causing massive amount of damage in Everett, Washington.

.





United States and Indonesia have agreed on a new trade deal that will reduce tariffs and allow more American goods into the Southeast Asian country.The White House said that Indonesia will also ease its export restrictions on critical minerals like nickel, copper and cobalt — which are key for electric vehicles and electronics.Under the deal, US will lower a planned tariff on Indonesian products from 32 percent to 19 percent. However, items suspected of being transshipped to avoid duties will face a higher 40 percent rate.US president Donald Trump celebrated the agreement on his social media platform, Truth Social on Tuesday, calling it a “huge win” for American businesses. He said Indonesia will cut 99 percent of its tariff barriers, making it easier for US companies to sell industrial, tech and agricultural goods there.In return, Indonesia is expected to buy American products, including Boeing aircraft, farm produce and energy.A US official said the deal could be worth at least $50 billion for the US in terms of new trade and purchases. The official also said Indonesia will no longer try to tax cross-border data flows — something the US had opposed — and will accept US vehicle safety standards.The agreement comes ahead of a 1 August deadline, when the US is set to raise tariffs on several countries. Similar trade deals have also been announced with Britain, Vietnam and the Philippines.","U.S. and Indonesia have agreed on a new trade deal that will reduce tariffs and allow more American goods into the Southeast Asian country.

US envoy to discuss finalizing Gaza aid 'corridor': State Dept | AFP





US president Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is travelling to the Middle East as Washington tries again to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The conflict has dragged on for over 21 months, with the situation in Gaza getting worse, especially for people trying to get food and aid.State department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters on Tuesday that Witkoff was going with a “strong hope” of helping finalise a ceasefire deal and set up a new humanitarian corridor.“I would suggest that we might have some good news, but, again, this could be a constantly changing dynamic,” Bruce said.She did not share details of Witkoff’s travel plans or meetings. The announcement came after one of Gaza’s deadliest days for people seeking aid — at least 85 Palestinians were killed on Sunday while trying to reach food.The Israeli army claimed it only fired warning shots and said the death toll was being exaggerated. But the UN’s food agency accused Israeli forces of firing directly on the crowd.Bruce called the incident at Zikim crossing “absolutely horrible” and said it showed why a humanitarian corridor was urgently needed as part of any ceasefire.Talks between Israel and Hamas have been going on for weeks in Qatar. The US has proposed a 60-day ceasefire during which Hamas would release some hostages, Israel would free Palestinian prisoners, and more aid would enter Gaza.Talks on a permanent peace would begin during this period.But both sides remain firm. Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to keep fighting until Hamas is defeated and disarmed. Hamas says it won’t release all hostages unless the war fully ends — and wants a guarantee that Israel won’t resume attacks after the 60 days, like it did in March.","Steve Witkoff is travelling to the Middle East to discuss a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

US president Donald Trump on Tuesday accused former president Barack Obama of leading a coup against him in 2016.While hosting Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos Jr at the White House, president Trump was asked a question about Jeffrey Epstein, which he brushed aside. Instead, he accused Obama of trying to interfere in the 2016 election.Trump called the Epstein investigation a “witch hunt” and said the real issue was Obama’s alleged role in a plot to undermine his victory against Hillary Clinton. “The witch hunt you should be talking about is they caught president Obama, absolutely cold,” Trump said, before making a series of claims.The US president said he wanted the US department of justice to launch a criminal investigation into Obama. He told reporters that Obama, along with Hillary Clinton and others, tried to undermine American democracy.""We found absolute -- this isn't like 'evidence' or like -- this is proof, irrefutable proof that Obama was seditious, that Obama was trying to lead a coup, and with Hillary Clinton and all these other people, but Obama headed it up. This is the biggest scandal in the history of our country. It really goes on even to the autopen.""Trump added that recently declassified documents would prove his allegations. He claimed the Democrats paid $12 million to former British spy Christopher Steele for a report he called fake.He also said the report included false claims that media houses refused to print before the election. Trump claimed he had strong documentation, and said intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard told him more documents would be released soon.Trump linked the alleged conspiracy to the 2020 presidential election, which he again described as “rigged”.Trump also accused the January 6 committee of destroying evidence that could have revealed wrongdoing.","US president Donald Trump accused former president Barack Obama of leading a coup against him in 2016.

Trump vs Jerome Powell: Scott Bessent softens tone; suggests Fed chief 'shouldn’t step down right now’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-vs-jerome-powell-scott-bessent-softens-tone-suggests-fed-chief-shouldnt-step-down-right-now/articleshow/122843097.cms,"AP photo

Bessent calls for review of 'the entire' Federal Reserve





US treasury secretary scott Bessent said on Tuesday he saw no immediate reason for federal reserve chair Jerome Powell to step down. This comes just a day after Bessent publicly called for a full review of the Fed’s operations beyond its main role in setting interest rates.Speaking to Fox Business, Bessent said, “There’s nothing that tells me that he should step down right now.” He also noted that Powell’s term ends in May 2026 and that he should be allowed to complete it—unless he chooses to leave early.The comment follows rising pressure from US president Donald Trump’s administration for the Fed to cut interest rates. Trump has been sharply critical of Powell in recent weeks, especially over the central bank’s $2.5 billion renovation of its headquarters. While Trump said Powell has done a “bad job,” he also said it’s unlikely he’ll remove him before his term ends.Late Monday, Bessent posted on X calling for an “exhaustive internal review” of the Fed’s non-monetary operations. He said the bank’s independence was vital for economic stability but warned it was being threatened by “mandate creep,”—saying the Fed was taking on tasks outside its core responsibilities. He did not give examples.Earlier on CNBC, Bessent said the entire Federal Reserve should be evaluated for effectiveness.Meanwhile, Fed vice chair Michelle Bowman defended the bank’s independence and said it's “very important” for setting monetary policy.The Fed has held interest rates steady this year while assessing the impact of Trump’s new tariffs. Trump argues that rates should be three percentage points lower, saying it would ease debt costs. But Fed officials are cautious, warning that cutting rates too soon could raise consumer prices.The Fed holds its next policy meeting at month-end, and is widely expected to keep rates unchanged again.",US treasury secretary scott Bessent said on Tuesday he saw no immediate reason for federal reserve chair Jerome Powell to step down.

‘Not too distant’: Donald Trump hints at upcoming China visit; meeting with Xi Jinping on cards,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-too-distant-donald-trump-hints-at-upcoming-china-visit-meeting-with-xi-jinping-on-cards/articleshow/122842440.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: ANI)





US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he may travel to China “not too far into the future” to meet with President Xi Jinping , signalling a potential diplomatic thaw amid intense trade negotiations and geopolitical tensions.Speaking alongside Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr at the White House, Trump confirmed that Xi had extended an invitation. “President Xi has invited me to China, and we'll probably be doing that in the not-too-distant future,” he told reporters.“It’s a little bit out, but not too distant”, Trump added.According to CNA, while no final plans have been announced, sources familiar with the matter cited by news agency Reuters claim that the visit could be timed to coincide with a broader Asia tour later this year.Two possible occasions under consideration are the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea from October 30 to November 1, or a separate Beijing trip on September 3 for the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, a ceremony Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to attend.The White House and Chinese authorities have not yet confirmed details about any potential Trump-Xi meeting. However, the Kremlin has indicated it would not rule out a meeting between Trump and Putin if both leaders happen to be in Beijing at the same time.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Monday said, “If it so happens that [Trump] is there, then, of course, we cannot rule out that the question of the expediency of holding a meeting will be raised.”According to The Times, Beijing is actively considering playing host to a summit involving all three leaders, a move that could have wide-reaching diplomatic implications. Trump and Putin have already held multiple phone conversations since the former returned to office in January.Trump has expressed dissatisfaction with Moscow’s stance on Ukraine and recently warned of sanctions on Russia and its trading partners unless a peace agreement is reached by early September.In his comments on Tuesday, Trump described the US-China relationship as being on stable ground. “We’re getting along with China very well,” he said, adding that President Marcos should feel free to pursue economic ties with Beijing.“It wouldn’t bother me at all,” Trump remarked, to which Marcos replied, “It is something that we have to do in any case.”The meeting comes at a crucial moment, as the Trump administration pushes Beijing to meet an August 12 deadline to finalise a new trade agreement. Although Trump has toned down his rhetoric in recent weeks, the US continues to apply pressure over Chinese industrial overcapacity, fentanyl-related exports, and regional security concerns.A proposed 10 per cent universal base tariff on all imports remains on the table, alongside a sharply higher 55 per cent rate on goods from China.Despite unresolved disputes, including China’s support for Russia, exit bans on American residents, and aggressive moves in the Indo-Pacific, Trump has reiterated his willingness to keep lines of communication open with Xi, underscoring what he called a “very good relationship” with the Chinese leader.",US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he may travel to China “not too far into the future” to meet with President Xi Jinping.

San Francisco will ban homeless people from living in RVs





San Francisco is preparing to ban people from living in recreational vehicles (RVs) on city streets, a move that could force hundreds of unhoused residents — including working families and immigrants — to give up the only shelter they can afford.The crackdown comes under Mayor Daniel Lurie’s broader promise to clean up the city and is centred around strict new parking rules.""The proliferation of large vehicles has led to blocked sidewalks, compromised traffic circulation and health hazards that impact our neighborhoods. These are real challenges that residents and businesses experience daily,"" Kunal Modi, chief of health at the homelessness and family services department told news agency Associated Press.Under the proposed policy, RVs and other oversized vehicles will be restricted to just two hours of parking anywhere in the city, making long-term living in them nearly impossible. An exception will apply to those already registered before May — but only if they agree to work with the city on finding housing and eventually surrender their vehicles.The change will directly impact at least 400 RVs currently being used as homes.Many of the people living in them say they simply can’t afford San Francisco’s sky-high rents.""We are deploying a dedicate peer-based outreach team comprised of people with lived experiences of vehicular homelessness. The role will be to engage people living in large vehicles, assess their needs, determine their homelessness status and connect them with housing resources,"" Emily Cohen with the SF homelessness and supportive housing department told ABC 7 News.The policy has cleared its first hurdle and is expected to get final approval from the board of supervisors soon.",San Francisco is preparing to ban people from living in recreational vehicles (RVs) on city streets.

The Trump administration is quietly looking for alternatives to SpaceX for its ambitious Golden Dome missile defence system, weeks after the public rift between the two, according to news agency Reuters.Until recently, Trump's former political ally Elon Musk's SpaceX was the top contender to help build the Golden Dome, a missile shield Trump has frequently touted in speeches.According to Wall Street Journal, Trump aides have launched a fresh review of SpaceX’s federal contracts, hoping to find potential overspending or loopholes. But the new review hasn’t yielded much. Most of SpaceX’s existing contracts — with Nasa and the Pentagon — were deemed too critical to tamper with.Despite the tensions, the US government remains deeply tied to Musk’s companies. Over the years, SpaceX and Tesla have benefited from billions in public funding and contracts.Still, Trump’s team is reportedly exploring whether competitors, including Jeff Bezos’ Amazon-backed Project Kuiper, can replace SpaceX in future projects like Golden Dome.Interestingly, Musk himself has said SpaceX isn’t interested in working on the missile shield. In April, he posted on his social media: “SpaceX has not tried to bid for any contract in this regard. Our strong preference would be to stay focused on taking humanity to Mars.”","Until recently, Elon Musk's SpaceX was the top contender to help build the Golden Dome, a missile shield Trump has frequently touted in speeches.

Balochistan chief minister Sarfraz Bugti has confirmed the arrest of a tribal chief who allegedly ordered the so-called honour killing of a couple accused of having an affair.Condemning the incident, Bugti on Monday said, ""No one has a right, no matter what, to kill someone in such a painful and disgusting way, and then video shoot it. It is a crime. It is a murder. ”""We will make sure that they all will be prosecuted,"" he added, as quoted by Reuters.The incident came to light after a disturbing video went viral on social media last month.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Asim Munir for President? Pakistan Defence Minister Denies Amid Buzz Of Asif Ali Zardari Quitting





A political and diplomatic dogfight is underway over a prospective visit to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump en route to the Quad summit in India in September amid a gradual recalibration of ties in the region.Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit after pulling off a coup by arranging a luncheon meeting last month for the country's army chief Asim Munir with the US President.Munir charmed Trump by endorsing him for a Nobel Peace Prize, playing up to his craving for one, and the Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits, despite having thrown itself at China's feet for survival.Although the White House has not confirmed Trump's Quad attendance given New Delhi is yet to nail the dates -- which also depends on the leaders of Japan and Australia -- Pakistan's excitable media broadcast that the US President would visit Pakistan on September 18, before retracting the report because Trump will be on a state visit to the UK from September 17-19.There are indications though that Trump may stopover in Pakistan whenever he heads out to the Quad summit.This could be as late as November given the MAGA supremo's obsession with trade deals over strategic alignments. He has just delivered a tariff shock to Japan and also riled up Australia, while India has proved to be a tough negotiator, frustrating his trade boffins attempts to strong-arm New Delhi into a quick deal.In fact, Trump's fetish for tariffs and his fixation on trade deals puts a question mark over the strategic salience of the Quad even as long-time allies and partners adjust to his mercurial approach.According to some diplomats, India itself may have to reassess its approach to Trump-era Washington after a rosy-eyed view of long-term strategic ties with the US. They acknowledge that Trump’s response during his second term to the Pakistani outreach – driven more by opportunism than any strategic vision – clearly caught India off guard. New Delhi resents the re-hyphenation that would be implicit in such a two-fer, but has no way of thwarting it.If Trump does visit Pakistan, it will be the first US Presidential trip to the country in nearly two decades after George W Bush layover in 2006. Bush stopped by in Islamabad for a few hours under a tight security blanket on his way back from a three-day visit to New Delhi, talking up counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan while rejecting its pleas for a nuclear deal similar to the one he forged with India.Presidents Obama and Biden both disdained even a stopover while Trump himself trashed Pakistan during his first term, accusing it of ""nothing but lies & deceit"" and providing ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.""Pakistan is now promising to turn itself into a safe haven for US businesses promoted by Trump associates -- including transforming Islamabad into the ""crypto capital of South Asia"" and a ""global leader in the digital finance revolution,’ -- to land a Presidential visit.During his first term, Trump is famously said to have complained about landing in Iraq and Afghanistan with the lights on Air Force One turned off (as a security measure), despite the US having spent billions on the countries. If the Pakistan stopover comes through, he may well insist on landing in full sight – to soak up the fanfare and flattery.","Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Monday it was creating a national paramilitary force, prompting concern among opposition parties and human rights groups that it could be used as a tool of political repression.The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force that will be called the Federal Constabulary, state minister for the interior Talal Chaudhry told a press conference in the eastern city of Faisalabad. Its new duties will include internal security, riot control and counter-terrorism, according to a copy of the amended law reported by the local Dunya News TV.The announcement came after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of former jailed PM Imran Khan said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of his arrest. Several such protests since his Aug 2023 arrest have turned violent, in some cases paralysing the capital Islamabad for days.“This will be a new force. This will be a stronger force. We need this force for internal security,” Chaudhry said, adding that President Asif Ali Zardari had already approved amendments in the law introducing changes in the paramilitary force.The new force replaces the Frontier Constabulary (FC), whose cadres were previously recruited only from tribes in the northwestern province, Chaudhry said.Training of the new force will bring it into line with other national law enforcement agencies, he added. Khan’s party spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari said the changes should be subject to parliamentary discussion.The new force “should not be used as a gimmick to silence political opponents, as has been previously witnessed when the government applied such laws against a large number of the PTI leadership and supporters,” he said. His concern was echoed by Haris Khalique, secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent body. “We are alarmed by the changes being made to the security and law enforcement structure of the country without any debate in parliament,” Khalique said.REUTERS","The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force.

Poliovirus found in 20 Pakistani districts amid rising vaccine refusals: New sewage data signals resurgence; 13th polio case confirmed in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/poliovirus-found-in-20-pakistani-districts-amid-rising-vaccine-refusals-new-sewage-data-signals-resurgence-13th-polio-case-confirmed-in-2025/articleshow/122421011.cms,"



Pakistan's battle against polio has hit a fresh setback, with the deadly virus detected in sewage samples across 20 districts, including the capital, just as the country grapples with rising vaccine refusal rates.According to ARY News, citing the National Reference Laboratory, 28 sewage samples collected between May 8 and June 17 tested positive for Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1). The presence of the virus was confirmed in major urban centres such as Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, as well as in districts across Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts. Lahore recorded three cases, while Islamabad and four districts in KP also registered positive samples. In Balochistan, the virus was found in Mastung, Khuzdar, and Sibi. Mirpur in PoJK also showed signs of the virus.This alarming development follows Pakistan’s second national polio vaccination drive earlier this year, which saw over 60,000 refusals, 39,000 of them in Karachi alone. These refusals, officials say, are now posing a major roadblock to the country’s eradication efforts.“We’re not just fighting a virus; we’re battling misinformation and mistrust,” a senior health official told ARY News.Pakistan remains one of only two countries where polio is still endemic, the other being Afghanistan. With the confirmation of another new case this week, the total number of polio cases in the country has reached 13 so far in 2025.Health experts warn that the virus spreads primarily through contaminated water or food and can cause paralysis or death. There is no cure for polio, making vaccination the only defense. The World Health Organisation emphasises that multiple oral doses are needed to protect children under five, the group most vulnerable to the disease.Despite ongoing national campaigns, large pockets in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain difficult to access for vaccination teams, leaving thousands of children at risk.As the virus resurfaces in urban and rural sewers alike, officials say the next phase in Pakistan’s anti-polio war must tackle both the virus, and vaccine hesitancy, with equal urgency.","Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts.

So far, Pakistan has received two instalments under the programme, with the government implementing agreed policy measures aimed at fiscal discipline and investor confidence.“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici noted.He stressed the importance of structural reforms to ensure long-term economic sustainability, including strengthening tax equity, improving the business climate, and encouraging private-sector-led investment.Binici also welcomed Pakistan’s commitment to climate-related reforms under the $1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), approved in March.The RSF supports projects focused on disaster preparedness, efficient water use, green investments, and better climate data transparency.“Support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory,” he said.On regional prospects, Binici said economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including Pakistan, was expected to improve in 2025 and beyond. However, he warned that global economic uncertainty remains high due to trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation, and weakening cooperation.","Pakistan's economic performance under IMF's $7 billion loan programme has been'strong so far' Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, spoke at a lecture in Islamabad.

Karachi blackout protest chokes city traffic: Punjab Colony residents block roads after 24-hour outage; report points to systemic collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/karachi-blackout-protest-chokes-city-traffic-punjab-colony-residents-block-roads-after-24-hour-outage-report-points-to-systemic-collapse/articleshow/122418234.cms,"



A protest over a prolonged power outage in Karachi’s Punjab Colony spiraled into city-wide traffic chaos on Saturday, underscoring what many see as chronic governance failure and energy mismanagement in Pakistan, Dawn reported.Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity. Power had reportedly been out since 11 am Friday, and despite repeated complaints, K-Electric, Karachi’s sole power distributor, allegedly failed to respond.The resulting sit-in crippled traffic on Defence Road and nearby areas. Long queues of trucks and tankers vital to Karachi Port were stalled from Qayyumabad to the KPT Flyover. Major intersections like Boat Basin, Gizri, and Hino Chowrangi were brought to a standstill, leaving thousands of commuters stranded, according to Dawn.The outage reportedly followed K-Electric’s anti-theft operation in the adjacent P&T Colony. Protesters claimed legal connections were also cut off in the sweep, with no clear procedure followed. KE, however, described the protestors as ""miscreants"" attempting to restore illegal connections and said their teams were attacked during the operation, allegedly linked to a cable TV network.No evidence was provided implicating all affected residents in theft.While KE later claimed to have restored power to parts of the area, the larger issue remains unresolved. The incident highlights Pakistan’s ongoing struggle to provide reliable electricity, exacerbated by outdated infrastructure and lack of accountability in power distribution.As Dawn noted, the crisis is less about one blackout and more a reflection of systemic dysfunction, where citizens bear the brunt of institutional failure.","Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity.

Afghanistan was rocked by two more earthquakes early Saturday with a magnitude of around 4.0 on Richter scale, marking fifth such seismic event in the past week, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS).The first tremor, recorded at 1.26 am IST, measured 4.2 on the Richter scale with a depth of 190 km. The second quake struck just 45 minutes later at 2:11 am IST, registering a magnitude of 4.0 and a depth of 125 km. Both events were located in the northern region of Afghanistan, based on NCS data.On Friday night, another quake measuring 4.6 also shook the region. Earlier in the week, two more quakes of magnitudes 4.7 and 4.3 were reported, making this the fifth seismic jolt since July 17.Afghanistan’s vulnerability to frequent and often destructive earthquakes stems from its location at the convergence of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. The Hindu Kush mountain range, in particular, experiences frequent tremors and aftershocks.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) notes that Afghanistan remains highly prone to natural disasters including earthquakes, landslides, and seasonal floods. These events further strain communities already grappling with decades of conflict and limited infrastructure, making disaster response and recovery particularly challenging.","The first tremor measured 4.2 on the Richter scale with a depth of 190 km.

Nicknamed “Sika Golf” and believed to be in her mid-30s

Arrested in Nonthaburi province on charges of extortion and money laundering

Allegedly blackmailed multiple senior monks after initiating sexual relationships

Claimed to be pregnant to extract over 7 million baht from one monk

Received around 385 million baht over three years, mostly from temple-linked accounts

Told media she had fallen in love with some of the monks and gave money to one

Reportedly spent much of the funds on online gambling

Phones seized from her home contained tens of thousands of compromising images and videos

Police say she is connected to multiple temples across Thailand

Has become a lightning rod in a scandal that has triggered broader questions about the abuse of wealth and status in Thai Buddhism.





A dramatic scandal involving Thailand’s senior Buddhist clergy has gripped the nation after the disappearance of a well-known monk led to a web of blackmail, sex, and temple money trails. At the centre of it all is Wilawan Emsawat, a woman now accused of seducing and extorting powerful monks, and exposing a deeper rot in Thailand’s religious institutions.The controversy erupted after Phra Thep Wachirapamok, a respected monk from a central Bangkok temple, vanished without a trace. Investigators soon found the trail led to Wilawan, whose home was reportedly filled with phones containing tens of thousands of compromising images and videos involving monks. Her financial records showed deposits linked to temple accounts, drawing in at least nine senior clergy who have since been disrobed or dismissed.Police say Wilawan used romantic relationships with monks to pressure them into paying large sums to maintain silence, money often transferred directly from temple funds. She allegedly claimed to be pregnant in one case and demanded 7.2 million baht from a monk who later fled the monkhood, the Guardian reported.Wilawan, now in her mid-30s, was arrested in Nonthaburi province on charges of extortion, money laundering, and receiving stolen property. She has not commented since her arrest, and it remains unclear whether she has legal representation. However, before her arrest, she admitted to relationships with at least two monks and a religious academic. She also expressed guilt, saying she had “fallen in love.”Police say 385 million baht (around $11.9 million) passed through Wilawan’s accounts in three years, much of which was spent on online gambling, as per the report.Thailand’s acting Prime Minister has now ordered a review of laws governing monk behaviour and temple finances, amid growing calls for reform.

UK launches world-first sanctions regime targeting gangs smuggling illegal migrants to Britain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-launches-world-first-sanctions-regime-targeting-gangs-smuggling-illegal-migrants-to-britain/articleshow/122844270.cms,"Representational Image





LONDON: The UK govt has introduced sanctions for the first time on people who facilitate smuggling illegal migrants to the UK.The new sanctions regime will target anyone involved in assisting illegal immigration to the UK wherever they are in in the world.It is the world’s first sanctions regime targeted at gangs involved in people smuggling and organised immigration crime, as well as their enablers.From Wednesday, those involved face having their assets frozen, being shut off from the UK financial system and banned from travelling to the UK.The first wave of sanctions will target a range of wrongdoing, from the supply of small boats being used on cross-Channel journeys to the trade in fake passports, as well as middlemen facilitating payments through hawala networks, to the gang leaders themselves. The sanctions make it illegal for the UK financial system and any UK business to engage with those designated.As of July 20, 23,534 people have crossed the channel in small boats this year, an increase of 50% on the same period last year.Dr Madeleine Sumption, deputy chair of the migration advisory committee, told BBC Radio 4’s “Today” programme that she questioned what impact the sanctions will have. “The govt’s hope is it will make it harder for certain people smugglers to operate, but the impacts may depend on the cooperation of other countries where smugglers are operating and to what extent they help.I will be surprised if it would be a game-changer for the industry as a whole just because there are so many people involved in this industry that targeting people individually is probably only going to have impacts around the margins. ”MP Chris Philp, shadow home secretary, said: “The truth is you don’t stop the Channel crossings by freezing a few bank accounts in Baghdad or slapping a travel ban on a dinghy dealer in Damascus. Swathes of young men are arriving daily, in boats bought online, guided by traffickers who laugh at our laws and cash in on our weakness. We must deport illegal immigrants immediately on arrival, it is the only way to end the pull factor and deter crossings. ”","UK govt introduces sanctions for the first time on people who facilitate smuggling illegal migrants to the UK.

Ozzy Osbourne, heavy metal music legend, dead at 76

BLACK SABBATH - ""Paranoid"" (Official Video)





British heavy-metal icon Ozzy Osbourne , known for his dark stage persona and iconic role as lead singer of Black Sabbath, died on Tuesday at the age of 76- just weeks after performing his farewell show.In a statement, his family said: “It is with more sadness than words can express that we share the news of Ozzy Osbourne’s passing this morning. He was surrounded by his family and love. We request privacy during this difficult time.”Osbourne's death comes just weeks after what he had called his final live show. He had been struggling with health issues in recent years, including Parkinson’s disease, which he revealed in 2020.Often seen in all black or shirtless on stage, Osbourne became known for his dark image and shocking behaviour, including once biting the head off a bat during a concert. Though controversial, he later showed a softer side on the reality show The Osbournes, which portrayed him as a caring father.Black Sabbath’s self-titled 1969 debut album is widely seen as the starting point of heavy metal music. Sabbath brought a darker, heavier sound to rock music.Their second album, Paranoid, included well-known songs like “Iron Man” and “War Pigs,” and became a key influence for generations of metal bands.Osbourne was removed from the band in 1979 due to his legendary excesses, like showing up late for rehearsals and missing gigs. He went on to launch a successful solo career, with hit albums like Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman. His solo songs “Crazy Train” and “Flying High Again” remain fan favourites.He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame twice—once with Sabbath in 2006 and again in 2024 as a solo artist.In July 2025, Osbourne reunited with the original members of Black Sabbath for his farewell show. Metallica, Guns N’ Roses, Tool and many others performed at the concert, which drew tens of thousands of fans. Pantera frontman Phil Anselmo said, “I wouldn’t be here without Black Sabbath.”","Osbourne's death comes just weeks after what he had called his final live show.

British-African YouTuber 'Cenzo', who sparked widespread outrage after filming himself eating KFC chicken inside Govinda’s, a vegetarian restaurant run by the Iskcon temple in London, has issued a public apology days after the incident.The content creator, who has around 6,000 subscribers, admitted that he had been targeting vegan restaurants in the area as part of a prank series. In the now-viral clip, he is seen entering Govinda’s while eating fried chicken, offering it to staff members, and taunting them with meat, despite being informed that the restaurant does not serve non-vegetarian food. At one point, he dangles chicken from his mouth and shouts, “Free the chicken!” before being asked to leave the premises.Cenzo later released a video expressing regret, stating that he was unaware the restaurant was connected to a temple. He shared footage showing a man warning him that he was about to enter a temple and that the restaurant was next door. Despite the warning, Cenzo proceeded with the prank.“If I had known that the restaurant was with the temple, I would have never filmed that prank and left,” he said. He also confirmed he had contacted the restaurant and planned to visit in person to apologise.The shopkeeper, attempting to clarify further in the original video, said, “It’s a temple,” referring to the restaurant’s affiliation with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon), which follows strict vegetarian dietary practices based on religious beliefs.Cenzo acknowledged that his actions were “ill-timed and irresponsible.” After the backlash, he said he ""researched"" the Hindu community and realised the prank had deeply offended their values.Also Read: 'Racist attack': Indian national beaten, partially stripped in Ireland; envoy demands justice ""They believe in no violence and peaceful behaviours towards animals and people.

One user commented, “He was there to mock, it was purely intentional and done with a motive.” Another added, “They should have sued him for being unruly and mocking the religion.""","British-African YouTuber 'Cenzo' filmed himself eating KFC chicken inside Govinda's.

Poll Should family courts prioritize the protection of victims in domestic abuse cases? Absolutely, victims need more protection. No, the current system is sufficient.





As domestic abuse cases in the UK continue to rise, former Conservative MP Kate Kniveton has spoken out about the years of abuse she suffered from her ex-husband, former Tory MP Andrew Griffiths.In a new ITV documentary, Breaking The Silence: Kate’s Story, Kniveton shared how the abuse lasted for more than a decade and continued through legal channels even after she left the relationship.Kniveton is now speaking out about what happened to her and how the family courts are failing to protect other victims too.""People don't think it can happen to professional middle-class people, but domestic abuse has no boundaries. It can affect absolutely anybody,"" Knievton was quoted as saying to the Mirror UK.""When I was elected I made a promise to be an advocate of victims of domestic abuse. I am traumatised, not just by the 10 years of abuse I experienced, but the following five years where he continued to use the legal system to abuse me.""Kniveton described how Griffiths had a public image as a campaigner for women’s rights. However, he was abusive behind closed doors.She said he would rape her while she was asleep and verbally abuse their baby.""It would start when I was asleep. I'd wake up and he would have started having sex with me,"" she said. ""Sometimes I'd just think 'let it carry on' but there would be other times when I would cry. And those times he'd sometimes stop, not all times, but then he'd be in a foul mood if he did.""She also recalled being kicked out of bed and having to sleep in the spare room with the door barricaded. A turning point came when she saw the abuse directed at their newborn. ""When our baby was just two weeks old I realised that the abuse may not stop with me. He turned round and said 'shut the F up' and it was said with such force and aggression,"" she said.In 2018, Griffiths was caught sexting two constituents and later resigned. After this, Kniveton left the family home but had to fight the family court to stop him from seeing their child. In 2021, a judge found that Griffiths had raped and abused her. He denies the rape.In 2019, Kniveton ran for Parliament against Griffiths and won. Through her new documentary, she wants to show how many family court cases involve abuse and why the system needs to change to protect victims and children.","Former Conservative MP Kate Kniveton has spoken out about the years of abuse she suffered from her ex-husband, former Tory MP Andrew Griffiths.

"Antimicrobial resistant superbugs could kill millions, cost $2 trillion yearly by 2050: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/antimicrobial-resistant-superbugs-could-kill-millions-cost-2-trillion-yearly-by-2050-report/articleshow/122810364.cms,"Representative AI-generated image





Antimicrobial-resistant superbugs could lead to substantial global mortality and economic losses of approximately $2tn annually by 2050, according to a study, quoted by the Guardian.Analysis from a UK government-sponsored research reveals that rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) could result in yearly global GDP losses of $1.7 trillion over the next 25 years without decisive intervention.The Center for Global Development's research indicates severe economic impact on the US, UK and EU economies. Recent reductions in aid funding appear counterproductive, particularly as the UK government has eliminated Fleming fund support for AMR prevention in developing nations. Similarly, the US has confirmed $9 billion in foreign aid reductions, with European nations following suit.Anthony McDonnell, who led the research at the Center for Global Development, explained that initial projections were based on historical resistance trends. He noted that significant aid reductions by the US (80%), UK (from 0.5% to 0.3% of GNI), France, and Germany could accelerate resistance rates to worst-case scenarios.He emphasised that no country, regardless of their AMR control success, should be complacent. Without protecting AMR programmes from funding cuts, global resistance rates could escalate to match severely affected nations, resulting in increased mortality worldwide and substantial economic consequences.The study, covering 122 countries, projects annual GDP losses by 2050 could reach $722 billion in China, $295.7 billion in the US, $187 billion in the EU, $65.7 billion in Japan, and $58.6 billion in the UK under pessimistic scenarios.The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation forecasts a 60% increase in AMR-related deaths by 2050, with annual mortality reaching 1.34 million in the US and 184,000 in the UK. Drug-resistant infections are expected to rise significantly.Antibiotic-resistant infections double treatment costs due to increased hospitalisations, extended stays, expensive alternative treatments, and complex care requirements.The research estimates global AMR treatment costs could rise by $176bn annually, with UK costs increasing from $900m to $3.7bn and US costs from $15.5bn to $57bn.The study indicates workforce reductions of 0.8% in the UK, 0.6% in the EU, and 0.4% in the US due to resistant infections.However, increased investment in addressing superbugs could boost annual economic growth by $156.2bn in the US and $12bn in the UK by 2050.Dr Mohsen Naghavi from IHME warned that without immediate action, current medicines might become ineffective, potentially making simple infections lethal, according to The Guardian.This requires governmental policy changes, new drug development, and public education about antibiotics' ineffectiveness against viruses.A UK government representative highlighted their 10-year health strategy addressing AMR, citing progress in reducing antibiotic use in meat production and developing new treatment incentives whilst maintaining international cooperation.","Antibiotic-resistant superbugs could lead to substantial global mortality and economic losses of approximately $2tn annually by 2050.

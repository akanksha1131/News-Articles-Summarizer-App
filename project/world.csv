‘US Is Screwed If…’: Trump Fears Supreme Court Ruling As Tariff Empire Faces Trillions In Losses





A trio of conservative justices Friday warned that the court had overstepped its bounds in its decision to block President Donald Trump's emergency tariffs, arguing that the president should be able to impose tariffs under his power to conduct foreign affairs.In a 63-page dissent, written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, the dissenters also raised concerns that the decision would lead to chaos, at least in the short term as importers who have already paid the tariffs seek refunds.""The United States may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others,"" Kavanaugh wrote, referring to an acronym for the 1970s emergency statute Trump invoked to impose tariffs. He noted discussion at oral arguments about how such a refund process was likely to be a ""mess.""He also noted that the administration had used the leverage of tariffs to enter into key trading deals with other nations. Trump, he wrote, ""helped facilitate trade deals worth trillions of dollars -- including with foreign nations from China to the United Kingdom to Japan, and more.""The court's ruling ""could generate uncertainty regarding those trade arrangements,"" he wrote.Even as Kavanaugh warned of dire consequences from the court's decision, he sounded optimistic about the ability of Trump to continue imposing tariffs.Kavanaugh wrote that although he ""firmly"" disagreed with the outcome, ""the decision might not substantially constrain a President's ability to order tariffs going forward.""He laid out several potential pathways for the president to impose tariffs, adding that these other federal statutes ""might justify most (if not all) of the tariffs at issue in this case."" He added, however, that those statutes might require additional steps that the emergency law Trump has so far cited does not.He listed specific sections of several federal laws, including the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the Trade Act of 1974 and the Tariff Act of 1930, writing that the majority had concluded that ""the president checked the wrong statutory box"" by relying on the emergency law.","Kavanaugh, Thomas and Alito wrote a 63-page dissent to the court's decision.

Meet Asha Sharma: Indian-origin executive named CEO of Microsoft Gaming,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/meet-asha-sharma-indian-origin-executive-named-ceo-of-microsoft-gaming/articleshow/128628891.cms,"Asha Sharma’s journey to becoming Microsoft Gaming CEO

Changes across the gaming division

A pivotal moment





Microsoft has named Asha Sharma as the new chief executive of its gaming division, marking one of the most significant leadership changes in Xbox’s history. Sharma succeeds long-time gaming head Phil Spencer, who is retiring after nearly four decades at the company and will stay on as an adviser through the summer. Her appointment comes at a challenging moment for Microsoft Gaming, which is facing slowing revenue growth, rising costs and intense competition in the global console and content market.Sharma has been appointed Executive Vice President and CEO of Microsoft Gaming and will report directly to Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chairman and chief executive. In her first comments following the announcement, Sharma said she would refocus on Xbox’s core audience while navigating a rapidly changing gaming landscape shaped by subscriptions, cloud gaming and large-scale acquisitions.Before taking charge of Microsoft Gaming, Sharma held senior leadership roles across some of the world’s biggest technology companies. At Microsoft, she most recently worked in AI platform and product leadership, giving her direct exposure to the company’s broader push into artificial intelligence. Before that, she served as chief operating officer at Instacart and held product leadership roles at Meta. Her career has largely focused on scaling platforms, managing large teams and steering products through periods of rapid growth.Sharma is US-educated, with a business degree from the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management. While she is widely described as being of Indian origin, publicly available biographies and official company disclosures provide limited detail about her family background or roots, and she has not spoken extensively in public about her personal history. Her professional profile, however, places her firmly among a growing cohort of global tech leaders with diverse backgrounds.The leadership change comes as Microsoft Gaming faces multiple pressures. Gaming revenue has declined in recent quarters, hardware prices have risen due to cost pressures, and consumer spending remains uncertain. At the same time, Microsoft is still integrating Activision Blizzard, acquired in 2023 in a $69 billion deal that reshaped the company’s position in the gaming industry.Sharma’s background in operations, platforms and AI suggests Microsoft is betting on a leader who can balance content, technology and business discipline.Alongside Sharma’s appointment, Microsoft confirmed other senior changes. Matt Booty has been promoted to chief content officer, overseeing game studios and titles, while Sarah Bond is leaving the company to pursue a new chapter. Together, the moves point to a broader reset of the Xbox leadership structure.Sharma takes over at a time when Xbox is reassessing its identity. Competition from Sony’s PlayStation remains strong, especially in console market share and exclusive games. Analysts will be watching closely to see whether Sharma prioritises hardware, subscriptions, first-party content, or deeper integration with Microsoft’s AI and cloud businesses.Asha Sharma’s appointment marks the start of a new chapter for Microsoft Gaming. With Phil Spencer stepping back and a restructured leadership team in place, the company is signalling a willingness to rethink strategy at a time when the global games industry is under pressure. How Sharma navigates this transition will shape Xbox’s direction for years to come.","Asha Sharma has been appointed Executive Vice President and CEO of Microsoft Gaming.

Being Gordon Ramsay | Official Trailer | Netflix

With six episodes released on 18 February, Being Gordon Ramsay offers an unusually unfiltered look at one of Britain’s most recognisable chefs. Made with Netflix, the fly-on-the-wall series follows the 59-year-old as he embarks on what he describes as his most ambitious professional project yet: opening five separate dining concepts inside 22 Bishopsgate, London’s second-tallest building.But beyond the pressure of launching multiple restaurants in one of the capital’s most prominent skyscrapers, the documentary turns inward. Ramsay speaks candidly about his upbringing, his family and the long shadow cast by his younger brother’s decades-long heroin addiction.“I’m not embarrassed of my past. I got dealt a dysfunctional card. Big f**king deal,” he says on camera. At another point, he reflects on how close he feels he came to a very different life: he was “so close to not making it,” he says, and that proximity, he explains, “is what keeps me going.”The series does not attempt to soften those edges. Ramsay told LADbible he was “too honest” to have “sanitised” any part of the project. “We ripped off the Band Aid,” he says. “I need to do stuff that is raw. I need less shiny and more real. And I think that's me.”The second episode of the series focuses heavily on Ramsay’s brother Ronnie, now 58, who has struggled with heroin addiction for much of his adult life. The two shared a bedroom growing up, often a bunk bed, as their family moved repeatedly between deprived council estates.“I have a brother who’s a heroin addict. We shared a bunk bed together. He’s 15 months younger than me, and he’s been an addict for the last four decades. I’ve gone to hell and back with him, and so I have a guilt complex,” Ramsay says in the documentary.“That could’ve been me, it could’ve been switched.”He elaborates on how close their early lives were, and how starkly they diverged: “And so, when that… when that change is so close to you… it’s your brother, right? It’s not a cousin. It’s not a mate down the pub. It’s your brother. Born in the same house, grew up in the same bedroom, shared bunk beds, and so similar… But how can it be so different now? That’s what I mean by that [being so close to not making it is what keeps him going]. ”The family’s instability shaped both men. Ramsay has described his father as a “violent alcoholic” and has spoken openly about what he calls a “torrid relationship” with him. “It’s hard, isn’t it, when someone’s an alcoholic? It’s very hard to relate to that, because you’re just … you’re nervous,” he says in the first instalment. “You’re worried about, you know, hitting the end of the bottle and seeing that bottle of Bacardi disappear, because you know what happens at the end of that. ”The Ramsay children, Gordon, Ronnie and sisters Yvonne and Dianne, moved frequently. At nine, Gordon relocated from a tough Renfrewshire council estate to Stratford-upon-Avon. It would be the first of many moves. Speaking on thepodcast in 2023, he recalled: “Growing up in multiple stholes, you get one's st together early. I just wanted to better myself and get out of a situation that was unfortunate. I had grown up on 15 council estates.”“There’s always a nerve-wracking moment when you go to another school, another football club. Having to make mates again sometimes twice in one year. That’s incredibly disruptive.”Ronnie’s struggles became public in 2007 when he was jailed in Bali for drug offences. Ramsay’s own path diverged sharply. Now estimated to be worth around £180 million through his restaurants and television ventures, he credits relentless work and his mother’s resilience for driving him forward.“The first ambition when I got successful was to give mum her own house, her own garage and a car,” he says. “It’s a big thing for a son to look after their mum. She went to hell and back to look after us.”Still, the contrast with his brother remains front of mind. “The flipside to my success is my brother’s addiction to heroin. It’s bizarre isn’t it?” he says. “You grow up on several council estates, you’re sharing this tiny bedroom and you’re in bunk beds. You’re so close as brothers, we’re 14 months apart so much has changed dramatically.”“I have that reminder on a daily basis how different it could have been if I’d gone down a different road and felt the country owed me something rather than fighting for something.”","Being Gordon Ramsay is a six-part documentary series on Netflix.

California’s role in challenging Trump tariffs





In a major setback to President Donald Trump’s trade policy, the US Supreme Court, in a 6-3 ruling, struck down sweeping global tariffs imposed under emergency powers, holding that the president exceeded his legal authority by bypassing Congress.In its majority opinion, the court ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose broad import tariffs, emphasizing that the Constitution clearly vests taxing powers, including tariffs, with Congress.Reacting to the verdict, California Governor Gavin Newsom called for immediate refunds to American families and businesses for what he described as unlawfully collected tariffs.“Time to pay the piper. These tariffs were nothing more than an illegal cash grab that drove up prices and hurt working families. Every dollar unlawfully taken must be refunded immediately — with interest,” Newsom wrote on X.California played a central role in the legal battle, becoming the first state to challenge the tariffs in court in April 2025. The state argued that Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs without congressional approval was unlawful and economically damaging.State officials warned the measures had a disproportionate impact on California’s vast agricultural sector, exporters, and small businesses, given its position as the largest state economy in the US.According to estimates from Yale University’s Budget Lab and federal customs data, more than USD 130 billion to USD 142 billion was collected under the tariffs in 2025 alone. Analysts said the costs were largely passed on to consumers through higher prices, with the average American household losing an estimated USD 1,751 over the year.The Supreme Court’s decision marked a significant victory for states, businesses, and trade groups that had challenged the tariffs, arguing they disrupted global trade relationships and imposed heavy financial burdens domestically.Trump, however, criticised the ruling, calling it “deeply disappointing” and asserting that his administration has “very powerful alternatives” to continue protecting US trade interests. He also indicated plans to pursue other legal avenues to maintain tariffs under different statutory authorities.","The US Supreme Court, in a 6-3 ruling, struck down sweeping global tariffs imposed under emergency powers.

US President Donald Trump’s long-discussed ankle swelling has once again drawn public attention after a photo taken during an informal podcast recording in Georgia surfaced online.The image, shared by sports podcaster Josh Pate, shows Trump seated at The Varsity fast-food restaurant in Rome, Georgia, ahead of a political rally. In the photo, Trump’s lower legs appear visibly swollen above his shoes, prompting renewed speculation about his health.Pate posted the image on social media, noting that Trump would appear on his show. According to local reports, the president stopped at the restaurant for a cheeseburger and briefly recorded the podcast episode before continuing his campaign engagements.The White House has consistently maintained that Trump’s ankle swelling is caused by chronic venous insufficiency, a condition common among older adults in which veins struggle to circulate blood efficiently back to the heart.Trump previously acknowledged in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that he had used compression socks to manage the condition but stopped wearing them because he “didn’t like them.”His aides also told the publication that increased movement and walking had helped improve the swelling.Responding to the latest photo, a White House spokesperson defended Trump’s health and fitness and told“President Trump is the sharpest, most accessible, and energetic president in modern American history,” while dismissing criticism surrounding his condition.However, questions around Trump’s health have persisted following recent public appearances. During the inaugural meeting of the “Board of Peace” on Thursday, cameras captured the 79-year-old president appearing to briefly doze off while seated, marking the latest in a series of instances where he has appeared fatigued at official engagements.The latest episode follows several instances where Trump’s swollen ankles were noticed during public appearances. Last week, photographs captured during a meeting with Colombian President Gustavo Petro in the Oval Office also drew attention to the issue.In October last year, Trump’s ankles appeared visibly swollen during talks with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. A month earlier, similar observations were made when Trump and First Lady Melania Trump returned from an overseas visit.Trump, currently the oldest person to assume the US presidency, has also been photographed appearing fatigued at some recent official meetings, further fuelling debate over his health and stamina.","US President Donald Trump’s long-discussed ankle swelling has once again drawn public attention after a photo taken during an informal podcast recording in Georgia surfaced online.

'Something meaningful changed behind the scenes'





The March 2026 visa bulletin brings good news for Indian Green Card applicants as the EB-2 category sees a forward movement by 11 months and the EB-1 by four months in the latest visa update. In the EB-1 category, China and India advance by four months to December 1, 2023. In the EB-2 category, all countries become current except India and China. While India moves 11 months to November 1, 2014, China is at January 1, 2022.Immigration attorney Rahul Reddy called the forward movement an ""abrupt and unexpected shift"" and said for many, this movement is not just an incremental progress but a door opening that few believed would open so quickly.Reddy said that the forward movement makes it clear that the system is now acknowledging that the backlog had been unreasonable. ""The sentiment is clear: This is not just date movement; this is the system acknowledging that the backlog has been stretched beyond reason. Filing dates do not move nearly a year forward unless USCIS and the Department of State see real visa number availability. This movement signals that something meaningful has changed behind the scenes,"" he said.""An eleven-month jump in filing dates does not occur in isolation. It reflects structural realities built into US immigration law. When family-based immigrant visas go unused in a fiscal year, those numbers automatically spill over into the employment-based system. In recent years, family-based visa issuance has consistently fallen short due to consular backlogs and processing delays abroad. Those unused numbers do not vanish; they are redirected. When that happens, EB-2 India—because of the sheer size of its backlog—is often the first category to show visible movement.

Scientists finally reveal what’s inside Charles Darwin’s 200-year-old jars,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/scientists-finally-reveal-whats-inside-charles-darwins-200-year-old-jars/articleshow/128630716.cms,"How Charles Darwin collected specimens and stored them in jars

Looking inside sealed jars

What chemicals preserved which animals

Beyond the liquid

Why it matters now

A quiet breakthrough

For almost two centuries, glass jars holding animals collected by Charles Darwin have remained sealed in museum stores. Any attempt to open them risked evaporation, contamination and irreversible damage to some of the world’s most historically important specimens. As a result, much about their preservation remained uncertain. That has now changed. Scientists from the Natural History Museum, working with researchers at the STFC Central Laser Facility under UK Research and Innovation, have identified the chemical fluids inside Darwin’s jars using a laser-based technique. The breakthrough offers rare insight into early scientific practice and marks a major advance in museum conservation worldwide.The specimens were gathered during Darwin’s journey aboard the HMS Beagle from 1831 to 1836. During the expedition, Darwin collected mammals, reptiles, fish and invertebrates from South America and the Galápagos Islands. Many later entered the collections of the Natural History Museum in London. These samples remain central to the history of biology.“These jars are more than storage,” said Wren Montgomery, a research technician at the museum.“They are records of how science was done and how practices evolved over time.”Darwin collected animals to answer questions, not to fill shelves. He compared species from different regions to understand variation and adaptation. Mammals and reptiles helped him study bone structure and physical form. Fish revealed how bodies adapt to aquatic life.Invertebrates, including jellyfish, offered insight into simple body plans and development. Together, these specimens formed the evidence base that later shaped his theory of natural selection, years before On the Origin of Species appeared in 1859.Researchers analysed 46 historic specimens using Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy, known as SORS. The technique sends laser light through glass and measures how it scatters. That signal reveals the chemical composition of liquids inside sealed containers.Dr Sara Mosca from the STFC Central Laser Facility explained the benefit. “Until now, identifying preservation fluids meant opening jars,” she said. “That risks contamination and chemical change. This method lets us care for fragile specimens while keeping them sealed.”Clear patterns emerged from the analysis.Mammals and reptiles were usually fixed in formalin soon after collection. This stabilised tissue and stopped decay. They were later transferred to ethanol, which is safer for long-term storage.Fish were also mainly stored in ethanol. Many showed signs of earlier formalin use during initial preservation.Invertebrates, including jellyfish and shrimps, showed the greatest variation. Some were preserved in formalin. Others were kept in buffered water-based solutions. Several samples contained glycerol, likely added to prevent shrinking and collapse in soft-bodied animals.The technique fully identified preservation fluids in about 80 per cent of specimens. Another 15 per cent were partially identified.The laser scans also revealed whether containers were glass or plastic. This helped track changes in storage over time and past conservation work.“Knowing both the fluid and the container matters,” Montgomery said. “Some combinations age better than others. This gives us early warning before damage becomes visible.”More than 100 million fluid-preserved specimens are held in museums worldwide. Many lack detailed records. The ability to analyse them without opening containers could transform how collections are monitored and protected.“This is not just about Darwin,” Mosca said. “It gives museums a way to safeguard irreplaceable material for future research.”The study did not uncover new species or hidden biological secrets. Its impact lies in how it protects the past. By confirming exactly how Darwin’s animals were preserved and proving this can be done safely, scientists have set a new standard for conservation.As Montgomery put it, “Understanding what these specimens are stored in helps ensure they survive for the next 200 years.”","Scientists from the Natural History Museum have identified the chemical fluids inside Darwin’s jars using a laser-based technique.

The holy month will run for either 29 or 30 days, depending on the lunar cycle.While residents settle into adjusted working hours and quieter evenings, the calendar is already in focus. The key date is March 18, the 29th day of Ramadan, when official moon-sighting committees will convene to determine whether Shawwal has begun.That decision will shape the length of the Eid Al Fitr holiday.Under the UAE’s official public holiday calendar, Eid Al Fitr is observed from Shawwal 1 to 3. The holiday is non-transferable and applies nationwide.In 2026, Eid is expected to fall between Friday, March 20 and Sunday, March 22. However, the precise start date depends entirely on whether the Shawwal crescent is sighted on March 18.Dubai’s Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department has listed March 20 to March 22 as the expected Eid period for 2026, subject to confirmation.If the crescent is sighted on March 18, Eid Al Fitr will be declared the following day, March 19.In that case, residents would receive a four-day break from March 19 to March 22, with Sunday aligning with the usual weekend in the Emirates.If the moon is not sighted on March 18, Ramadan will complete 30 days and Eid will begin on Friday, March 20. That scenario would result in a three-day break.However, a UAE Cabinet resolution provides that if Ramadan completes 30 days, the 30th day of Ramadan will be treated as an official holiday added to the Eid Al Fitr holiday. This effectively secures a long weekend at the end of the month regardless of whether Ramadan lasts 29 or 30 days.The Hijri calendar is approximately 11 days shorter than the Gregorian calendar. As a result, Islamic months shift earlier each year in relation to the solar calendar.In 2026, that shift places Eid Al Fitr in the third week of March. For now, the focus remains on March 18, when the sighting of a slender crescent will determine how long the UAE pauses at the close of Ramadan.","Eid Al Fitr is observed from Shawwal 1 to 3.

Watch: US releases video of ‘lethal kinetic’ attack on alleged drug traffickers; 3 killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-us-releases-video-of-lethal-kinetic-attack-on-alleged-drug-traffickers-3-killed/articleshow/128631951.cms,"Trump Intensifies Drug War; Lethal Kinetic Strike On 'Narco Boat' In Caribbean; 3 Killed





The US Southern Command has released a video of what it described as a “lethal kinetic” strike on an alleged drug boat in the eastern Pacific as part of Operation Southern Spear. The operation reportedly killed three people.According to news agency AFP, the death toll from such strikes has now risen to 128.Sharing the footage on X, US Southcom confirmed the action, stating, ""On Feb. 20, at the direction of #SOUTHCOM commander Gen. Francis L. Donovan, Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by Designated Terrorist Organisations. Intelligence confirmed the vessel was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations. Three male narco-terrorists were killed during this action. No U.S. military forces were harmed.""However, administration officials have not presented definitive evidence publicly proving that the targeted vessels were engaged in drug trafficking.The lack of transparency has triggered heated debate over the legality of the expanding operations, which have widened from the Caribbean into the Pacific.Last week, relatives of two Trinidadian men killed in a 2025 strike on a boat the US military claimed was carrying drugs filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the US government.It marks the first such legal challenge brought against the Trump administration over its missile strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.The recent action was the second reported US strike on an alleged drug boat in the region since the January 3 capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. Maduro had previously alleged that the US campaign of strikes was aimed at regime change in Venezuela.In another incident late last month, the US military carried out a strike in the eastern Pacific that killed two alleged drug traffickers.Maduro was subsequently taken by US forces to New York, where he pleaded not guilty to drug and weapons charges.","US Southern Command has released a video of what it described as a “lethal kinetic” strike on an alleged drug boat in the eastern Pacific.

"Trump announces new 10% global tariff after Supreme Court ruling: What are Sections 122, 232 and 301? Explained",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-announces-new-10-global-tariff-after-supreme-court-ruling-what-are-sections-122-232-and-301-explained/articleshow/128622162.cms,"‘Historic Embarrassment’ For Trump; US Supreme Court Blocks Global Tariffs In Shock Ruling

What is Section 122?

What is Section 232?

What is Section 301?





US President Donald Trump said he would sign new orders aimed at restoring tariffs using alternative legal authorities after the Supreme Court struck down a large portion of his previous measures.Speaking after the ruling, Trump said he would rely on a set of trade powers known as Section 122 to impose a global 10% tariff across the board. He also said the administration would use another provision, Section 301, to open investigations into what it describes as unfair trade practices, a process that could lead to additional tariffs.“Effective immediately all national security tariffs under Sec 232 & all existing Sec 301 tariffs remain fully in place and in full force and effect. I will sign an order to impose a 10% global tariff under Sec 122 over and above our normal tariffs.""The Supreme Court ruling against Trump’s tariffs created uncertainty for existing trade agreements with countries such as China, Canada and the UK. It may lead to renegotiations or challenges from those nations as they reassess their positions in light of the court’s decision. This could disrupt ongoing trade negotiations and affect international relations, as countries might reconsider their strategies in dealing with the US.Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 allowed a President to impose tariffs of up to 15% to address what the statute describes as “large and serious” balance-of-payments deficits, an issue linked to trade deficits. However, any tariffs introduced under this authority can remain in place for only 150 days unless Congress votes to extend them.At least in the short term, such a move would not differ substantially from the baseline 10% global tariff Trump previously imposed, or the 15% tariff he secured in trade agreements with other countries over the past year.Section 232 comes from the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. It allows tariffs or quotas on imports that threaten national security. Trump invoked Section 232 to impose 25% tariffs on steel and 10% tariffs on aluminum in 2018. These affected Canada, Mexico, the EU, and other countries. The tariffs under Section 232 remain in place after the Supreme Court ruling, as they are separate from emergency powers.Section 301 is part of the Trade Act of 1974. It allows tariffs in response to unfair foreign trade practices. These include intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, or discriminatory measures. Trump applied Section 301 tariffs against China, reaching 25% on hundreds of billions in goods. The goal was to target anticompetitive behavior.","US President Donald Trump said he would sign new orders aimed at restoring tariffs using alternative legal authorities.

Third pole

Faster growth than China

Demographic advantage

Multi-alignment

The Indian diaspora





For years, 21st-century geopolitics has been framed as a heavyweight bout between Washington and Beijing. But what if the most consequential player isn’t in either corner?The world’s fastest-growing major economy — and its most populous nation — isn’t China. It’s India.As other major powers age, India’s greatest export may simply be its people. So what could that mean for the global order?On the podcast “Interesting Times,” host Ross Douthat spoke with international relations scholar Amitav Acharya about demographics, growth and what Acharya calls a “multiplex” world — one shaped by several rising powers, not a single superpower.Here are five takeaways from the NYT conversation on why this could be India’s century:The “third pole” envisions India as an independent center of global power — distinct from both the United States and China.Instead of aligning fully with Washington or Beijing, India would act as its own gravitational force: a top-three economy, a strategic power in the Indian Ocean, a demographic heavyweight and a diplomatic swing state engaging both sides without formal alliances.In Acharya’s “multiplex world order,” power is distributed among several major actors — and India is one of them.Acharya acknowledged that China industrialized and reduced poverty faster.But he cautioned against a short-term lens.In the early post-independence decades, India played a significant role in Asian affairs while China was consolidating Communist rule. Though China later surged ahead, India’s recent growth rates have outpaced China’s — albeit from a lower base.India has also preserved its democratic system. The key challenge now is jobs. If India expands trade access — especially with Europe and the United States — it could combine growth with greater economic resilience.While China faces a collapsing birthrate and rapid aging, India is entering a “demographic dividend” phase — a large working-age population with fewer elderly dependents.Unlike China, India never implemented a one-child policy, leaving it with a younger labor force.But demographics are not destiny. Without job creation, education reform and skill development, the dividend could become a liability. Integration into global supply chains — blending manufacturing with services and technology — will be critical.India’s strategy has evolved from Cold War “non-alignment” to what Acharya calls “multi-alignment.”The goal: avoid overdependence on any single power. India maintains ties with the U.S., engages Russia and deepens trade with the European Union — all while preserving strategic autonomy.This balancing act works so long as major powers tolerate flexibility. It becomes harder if Washington demands countries choose sides.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has turned the Indian diaspora into a diplomatic asset, staging major events in U.S. cities to showcase global influence.Yet American understanding of India still lags behind its focus on China. Indian Americans have risen prominently in tech and politics, but their success — especially in Silicon Valley and through H-1B visas — has triggered backlash amid rising populism.Acharya argues the resentment reflects broader anti-immigrant currents rather than direct job displacement. Politically diverse, parts of the diaspora appear to be trending conservative — in some cases as a path toward assimilation in a polarized America.","The world’s fastest-growing major economy isn’t China.

"'Deeply disappointing,' says Donald Trump on US Supreme Court striking down Tariffs — Top quotes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/deeply-disappointing-says-donald-trump-on-us-supreme-court-striking-down-tariffs-top-quotes/articleshow/128619446.cms,"Trump said, ""The court has been swayed by foreign interests and a political movement far smaller than people would ever think. It is a small movement. I won by millions of votes. We won in a landslide. With all of the cheating that went on.""

Others think being politically correct which has happened before far too often with members of this court. They are just being fools and lapdogs for the RINOS and radical left Democrats. They are very unpatriotic and disloyal to our constitution: Trump

Trump said, ""Effective immediately all national security tariffs under Sec 232 & all existing Sec 301 tariffs remain fully in place and in full force and effect. I will sign an order to impose a 10% global tariff under Sec 122 over and above our normal tariffs.""

Trump said, ""Although I firmly disagree with the court's holding today, the decision might not substantially constrain a president's ability to order tariffs going forward."" ""That's because numerous other federal statutes, which is so true, authorize the president to impose tariffs and might justify most, if not all, of the tariffs issued in this case. Even more tariffs.""

""You gotta do what's right for the Constitution. That's why I respect, so much, Justices Thomas, and Alito, Kavanaugh — because they not only dissented, their dissent is so strong... as Justice Kavanaugh said... you have other ways you can go.""

""I've been waiting for this decision so long... We waited months, and that gave uncertainty. Now, we have certainty — and I think you're going to see the country get much stronger because of it,"" Trump said.







US President Donald Trump on Friday called the Supreme Court’s ruling on tariffs ""deeply disappointing"" and said that he is ashamed of certain members of the Court for not having the courage to do what’s right for our country.The US Supreme Court on Friday deemed Trump’s reciprocal tariffs as ‘illegal’, a move that is a big blow to the American President’s trade war. The ruling invalidates country-specific “reciprocal tariffs” and fentanyl-linked duties imposed on imports from major trading partners.Furious with Court's decision, Trump said that the foreign countries that have been ripping the US off for years are ecstatic. ""They're so happy. And they're dancing in the streets, but they won't be dancing for long. That I can assure you. The Democrats on the court are thrilled, but they will automatically vote no. They're an automatic no, just like in Congress. They're an automatic no. They're against anything that makes America strong, healthy, and great again,"" Trump said.Here are the top quotes:",The US Supreme Court on Friday deemed Trump’s reciprocal tariffs as ‘illegal’.

Pakistan says Imran Khan rejected 'serious deals' twice for release from jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-says-imran-khan-rejected-serious-deals-twice-for-release-from-jail/articleshow/128592292.cms,"Pakistan former PM Imran Khan





Pakistan’s jailed former prime minister Imran Khan twice turned down ""serious"" deals for release, a top aide to PM Shehbaz Sharif said, as tensions simmer over his health crisis.Adviser to the prime minister on political affairs Rana Sanaullah disclosed during a talk show on Wednesday that “two serious attempts were made to cut a deal with Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan in the past, but they failed.”“The first attempt was led by Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and then-Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Ali Amin Gandapur before November 26, 2024, and the second was made by a few people from abroad in the recent past. Imran Khan initially agreed but later backed out of the deal,” Sanaullah said, as quoted by news agency PTI.“We want a political solution to this problem, but Khan is not willing to find a way out,” he added.Sanaullah, a close aide to Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) head Nawaz Sharif, further said Khan wants the incumbent government to be packed and he comes to power.The claims were immediately met with a fierce rebuttal. Federal Minister Attaullah Tarar in a post on X on Thursday called any claim of leniency “entirely false.”""There is neither any deal nor any leniency being offered to Imran Khan. Any impression of the government granting relaxation to Imran Khan is entirely false. Imran Khan is a convicted criminal,” said Tarar.Imran Khan has been offered eye treatment at Shifa Hospital in Islamabad as his family and party raised concerns about his health in prison.Khan's lawyer, Salman Safdar, told the Supreme Court last week that the 73-year-old former premier had lost 85 per cent of vision in his right eye in jail.Later, Khan's sister Noreen Khan said, ""Imran Khan is enduring unimaginable mistreatment in prison under the directives of Field Marshal Gen Asim Munir as the country is under illegitimate and un-Islamic rule.""The cricketer-turned-politician has been in jail since August 2023 in multiple cases.","Pakistan's jailed former PM Imran Khan twice turned down ""serious"" deals for release, a top aide to PM Shehbaz Sharif said.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) reportedly released a video purportedly showing Pakistani Army personnel in its custody, as a self-declared deadline for a proposed prisoner exchange continues to run.In the footage circulated on social media, shared by region's independent online news portal Balochistan Post, citing the group’s official channel Hakkal, several men appear on camera displaying what they say are official service cards and national identity documents. The individuals, identified by the BLA as detained servicemen, are heard appealing to Pakistani authorities. They claim that they were formally recruited, issued official documentation, and assigned postings, while questioning why authorities are allegedly refusing to acknowledge them.In the video, a soldier can be seen pleading to the Pakistan Army for help. ""How can the army say that we are not their personnel? Whose card is this [showing supposed identitiy card]?It's the Army's right? Look at my identity card, Pakistan also issued this to me,"" a soldier can be heard saying. Continuing his pleas, he addes, ""I request for God's sake, my father is disabled and I am the eldest at home.

At least 16 people, including women and children, were killed and 14 others injured after a gas explosion caused a partial collapse of a residential building in Karachi’s Soldier Bazaar area, Dawn reported on Thursday.The blast occurred around 4.15 am during Sehri at a residence in Gul Rana Colony, according to assistant superintendent of police (ASP) Jamshed Asher. He said the explosion took place on the building’s first floor. The injured and the deceased were shifted to Civil Hospital.Rescue authorities later confirmed that the death toll had risen to 16.Rescue chief operating officer Dr Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh told the media that a gas explosion led to the structure’s partial collapse. He said the ground-plus-two-storey structure comprised small, individual rooms, which made rescue efforts difficult.“This is not a legal building, and the structure is made of individual rooms,” he said, adding that nearby structures were also damaged.According to a list issued by Rescue 1122, the deceased included eight minors, four women and four men, aged between two and 60 years. Among the injured were seven minors.Search and rescue operations were ongoing, with an urban search and rescue team and a disaster response vehicle deployed at the site.A district east police spokesperson said law enforcement personnel cordoned off the area soon after the incident was reported. “Police cordoned off the area and tightened security, while rescue agencies initiated a search and rescue operation,” the spokesperson said.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah, taking notice of the incident, expressed grief over the loss of lives.He directed authorities to “immediately rescue people trapped under the debris” and ensure the “best possible” medical treatment for the injured. He also ordered support for affected families and asked the Karachi commissioner to investigate the cause.Building collapses remain frequent in Karachi, home to over 20 million people, amid concerns over unsafe construction, illegal structures and ageing infrastructure. In July 2025, at least 27 people were killed when a five-storey building collapsed in Lyari. Authorities had earlier declared the structure uninhabitable.

Pakistan Army Chief Asim Munir was briefly stopped and asked to produce his identity card by security staff at the Munich Security Conference in Germany.A video that went viral on social media showed a security officer asking the Pakistani army chief to keep his identity card visible. Just steps away from the conference entry, a security official is heard saying, “Stop… where is your ID? Please flip your ID card. ”The Munich Security Conference, widely regarded as a key platform for dialogue and conflict resolution, annually brings together world leaders, diplomats, and security experts to address international peace and security challenges.Meanwhile, Munir’s visit was also objected to by Germany-based Sindhi political organisation Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), which called the invitation “deeply regrettable.” Members of the JSMM protested outside the venue, highlighting alleged human rights violations in Pakistan.In a formal statement addressed to the United Nations, the European Union, the German government, and international human rights bodies, JSMM Chairman Shafi Burfat expressed what he described as “deep shock and regret” over Munir’s presence at the high-level global forum.JSMM alleged that Pakistan’s military establishment has a historical record of human rights violations and political interference.The group referred to the 1971 events in former East Pakistan that led to the creation of Bangladesh, describing them as genocide. It also accused Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies of supporting extremist elements in the region — allegations that Islamabad has consistently denied.The organisation further claimed that Pakistan’s military wields disproportionate influence over the country’s political and judicial institutions. It cited the assassinations of former leaders, including Liaquat Ali Khan and Benazir Bhutto, as well as the execution of former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, as examples of alleged instability linked to military dominance. It also referenced the imprisonment of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, attributing it to tensions with the current military leadership.",Pakistan Army Chief Asim Munir was briefly stopped and asked to produce his identity card by security staff at the Munich Security Conference in Germany.

'Imran Khan’s Health Stable, But Facing Mental Torture', Claims Sister After Jail Visit





PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan underwent an eye examination at Adiala Jail on Sunday following a Supreme Court order, with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) calling the process as “malicious” and questioning the exclusion of his family and personal doctors.According to news website Dawn, a five-member medical team conducted a detailed examination that lasted about an hour. The doctors collected blood samples, measured his blood pressure and brought their own equipment. The process reportedly began after a two-and-a-half-hour wait and a report is expected to be compiled soon.Shortly after the examination ended around 5.30 pm, PTI issued a statement on X rejecting the procedure and objecting to the absence of Imran’s family and personal physicians.“Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf categorically rejects the recent conduct of the government and jail administration regarding the medical examination of former prime minister Imran Khan's eye in Adiala Jail. The government's claim that a message was sent to the party leadership to arrive at the jail at the time of the examination is, in fact, a crude attempt to divert attention from the core issue,” the party said.Explaining its objection, the statement added, “This matter was never about the presence or absence of the party leadership.In such sensitive and delicate medical matters, the constitutional, moral, and legal right to make decisions belongs to Imran Khan's family. The family cannot make an informed decision until Imran Khan's personal doctors are present for the examination. Therefore, inviting the party leadership symbolically has neither any moral rationale nor any legal justification. ”Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum also said that no medical board would be accepted without the approval of his personal doctors.Referring to reports that he might be shifted to Al-Shifa Eye Hospital in Rawalpindi, she reiterated, “Our demand has been clear from the beginning. Imran Khan shall not be given any treatment without the presence and approval of his personal doctors and family members.”She further said, “We do not accept any medical board they set up and control! We do not accept any reports or results they manufacture.”Questioning the exclusion of family members and doctors recommended by Imran’s team, she asked, “Why are they rejecting the supervision by Imran Khan's personal doctors? Why are they rejecting the presence of Imran Khan's family members? Why such fierce resistance? Are they hiding something?”The examination was carried out after the Supreme Court directed the formation of a medical board to assess Imran’s condition. The order followed his claim on February 12 that his right eye retained only 15 per cent vision. The court also allowed him to speak with his children before February 16.Although government officials had indicated on Saturday that Imran might be transferred to a hospital, no shift had taken place by Sunday afternoon. At 3.45 pm, his sister Noreen Khanum said that an ambulance had arrived at the jail to move him.“But, this is unacceptable to us without us and Khan sahib's personal doctors being taken into confidence,” she said.The jail superintendent dismissed reports of a transfer as a “rumour” and clarified that only a medical examination was underway.“The medical team will examine Imran's eyes, conduct different tests, and decide whether there is a requirement to move him to a hospital or if he can be retained in jail and continue the treatment here,” the superintendent said.Imran had earlier undergone a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad on the night of January 24, a development that was confirmed later amid limited information shared with his family.Imran’s personal physicians, Aasim Yusuf and Faisal Sultan, also called for a comprehensive evaluation at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad, news agnecy PTI reported citing Dawn.In a joint video statement they said, “In addition to urgent retina specialist care for his central retinal vein occlusion and severe vision loss, Imran Khan needs a full multidisciplinary evaluation of his underlying conditions at a tertiary hospital like Shifa International Islamabad.”Meanwhile, the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) alliance continued its sit-in at Parliament House for the third day, demanding that Imran be treated at a hospital chosen by his personal doctors.PTI MNA Asad Qaiser told reporters, “We will not compromise on Imran's health.”A TTAP leader said that the initial understanding to shift Imran to Shifa International collapsed due to demands to change the composition of the medical board. The alliance also alleged that access to food, water and medicines inside Parliament House had been blocked for the third day.Describing the reported denial of medicine to Senator Abbas as an “extreme and condemnable act,” the alliance said, “Prioritising any political disagreement over human compassion and medical needs is the worst form of oppression.”Vowing to continue the protest, TTAP stated, “History bears witness that tyrannical tricks, sieges, and oppression have never suppressed movements, nor forced those standing firm on the right side to back down from their demands.”The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan expressed grave concern over the health of PTI-affiliated prisoners, particularly Imran Khan and Yasmin Rashid and urged authorities to ensure immediate independent medical examinations and uninterrupted access to treatment.",Imran Khan underwent an eye examination at Adiala Jail on Sunday following a Supreme Court order.

Baloch Leader Akhtar Mengal Stuns Pakistan, Says Balochistan's 'Separation Is The Only Option Now'





The recent disappearances of several people in Balochistan have been linked to Pakistan’s security apparatus, sparking fear and anxiety among families.At least seven individuals are reported missing in incidents connected to Panjgur and Karachi.Residents of Pulabad, a locality in Panjgur, described a recent raid where armed personnel searched homes and detained at least six people. Witnesses said those taken were transported to unknown locations. Locals mentioned two names, Inayat and Rasheed, while the identities of the other detainees could not be independently confirmed, reported ANI citing The Balochistan Post.In a separate case, 23-year-old Zulfiqar, son of Hameed and a resident of Tasp, was reportedly seized from a marketplace on February 13, 2026. Locals alleged that men linked to a state-backed armed faction, commonly described as a “death squad,” carried out the detention. Family members have not received any information regarding his condition since the incident.Another case raising alarm involves Zakir Noor, a student from Panjgur, who was allegedly detained in Karachi on December 30, 2025.The Baloch rights organisation Paank said he was taken by security personnel without legal documentation.Noor has not contacted his family since, fueling fears he may have been transferred to an undisclosed detention site.Paank said secret confinement places detainees at serious risk and violates international safeguards against arbitrary arrest. Activists added that the pattern disproportionately affects students and young men, especially those who migrate to major cities for education or work.","At least seven individuals are reported missing in incidents connected to Panjgur and Karachi.

Imran Khan’s Family Stages Prayer Protest After Being Barred From Meeting Him At Adiala Jail

'We were not consulted': Imran Khan’s sister

(With AP inputs)





Pakistan’s information minister Ataullah Tarar on Saturday announced that imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan will undergo treatment for an eye condition at a specialised medical facility, days after the Supreme Court ordered a medical evaluation amid growing concerns about the cricketer-turned-politician’s eyesight.Tarar wrote on X that an examination would be conducted by leading eye specialists as part of Khan’s ongoing treatment, which began in late January after the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder-chairman claimed ""partial loss of vision"" in his right eye.The minister, however, did not specify the medical facility or the date of treatment and urged the public to avoid speculation.“A detailed report will also be submitted to the Supreme Court. Conjecture, speculations, and efforts to turn this into political rhetoric and mileage for vested interests may please be avoided,” Tarar posted.Earlier this week, Khan’s lawyer and PTI member Salman Safdar told the Supreme Court that the ex-premier had lost roughly 85% of vision in his right eye. The court subsequently directed authorities to arrange a medical assessment by a panel of doctors and facilitate a telephone call between Khan and his two UK-based sons before February 16.PTI supporters have staged protests in the capital, Islamabad, and other cities, demanding that their party chief be shifted from prison to a hospital for specialised treatment. Some lawmakers from PTI and its allies are also staging a sit-in outside Parliament.Meanwhile, Khan’s sister Aleema Khan reacted angrily to Tarar's announcement, saying the family had not been consulted and demanding that family members and his personal physician be present during any future procedures.She confirmed that, following the Supreme Court’s directive, authorities had arranged a call between her brother and his two sons, who live with their mother and his former wife, British screenwriter and producer Jemima Goldsmith.Khan was removed from office in a parliamentary no-confidence vote in April 2022. He has alleged that his ouster was the result of a US-backed “conspiracy” involving political rivals and Pakistan’s then army chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa — allegations denied by Washington, Pakistan’s military, and Khan’s political opponents.The issue of Khan’s partial vision surfaced in late January when the federal government said the former prime minister had undergone a medical procedure for an eye condition and was in ""good health.""The PTI made a strong showing in the February 2024 parliamentary elections but did not secure a majority in the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament. The party alleged the vote was “rigged,” a claim the government has denied.","Pakistan’s information minister Ataullah Tarar on Saturday announced that imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan will undergo treatment for an eye condition.

Imran Khan’s Family Stages Prayer Protest After Being Barred From Meeting Him At Adiala Jail





The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Thursday directed authorities to constitute a medical board to assess the health of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan after reports surfaced about a loss of vision in one of his eyes.A bench comprising Chief Justice Yahya Afridi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan also instructed officials to facilitate communication between Khan and his two sons, who live in the United Kingdom with his former wife, British producer and screenwriter Jemima Goldsmith.“The issue of Imran’s health is most important. Intervention is necessary. His phone calls with his son are also important,” Chief Justice Afridi said during the hearing.The order came after the bench resumed hearing a case about the jail conditions of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder-president and ordered a detailed medical check-up before February 16. During the hearing, Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan said it was the state’s responsibility to provide the former prime minister with medical care.The order also came two days after the court asked PTI leader and lawyer Salman Safdar to meet Khan at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where the cricketer-turned-politician has been held since August 5, 2023, following his conviction in a corruption case.Safdar later submitted his report to the court after meeting Khan. It was the first meeting with the jailed leader since December 2, when his sister, Uzma Khan, was allowed to see him for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, Dawn newspaper, citing the report, noted that it detailed Safdar’s meeting with Khan, the condition of his cell, the facilities provided to him, a description of his living area and the process the lawyer followed to reach the jail.In the report, Safdar quoted Khan as stating that despite receiving treatment, including an injection, he has only 15% vision left in his right eye.Khan reportedly told Safdar that until October 2025, he had normal vision in both eyes. He later began experiencing constant blurred and hazy vision, which he repeatedly reported to the then jail superintendent, but no action was taken.The report added that Khan eventually suffered a sudden and complete loss of vision in his right eye. An eye specialist from Pims Hospital, Dr Muhammad Arif, was then called to examine him.He was diagnosed with a blood clot that caused serious damage. Despite treatment, including an injection, his vision in the right eye remains at only 15 per cent.A day earlier, Safdar denied making any statement about Khan’s health on Tuesday, clarifying that anything attributed to him on the matter had been misrepresented or misreported.However, on the day he met Khan, Safdar told reporters that the jailed leader was “fine and healthy.”","The Supreme Court of Pakistan has ordered a medical board to assess the health of Imran Khan.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has delivered a scathing assessment of his country’s past alliances with Washington, telling the National Assembly that Islamabad had been “used like toilet paper and then discarded” after serving American interests in Afghanistan.Speaking during a debate on terrorism following a deadly suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Islamabad, Asif said Pakistan had repeatedly joined “superpower wars” that were never its own.“We took part in two wars that were fought on the soil of Afghanistan,” Asif told lawmakers. Referring to the Soviet intervention in 1979, he claimed it was carried out “at the invitation of the government in Kabul” and that the narrative of an outright invasion was shaped by the United States.Pakistan, he said, entered those conflicts “in the name of Islam and religion”, but in reality two former military dictators sought legitimacy and the backing of a global power.“These were not our wars; they were superpower wars,” he said, adding that Pakistan and its land were used and then discarded ""like toilet paper.""Asif went on to describe terrorism in Pakistan as the “blowback of mistakes committed by dictators in the past”.He added that Pakistan had failed to learn from history, continuing to shift between Washington, Moscow and London in pursuit of short-term interests.""For our own interests, we sometimes turn to Washington, sometimes to Moscow, and sometimes to Britain. We have built strong franchises here, which was not the case 30 or 40 years ago,"" Asif said.Recalling then US President Bill Clinton’s brief stop in Islamabad in 2000, a visit lasting only a few hours at the end of a longer India trip, Asif said it underscored how transactional the relationship had become. Clinton’s engagement with then military ruler Pervez Musharraf was framed by US demands on democracy, non-proliferation and militancy, reinforcing.Asif’s remarks came as parliament passed a resolution condemning the attack on Imambargah Qasr-e-Khadijatul Kubra in Islamabad’s Tarlai area, where a suicide bomber killed 31 people and wounded 169 during Friday prayers. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. Thousands attended funerals across the capital as grieving families demanded accountability. “What happened yesterday has left us extremely angry and deeply hurt,” said Bushra Rahmani, whose brother was among the wounded.The minister urged political unity, lamenting what he called a lack of consensus even in condemning terrorism. “It is very important that we have a national identity on which no one disagrees,” he said, criticising those who, for political reasons, avoided attending the funerals of victims.","Defence minister Khawaja Asif criticises Pakistan's past alliances with the U.S. and Russia.

Backdrop of deadly Islamabad attack





Pakistan’s Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday launched a sharp attack on Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy, questioning how extremist elements continue to cross the border even as trade remains blocked.Speaking at a public gathering in Rawalpindi, Rehman highlighted what he described as a glaring contradiction in Islamabad’s approach towards Afghanistan. “In all these decades, we never paused to ask why our Afghan policy failed so miserably. Not a single pomegranate or melon can enter Pakistan, yet terrorists keep crossing the border,” he said, smiling as he made the remark.Referring to repeated claims by Pakistani authorities that militants were entering from Afghanistan, Rehman added, “Authorities say terrorists are coming from there. If they are coming, stop them. If they are coming, eliminate them. The Afghan government has never objected to your actions.”The JUI-F leader also criticised Pakistan’s broader foreign and economic policies, calling them “complete failures”. He said Islamabad’s diplomatic approach had left the country increasingly isolated.“India is our enemy, Afghanistan is our enemy, and even Iran and China are upset with us,” Rehman said, adding that the public deserved answers.“A nation cannot survive when its policies produce only isolation, mistrust and insecurity.”He argued that Pakistan’s foreign policy was being driven not by elected governments but by the military establishment. “One general comes and says we will negotiate; another comes and says we will wage war,” he said.Rehman also took aim at the government’s handling of the China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC), claiming that the flagship infrastructure project had stalled due to declining Chinese confidence.“CPEC has seen no real progress during this tenure because China no longer trusts us,” he said, questioning whether “even a single brick” had moved under the current government. He claimed Beijing had expected the Pakistan democratic movement (PDM) government to stabilise relations and revive projects, but remained dissatisfied.Rehman’s remarks come amid heightened tensions following a suicide bombing at a mosque in Islamabad on Friday that killed 69 people and injured more than 170, according to local media reports citing hospital officials. The blast occurred during Friday prayers at Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra in the Tarlai area, Dawn reported.After Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif suggested on X that preliminary findings pointed to the attacker having travelled to and from Afghanistan, Kabul rejected the allegation. Afghanistan’s ministry of national defence termed the claim “irresponsible and baseless” and urged Pakistani authorities to take responsibility for internal security lapses, Afghan media outlet Ariana News reported.The Afghan ministry said similar accusations had been made in the past following attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, without conclusive evidence.","Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman criticises Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy.

Nitai Roy Chowdhury: Committed to minority safety and cordial relations with India: Bangladesh lone Hindu minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/committed-to-minority-safety-bangladesh-hindu-min/articleshow/128587310.cms,"Bangladesh PM Tarique Rahman Makes BIG Promise To Hindus As India Detains Hindu Cop Killer In Delhi

Most political parties now realise importance of Hindus in Bangladesh’s electoral politics: Culture minister





Nitai Roy Chowdhury, 77, lone Hindu minister in PM Tarique Rahman-led govt and vice-chairman of Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s central committee, said the administration was committed to ensuring the safety of all minorities and restoring cordial relations with India, asserting that fundamentalism would not be allowed to spread in Bangladesh.Chowdhury spoke to TOI in an exclusive interview over the phone after taking oath as culture minister along with 48 other members, including state ministers, in the cabinet headed by Rahman. He was also among the only four candidates from minority communities, all from BNP, who won in the Feb 12 elections.Among the 25 newly elected members of the National Parliament from BNP who took oath as ministers alongside the newly sworn-in PM, Chowdhury won from Magura-2 constituency.He received over 1.4 lakh votes, defeating Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami’s Mustarshid Billah, who secured about 1.2 lakh votes. Referring to the state of governance he inherited, Chowdhury said the previous government led by Sheikh Hasina had left the country’s institutions in tatters.“Almost everything was in disorder,” he said, adding that after being elected to form the new govt, it was their duty to bring the country back on track.He said the BNP did not want to indulge in criticism of the past but aimed to move forward with new hopes and dreams to put Bangladesh on the path of development.Explaining what he meant by institutional damage, Chowdhury alleged that when Hasina fled Bangladesh in 2024, the country was “completely broken”. He claimed the biggest damage was done to the education system, alleging that it had become policy under Awami League to pass 98% of students in exams irrespective of merit. “It was done to falsely show that literacy rate of Bangladesh was increasing along with the passing percentage of students,” he said.He also accused the previous regime of damaging the country’s cultural fabric. During the Awami League govt, he said, “all sorts of obscene dance and music along with hooliganism were encouraged while pushing our actual cultural values on the backburner.” He said the new govt would work to repair these pillars while upholding the ethos of unity in diversity, which he claimed had been ruined.On apprehensions regarding the safety of minorities, particularly Hindus, Chowdhury pointed to what he described as a significant turnout of Hindu voters in the recent elections. He said such turnout was not witnessed in other communities and reflected a shift in political thinking.“Hindus realised that they cannot be treated as mere vote-bank by any party in Bangladesh. They felt that they are an inseparable part of this Bangladesh,” Chowdhury said.He said the PM and other BNP leaders met Hindu voters before the elections to assure them of safety and security. “They realised that they too are independent citizens of this country with equal rights to life and livelihood as mentioned in our constitution. Hence, they voted in large numbers for the BNP, for which we are grateful,” he said.Chowdhury said most political parties had now realised the importance of Hindus in electoral politics, noting that their support was crucial in at least 80 of the total 297 constituencies in parliament.

""No Control Over Minority Violence In Bangladesh..."": Former Indian Envoy Slams Yunus Govt





Nitai Roy Chowdhury, 77, lone Hindu minister in PM Tarique Rahman-led govt and vice-chairman of Bangladesh Nationalist Party's central committee, said the administration was committed to ensuring the safety of all minorities and restoring cordial relations with India, asserting that fundamentalism would not be allowed to spread in Bangladesh.Chowdhury spoke to TOI in an exclusive interview over phone after taking oath as culture minister along with 48 other members, including state ministers, in the cabinet headed by Rahman.Among the 25 newly elected members of National Parliament from BNP who took oath as ministers alongside the newly sworn-in PM, Chowdhury won from Magura-2 constituency.He received over 1.4 lakh votes, defeating Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami's Mustarshid Billah, who secured about 1.2 lakh votes. Referring to the state of governance he inherited, Chowdhury said the previous govt led by Sheikh Hasina had left the country's institutions in tatters.""Almost everything was in disorder,"" he said, adding that after being elected to form the new govt, it was their duty to bring the country back on track. He said the BNP did not want to indulge in criticism of the past but aimed to move forward with new hopes and dreams to put Bangladesh on the path of development.Explaining what he meant by institutional damage, Chowdhury alleged that when Hasina fled Bangladesh in 2024, the country was ""completely broken"". He claimed the biggest damage was done to the education system, alleging that it had become policy under Awami League to pass 98% of students in exams irrespective of merit. ""It was done to falsely show that literacy rate of Bangladesh was increasing along with the passing percentage of students,"" he said.He also accused the previous regime of damaging the country's cultural fabric. During the Awami League govt, he said, ""all sorts of obscene dance and music along with hooliganism were encouraged while pushing our actual cultural values on the backburner."" He said the new govt would work to repair these pillars while upholding the ethos of unity in diversity, which he claimed had been ruined.On apprehensions regarding the safety of minorities, particularly Hindus, Chowdhury pointed to what he described as a significant turnout of Hindu voters in the recent elections. He said such turnout was not witnessed in other communities and reflected a shift in political thinking.""Hindus realised that they cannot be treated as mere vote-bank by any party in Bangladesh. They felt that they are an inseparable part of this Bangladesh,"" Chowdhury said.He said the PM and other BNP leaders met Hindu voters before the elections to assure them of safety and security. ""They realised that they too are independent citizens of this country with equal rights to life and livelihood as mentioned in our constitution. Hence, they voted in large numbers for the BNP, for which we are grateful,"" he said.Chowdhury said most political parties had now realised the importance of Hindus in electoral politics, noting that their support was crucial in at least 80 of the total 297 constituencies in parliament. He said that earlier the majority of Hindu voters had supported Awami League, but after its leaders fled, many felt insecure. He credited Rahman with working to remove that fear and win their support.On ties with India, Chowdhury said it was the new administration's duty to develop good relations with all neighbours, including India. ""We want to have ties which have mutual respect, interest, and understanding,"" he said. ""We will work on issues related to internal security of both Bangladesh and India,"" he added.As culture minister, Chowdhury said Bengali culture was rich and that Bangladesh had cultural ties with at least 48 countries, including India.

'Bad Neighbours Who Persist With Terror': Jaishankar Warns Pakistan, Hopes Improved Bangladesh Ties





Bangladesh will seek respectful, mutually beneficial relations with all nations, particularly its neighbours, grounded in sovereign equality and shared interests, the new Tarique Rahman-led BNP govt said Wednesday, indicating its intention for a reassessment of Bangladesh-India relations, strained during the 18-month tenure of the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt.Newly appointed foreign minister Khalilur Rahman announced that “Bangladesh First” would serve as the central organising principle of the country’s foreign policy. Under this framework, he said, “we aim at maintaining good relations with all countries, especially our neighbours, based on respect and mutual benefit.” “There will be comprehensive reassessment of Bangladesh’s external engagement, anchored in sovereign equality, non-interference in internal affairs, national dignity and honour, and reciprocity,” he told reporters.“The govt’s commitment is to a balanced and pragmatic engagement and where complexities or stagnation exist, efforts will continue to resolve obstacles and normalise ties,” Khalilur said — as the BNP has already indicated that though the new govt will not stop seeking former PM Sheikh Hasina’s extradition from New Delhi, the “issue” will not be a roadblock. “Our foreign policy will be guided exclusively by national interest,” he added.“It will not be shaped by partisan considerations.”“Foreign policy is a very serious matter,” Khalilur said, adding that “the goal is to build a foreign policy that reflects the will and aspirations of the people of Bangladesh and pledges a strategy rooted in national interest and constructive global engagement”.Meanwhile, home minister Salahuddin Ahmed, after the first meeting of the Tarique-led cabinet, said the days of “mob culture is over” in Bangladesh. Ahmed said, “Mob culture is over in Bangladesh. Mob culture cannot be encouraged in any way.” He said there will be demands but those demands must be raised through proper processes and forums. Democratic culture will continue, the minister said.","Newly appointed foreign minister Khalilur Rahman announced that “Bangladesh First’ would serve as the central organising principle of the country’s foreign policy. “Our foreign policy will be guided exclusively by national interest,” he added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128535347,imgsize-645715,width-400,resizemode-4/128535347.jpg"

He, however, at the beginning of his speech said that “in a Bangladesh freed from subservience, a new govt accountable to the people through their votes has begun its journey”.Earlier on Wednesday, Tarique chaired the first meeting of the cabinet, which set a 180day priority plan, a departure from the norm of 100-day plans, with focus on controlling commodity prices, maintaining law and order, stabilising supply chains, and ensuring uninterrupted gas and electricity supply, home minister Salahuddin Ahmed was quoted as saying by the Daily Star newspaper.","Tarique Rahman outlined his govt’s priorities, stressing on improving the law and order situation and turning the country into a safe land for people of all faiths, regardless of party, opinion, religion, or ethnicity.

Sri Lankan legislators overwhelmingly voted on Tuesday to scrap their pensions, in a bid to fulfil a key pre-election campaign promise by the ruling Left-leaning govt following anger over the country's economic crisis. Lawmakers passed the bill on Tuesday by 154 votes in the 225-member House, with only two against. The remaining legislators were not present during the vote.In Sri Lanka, a lawmaker was previously entitled to a pension after serving a five-year term. The new law stops payments to anyone who already receives, or qualifies for, the pension. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake , voted into office in 2024, pledged to end the practice during his election campaign.In a similar move, Dissanayake's govt abolished perks provided to former presidents in Sept in response to popular demand. Those included state funding for housing, allowances, pensions, and transport. An office and a staff for former presidents and their widows were also scrapped. There are currently five living past presidents and a widow.","Lawmakers passed the bill on Tuesday by 154 votes in the 225-member House, with only two against.

Bangladesh at a historic crossroads





Bangladesh’s decades-long “battle of begums” era has ended, and a new power centre has emerged in Dhaka. With Sheikh Hasina in exile and Khaleda Zia no more, the country is witnessing a political shift that would have seemed improbable even two years ago. After decades of dominance by its two most powerful women leaders, Bangladesh has now democratically elevated a man to its top office: BNP scion Tarique Rahman, marking the beginning of a new chapter in the nation’s politics.Tarique Rahman took oath on Tuesday, becoming Bangladesh’s first male Prime Minister in 35 years.Both towering figures of Bangladesh’s political landscape remained absent from this election, with Hasina’s Awami League not even participating in the general polls. For over three decades, the country’s politics revolved around the “battle of begums” -- a rivalry that shaped elections, governance, and Bangladesh’s foreign policy trajectory.Hasina now lives in exile in India after being forced from power by a mass uprising, while Zia’s death following prolonged illness has brought a definitive end to one of South Asia’s most enduring political rivalries.Into this historic vacuum has stepped Tarique Rahman, son of Khaleda Zia and heir to one of Bangladesh’s most influential political dynasties.His return from exile after 17 years, followed by a sweeping electoral victory, has reshaped Bangladesh’s political order, marking the end of the “battle of begums” and the emergence of a new centre of power.Rahman’s ascent is more than a political comeback. It marks a generational shift, the end of a decades-long political order, and the beginning of a new phase in Bangladesh’s leadership under a figure who has moved from exile to elected power.The longstanding rivalry between Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, two leaders whose personal histories were closely intertwined with Bangladesh’s founding and political evolution.Sheikh Hasina, daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s founding father, dominated Bangladesh’s political landscape for much of the past two decades. Her tenure transformed Bangladesh economically and strengthened its global standing. However, in her later years, her leadership drew criticism for being increasingly autocratic, suppressing opposition, weakening democratic institutions, and concentrating power.Her rival, Khaleda Zia, widow of former president Ziaur Rahman and leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), represented the principal alternative political force. She became Bangladesh’s first female prime minister in 1991 and led governments in 1991, 1996, and 2001. Her political strength ensured that Bangladesh remained defined by a bipolar political system.The ""battle of begums"" became the central narrative of Bangladesh’s political life.That era ended abruptly in August 2024.A massive youth-led uprising swept across Bangladesh, driven by frustration over unemployment, economic inequality, and political repression. Tens of thousands of young Bangladeshis poured into the streets, demanding systemic change and accountability. The protests intensified rapidly, spreading from university campuses to cities, highways, and government institutions to ultimately Hasina's official palace in Dhaka.The wave of unrest grew so strong that protesters surrounded and stormed Hasina’s residence, leaving her with no option but to flee the country to avoid the fate her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and his family faced in 1975, when they were killed during a violent uprising.As unrest spiralled, Hasina’s hold on power collapsed. Facing mounting pressure, she fled and took refuge in India, ending her uninterrupted 15-year rule in dramatic fashion.Her departure created an unprecedented political vacuum.Khaleda Zia, once her fiercest rival, was no longer able to step into that space. Years of illness had weakened her physically, even as her symbolic political influence endured. Within days of her son Tarique Rahman’s return to Bangladesh, she died, marking the definitive end of an era defined by her rivalry with Hasina.The “battle of begums,” which had dominated Bangladesh’s political narrative for decades, ended not with an electoral defeat, but with exile and death.Until recently, Tarique Rahman’s political comeback did not seem foreseeable.Once a controversial and polarising political figure, Rahman went into exile in London in 2008 amid corruption charges and political pressure. For nearly two decades, he remained physically absent from Bangladesh’s political stage.Not even two months after returning from his self-imposed exile of 17 long years, Rahman rose rapidly to prominence.London-return Tarique Rahman landed in country with celebration scenes, boarding a bulletproof bus, painted in the red and green, theme colours of Bangladesh national flag. Dhaka crowd erupted to give him a massive welcome. The crowd welcoming Rahman was as massive as the July–August 2024 protests against Hasina, but the atmosphere was entirely different.In his first public address that same day, which was also Christmas, he drew inspiration from American civil rights veteran Martin Luther King, turning the phrase ""I have a dream"" into""Today, the people of Bangladesh want to regain their right to speak. They want to regain their right to democracy,"" he said in first address.He also struck a reassuring and secular tone in a country shaken by communal tensions, outlining BNP’s inclusive vision ahead of the elections. Rahman stressed on the values of unity and also safety for all citizens of the country.His message was clear: he was positioning himself not merely as a dynastic successor, but as a national leader capable of restoring democratic legitimacy and unity.The strategy resonated with voters.The BNP secured a landslide victory, winning nearly two-thirds of parliamentary seats, restoring the party to power and elevating Rahman to the position of prime minister.Rahman was struck by a personal tragedy as Khaleda Zia died after a prolonged illness in December.Her death marked not only the loss of a mother but the passing of one of Bangladesh’s most influential political figures and first lady PM.Rahman inherited not only leadership of the BNP but also a powerful political legacy shaped by struggle, violence, and sacrifice.His father, President Ziaur Rahman, who founded the BNP in 1978, had been assassinated in a military coup in 1981 when Tarique was a teenager.Despite years of exile, political isolation and legal battles, Rahman’s return signified both his resilience and his determination to reclaim political relevance.He dedicated his victory to the people.“Our paths and opinions may differ, but in the interest of the country, we must remain united,” he said in his first speech since the election. “I firmly believe that national unity is a collective strength, while division is a weakness.”The recently held polls in Bangladesh were different in many ways, as for the first time voters were asked to cast ballots twice, once to choose their next Prime Minister and again to give their consent to the “July Charter”, which seeks to overhaul the nation’s governance structure.The referendum was conducted across all 64 districts under tight security and international observation.The referendum count suggested a commanding “Yes” vote, with most constituencies reporting strong backing from both urban and rural regions, as most major parties, even those with minor disagreements over details, campaigned in favour of the Charter.Under the regulations of the July Charter, the powers of new Prime Minister Tarique Rahman will face closer checks to prevent a return to authoritarianism in the country.The power centre in Dhaka was founded on democratic and secular principles in 1971, following Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan after the Mukti Bahini-led liberation struggle. Formerly East Pakistan, the country has, from time to time, suffered under autocratic rule.The July National Charter Implementation Order 2025 is a 28-page political agreement signed by Muhammad Yunus and 25 political parties. Its goal is to transform Bangladesh into what many call the “Second Republic”—a state designed to prevent any future return to authoritarianism.Rahman took charge at a time when Bangladesh was facing one of its most unstable internal security situations in years.December proved to be a turbulent month. Dhaka and several other cities witnessed explosions, widespread unrest, and internet shutdowns.Much of the violence was triggered by an assassination attempt on influential student leader Osman Hadi, who later died from his injuries in Singapore.News of his death sparked anger across the country. Violent attacks followed, with minorities, especially Hindu labourers, businessmen, and community members, among those targeted.However, people from other communities were also caught in the violence.Dipu Chandra Das was one of the victims. The 28-year-old garment factory worker was burnt alive on December 18, the same day Hadi’s death was confirmed. His killing shocked the country and drew widespread attention on social media.As Bangladesh voted for a new government under Tarique Rahman, Das’s family said they cast their vote hoping for justice and safety.Rahman’s inclusive messaging and his promise to protect all communities may help reassure minorities and broaden support for the BNP.Since his return, Rahman has tried to present himself as a calmer and more mature leader, ready to move beyond past political conflicts.The image of an aggressive political operator from the BNP’s 2001–2006 era has largely faded.Although he never held an official government position, Rahman was often accused of influencing decisions behind the scenes during his mother Khaleda Zia’s tenure, an allegation he has denied.“What does revenge bring to someone? People have to flee from this country because of revenge. This does not bring anything good,” he said. “What we need at the moment in the country is peace and stability.”During Sheikh Hasina’s rule, Rahman faced multiple corruption cases and was convicted in absentia. In 2018, he was also sentenced to life imprisonment over a 2004 grenade attack on a rally Hasina was addressing.Rahman denied all allegations, calling them politically motivated. Following Hasina’s ouster, he has since been acquitted in these cases.Since returning, he has adopted a more measured tone, avoiding aggressive rhetoric and calling for unity and reconciliation.He has spoken about restoring “people’s ownership of the state” and rebuilding institutions -- a message that has energised BNP supporters and raised hopes for political change.The elections also marked a significant gain for Jamaat-e-Islami, which won nearly one-third of the parliamentary seats, its strongest performance in decades.Notably, the party did not field a single woman candidate, reflecting its ideological position on women’s role in politics.Jamaat's rise, an organisation that believes in '' for women, signals a shift in Bangladesh’s political landscape, especially after decades dominated by two powerful female leaders, Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia.Two months earlier, Jamaat had surprised observers by forming an alliance with the National Citizen Party (NCP), created in 2025 by leaders of the student uprising.The NCP promised a more inclusive democracy and stronger protection of women’s rights. However, this contrasts with Jamaat’s long-held belief that women’s participation in public life should follow Islamic principles. The election results, meanwhile, suggested that voters gave greater support to Jamaat than to the NCP.This alliance reflects the complex and evolving nature of Bangladesh’s political alliances.After Hasina’s departure, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus assumed charge as caretaker, leading the interim government during the country’s political transition.Yunus became chief adviser of the interim government.He repeatedly said his role was temporary.Throughout his tenure, Yunus maintained that he had “no desire to be part of the next elected government”.His focus, he said, was to ensure a peaceful and fair transition.According to JNU professor Rajan Kumar, Yunus is likely to remain influential even after the new government takes over.“I think he is likely to remain as an advisor because this government would be favourable to him and they'll press no charges against him, whatever happened earlier,” Kumar said.“He fits perfectly into that structure. So he'll remain in some capacity as an advisor — maybe some role of economic adviser, either formal or informal.”Rahman’s rise carries important implications for India-Bangladesh relations.After Sheikh Hasina fled and took refuge in India, ties between the two countries became strained. The interim government under Yunus did little to improve relations.Rahman, however, moved quickly to reach out diplomatically.Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke with Rahman and congratulated him.""Delighted to speak with Mr Tarique Rahman. I congratulated him on the remarkable victory in the Bangladesh elections.""The BNP also thanked India and Prime Minister Modi for recognising the election results and expressed hope for stronger ties.India sent Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri to attend the oath-taking ceremony, signalling its willingness to rebuild relations.Under Sheikh Hasina, India was Bangladesh’s closest regional partner. Rahman’s outreach suggests an effort to restore stability and cooperation between the two neighbours.Tarique Rahman’s rise marks a major turning point in Bangladesh’s political history.For decades, politics was dominated by Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia. Their rivalry shaped the country’s leadership, elections, and direction.That era has now ended.Rahman’s leadership represents both continuity and change — continuity through political legacy, and change through generational transition.He faces major challenges: restoring trust in institutions, maintaining communal harmony, managing rising political forces, and rebuilding foreign relations.Bangladesh now stands at an important moment, entering a new political phase under a leader whose journey reflects the country’s own years of conflict, change, and political transformation.","Bangladesh’s decades-long “battle of begums” era has ended, and a new power centre has emerged in Dhaka. With Sheikh Hasina in exile and Khaleda Zia no more, the country is witnessing a political shift that would have seemed improbable even two years ago.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128466299,imgsize-1530199,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Ukraine's foreign affairs minister Andrii Sybiha supported the recent US strikes on Iran, which targeted three nuclear sites early Sunday under the code name 'Operation Midnight Hammer'.He also backed US President Donald Trump 's statement that Tehran must not be allowed to obtain nuclear weapons. ""Ukraine is convinced that Iran’s nuclear program must be brought to an end so that it never again poses a threat neither to the countries of the Middle East nor to any other state,"" Ukraine's foreign ministry said in a statement.“Peaceful efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons have been ongoing for years, but they have not yielded effective results. As early as this spring, the United States warned Iran of the consequences in the absence of constructive steps,” the statement read.The statement also criticized Iran for aiding Russia in its war against Ukraine. ""Iran is complicit in the crime of aggression against Ukraine. The Iranian regime is providing military assistance to Russia, including the supply of UAVs and technologies that Russia consistently uses to kill people and destroy critical infrastructure,"" it said.In a post on X, Medvedev, downplaying Trump's chances of receiving the Nobel Peace Prize , wrote: ""At this rate, Trump can forget about the Nobel Peace Prize, not even with how rigged it has become. What a way to kick things off, Mr President.""US vice-president JD Vance strongly disagreed with Medvedev’s views and opposed his warning.“First of all, I think it’s a bizarre response, but I also don’t know that guy speaks for President Putin or for the Russian government,” Vance said. “[Russia has] been very consistent that they don’t want Iran to get a nuclear weapon .”“I’ll let President [Vladimir] Putin speak to what the official Russian position on this is,” he added.","Ukraine's foreign affairs minister Andrii Sybiha supported the recent US strikes on Iran, which targeted three nuclear sites early Sunday under the code name 'Operation Midnight Hammer' He also backed US President Donald Trump's statement that Tehran must not be allowed to obtain nuclear weapons.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122014468,imgsize-950990,width-400,resizemode-4/122014468.jpg"

The US Air Force B-2 Spirit bombers which dropped massive bunker-buster bombs on three Iranian nuclear facilities, arrived back at their Whiteman Air Force base home on Sunday (local time).""B-2 Spirit bombers recently returned safely to Whiteman AFB, Mo., after a successful 36-hour mission to the @CENTCOM (United States Central Command) area of responsibility,"" the US Strategic Command posted on X, and shared a video of a B-2 landing at the Whiteman facility.The base, about 73 miles (117 kilometers) southeast of Kansas City, is home to the 509th Bomb Wing, the only US military unit which operates the B-2, which is more famous as the stealth.The first group of four of the stealth aircraft did a loop around the base before approaching a runway from the north, while a final group of three arrived within 10 minutes, according to the Associated Press.The day before, the B-2s had been part of a wide-ranging plan involving deception and decoys to deliver what America's military leaders believe is a ""knockout blow"" to Iran's nuclear programme, which US ally Israel views as an ""existential threat"" and has been pummelling for more than a week.According to American officials, one group of the stealth aircraft headed west from the base on Saturday, as a decoy to throw off the Iranians.Another flight of seven B-2s quietly flew off eastward, ultimately executing in the Iran mission. Aided by refuelling tankers and fighter jets — some of which launched their own weapons — American pilots dropped 30,000-pound ""bunker buster"" bombs early Sunday local time in Iran on key nuclear plants in the Islamic Republic.As per officials, the mission, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, carried out a “precision strike” and “devastated the Iranian nuclear programme,"" even as they acknowledged an assessment was ongoing.

What does the court say about Garcia’s detention?





federal judge in Tennessee is set to order the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year and is now facing human smuggling charges in the United States.The decision came on Sunday, when US mmagistrate Judge Barbara Holmes denied the government’s motion to keep Abrego Garcia detained while he awaits trial. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday to finalize the conditions of his release.However, the US government has already filed a motion to appeal the ruling and has requested a stay on the release order. Agencies suggest that the US administration would not set Garcia free, as the Customs Enforcement might take him into custody and try to deport him.Originally from El Salvador, Abrego Garcia crossed into the United States illegally around 2011. In 2019, he was detained by immigration officials in Maryland.García has no criminal record in either the US or El Salvador and has never been charged with any gang-related activity. However, Trump officials claim he has ties to MS-13 — a violent criminal gang that started in Los Angeles in the 1980s and later spread to Central America.The investigation gained momentum after the Supreme Court ordered the federal government to facilitate his return from El Salvador, responding to rising public and legal pressure.In her ruling, Judge Holmes acknowledged that the release order may be “little more than an academic exercise,” given ICE’s probable intervention. Still, she concluded that the government had not presented sufficient evidence to prove Abrego Garcia posed a flight risk, a threat to the community, or a risk of obstructing justice.“Overall, the Court cannot find from the evidence presented that Abrego’s release clearly and convincingly poses an irremediable danger to other persons or to the community,” she wrote.During the June 13 hearing, acting US attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, Rob McGuire, argued that ICE’s likely deportation attempt was a valid reason to keep Abrego Garcia in custody. Holmes countered that it was up to the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security to determine whether prosecution or deportation should take precedence.Assistant Federal Public Defender Will Allensworth, who represents Abrego Garcia, noted that while a deportation to El Salvador is barred, the government could consider removal to a third country. However, such a transfer would require proof that the receiving country agrees not to return him to El Salvador.",Kilmar Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year.

He added, “What happens when Israel gets bombed again? Is Trump going to sit by and say, no, we’re not going to further engage in this war?”“MAGA should drop this pathetic LOSER, Tom Massie, like the plague!” Trump wrote. “The good news is that we will have a wonderful American Patriot running against him in the Republican Primary, and I’ll be out in Kentucky campaigning really hard.

The US administration issued a warning of a ""heightened threat environment"" in the United States after its military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. The bulletin issued by the National terrorism Advisory System did not mention Operation Midnight Hammer but warned Americans of ""low-level cyber attacks"" against US networks amid the ongoing ""Iran conflict"".""The ongoing Iran conflict is causing a heightened threat environment in the United States. Low-level cyber attacks against US networks by pro-Iranian hacktivists are likely, and cyber actors affiliated with the Iranian government may conduct attacks against US networks,"" it said.""Iran also has a long-standing commitment to target US Government officials it views as responsible for the death of an Iranian military commander killed in January 2020. The likelihood of violent extremists in the Homeland independently mobilizing to violence in response to the conflict would likely increase if Iranian leadership issued a religious ruling calling for retaliatory violence against targets in the Homeland. Multiple recent Homeland terrorist attacks have been motivated by anti-Semitic or anti-Israel sentiment, and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could contribute to US-based individuals plotting additional attacks,"" the advisory said.Iran had previously vowed to retaliate if the U.S. joined Israel's attack, which started June 13 with Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets. More than 650 people have been killed and at least 2,000 have been wounded in Iran since then, according to a Washington-based Iranian human rights group. At least 24 have also been killed in Israel, and hundreds wounded, in Iran's retaliatory missile and drone strikes, according to estimates from the Israeli military. The conflict has played out as Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza continues.Law enforcement officials in New York City said Saturday night that they were ""deploying additional resources"" to certain sites as a precaution. The NYPD posted: ""We're tracking the situation unfolding in Iran.

"Microwave, toilet, refrigerator: Inside B-2 stealth bombers that flew 37 hours for Iran strike",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/microwave-toilet-refrigerator-inside-b-2-stealth-bombers-that-flew-37-hours-for-iran-strike/articleshow/122010574.cms,"B-2 stealth bombers are equipped for long-haul flights.





Seven B-2 bombers were deployed for Operation Midnight Hammer to destroy three nuclear plants in Iran in almost radio silence. They took off from the Whiteman Air Force Base outside Kansas City on Friday and flew 18 hours to enter Iran. After demolishing their targets, the B-2s were on their way back home, unattached. The bombers refuelled several times mid-air, and as they are stealth bombers, they were virtually invisible to Oranian radar.B-2 bombers are equipped for such long-haul flights. There is enough room for one pilot to lie down while the other flies the plane. There is a toilet, a refrigerator and a microwave for snacks. The B-2 first entered service in 1997 and each one costs more than $2 billion; the US Air Force has a fleet of 19, after losing one in a crash in 2008. One of the B-2’s most striking features is its unique design. Lacking a fuselage or tail, the aircraft is a flying wing, which necessitates highly precise control of its surfaces.With a wingspan of 172 feet and a crew of just two pilots — the B-2 relies on automation to help complete long-haul flights. The 37 hours spent to attack Fordow marked the longest B-2 bomber mission since the initial American assault on Afghanistan following the Sept.11, 2001, terrorist attacks.There were layers of secrecy and minute planning behind every stage of the operation. While the B-2 bombers moved towards the east, a decoy group of B-2 bombers moved towards the west.As the attack bombers approached Iran, they were joined by support aircraft and a fleet of fighter jets. “The B-2s linked up with escort and support aircraft in a complex, tightly timed maneuver requiring exact synchronization across multiple platforms in a narrow piece of airspace, all done with minimal communications,” Gen Daniel Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in the Pentagon briefing.The lead B-2 bomber dropped two GBU-57 “bunker buster” munitions on the “first of several aim points at Fordow."" “The remaining bombers then hit their targets, as well, with a total of 14 MOPs (Massive Ordnance Penetrators) dropped against two nuclear target areas,” Gen Caine added.","Seven B-2 bombers were deployed for Operation Midnight Hammer to destroy three nuclear plants in Iran in almost radio silence.

Iranian State TV aired a bold warning to US President Donald Trump , displaying a map of US military bases in the Middle East alongside the message: “Mr. Trump, you started it, and we will end it.”The message comes at a time when tensions are at a all time high following Trump’s confirmation that the US military carried out strikes on three of Iran’s major nuclear sites.In a post on his Truth Social account early Sunday morning local time, Trump said, “We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow.” He added, “There is not another military in the World that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!” The president is expected to deliver a televised address at 10pm ET.The strikes signal a major shift in US policy, as Trump has now committed American military power to support Israel’s ongoing operations against Iran. The Israeli government had already spent more than a week targeting Iran’s air defences and missile systems before the US joined in.The White House confirmed that Israel was informed in advance of the US attack.A US official told Reuters that B-2 stealth bombers were used to hit the targets. These bombers are capable of carrying 30,000-pound bunker-busting bombs, making them suitable for deep underground sites like Fordow.Although Trump had earlier said he would decide within two weeks whether to act, preparations for military action intensified over the weekend. According to NBC News, he is not currently planning additional strikes inside Iran.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei had also warned that it would be bad if the US got involved in the conflict with Israel.","Iranian State TV aired a bold warning to US President Donald Trump.

Crash dummies used in car safety tests are still modelled after men despite higher risks for women,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/crash-dummies-used-in-car-safety-tests-are-still-modelled-after-men-despite-higher-risks-for-women/articleshow/122015309.cms,"Crash dummies used in car safety tests are still modelled after men despite higher risks for women (Image: AP)





Maria Weston Kuhn had one lingering question about the car crash that forced her to have emergency surgery during a vacation in Ireland: Why did she and her mother sustain serious injuries while her father and brother, who sat in the front, emerge unscathed?""It was a head-on crash and they were closest to the point of contact,"" said Kuhn, now 25, who missed a semester of college to recover from the 2019 collision that caused her seat belt to slide off her hips and rupture her intestines by pinning them against her spine. ""That was an early clue that something else was going on.""When Kuhn returned home to Maine, she found an article her grandma had clipped from Consumer Reports and left on her bed. Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a frontal crash, she learned, yet the dummy used in vehicle tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dates back to the 1970s and is still modeled almost entirely off the body of a man.A survivor becomes an activist Kuhn, who is starting law school at New York University this fall, took action and founded the nonprofit Drive US Forward. Its aim was to raise public awareness and eventually encourage members of Congress to sign onto a bill that would require NHTSA to incorporate a more advanced female dummy into its testing.The agency has the final word on whether cars get pulled from the market, and the kind of dummy used in its safety tests could impact which ones receive coveted five-star ratings.""It seems like we have an easy solution here where we can have crash test dummies that reflect an average woman as well as a man,"" Sen Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican who has introduced the legislation the past two sessions, told The Associated Press.Senators from both parties have signed onto Fischer's ""She Drives Act,"" and the transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for updating the rules.But for various reasons, the push for new safety requirements has been moving at a sluggish pace. That's particularly true in the US, where much of the research is happening and where around 40,000 people are killed each year in car crashes.Evolution of a crash test dummy The crash test dummy currently used in NHTSA five-star testing is called the Hybrid III, which was developed in 1978 and modelled after a 5-foot-9, 171-pound man (the average size in the 1970s but about 29 pounds lighter than today's average). What's known as the female dummy is essentially a much smaller version of the male model with a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger seat or the back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women.""What they didn't do is design a crash test dummy that has all the sensors in the areas where a woman would be injured differently than a man,"" said Christopher O'Connor, president and CEO of the Farmington Hills, Michigan-based Humanetics Group, which has spent more than a decade developing and refining one.A female dummy from Humanetics equipped with all of the available sensors costs around $1 million, about twice the cost of the Hybrid used now.But, O'Connor says, the more expensive dummy far more accurately reflects the anatomical differences between the sexes - including in the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs, which one NHTSA study found account for about 80% more injuries by women in a car crash compared to men.Such physical dummies will always be needed for vehicle safety tests, and to verify the accuracy of virtual tests, O'Connor said.Europe incorporated the more advanced male dummy developed by Humanetics' engineers, the THOR 50M (based on a 50th percentile man), into its testing procedures soon after Kuhn's 2019 crash in Ireland. Several other countries, including China and Japan, have adopted it as well.But that model and the female version the company uses for comparison, the THOR 5F (based on a 5th percentile woman), have been met with scepticism from some American automakers who argue the more sophisticated devices may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags.A debate over whether more sensors mean more safety Bridget Walchesky, 19, had to be flown to a hospital, where she required eight surgeries over a month, after a 2022 crash near her home in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, that killed her friend, who was driving. While acknowledging the seat belt likely saved her life, Walchesky said some of the injuries - including her broken collarbone - were the result of it pinning her too tightly, which she views as something better safety testing focused on women could improve.""Seat belts aren't really built for bodies on females,"" Walchesky said. ""Some of my injuries, the way the force hit me, they were probably worsened.""The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry trade group, said in a statement to the that the better way to ensure safety - which it called its top priority - is through upgrades to the existing Hybrid dummy rather than mandating a new one.""This can happen on a faster timeline and lead to quicker safety improvements than requiring NHTSA to adopt unproven crash test dummy technology,"" the alliance said.Humanetics' THOR dummies received high marks in the vehicle safety agency's early tests. Using cadavers from actual crashes to compare the results, NHTSA found they outperformed the existing Hybrid in predicting almost all injuries - including to the head, neck, shoulders, abdomen and legs.A separate review by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, was far more critical of the dummy's ability to predict chest injuries in a frontal crash. Despite the vast expansion in the number of sensors, the insurance institute's testing found, the male Thor dummy was less accurate than the current Hybrid dummies, which also had limitations.""More isn't necessarily better,"" said Jessica Jermakian, senior vice president for vehicle research at IIHS. ""You also have to be confident that the data is telling you the right things about how a real person would fare in that crash.""The slow pace of changing the rules NHTSA's budget plan commits to developing the female Thor 5F version with the ultimate goal of incorporating it into the testing. But there could be a long wait considering the THOR's male version adopted by other countries is still awaiting final approval in the US.A 2023 report by the Government Accountability Office, which conducts research for Congress, cited numerous ""missed milestones"" in NHTSA's development of various crash dummy enhancements - including in the Thor models.Kuhn acknowledges being frustrated by the slow process of trying to change the regulations. She says she understands why there's reluctance from auto companies if they fear being forced to make widespread design changes with more consideration for women's safety.""Fortunately, they have very skilled engineers and they'll figure it out,"" she said.","Crash dummies used in car safety tests are still modelled after men despite higher risks for women.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has clarified that the Donald Trump administration made ""bipartisan courtesy calls"" to brief the Congressional leadership well before the US forces conducted air strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran - codenamed Operation Midnight Hammer.Leavitt's statement came after several US media outlets, including CNN and Axios, claimed that the Trump administration - the US President is a Republican - briefed only the top two Republicans in the Congress (House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate majority leader John Thune) before the operation.""This is fake news. The White House made bipartisan courtesy calls to Congressional leadership and spoke to ⁦@SenSchumer before the strike. ⁦⁦@RepJeffries could not be reached until after, but he was briefed. Please retract,"" she wrote on X.Leavitt was referring to Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, both Democrats.Earlier, it was reported that Schumer was informed shortly before Trump's address to the nation on the mission in Iran, while Jeffries came to know well after the attack.Meanwhile, in a statement on X, Jeffries accused Trump of ""misleading"" the nation, and called for an immediate and classified Congressional briefing.""President Trump misled the country about his intentions, failed to seek congressional authorization, and risks American entanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East,"" the Democrat said.""Congress must be fully and immediately briefed in a classified setting,"" he added.","White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration made ""bipartisan courtesy calls"" to Congressional leadership well before the US forces conducted air strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran.

US-Iran tensions spike: Washington issues 'worldwide caution'; Tehran says response to American strikes will be 'proportionate',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-iran-tensions-spike-washington-issues-worldwide-caution-tehran-says-response-to-american-strikes-will-be-proportionate/articleshow/122013293.cms,"Global alert: Exercise increased caution



Türkiye: Avoid Southeast, maintain low profile

Lebanon: Non-essential staff ordered to depart

Saudi Arabia: Avoid military sites





The United States has issued a sweeping global security alert for its citizens following its military strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. The State Department warned of potential reprisals against Americans, and ordered the departure of non-essential diplomatic staff from Lebanon, while also issuing specific advisories for Türkiye and Saudi Arabia.The US missile strikes which President Donald Trump claimed had “completely and fully obliterated” Iran’s nuclear facilities have provoked fierce threats from Tehran, which has vowed a “proportionate response” at a time and place of its choosing. With Israeli air raids continuing deep into Iranian territory and Tehran’s Revolutionary Guard launching retaliatory missile attacks, fears of a prolonged confrontation have grown.Iran has signalled that US military bases and regional allies could be targeted if used in attacks against it. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s advisor Ali Akbar Velayati warned that “any country used by the US to strike Iran will be a legitimate target for our armed forces.”“The Department of State advises US citizens worldwide to exercise increased caution,” the alert read. In light of “disruptions to travel and periodic closure of airspace across the Middle East,” and the potential for demonstrations against US citizens, travellers were urged to consult the most recent travel advisories and country-specific information.The warning directs citizens to visit the Department’s website for up-to-date guidance and security alerts.The US Embassy in Türkiye has cautioned its personnel to avoid the consular district of Adana in the country’s southeast, encompassing 22 provinces. “Negative sentiment toward US foreign policy may prompt actions against US or Western interests,” the alert said, citing risks of demonstrations, graffiti, boycotts and anti-American rhetoric.Americans in Türkiye were advised to avoid protest areas, monitor local media, and “exercise caution and stay alert at locations publicly associated with the United States or Israel or frequented by Westerners.”In Beirut, the State Department on ordered the departure of non-emergency government staff and family members due to a “volatile and unpredictable security situation.” While flights remain operational at Rafic Hariri International Airport, the embassy noted that “some airlines have suspended or cancelled flights,” urging citizens to monitor news updates and leave while commercial options are still available.“We remind US citizens to continue to exercise caution,” the embassy said, stressing the uncertain and rapidly evolving nature of the conflict.The US Mission to Saudi Arabia issued a separate advisory warning American citizens and its own staff to “limit non-essential travel to any military installations in the region.” The alert acknowledged the fluid situation following Israel’s military campaign and the US strikes, urging Americans to prepare personal emergency plans and review existing travel arrangements.“Crises can happen unexpectedly while travelling or living abroad, and a good plan helps you think through potential scenarios,” it added, with assurances that embassy staffing and consular services remain unaffected for now.The alerts come as Washington’s intervention in Israel’s war with Iran escalates regional instability. Israeli forces continued their aerial bombardment of Iranian targets on Sunday, hitting missile sites and infrastructure in Tehran, Hamedan and Kermanshah. Iran’s response has included launching long-range missiles at Israel and threatening further escalation.Iran’s UN ambassador accused the US of “destroying diplomacy,” while other officials insisted that Iran’s nuclear programme though damaged was not completely halted. “Even if nuclear sites are destroyed, game isn’t over,” wrote Ali Shamkhani, another advisor to Khamenei.","U.S. State Department issues global security alert for its citizens.

"Day after deciding to nominate Trump for peace Nobel, Pakistan blows hot at US for Iran strikes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/day-after-deciding-to-nominate-trump-for-peace-nobel-pak-blows-hot-at-us-for-iran-strikes/articleshow/122013603.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: Pakistan found itself in an embarrassing diplomatic bind as American bombs rained on Iran early Sunday, barely 24 hours after Islamabad's surprise decision to nominate US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.The airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan prompted the Shehbaz Sharif govt to issue a statement criticising the US for what it said was a violation of “all norms of international law”.The prelude to the foreign affairs ministry’s condemnation of the attacks was mounting domestic backlash over the timing and political wisdom of the Shehbaz govt’s Nobel move.""This is diplomatic inconsistency at its worst,"" said former ambassador Maleeha Lodhi. ""You can't praise a man for peace one day and stay silent when he orders bombings the next.""Just a day earlier, Islamabad had announced it would formally nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in “halting” the India-Pakistan conflict in May. Officials highlighted his rare White House meeting with Pakistan's army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, and a purported backchannel hotline with Delhi as evidence of “effective US intervention”.The forced change in tone within a day was as dramatic as Trump transitioning from “peacemaker” to aggressor.“Pakistan condemns the US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities which follow the series of attacks by Israel. We are gravely concerned at the possible further escalation of tensions in the region,” the foreign ministry said.“Iran has the legitimate right to defend itself under the UN Charter…Any further escalation of tensions will have severely damaging implications for the region and beyond.”Deputy PM and foreign minister Ishaq Dar posted on X a message expressing solidarity with Iran. “Met my dear brother, Iran’s foreign minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi @araghchi, today on the sidelines of the 51st OIC CFM in Istanbul…I reaffirmed our unwavering support for Iran’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and its right to self-defence under the UN Charter,” he wrote.Earlier in the day, criticism poured in from various quarters for the Shehbaz govt’s Trump tilt, with commentator Talat Hussain terming the move ""pathetic"" and saying it revealed a ""colonised mindset desperate for American approval”.The backlash reflects deeper unease within Pakistan, where public support for Iran and Palestine runs high. ""There's growing public anger over inconsistency,"" said political analyst Mosharraf Zaidi. ""It weakens Pakistan's moral position and suggests a transactional approach to diplomacy.""Behind the scenes, officials say the govt is pursuing a difficult but pragmatic strategy: maintaining ties with Washington to ease economic pressure and retain diplomatic space in its conflict with India. But the optics of nominating Trump just before he authorised strikes on a Muslim-majority nation have complicated that calculation significantly.Online, the blowback has been swift and unforgiving. Hashtags like #NobelForWar and #TrumpNominationShame trended on Pakistani Twitter (X), amplifying criticism of what many see as a diplomatic own goal. The Nobel nomination, intended as a diplomatic coup, appears to have backfired spectacularly.","Pakistan condemns U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.

Pakistan Condemns U.S. Strikes On Iran A Day After Nobel Peace Prize Endorsement For Donald Trump





The Pakistani government and its powerful military establishment are facing a wave of public backlash after formally recommending US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, a move that drew widespread condemnation following the US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities.Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar sent a letter to the Nobel Committee in Norway, crediting Trump’s “decisive diplomatic intervention” during the recent India-Pakistan standoff. But the recommendation triggered a storm on social media after Trump ordered attacks on Iran’s Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear sites, an operation he called a “historic moment” and one that escalated regional tensions.On X (formerly Twitter), users accused the Pakistani government of appeasing its “master.” One user mocked, “Pakistanis, beware! After the attack on Iran, PM Shehbaz might not only award Trump the Nobel Peace Prize, but also Tamgha-e-Jurat, Tamgha-e-Shujaat, Tamgha-e-Basalat, Tamgha-e-Imtiaz, and perhaps even the Nishan-e-Haider!”Veteran journalist Ameer Abbas recalled that PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique had once likened Trump to Genghis Khan and Hitler.“Now, the same government nominates him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Who is orchestrating such shameful and cowardly decisions?” he asked.Raheeq Abbasi, political analyst and columnist, noted the irony, “Trump, who vetoed the Gaza ceasefire 8 times and is protested across the West for war crimes, is being nominated for a Nobel by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Is there no sense of honour left?”The backlash cut across ideological lines. Some users accused the military establishment of calling the shots. “The uncrowned kings are ready to sell out the nation whenever they please,” wrote Major (R) Asim.Another user, Jarjees Ahmad, called out the “supreme level of hypocrisy”, “We’re nominating someone involved in the massacre of Palestinians while claiming to stand with Iran.”Aamir Khan added, “What greater betrayal could there be to Muslims, our country, and the people of Pakistan?”The Pakistani government has yet to respond officially to the criticism.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar sent a letter to the Nobel Committee in Norway, crediting Trump’s “decisive diplomatic intervention” during the recent India-Pakistan standoff.

ISLAMABAD: In a move likely to stir diplomatic discussion across the region, the Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan govt announced on Saturday that it will formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, citing his diplomatic intervention during the recent India-Pakistan military crisis, reports Omer Farooq Khan.In an official statement shared on X, the Pakistan govt credited Trump's ""decisive intervention"" and ""pivotal leadership"" with helping de-escalate a rapidly intensifying standoff between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Islamabad said it responded with a calibrated military action - Operation Bunyanum Marsoos - described as a ""measured"" and ""precise"" strike intended to restore deterrence without targeting civilian areas.Pakistan's govt claimed Trump engaged both Islamabad and New Delhi through high-level diplomacy at a moment of heightened regional volatility, securing a ceasefire that averted a wider conflagration. ""President Trump demonstrated strategic foresight and statesmanship, preventing a broader conflict that could have had catastrophic consequences for the region,"" the statement read.The govt also praised Trump for his ""sincere"" willingness to assist in resolving the Kashmir dispute - an issue Pakistan maintains is central to lasting peace in South Asia.India, however, has consistently rejected third-party involvement in Kashmir, reiterating that the issue must be resolved bilaterally under the Simla Agreement.The Pakistani statement expressed hope that Trump's ""legacy of pragmatic diplomacy"" would continue to play a role in addressing global flashpoints, including the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and rising tensions involving Iran.Trump, who is yet to respond publicly, has previously highlighted his role in managing past India-Pakistan tensions, including in 2019 following the Pulwama-Balakot incident. His earlier offer to mediate on Kashmir was firmly rebuffed by New Delhi.The Nobel Peace Prize nomination process permits formal recommendations from heads of state, national lawmakers, and certain academic and diplomatic figures. The Norwegian Nobel Committee does not comment on individual nominations.If successful, Trump would join a select group of American leaders - US Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter, and Barack Obama - who have received the Nobel Peace Prize.","Pakistan govt says it will formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.

'Could not Occur Without Money': FATF Condemns Pahalgam Attack; Pakistan's Return To Grey-List Soon?





A new report from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has cited a case involving Pakistan’s missile development programme, referencing a shipment seized by Indian customs officials in 2020 that was bound for Port Qasim in Karachi. The FATF case study outlines how dual-use goods, including equipment critical for ballistic missile technology, were mis-declared in export documents and linked directly to Pakistan’s National Development Complex, which is known to be involved in the development of long-range ballistic missiles.The FATF report reveals that Indian investigators intercepted a cargo ship falsely declaring autoclaves, equipment used for high-energy materials and missile motor components. “The Bill of Lading of the seized cargo provided evidence of the link between the importer and the National Development Complex,” the report noted.This latest disclosure comes as FATF increases its scrutiny of state-sponsored terrorism, particularly following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, which left 26 dead. In a public condemnation, FATF said: “This, and other recent attacks, could not occur without money and the means to move funds between terrorist supporters.”As per PTI sources, India is likely to use this FATF disclosure in its dossier to push for Pakistan’s return to the FATF grey list. The upcoming Asia Pacific Group meeting in August and the FATF plenary in October may see renewed calls for sanctions or monitoring. According to officials cited by PTI, the inclusion of “state-sponsored terrorism” in the FATF’s upcoming analysis marks a significant step in acknowledging Pakistan’s involvement in funding and facilitating terror operations.The incident flagged by FATF, which occurred in February 2020 at Kandla port, saw authorities act on intelligence regarding a suspicious Hong Kong-flagged ship, Da Cui Yun, that had departed from China’s Jiangyin port, TOI had reported. Officials seized a massive pressure chamber described as a pipe-like object, 35-40 feet in length, now confirmed to have potential ballistic missile applications. Experts from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) joined a high-level investigation into the cargo, amid tight-lipped responses from customs due to the national security implications.Also read: ‘Suspicious’ Chinese ship seized at Kandla, under strict scrutiny The FATF report also highlighted the growing global risk from proliferation financing (PF), especially concerning state and non-state actors acquiring dual-use technologies for weapons of mass destruction (WMD). “The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related financing represents a significant threat to global security and the integrity of the international financial system,” the report warns, adding that failure to implement effective controls could allow actors to exploit weaknesses in global export and financial systems.","A new report from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has cited a case involving Pakistan’s missile development programme.

ISLAMABAD: In a bid to recalibrate Pakistan’s global narrative and bolster ties with Washington, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States, meeting senior American scholars, strategic experts, and international media representatives during an official visit to Washington DC, the Pakistani military said on Friday.In a carefully choreographed diplomatic offensive, Munir interacted with leading think tanks and policy institutions, offering what officials described as “Pakistan’s principled perspectives” on evolving regional and global dynamics. His engagements underscored Islamabad’s renewed focus on international outreach amid a shifting geopolitical landscape in South Asia.The army chief reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to regional stability, counterterrorism, and a rules-based global order, pitching the country as a responsible actor in an increasingly multipolar world.Munir spoke at length about Pakistan’s counter-terrorism strategy, highlighting military operations such as Maarka-e-Haqa and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. He reminded his audience of Pakistan’s role as a frontline state in the global war on terror, citing the “immense sacrifices” borne by its security forces and civilians.Without naming India, Munir warned against “regional actors using terrorism as an instrument of hybrid warfare” – a familiar refrain in Pakistan’s diplomatic lexicon referring to its neighbour.While not new, the accusation resurfacing in the US capital, signalling Pakistan’s intent to shape the security discourse in South Asia.Munir also showcased Pakistan’s economic aspirations. He pitched the country’s untapped potential in IT, agriculture, and mineral wealth, calling on global stakeholders to invest in these “engines of shared prosperity”.From foreign policy to economic diplomacy, Munir portrayed Pakistan as a country pursuing dialogue, diplomacy, and international law — an image Islamabad has been keen to project as it seeks to distance itself from past reputational baggage.Discussing Pakistan-US relations, Munir called for transforming the historical security-centric engagement into a multidimensional partnership grounded in strategic convergence and mutual respect. He acknowledged past cooperation on counterterrorism and economic development but pushed for a broader framework of engagement.According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, participants appreciated the candid nature of the discussions and acknowledged Pakistan’s efforts to maintain regional stability. The meetings were seen as a trust-building exercise amid evolving US priorities in the Indo-Pacific region and growing scepticism over Islamabad’s commitments.The visit comes at a time when Pakistan is striving to reset ties with major powers, especially after its recent economic crises and shifting regional alignments. With India drawing closer to the US and Afghanistan remaining volatile, Islamabad is attempting to reposition itself as an indispensable — if complicated — regional player.","Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States.

He added that a new strategy would be announced on Monday.“If we don’t pass the budget, the federal government could take control of the province under the pretext of a financial emergency,” Gandapur said, accusing Islamabad of conspiring to topple his government.He also lashed out at the federal authorities for what he described as “unjust treatment” of the province following the May 9, 2023, incidents. He alleged that the public mandate in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was stolen in the aftermath.“Our leader was unjustly jailed, and the way we were treated after May 9, followed by the theft of our mandate, is unacceptable.

Trump Hosts Pakistan Army Chief Munir Alone At White House, Faces Fierce Criticism From Pentagon Vet





ISLAMABAD: The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz, with whispers of backroom deals that could reshape the balance of power in South Asia and far beyond.What began as a one-hour lunch in the Cabinet Room turned into a two-hour marathon meeting that continued in the Oval Office, attended by US secretary of state Marco Rubio, special representative Steve Witkoff, and Pakistan NSA and Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Asim Malik.The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) handout flags counter-terrorism, trade, and peace, but the real stakes — against the backdrop of Iran-Israel airstrikes and India-Pakistan tensions — reveal a high-wire act with far-reaching implications.Trump, channeling his trademark deal-maker bravado, now sees Pakistan as a strategic prize. As Israel intensifies strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites and Washington edges closer to military escalation, Pakistan’s shared border with Iran becomes critical. Sources say Trump privately pressured Munir for airspace access and intelligence on Tehran — leveraging Pakistan’s backchannel role as the host of Iran’s interests section for the US.In return, he offered advanced weaponry and economic incentives, aiming to lure Islamabad away from China’s orbit and Russia’s Brics alliance.Trump’s push to expand trade in critical minerals, cryptocurrency, AI, and energy is part of a broader strategy to anchor Pakistan within US-led markets and curb China’s regional influence. He has also claimed credit for defusing the May 2025 crisis between India and Pakistan.As Pakistan’s power broker, Munir brings serious leverage. His military’s fight against Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) syncs with US aims in Afghanistan. With ties to Iran and a shared border, Munir can offer covert intelligence or logistical support, though Pakistan’s pro-Iran rhetoric caps public alignment. Economically, he can unlock Pakistan’s mineral and tech potential for US investors, but treading too far risks Beijing’s wrath.On India, Munir’s role in brokering the May ceasefire – praised by President Trump – has been framed in Islamabad as a direct rebuttal of New Delhi’s allegations of Pakistani involvement in cross-border terrorism. With the country facing severe economic challenges, Munir is believed to have sought US military and financial assistance to modernise Pakistan’s armed forces and stabilise its economy. Trump’s openness to providing drones or missile defence systems could significantly alter the military balance with India. Munir also reportedly urged Trump to de-escalate growing tensions between Iran and Israel, warning of broader regional instability and citing Pakistan’s vocal alignment with Tehran. In a bold diplomatic gesture, Munir extended an invitation for Trump to visit Pakistan, an effort seen as central to reshaping bilateral ties and enhancing Islamabad’s global relevance.Timed amid Middle East turmoil and South Asian friction, the Trump-Munir summit is a geopolitical pivot. It signals a fragile US-Pakistan thaw, driven by Washington’s ally hunt and Pakistan’s economic crunch. For India, it’s a call to counter a US strategy cosying up to both rivals while eyeing Iran. Trump’s deal-making and Munir’s strategic charm aim to reposition Pakistan as a US cornerstone, potentially redrawing South Asia’s power map at India’s expense. Wednesday’s White House talks weren’t just diplomacy, they were a bold move in a high-stakes regional chess game.","The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz.

'Heartbreaking stories'

Public support





Britain took a historic step toward legalising euthanasia on Friday as Members of Parliament (MPs) backed a controversial bill that would introduce assisted dying for terminally ill people.In the House of Commons, lawmakers voted 314 to 291 in favour of sending the proposal to the House of Lords for further consideration, following four hours of emotional debate.The outcome sparked celebrations among supporters gathered outside Parliament, who argued that legalising euthanasia would offer dignity and choice to people facing incurable illnesses at the end of their lives.At the same time, opponents at a nearby counter-protest voiced concerns that vulnerable individuals could be pressured into choosing death and called on lawmakers to instead prioritise improvements in palliative care.The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill would allow assisted suicide in England and Wales for adults diagnosed with less than six months to live. Under the proposed law, individuals would need to self-administer the life-ending medication, and their decision would require approval from two doctors and a panel of experts.If passed, the bill would bring Britain in line with several countries in Europe and elsewhere — such as Belgium and the Netherlands — that have already legalised some form of assisted dying.Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, who introduced the bill, told Friday’s third reading debate that changing the law would “offer a compassionate and safe choice” to terminally ill people.She argued that keeping the current ban in place would result in more “heartbreaking stories” of “pain and trauma, suicide attempts, PTSD, lonely trips to Switzerland, (and) police investigations.”However, Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft raised concerns that the bill did not include strong enough safeguards to protect disabled individuals.“We have to protect those people who are susceptible to coercion, who already feel like society doesn't value them, who often feel like a burden to the state, society and their family,” she said.Outside Parliament, demonstrators held placards with messages such as “Let us choose” and “Don’t make doctors killers.”David Walker, 82, shared his personal story of supporting the bill after witnessing his wife suffer for three years toward the end of her life.“That’s why I’m here, because I can’t help her anymore, but I can help other people who are going through the same thing, because if you have no quality of life, you have nothing,” he told AFP.But Elizabeth Burden, a 52-year-old doctor, warned that the legislation could lead to a “slippery slope” where eligibility for assisted dying might expand.“Once we allow this. Everything will slip down because dementia patients, all patients... are vulnerable,” she told AFP.MPs had initially backed an earlier version of the bill in November by 330 to 275 votes. Since then, several changes have been made, including a ban on advertising assisted dying and provisions allowing all healthcare workers to opt out of participating in the process.Lawmakers also added a safeguard to prevent eligibility “solely as a result of voluntarily stopping eating or drinking,” effectively ruling out cases such as people with anorexia.Britain’s medical community remains divided, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s cabinet is also split. His health and justice secretaries have publicly opposed the proposed law.However, public support appears strong. A YouGov poll of 2,003 adults, conducted last month and published on Thursday, found that 73 per cent of respondents supported the introduction of an assisted dying law.The bill now moves to the House of Lords, which must approve the legislation before the end of the current parliamentary year, likely in the autumn, or it will lapse.If passed and granted royal assent, the law would take approximately four years to implement before assisted dying services become available.A government impact assessment published this month estimated that between 160 and 640 assisted deaths could take place in the first year, potentially rising to 4,500 annually within a decade.Assisted suicide is currently illegal in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, carrying a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.Meanwhile, a separate assisted dying bill is progressing through the devolved Scottish Parliament. In March, the Isle of Man became the first British territory to pass an assisted dying bill.",MPs vote 314 to 291 in favour of sending the bill to the House of Lords for further consideration. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill would allow assisted suicide in England and Wales for adults diagnosed with less than six months to live. Opponents say vulnerable individuals could be pressured into choosing death.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121978028,imgsize-79176,width-400,resizemode-4/121978028.jpg"

'Mehul Choksi's Extradition To India Will Be Tough' Says Former CBI Director

LONDON: Fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi is suing the Indian govt and five other people in the London high court for orchestrating what he refers to as his “kidnapping” from Antigua in 2021 in an alleged honeytrap plot.Choksi has claimed in the preliminary hearing that five people working for R&AW kidnapped him in Antigua and smuggled him on a yacht to Dominica in a plot masterminded by the Indian state in order to extradite him to India to face charges in the Rs 13,500 Punjab National Bank scam.Antigua police named Gurdip Bath, Barbara Jarabik, Gurmit Singh, Gurjit Singh Bhandal and Leslie Farrow-Guy as the five suspects, mostly UK-based, in the kidnapping. They are all being sued by Choksi alongside the Indian govt. They all deny the charges.The court documents were served on the ministry of external affairs by the British high commission in New Delhi.Edward Fitzgerald KC, representing Choksi (66), told Justice Freedman on Monday that Choksi was filing a civil suit against the Indian govt for allegedly ordering Choksi to be kidnapped on May 21, 2021 and smuggled by yacht to Dominica.India denies any involvement, argues it is protected by state immunity and that the UK courts do not have jurisdiction for this case.Harish Salve KC, representing India’s govt, said: “There is no evidence of India having anything to do with the alleged events. The claimant’s account is rife with non sequiturs and unsupported assumptions. Those accused seem a rather unlikely band of state-sponsored conspirators.”Choksi is currently in jail in Belgium where he is fighting extradition proceedings brought by India.Choksi first met Barbara Jarabik, a Hungarian luxury goods expert, in Antigua in Aug 2020.

"Tigers, jaguars and elephants are the latest to flee cartel violence in Mexico's Sinaloa",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/tigers-jaguars-and-elephants-are-the-latest-to-flee-cartel-violence-in-mexicos-sinaloa/articleshow/121305339.cms,"Photo: AP





CULIACAN: A pack of veterinarians clambered over hefty metal crates on Tuesday morning, loading them one by one onto a fleet of semi-trucks. Among the cargo: tigers, monkeys, jaguars, elephants and lions - all fleeing the latest wave of cartel violence eclipsing the northern Mexican city of Culiacan.For years, exotic pets of cartel members and circus animals have been living in a small animal refuge on the outskirts of Sinaloa 's capital. However, a bloody power struggle erupted last year between rival Sinaloa cartel factions, plunging the region into unprecedented violence and leaving the leaders of the Ostok Sanctuary reeling from armed attacks, constant death threats and a cutoff from essential supplies needed to keep their 700 animals alive.The aid organization is now leaving Culiacan and transporting the animals hours across the state in hopes that they'll escape the brunt of the violence. But fighting has grown so widespread in the region that many fear it will inevitably catch up.""We've never seen violence this extreme,"" said Ernesto Zazueta , president of the Ostok Sanctuary. ""We're worried for the animals that come here to have a better future.""Cartel factions battle Violence in the city exploded eight months ago when two rival Sinaloa Cartel factions began warring for territory after the dramatic kidnapping of the leader of one of the groups by a son of notorious capo Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman who then delivered him to U.S.authorities via a private plane.Since then, intense fighting between the heavily armed factions has become the new normal for civilians in Culiacan, a city which for years avoided the worst of Mexico's violence in large part because the Sinaloa Cartel maintained such complete control.""With the escalating war between the two factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, they have begun to extort, kidnap and rob cars because they need funds to finance their war,"" said security analyst David Saucedo . ""And the civilians in Culiacan are the ones that suffer.""Zazueta, the sanctuary director, said their flight from the city is another sign of just how far the warfare has seeped into daily life.This week, refuge staff loaded up roaring animals onto a convoy as some trainers attempted to sooth the animals. One murmured in a soft voice as he fed a bag of carrots to an elephant in a shipping container, ""I'm going to be right here, no one will do anything to you.""Veterinarians and animals, accompanied by the Mexican National Guard, began traveling along the freeway to seaside Mazatlan , where they planned to release the animals into another wildlife reserve.The relocation came after months of planning and training the animals, a move made by the organization in an act of desperation. They said the sanctuary was caught in the crossfire of the warfare because of its proximity to the town of Jesus Maria , a stronghold of Los Chapitos, one of the warring factions.'No safe place left these days' During intense periods of violence, staff at the sanctuary can hear gunshots echoing nearby, the roar of cars and helicopters overhead, something they say scares the animals. Cartel fighting regularly blocks staff off from reaching the sanctuary, and some animals have gone days without eating. Many have started to lose fur and at least two animals have died due to the situation, Zazueta said.Complicating matters is the fact that an increasing number of the animals they rescue are former narco pets left abandoned in rural swathes of the state. In one case, a Bengal tiger was discovered chained in a plaza, caught in the center of shootouts. Urban legends circulate in Sinaloa that capos feed their enemies to pet lions.Diego Garcia , a refuge staff member, is among those who travel out to rescue those animals. He said he regularly receives anonymous threats, with callers claiming to know his address and how to find him. He worries he'll be targeted for taking away the former pets of capos. Zazueta said the refuge also receives calls threatening to burn the sanctuary to the ground and kill the animals if payment isn't made.""There's no safe place left in this city these days,"" said Garcia.That's the feeling for many in the city of 1 million. When the sun rises, parents check for news of shootouts as if it were the weather, to determine if it's safe to send their kids to school. Burned houses sit riddled with bullets and occasionally bodies appear hanging from bridges outside the city. By night, Culiacan turns into a ghost town, leaving bars and clubs shuttered and many without work.""My son, my son, I'm here. I'm not going to leave you alone,"" screamed one mother, sobbing on the side of the road and cursing officials as they inspected her son's dead body, splayed out and surrounded by bullet casings late Monday night. ""Why do the police do nothing?"" she cried out.Displaced animals head for new refuge In February, while driving a refuge vehicle used for animal transport, Garcia said he was forced from the car by an armed, masked man in an SUV. At gunpoint, they stole the truck, animal medicine and tools used by the group for rescues and left him trembling on the side of the road.The breaking point for the Ostok Sanctuary came in March, when one of the two elephants in their care, Bireki, injured her foot. Veterinarians scrambled to find a specialist to treat her in Mexico, the United States and beyond. No one would brave the trip to Culiacan.""We asked ourselves, 'what are we doing here?'"" Zazueta said. ""We can't risk this happening again. If we don't leave, who will treat them?""The concern by many is that Mexico's crackdown on the cartels will be met with even more violent power moves by criminal organizations, as has happened in the past, said Saucedo, the security analyst.Zazueta blames local government and security forces for not doing more, and said their pleas for help in the past eight months have gone unanswered.Sinaloa's governor's office did not immediately respond to a request comment.The sanctuary made the move without any public announcement, worried that they might face repercussions from local officials or the same cartels forcing them to flee, but they hope the animals will find some relief in Mazatlan after years of conflict.Garcia, the sanctuary staff member, is not so sure. While he hopes for the best, he said he's also watched cartel violence spread like a cancer across the Latin American country. Mazatlan, too, is also facing bursts of violence, though nothing compared to the Sinaloan capital.""It's at least more stable,"" he said. ""Because here, today, it's just suffocating.""","The Ostok Sanctuary in Culiacan, Sinaloa, has been forced to relocate its 700 animals. The sanctuary has been caught in the crossfire of the war between rival cartel factions. Violence in the city has become the new normal for civilians in the northern city.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121305466,imgsize-511438,width-400,resizemode-4/121305466.jpg"

US secretary of state Marco Rubio slammed Democratic Senator Tim Kaine for questioning whether race played a role in the decision to grant refugee status to 59 white South African Afrikaners and said that it was you who is talking about the color of their skin.In a heated conversation at the Senate foreign relations committee session, Rubio defended the administration's acceptance of 59 Afrikaner refugees from South Africa.Kaine questioned the prioritisation of Afrikaners whilst cancelling established refugee programmes for other persecuted groups. This confrontation marked Rubio's most contentious interaction since his January confirmation hearing, occurring just before South African President Cyril Ramaphosa's scheduled White House meeting with Donald Trump.""Right now, the US refugee program allows a special program for Afrikaner farmers, the first group of whom arrived at Dulles airport in Virginia not long ago, while shutting off the refugee program for everyone else,"" said Kaine, Clinton's former vice-presidential running mate. ""Do you think Afrikaner farmers are the most persecuted group in the world?""Rubio defended the decision, stating the 49 admitted individuals had met all requirements and faced persecution in their homeland, where farms were being seized on racial grounds.This contrasted with Trump's suspension of the general refugee resettlement programme, which had affected 100,000 previously approved individuals.The debate intensified when Kaine highlighted other persecuted groups, including Uyghurs and Rohingyas. Rubio cited volume limitations, stating that millions of persecuted people worldwide couldn't all enter the US. Kaine dismissed claims of Afrikaner persecution as unfounded, noting an Afrikaner minister's presence in South Africa's coalition government.Kaine emphasised the historical absence of similar programmes for Black South Africans during apartheid, questioning the fairness of religious persecution criteria. The exchange grew tenser when discussing skin colour-based standards, with Rubio asserting US rights to prioritise admissions based on national interests.Kaine asked, “So you have a different standard based on the color of somebody’s skin. Would that be acceptable?” Rubio responded sharply, “You're the one who's talking about the colour of their skin, not me.”",US secretary of state Marco Rubio slammed Democratic Senator Tim Kaine for questioning whether race played a role in the decision to grant refugee status to 59 white South African Afrikaners.

Key figures at around 0230 GMT





HONG KONG: Crude prices surged Wednesday following a report that US intelligence suggested Israel was planning a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, which would send geopolitical tensions into overdrive and fuel regional conflict fears.While safe haven gold pushed almost two percent higher, the news from CNN appeared to be having little detrimental effect on Asian equities in early trade, with most extending the previous day's rally.Still, investors are keeping tabs on China-US relations after Beijing hit out at Washington's ""bullying"" over chip export controls, just over a week after the two sides dialled down trade tensions by temporarily slashing eye-watering tit-for-tat tariffs.Both main crude contracts jumped almost two percent after CNN reported multiple US officials as saying the government had received intelligence indicating Israel was preparing to target Iranian atomic facilities.There are fears that such a sharp escalation could tip the Middle East into a war, with tensions already high over Israel's strikes on Gaza.""This is the clearest sign yet of how high the stakes are in the US Iran nuclear talks and the lengths Israel may go to if Iran insists on maintaining its commercial nuclear capabilities,"" Robert Rennie, at Westpac Banking Corp, said.""Crude will maintain a risk premium as long as the current talks appear to be going nowhere.""Crude prices have risen around 15 percent since the start of the month on softening worries about the economic outlook as tariff tensions grow relatively calmer.Equities mostly built on Monday's gains on trade talk hopes.H ong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Wellington, Taipei and Manila all outshone Tokyo and Singapore.But the recent detente between China and the United States suffered a jolt Wednesday when Beijing slammed Washington's ""bullying"" chip export controls.It also warned it would take steps against measures aimed at restricting Chinese access to high-tech semiconductors and supply chains.The remarks came after US officials last week unveiled guidelines warning firms that using Chinese-made high-tech AI semiconductors, most notably tech giant Huawei's Ascend chips, would put them at risk of violating US export controls.Several Federal Reserve members appeared to dampen hopes they will cut US interest rates anytime soon as they warned over the effects of Trump's tariffs on the economy and inflation.St. Louis Fed chief Alberto Musalem warned the measures would likely hurt growth and jobs, even as countries look to dial down the blistering tariffs the president proposed.""Even after the de-escalation of May 12 (with China), they seem likely to have a significant impact on the near-term economic outlook,"" Musalem said.""On balance, tariffs are likely to dampen economic activity and lead to some further softening of the labour market.""He added that ""committing now to ignoring higher inflation from tariffs, or to easing policy, runs the risk of underestimating the level and persistence of inflation"".Atlanta Fed chief Raphael Bostic said Moody's ratings cut and Trump's proposed tax cuts could compound uncertainty and force officials to keep rates elevated.West Texas Intermediate: UP 1.9 percent at $63.22 per barrelBrent North Sea Crude: UP 1.8 percent at $66.56 per barrelTokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.1 percent at 37,491.80 (break)Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: UP 0.5 percent at 23,806.59Shanghai - Composite: UP 0.2 percent at 3,386.46Euro/dollar: UP at $1.1322 from $1.1284 on TuesdayPound/dollar: UP at $1.3425 from $1.3391Dollar/yen: DOWN at 144.07 yen from 144.47 yenEuro/pound: UP at 84.32 pence from 84.26 penceNew York - Dow: DOWN 0.3 percent at 42,677.24 (close)London - FTSE 100: UP 0.9 percent at 8,781.12 (close)","Crude prices surged Wednesday following a report that US intelligence suggested Israel was planning a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities.

"Chipping away at ties: China slams US AI chip curbs, vows retaliation against ‘bullying’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chipping-away-at-ties-china-slams-us-ai-chip-curbs-vows-retaliation-against-bullying/articleshow/121304850.cms,"China on Wednesday sharply rebuked the United States over its latest warnings against the use of Chinese-made artificial intelligence chips , calling Washington’s moves “unilateral bullying and protectionism” that threaten global tech supply chains The condemnation came after the US government issued fresh guidelines cautioning firms that using Chinese high-tech semiconductors, particularly Huawei’s Ascend AI chips, could place them at risk of violating American export controls.In a strongly worded statement, China’s commerce ministry accused the US of abusing its export control regime to suppress Chinese tech development. “These actions seriously harm the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises and endanger China's development interests,” the ministry said, warning that any party aiding in the enforcement of such measures could be in breach of Chinese law.Beijing also vowed to take “firm steps to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” though it did not specify what retaliatory actions might follow.The latest clash comes amid a years-long effort by Washington to restrict China’s access to advanced semiconductors over national security concerns. US officials fear that cutting-edge chips could be used to enhance Beijing’s military capabilities and undermine American dominance in AI and related technologies.Last week, the Biden administration, continuing policies initiated under President Donald Trump, announced it would rescind some export restrictions on advanced computing semiconductors. The move followed pressure from several countries arguing that the controls had cut them off from the critical tools needed for AI development.However, the relaxation was coupled with a renewed crackdown on Chinese access. The US commerce department reiterated that it aims to share American AI technology “with trusted foreign countries” while preventing adversaries from gaining access.Under the previous US policy, countries were grouped into three tiers, with top allies like Japan and South Korea exempt from restrictions. Nations in the second tier, including Mexico and Portugal, faced caps on the number of AI chips they could receive. The new revisions adjust those categories but still prioritise curbing China’s tech ascent.Industry giants like Nvidia and AMD, which had opposed the tiered restrictions, saw their stock prices rise following signs the Biden administration would recalibrate the rules. Yet the renewed focus on blocking Chinese firms from AI technology has rekindled tensions between the world’s two largest economies.As the global race for AI supremacy accelerates, the semiconductor battlefield is becoming increasingly geopolitical, with ramifications for supply chains, international trade, and diplomatic ties.",The US government issued fresh guidelines cautioning firms that using Chinese high-tech semiconductors could place them at risk of violating American export controls.

'Targeted for speaking out against Biden admin': Gabbard





US Senator Rand Paul said on Tuesday he has documents to confirm that under the previous Joe Biden administration, the TSA (Transportation Security Administration) put Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump's Director of National Intelligence, on its watchlist last year.The TSA watchlist allows federal air marshals to follow American citizens and collect information on their behaviour in an effort to stop threats from potential terrorists.""Just last night, I received the first set of records from the department (Homeland Security) regarding Tulsi Gabbard’s placement on the TSA Quiet Skies watchlist ,"" Fox News quoted Paul as saying.""These documents confirm our suspicions.

'Chance gone up significantly': US gathers intel on Israel preparing military strike on Iran nuclear sites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/chance-gone-up-significantly-us-gathers-intel-on-israel-preparing-military-strike-on-iran-nuclear-sites/articleshow/121304816.cms,"Representative Image





Fresh US intelligence suggests Israel's preparation for potential military action against Iranian nuclear installations, as reported by CNN, citing several US officials on Tuesday (local time). This development occurs while the Trump administration maintains its diplomatic engagement with Tehran.A source informed CNN, ""The chance of an Israeli strike on an Iranian nuclear facility has gone up significantly,"" especially if Washington cannot secure an agreement to restrict Iran's uranium enrichment programme.Although Israel has yet to make a final decision, officials familiar with the intelligence told CNN that the likelihood of a strike has grown significantly in recent months. They emphasized that Israel’s course of action will largely depend on the outcome of ongoing US-Iran negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program.The US assessment reportedly draws from both intercepted Israeli communications and observable military preparations, including the repositioning of aerial munitions and the completion of a major Israeli air exercise.However, US officials cautioned that these developments could also be part of a calculated effort by Israel to exert diplomatic pressure on Iran, rather than an indication of imminent military action.Any Israeli strike would represent a sharp departure from Trump’s current diplomatic strategy and could ignite a broader conflict in the already unstable Middle East. Since the outbreak of the Gaza war in 2023, the US has sought to prevent further escalation in the region.While Trump has threatened military action if talks with Iran break down, he has maintained a public commitment to diplomacy—for now. It was reported that in March, Trump sent a letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, setting a 60-day deadline to finalize a deal. That deadline has passed, and it has now been over five weeks since talks began.Meanwhile, a senior Western diplomat told that Trump recently signaled he would allow only a few more weeks for negotiations to succeed before turning to military options.Israel finds itself at a strategic crossroads. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under pressure to oppose a US-Iran deal he sees as insufficiently robust, while also striving to maintain Israel’s vital alliance with Washington.",US intelligence suggests Israel's preparation for potential military action against Iranian nuclear installations.

Newark airport restrictions extended till June: FAA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/flight-limits-at-newark-liberty-airport-extended-till-june-faa/articleshow/121302905.cms,"Newark Liberty International Airport (File)





The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Tuesday announced an extension till June of the current flight restrictions at the Newark Liberty International Airport.The curbs have been in effect ever since air traffic controllers first lost their radar and radios briefly last month.“Our goal is to relieve the substantial inconvenience to the travelling public from excessive flight delays due to construction, staffing challenges, and recent equipment issues, which magnify as they spread through the National Airspace System,” news agency AP quoted acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau as saying.Under the interim rule, the number of arrivals and departures at Newark Liberty are capped at 28 apiece per hour. That's in line with the limits imposed after about half a dozen air traffic controllers went on a 45-day ""trauma leave following"" an outage in April.In mid-June, the limit could be raised after a runway construction project largely wraps up, and the controllers on leave would be scheduled to return.Following that, as per the FAA, it could possibly increase the cap to 34 arrivals and 34 departures an hour, which would bring it closer to the 38 or 39 flights which typically took off and landed hourly before the problems.The FAA announcement, meanwhile, came a day after there was an outage at Newark, the airport's fourth since the last week of April.On April 28 and May 9, controllers at Philadelphia ATC, which directs planes in and out of Newark, were unable to see or communicate with the flights around the airport for as long as 90 seconds. This was because the main line which carries the radar signal down from another FAA facility in New York failed, and the backup line didn’t work immediately.The lines, some of which were old copper wires, failed a third time May 11, but the backup system worked and the radar stayed online.After the first outage, the already shorthanded Philadelphia ATC lost five to seven controllers to trauma leave. That left Newark unable to handle all the scheduled flights, leading to hundreds of cancellations and delays.The FAA quickly limited the number of flights to between 24 and 28 arrivals and the same number of departures every hour to ensure the remaining controllers could handle them safely.Officials have said the problems affecting Newark are a ""prime example"" of why the entire air traffic control system needs to be overhauled.Transportation secretary Sean Duffy announced a multibillion-dollar plan to upgrade America’s aging air traffic control system earlier this month. The House tentatively included $12.5 billion in the overarching bill that Republicans are trying to pass now, but officials have called that amount just a down payment on the overall plan.","The curbs have been in effect ever since air traffic controllers first lost their radar and radios briefly last month.

WASHINGTON: The Trump administration appears to have begun deporting people from Myanmar and Vietnam to South Sudan despite a court order restricting removals to other countries, attorneys for the migrants said in court documents.Immigration authorities may have sent up to a dozen people from several countries to Africa, they told a judge.Those removals would violate a court order saying people must get a ""meaningful opportunity"" to argue that sending them to a country outside their homeland would threaten their safety, attorneys said.The apparent removal of one man from Myanmar was confirmed in an email from an immigration official in Texas, according to court documents. He was informed only in English, a language he does not speak well, and his attorneys learned of the plan hours before his deportation flight, they said.A woman also reported that her husband, from Vietnam, and up to 10 other people were flown to Africa Tuesday morning, attorneys from the National Immigration Litigation Alliance wrote.They asked Judge Brian E. Murphy for an emergency court order to prevent the deportations. Murphy, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, previously found that any plans to deport people to Libya without notice would ""clearly"" violate his ruling, which also applies to people who have otherwise exhausted their legal appeals.A hearing in the case is set for Wednesday.The Department of Homeland Security and the White House did not immediately return messages seeking comment.Some countries do not accept deportations from the United States, which has led the Trump administration to strike agreements with other countries, including Panama, to house them. The Trump administration has sent Venezuelans to a notorious prison in El Salvador under an 18th-century wartime law hotly contested in the courts.South Sudan has suffered repeated waves of violence since gaining independence from Sudan in 2011 amid hopes it could use its large oil reserves to bring prosperity to a region long battered by poverty. Just weeks ago, the country's top UN official warned that fighting between forces loyal to the president and a vice president threatened to spiral again into full-scale civil war.The situation is ""darkly reminiscent of the 2013 and 2016 conflicts, which took over 400,000 lives,"" Nicholas Haysom, head of the almost 20,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission.The U.S. State Department's annual report on South Sudan, published in April 2024, says ""significant human rights issues"" include arbitrary killings, disappearances, torture or inhumane treatment by security forces and extensive violence based on gender and sexual identity.The US Homeland Security Department has given Temporary Protected Status to a small number of South Sudanese already living in the United States since the country was founded in 2011, shielding them from deportation because conditions were deemed unsafe for return. Secretary Kristi Noem recently extended those protections to November to allow for a more thorough review.","Immigration authorities may have sent up to a dozen people from several countries to Africa, they told a judge.

US president Donald Trump on Wednesday accused the preceding Biden administration of treason by having an ""open-border"" policy that allegedly allowed criminals into the country.Writing on social media, Truth Social, Trump said it wasn't Biden but the former president's administration that was responsible for the border policy, as they were aware of the former president's cognitive decline.""Joe Biden was not for open borders, he never talked about open borders, where criminals of all kinds, shapes, and sizes can flow into our country at will.

How inmates escaped

Fifth arrest made





A prison staffer has been arrested after he reportedly admitted to have helped 10 inmates escape a New Orleans jail last week.Maintenance worker Sterling Williams was asked by one of the escapees to ""turn the water off in the cell” before the men slipped through the hole, according to a statement by the office of the Louisiana attorney general.As per an arrest affidavit, the man threatened to ""shank"" (slang for stab) Williams if the latter did not turn off the water. Another inmate tried to take Williams’ phone and attempted to get him to bring a book with cash app information.However, the affidavit noted that the 33-year-old “wilfully and maliciously assisted” the inmates, and that without his help, the group would have flooded the cell, which would have drawn attention to their efforts.Williams is charged with 10 counts of principle to simple escape and one count of malfeasance in office. Each charge carries a $100,000 bond.Michael Kennedy, his appointed attorney, said at this time “we have every intention of entering a plea of not guilty.”During a tense New Orleans City Council meeting on Tuesday, the sheriff who oversees the Orleans Justice Centre, detailed how the group escaped.""The inmates removed a sink-toilet combination unit from a cell, then cut the steel bars behind the cell room sink. After bending the bars they slipped out.

US court says Trump administration may have violated order by sending migrants to South Sudan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-court-says-trump-administration-may-have-violated-order-by-sending-migrants-to-south-sudan/articleshow/121302288.cms,"Donald Trump (File Image)





The Trump administration appeared to have breached the court order by deporting several immigrants from Myanmar and Vietnam to South Sudan, a federal judge said on Tuesday.During an urgent virtual session in Boston, US district Judge Brian Murphy informed a department of justice attorney that this potential violation could amount to criminal contempt. He was weighing ordering the aircraft transporting the migrants to the African nation to return, Reuters reproted.Previously, Judge Murphy had prohibited the Trump administration from expeditiously deporting migrants to countries other than their origin without first addressing their concerns about potential torture or persecution.Legal representatives in a class action lawsuit informed Murphy that approximately eleven migrants detained in Texas were transported to South Sudan on Tuesday morning. Among them was a Myanmar national whose solicitor received notification from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement about the planned deportation.The legal team discovered their client's deportation to South Sudan on Tuesday morning. Court documents showed an email from a Vietnamese detainee's spouse at Port Isabel Detention Centre in Texas, reporting that he and ten others were presumably deported. The group included nationals from Laos, Thailand, Pakistan and Mexico, with the spouse pleading, ""Please help! They cannot be allowed to do this.""The migrants' advocates highlighted South Sudan's dangerous conditions, even for residents. The United Nations cautioned about the country's deteriorating political situation potentially rekindling the civil war that concluded in 2018.The Department of Homeland Security remained unresponsive to comment requests. In February, the department directed immigration officers to examine cases of protected individuals for possible re-detention and third-country deportation.On April 18, Murphy, appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden, issued a preliminary injunction ensuring migrants' due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. The order required advance written notice for deportations to unlisted countries and opportunities to express safety concerns.The administration must allow migrants at least 15 days to challenge deportation decisions if officials determine their safety concerns unreasonable.Murphy subsequently amended his injunction to prevent DHS from transferring migrants to other agencies for rapid deportations, following the defence department's transportation of four Venezuelans from Guantanamo Bay to El Salvador. The judge stated that similar military-operated transfers to Libya would constitute a clear violation.South Sudan’s political landscape is fragile and recent violence between government troops and armed opposition groups has escalated tensions.","Migrants from Myanmar and Vietnam were transported to South Sudan.

Pakistan Supreme Court upholds death penalty in beheading case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-supreme-court-upholds-death-penalty-in-beheading-case/articleshow/121300483.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Tuesday upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer , convicted of the gruesome 2021 murder of Noor Mukadam, the 27-year-old daughter of a former Pakistani diplomat.The decision, delivered by a three-member bench led by Justice Hashim Kakar, reaffirmed the judiciary’s stance on a case that has gripped the nation and exposed deep-seated issues of gender violence and privilege in Pakistan’s elite circles. The ruling, however, also raises questions about the consistency of justice in a country where systemic inequalities often shield the powerful.The case, one of the most high-profile in Pakistan’s recent history, stems from the horrific events of July 20, 2021, when Noor Mukadam was found tortured and beheaded at Jaffer’s residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4.Jaffer, a Pakistani-American and son of a wealthy industrialist, was arrested at the scene, covered in blood. Investigations revealed that Mukadam, a childhood acquaintance, was held hostage for two days, tortured with a knuckleduster, raped, and ultimately decapitated after allegedly rejecting Jaffer’s marriage proposal. The brutality of the crime, coupled with the elite status of both the victim and the perpetrator, sparked nationwide outrage and reignited debates over violence against women in Pakistan.The apex court’s verdict dismissed Jaffer’s appeal, which claimed “erroneous appreciation” of evidence and questioned the fairness of the trial due to media influence. The court upheld the death penalty for murder but converted Jaffer’s second death sentence for rape to life imprisonment, citing legal considerations.“This is not just my daughter’s case; it is a case for all the daughters of Pakistan,” said Shaukat Mukadam, Noor’s father. The ruling has been hailed by many as a victory for accountability, with social media posts on X reflecting public relief: “I hope Noor’s parents will sleep a little better tonight,” wrote one user, while another called it a “win for humanity.” Yet, the decision also exposes uncomfortable truths about Pakistan’s legal and social landscape.Critics argue that the case’s prominence owes much to the victim’s elite background, highlighting a stark disparity in how justice is pursued. “Mukadam’s status as a diplomat’s daughter shone a spotlight on her murder,” said women’s rights activist Tahira Abdullah, noting that countless similar cases involving less privileged women rarely garner such attention or swift judicial action. Pakistan ranks 153 out of 156 countries in the World Economic Forum’s 2021 gender gap index, and domestic violence remains a pervasive issue, with 28% of women aged 15-49 reporting physical violence, according to the ministry of human rights.","The Supreme Court of Pakistan upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer.

Pakistan promotes army chief Munir to 5-star rank of Field Marshal for ‘crushing enemy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-promotes-army-chief-munir-to-5-star-rank-of-field-marshal-for-crushing-enemy/articleshow/121300334.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: The Shehbaz Sharif govt in Pakistan promoted Tuesday army chief Syed Asim Munir from general to the five-star rank of Field Marshal in recognition of what it described as “exemplary leadership” while responding to India’s Operation Sindoor and bringing “great honour to our motherland”.For a country that has had four military rulers at different periods in its history, Field Marshal Munir is only the second Army chief to have been elevated to the apex rank, modelled on the British army’s structure. The first one, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, assumed the rank in 1959 while he was President, citing “requests” from Pakistani civil society.PM Shehbaz’s office announced that the cabinet unanimously decided to also continue the services of Air Chief Marshal Zahar Ahmed Babar Sidhu after his term ends.The statement also claimed that Pakistan downed five Indian jets and thwarted “further incursions”, leading to a US-mediated pause in military operations from May 10. Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, quoted Field Marshal Munir as dedicating the honour to “the nation, armed forces, and martyrs”.In a congratulatory statement on X, Shehbaz credited Field Marshal Munir with orchestrating a “high strategy” during the conflict with India, which escalated with the latter’s May 6-7 airstrikes targeting nine terrorist sites.Operation Sindoor was India’s response to 26 deaths in the April 22 terrorist attack on tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam.Without naming India, Shehbaz said that under Field Marshal Munir, the army “crushed the enemy’s nefarious designs”.With Pakistan’s history of military coups looming large, newly coronated Field Marshal Munir is widely seen as the kingmaker behind Shehbaz’s premiership. Critics of the move within Pakistan argue the promotion strengthens the military’s grip over civilian governance, especially amid domestic challenges like the Baloch insurgency and economic woes.The timing of the promotion, coinciding with Pakistan seeking US and EU’s support to counter “India’s terrorism narrative”, suggests a bid to project strength.While the PM's office and ISPR frame Field Marshal Munir’s elevation as a tribute to national resilience, its political undertones and opaque military claims raise concerns about democratic backsliding and regional instability.","Shehbaz Sharif govt in Pakistan promoted Tuesday army chief Syed Asim Munir from general to the five-star rank of Field Marshal.

A 4.7-magnitude earthquake hit Pakistan's Swat district and nearby regions on Sunday, according to ARY News.The quake struck at a depth of 205 kilometres, with its epicentre in the Hindukush mountain range — a known seismic zone spanning parts of Afghanistan and northern Pakistan.Tremors were felt across several areas of Swat, including Mingora and its outskirts. Authorities confirmed there were no immediate reports of damage.Earlier, on May 12, a 4.9-magnitude earthquake had shaken Quetta, the capital of Balochistan.The National Seismic Monitoring Centre (NSMC) confirmed that the 4.9-magnitude tremors affected Quetta and neighbouring regions. The quake's epicentre was situated west of Quetta, according to NSMC data.The tremor came just two days after Pakistan was hit by two consecutive earthquakes on Saturday — a 5.7-magnitude quake in the morning and a 4.0-magnitude tremor later in the day, according to Reuters.Pakistan's geographical position makes it particularly vulnerable to seismic activity, as it sits at the intersection of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The country's territory is traversed by numerous significant fault lines, resulting in frequent and potentially damaging earthquakes.","A 4.7-magnitude earthquake hit Pakistan's Swat district and nearby regions on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan late Saturday revealed that it too would launch a diplomatic campaign led by foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to present its narrative to the world. This comes after India announced it would dispatch seven all-party delegations to key capitals to brief global leaders on Operation Sindoor and its counter-terrorism efforts “I was contacted earlier today by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who requested that I lead a delegation to present Pakistan's case for peace on the international stage. I am honoured to accept this responsibility and remain committed to serving Pakistan in these challenging times,” Bhutto-Zardari wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday.However, there was no official confirmation of the campaign from the Pakistan government.The announcement follows India’s decision to send seven all-party delegations to key global capitals to brief foreign governments on its precision military strikes under Operation Sindoor.

Human rights violations in Sindh





Jeay Sindh Freedom Movement ( JSFM ), a political group advocating for Sindhu Desh, staged a peaceful sit-in protest on a highway in Pakistan on Friday, demanding the release of missing and jailed Sindhi nationalists. With traffic halted and slogans echoing through the air, the group sought global attention to enforced disappearances , illegal detentions, and human rights abuses in Sindh and Balochistan.JSFM leaders, including chairman Sohail Abro, Zubair Sindhi, and Amar Azadi, called for the immediate release of Zahid Channa, Sajad Channa, Adnan Baloch, Badshah Baloch, Rafiqat Manghanhar, and Shahid Soomro. They also demanded that false charges against them be withdrawn and that all forcibly arrested persons be freed.""This peaceful sit-in serves as a protest against the unlawful arrests of our nationalist activists, the abuses occurring in jails, and the enforced disappearances. Our effort is peaceful and democratic, and we will persist until our people are free,"" the collective statement read.The protestors warned the Hyderabad Jail authorities against further mistreatment of detainees and threatened to block the prison’s main gate if abuse continued.They also called out to international organisations like the UN, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch, urging intervention and global condemnation of Pakistan's rights violations.A 2022 US State Department report, had pointed out widespread cases of extrajudicial killings and the recovery of mutilated bodies across Sindh.In 2024, Abro had also appealed for help in the case of Priya Kumari, a missing Hindu girl, stressing rising cases of forced conversions and marriages to Muslim men.Sindhis have been historically struggling for identity and autonomy. They accuse the Pakistani state of erasing local culture through systemic oppression—citing Urdu imposition, the ‘One unit’ policy, and historic land grabs like the removal of Karachi from Sindh.Meanwhile, in related developments, Balochistan declared independence from Pakistan this week. On social media, hashtags like #RepublicOfBalochistan trended, with users sharing proposed flags and maps.","Jeay Sindh Freedom Movement (JSFM) staged a peaceful sit-in protest on a highway in Pakistan on Friday, demanding the release of missing and jailed Sindhi nationalists.

Decreasing day by day



Use less water







KABUL: Every week, Bibi Jan scrapes together some of her husband's meagre daily wage to buy precious water from rickshaw-drawn tankers that supply residents of Afghanistan's increasingly parched capital.Kabul faces a looming water crisis, driven by unruly and rapid urbanisation, mismanagement over years of conflict, and climate change, meaning people like Bibi Jan are sometimes forced to choose between food and water.""When my children have only tea for a few days, they say, 'You bought water and nothing for us',"" the 45-year-old housewife told AFP, describing reusing her supplies for bathing, dishes and laundry.Experts have long sounded the alarm over Kabul's water problems, which are worsening even as many international players have backed off big infrastructure projects and slashed funding to Afghanistan since the Taliban government took power in 2021.""There could be no ground water in Kabul by 2030"" without urgent action, the UN children's agency Unicef warned last year.Other experts are more cautious, citing limited consistent and reliable data, but say the situation is clearly deteriorating.A 2030 cliff is a ""worst-case scenario"", said water resources management expert Assem Mayar.But even if slated development projects are completed in a few years, it ""doesn't mean the situation would become better than now"", Mayar said.""As time goes on, the problems are only increasing,"" he added, as population growth outstrips urban planning and climate change drives below-average precipitation.The Taliban authorities have launched projects ranging from recycling water to building hundreds of small dams across the country, but larger interventions remain hampered by financing and technical capacity.They remain unrecognised by any country since they ousted the Western-backed government and imposed their severe interpretation of Islamic law, with restrictions on women a major sticking point.They have repeatedly called for non-governmental groups to reboot stalled projects on water and climate change, as Afghanistan faces ""some of the harshest effects"" in the region, according to the United Nations.The water and energy ministry wants to divert water from the Panjshir river to the capital, but needs $300 million to $400 million. A dam project near Kabul would ease pressures but was delayed after the Taliban takeover.For now, Kabul's primary drinking water source is groundwater, as much as 80 percent of which is contaminated, according to a May report by Mercy Corps.It is tapped by more than 100,000 unregulated wells across the city that are regularly deepened or run dry, the NGO said.Groundwater can be recharged, but more is drawn each year than is replenished in Kabul, with an estimated annual 76-million-cubic-metre (20-billion-gallon) deficit, experts say.""It's a very serious problem... Water is decreasing day by day in the city,"" said Shafiullah Zahidi, who heads central Kabul operations for the state-owned water company UWASS.Water systems designed decades ago serve just 20 percent of the city's population, which has exploded to around six million over the past 20 years, said Zahidi.At one of Kabul's 15 pumping stations, maintenance manager Mohammad Ehsan said the seven-year-old well is already producing less water. Two others nearby sit dry.""The places with shallower water levels are dried out now,"" said 53-year-old Ehsan, who has worked in water management for two decades, as he stood over an old well.It once produced water from a depth of 70 metres (230 feet), but a newer well had to be bored more than twice as deep to reach groundwater.At one of the two large stations in the city, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) recently procured four new pumps where only one had been functioning.""If that pump collapsed for any reason, that means stopping the service for 25,000 beneficiary households,"" which now have uninterrupted water, said Baraa Afeh, ICRC's deputy water and habitat coordinator.Everyone in Kabul ""should have 24-hour service"", said Zahidi, from the state water company.But in reality, Bibi Jan and many other Kabulis are forced to lug water in heavy jugs from wells or buy it from tankers.These suppliers charge at least twice as much as the state-owned utility, with potable water even more pricy in a country where 85 percent of the population lives on less than a dollar a day.Bibi Jan said she has to police her family's water use carefully.""I tell them, 'I'm not a miser but use less water.' Because if the water runs out then what would we do?""","Kabul faces a looming water crisis, driven by unruly and rapid urbanisation, mismanagement over years of conflict, and climate change. The Taliban authorities have launched projects ranging from recycling water to building hundreds of small dams across the country. But larger interventions remain hampered by financing and technical capacity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121303651,imgsize-1309661,width-400,resizemode-4/121303651.jpg"

Breeding ground for violence

Nowruz holiday declared 'un-Islamic'

Women's rights in decline

Afghans deported from Iran





Amid many other global crises, the human rights situation in Afghanistan has been overshadowed in the international media. Millions of people continue to suffer from systemic rights violations under the Taliban-run government, a UN report has found.Tasked with assisting the people of Afghanistan, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) monitors the human rights situation in the country, issuing regular reports. In its latest update on the human rights situation in Afghanistan, UNAMA not only documented cases of gender-based violence and public floggings but also the growing persecution of the Ismaili community.Ismailism is a branch of Shia Islam, while Sunni Islam is the dominant religion in Afghanistan. Most members of the Ismaili community live in the country's northern provinces, such as Badakhshan or Baghlan. In the former, there have been at least 50 cases of members of the Ismaili community being forced to convert to the Sunni faith. Those who refused to do so were subjected to physical assaults, coercion and death threats.""They are only accepted as Muslims if they profess the Sunni faith by force,"" Yaqub Yasna, a professor and member of the Afghan Ismaili community, told DW.Yasna himself was accused of blasphemy after the Taliban takeover of 2021 because he advocated enlightenment and tolerance in society. He was forced to step down from his position at his university and went into exile for fear of reprisals.Yasna said that even before the Taliban's return to power, tolerance toward the Ismaili minority in Afghanistan was limited but that the political system had at least protected their civil rights.He said that under the Taliban, tolerance had continued to decline steadily. ""When their rights are violated today, they don't know who they can turn to. Their children are forced to profess the Sunni faith,"" he explained. ""Under Taliban rule, only one faith is considered legitimate. Anything that deviates from their interpretation of Islam is rejected and thus creates a breeding ground for violence against religious minorities. ""Afghan human rights activist Abdullah Ahmadi confirmed there was increasing pressure on one of the last remaining religious minorities in Afghanistan. ""We have received several reports showing that children from the Ismaili community are being forced to attend Sunni-run religious schools. If they refuse to do so, or do not attend classes regularly, their families have to pay heavy fines,"" he said.Ahmadi complained that the international community had responded only hesitantly to the human rights violations in his country. He called for targeted sanctions against Taliban officials, saying they ""must be held accountable.""Historically, the country was a significant center of religious diversity, but there are very few members of non-Muslim communities left in Afghanistan today.The last members of the Jewish community left the country in September 2021. Those Christians who still live there tend to practice their faith in secret. And the Hazaras, another ethnic minority in Afghanistan who are predominantly Shiite, continue to be persecuted.The Taliban only accept one interpretation of religion and have banned certain rituals and festivals, including Nowruz, which marks the beginning of spring and a new year. They declared the holiday ""un-Islamic"" and said that nobody in Afghanistan should observe the celebration.The situation of all women is also getting worse, which means that half of society is subject to systematic oppression. According to the UNAMA report, girls continue to be ""barred from participating in education beyond grade six"" and there has been ""no announcement made by the de facto authorities regarding the reopening of high schools and universities to girls and women.""In the western city of Herat, the Taliban has confiscated several rickshaws and warned drivers not to transport women who were unaccompanied by a ""mahram,"" a close male relative.Despite this disastrous situation, Afghans who fled to neighboring countries are being expelled en masse. According to the United Nations, around 110,000 people, including women and children, were forced to return in April. Large numbers of people are also being deported from Iran.""We live in fear of being deported to Afghanistan every day,"" Afghan journalist Marzia Rahimi told DW. ""What am I supposed to do with my children there?""Rahimi said that only misery and terror awaited her in Afghanistan if she returned, explaining that she had left because she was unable to continue working as a journalist under Taliban rule and would not have been able to provide her daughter with an education.Most independent media outlets have been banned or placed under the control of the state. Journalists who criticize the regime risk being arrested and tortured.Under the Taliban, the country has also been plunged into an even more catastrophic socioeconomic crisis. Some 64% of the population of 41.5 million lives in poverty, according to the UN, with 50% dependent on humanitarian aid for survival and 14% suffering from acute hunger.","The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) monitors the human rights situation in the country.

Balochistan ‘Quakes’ After Deadly Blast Near Pak Security Base; ‘Over Two Dozen Casualties…’





Four people died and 20 were injured in a car bomb explosion on Sunday night, in Qillah Abdullah, a city in Balochistan province bordering Afghanistan.Several shops and the outer wall of a nearby building housing paramilitary forces were damaged.No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing, according to deputy commissioner Abdullah Riaz, news agency AP reported.The ethnic Baloch separatists remain under suspicion as they frequently target security forces and civilians in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan.Shahid Rind, a spokesperson for the Balochistan government, condemned the bombing and said an investigation is underway.Balochistan has been a focal point of a prolonged insurgency in Pakistan, with various separatist groups carrying out attacks, including the banned Balochistan Liberation Army , which was labeled a terrorist organization by the United States in 2019.Pakistan frequently accuses its rival India of backing the BLA and the Pakistani Taliban, both of which have escalated their attacks in Pakistan in recent months. One of the deadliest of these assaults occurred in March, when BLA insurgents killed 33 people, mostly soldiers, in an attack on a train carrying hundreds of passengers in Balochistan.On May 11, the BLA called for Indian support against Pakistan, making the appeal amid heightened tensions between the two countries.India has not yet responded to the BLA’s overture.The BLA further denied claims that it operated as an Indian proxy and said, “If we receive political, diplomatic and defense support from the world, especially from India, the Baloch nation can eliminate this terrorist state and lay the foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and independent Balochistan.”The group assured the Indian government that, if provided support, its fighters would open an additional front against Pakistan's military near the Afghan border, an area where the Pakistani Taliban maintains strongholds.","Four people died and 20 were injured in a car bomb explosion on Sunday night, in Qillah Abdullah, a city in Balochistan province bordering Afghanistan.

An earthquake of 4.2 magnitude has jolted Afghanistan in the early hours of Monday, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS). The tremors occurred around 08.54 am IST and were recorded at a depth of 140 kms.The NCS posted the details of the earthquake on its X account. The epicenter was located at a latitude of 36.41 N and longitude of 70.94 E. This is the fourth consecutive earthquake to hit the country in the last four days.Earlier on Sunday, a 4.5-magnitude earthquake shook Afghanistan. According to the NCS, it occurred at a depth of 150 kilometres.Previously on 17 May, an earthquake of magnitude 4.2 struck the region.On 16 May, another earthquake of magnitude 4.0 struck the region.Experts suggested that deeper earthquakes are less dangerous than shallow earthquakes because the seismic waves travel a longer distance before reaching the earth's surface due to which they lose their energy.Afghanistan has a history of powerful earthquakes. According to the Red Cross, the Hindu Kush region is a geologically active area where earthquakes occur every year.Afghanistan is situated on several fault lines between the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates, making it a seismically active region. A major fault line also runs directly through Herat. These plates meet and collide resulting in frequent seismic activity.According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( UNOCHA ), Afghanistan remains highly vulnerable to natural disasters. This also includes seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.UNOCHA noted that these frequent earthquakes in Afghanistan can cause damage to vulnerable communities that are already struggling with decades of conflict and under-development. These challenges have left them with limited capacity to cope with multiple disasters at once.","Afghanistan is situated on several fault lines between the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates, making it a seismically active region.

'Some teachers will buy pads for us'



Cloth pads can be unsafe



Government initiatives fall short



New vouchers expected this year







When 14-year-old Janani gets her period, she doesn't always make it to school. Some days, there are no sanitary pads at home, and Janani is forced to use a pad made from old clothes. On those days, she skips classes.""I feel ashamed of using cloth,"" Janani told DW. ""If we miss school because of this, they won't teach us again the lessons we've missed, will they?""A survey conducted by DW of more than 500 girls across six schools in Sri Lanka's Central Province indicated that nearly half — 46% — struggled to afford pads each month, with the figure skyrocketing to 81% at one school.Janani's mother works as a tea plucker in the hills of Nuwara Eliya District and earns about 1,350 rupees (around €4 or $4.5) per day. She buys her daughter pads when she can afford it. When she has no pads, Janani said, she wonders ""why I get my period at all.""Almost half of the girls surveyed by DW said they missed school during their period for a myriad of reasons, including excessive pain. And it is affecting their school performance.""I keep thinking about it, and so I can't study,"" said 14-year-old Girija referring to period poverty , a sentiment echoed by some of her peers.Sri Lanka's government is making an effort to address the problem as its economy inches towards recovery following an economic collapse in 2022.The cost of a pack of 10 sanitary napkins increased by 92% after the economic crisis, from 140 to 270 rupees, according to the Advocata Institute. Imported sanitary pads continue to be taxed in Sri Lanka at 51%.Teacher Anthonyraj Devaneshi told DW that her school gave out one sanitary pad to girls in emergency situations, but could not afford to give them out consistently.""Some teachers will buy pads for us, but others won't,"" said 12-year-old Harini, adding that she found it awkward to ask and would usually ask her friends to do it on her behalf. ""If my friends aren't at school [when I get my period], I'll just come home.""Harini has to make the long journey home by herself if her parents are unable to pick her up — a walk which takes her an hour through the hills.Her school also has no place for girls to dispose of their sanitary pads, with several girls telling DW they avoided changing at school. Two schools had a policy requiring students who took a pad from school to purchase a replacement and hand it in the next day.A 2021 study by Advocata revealed that half of Sri Lankan women did not spend any money on sanitary products.Rashmira Balasuriya, director of the Arka Initiative to combat period poverty and technical advisor to Sri Lanka's Family Planning Association, said the issue had ""most likely gotten worse"" following the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis.To save money, many girls use cloth. About 44% of the girls surveyed by DW reported using a combination of cloth and pads or exclusively cloth during their period, although not all of them cited unaffordability as the reason.Balasuriya said the lack of sunlight in Sri Lanka's hill country meant cloth pads were not always safe to use, because they would not properly dry.Girija told DW she had started using pads after developing an infection from cloth. ""Using cloth is hard. It feels like it's not secure,"" she said. ""I feel scared to sit because I'm worried something might happen. It's hard to walk, to sit, or to sleep.""At least a dozen other girls told DW they had also developed infections from using cloth.Girija said her family took out loans from the store to buy pads and she felt angry with her mother when they could not afford them. However, her mother told her, ""It doesn't matter if we have to use cloth, you use pads."" Still, Girija only changes her pad only once every seven hours, afraid of running out.""When we use cloth for too long, sometimes it burns,"" said 13-year-old Saraswathi, who sometimes uses cloth pads even at school, although she avoids changing for the entire day. ""It's difficult to walk with cloth, and my hips hurt.""Teacher Thiruchelvam Mangala Roobini said there was also a lack of awareness around menstruation, with many girls who lacked pads forced to bleed through their underwear, which they would then dispose of in the toilets.Last year, the Sri Lankan government distributed two vouchers of 600 rupees each to 800,000 schoolgirls, with the last disbursement given in September 2024. The goal of the scheme was to allow the girls to buy sanitary pads.But Balasuriya said the voucher system was ""not a sustainable one,"" as the average woman needs about 20 pads over five days in a single month, and the money was simply insufficient. Some girls told DW the pads they purchased had run out in one or two months.Roobini believes that many girls did not purchase sanitary pads with the vouchers, citing previous instances where shoe vouchers provided by the government had been used to purchase other necessities.One school principal told DW he was ""100% sure"" that the sanitary pad voucher had even been used to purchase alcohol.The current government, led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake, announced in March that it would spend 1.44 billion rupees on a similar initiative, distributing two vouchers of 720 rupees each to all menstruating schoolgirls.A representative from the Department of Education told DW the initiative would begin again at the end of May, but it was not possible to say whether it would continue after the two sets of voucher disbursements. The lawmakers have yet to decide on the issue.""If they give us pads continuously, it'll be good,"" 14-year-old Girija told DW. ""Then they won't run out, right? We can keep using them.""","Nearly half of Sri Lankan girls struggle to afford sanitary pads each month. The cost of a pack of 10 sanitary napkins increased by 92% after the economic crisis.

Will the agreement boost UK economic growth ?



Could the defence pact shift the landscape?



Does the deal mean a loss of UK sovereignty?

What comes next?







LONDON: Britain has hailed Monday's strategic partnership agreement with the European Union as the start of a new era, but the effects of the deal on defence and trade remain unclear.That is one of Prime Minister Keir Starmer 's key arguments for restoring closer ties with the EU.This deal, along with those signed earlier in May with the United States and India, ""release us from the tired arguments of the past and, as an independent sovereign nation, allow us to seize the opportunities of the future"", the Labour leader told parliament on Tuesday.The 2021 post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreement did not reinstate tariffs between the UK and EU, but introduced new trade barriers.The easing of veterinary checks and rules on food and drink trade, agreed on Monday, could increase UK exports to the EU by more than 22 percent, according to a study by the universities of Bristol and Aston.The deal also exempts UK businesses from the EU's carbon border tax, saving more than £800 million ($1.07 billion) a year, according to Starmer's office.Industry body UK Steel called it ""a significant step in reducing trade frictions in steel with the EU"".The UK government expects estimated economic gains of ""nearly £9 billion"" by 2040 -- but that amounts to less than 0.3 percent of the country's GDP.London and Brussels signed a pact to deepen defence cooperation, aimed at strengthening dialogue.The stakes are high given Russia's threat to European security, cyber dangers and concerns that the United States is disengaging from Europe.But Ed Arnold of the UK defence think tank RUSI said the agreement sets out ""no tangible deliverables or milestones, instead relying on vague commitments to talk more"".""To 'consider' participation is not a commitment to deploy, and as such does not compromise government sovereignty in any way,"" he said.""The real meat, the question of UK participation in defence industrial cooperation, is left still to be done,"" said Ian Bond, deputy director at the Centre for European Reform.""That's not a surprise but this is an indication that there is still a lot of work,"" he added.Conservatives and the Eurosceptic Reform UK party accused the government of handing over sovereignty to the EU.Opposition leader Kemi Badenoch on Tuesday described the deal as a ""betrayal"" and a ""failure"".The Sun tabloid accused Starmer of agreeing to adopt Brussels' rules, ""bow down to EU judges"" and criticised its agreement to allow French boats to continue fishing in UK waters for another 12 years.On sanitary and phytosanitary standards, the UK will have to align with EU regulations and adapt to future changes. Any disputes will ultimately be settled by the European Court of Justice.The UK will have little influence over future rules affecting its own territory, said Tom Bradshaw, president of the main farming union NFU.""Despite the benefits this deal brings, full dynamic (regulatory) alignment comes at a significant cost of committing to future EU rules, in which the UK will have little say,"" he said.While London conceded more than expected on fisheries -- extending EU access to British waters due to expire next year for 12 years until June 2038, the sector accounts for just 0.03 per cent of UK GDP.British fishers already export three-quarters of their catch to the EU, and the standards agreement will be ""hugely beneficial"", said Bond.Several issues remained unresolved after Monday's summit, including an EU-backed youth mobility scheme and the UK's potential return to the Erasmus student exchange programme , both priorities for Brussels.London, for its part, is seeking relaxed visa rules for touring artists and mutual recognition of professional qualifications.The two sides agreed to hold a bilateral summit every year.Some observers see the outlines of a relationship similar to Switzerland's, based on multiple bilateral agreements with the EU.The idea, particularly on mobility, is to strike specific arrangements in areas where the EU also sees a mutual benefit, said Bond.","UK and Brussels signed a pact to deepen defence cooperation, aimed at strengthening dialogue.

Tommy Robinson case: Why was he jailed and why is he being released early?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/tommy-robinson-case-why-was-he-jailed-and-why-is-he-being-released-early/articleshow/121293523.cms,"Why was Robinson jailed?

Why he’s being released early





Far-right figure Tommy Robinson is set to be released from prison four months early after the UK high court reduced his 18-month sentence for contempt of court . Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon , was jailed in October 2023 for repeatedly breaching an injunction banning him from spreading false claims about a Syrian refugee. His early release follows a court ruling that accepted he had shown a willingness to comply with the order, despite lacking any clear signs of remorse.Robinson, was jailed in October 2023 for breaching a court order that prohibited him from repeating libellous claims about a Syrian teenager. The case stemmed from false allegations Robinson made in 2018, when he described then-schoolboy Jamal Hijazi as a violent bully in videos shared online. These claims were later proven to be untrue, with Hijazi successfully suing Robinson for libel in 2021 and being awarded £100,000 in damages.Following the libel ruling, an injunction was issued to prevent Robinson from repeating the defamatory statements. However, he went on to breach the order multiple times through interviews, online videos, and a speech at a public rally, which led to his conviction for contempt of court.He admitted to ten breaches of the injunction. Robinson’s actions triggered further abuse directed at the teenager, who was forced to leave school and whose family had to relocate.The sentencing judge in October imposed an 18-month prison term, which included a 14-month punitive element and a four-month coercive element—designed to pressure Robinson into complying with the injunction. He was jailed at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes.On Tuesday, the high court in London ruled that Robinson's sentence should be reduced, potentially allowing for his release within days. Mr Justice Jeremy Johnson, who oversaw the hearing, said Robinson had shown a “change in attitude” and accepted that he had given clear assurances not to breach the injunction again.Robinson’s legal team argued that he had taken steps to remove the offending content and had demonstrated his commitment to complying with the court’s order. His lawyer, Alex Di Francesco, said each breach capable of being “purged” had been acted upon, with most material removed from online platforms.While the judge acknowledged Robinson’s ongoing lack of remorse, he accepted that the coercive portion of the sentence had served its purpose. As a result, Robinson will only be required to complete the punitive element, which ends this week. He had originally been due for release on 26 July.",Far-right figure Tommy Robinson is set to be released from prison four months early.

Golden toilet heist: UK man avoids jail for role in £4.8m Blenheim Palace theft,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-jeweller-avoids-jail-for-role-in-48-million-golden-toilet-heist-at-blenheim-palace/articleshow/121284621.cms,"Frederick Doe, right, with his father outside Oxford Crown Court in Oxford, England (AP)





A 37-year-old jeweller from Windsor, Berkshire, has been handed a 21-month prison sentence, suspended for two years,by a UK court, for his involvement in the 2019 theft of an 18-carat gold toilet valued at £4.8 million from Blenheim Palace, the birthplace of Winston Churchill.Frederick Doe, also known as Frederick Sines, was convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property after attempting to broker the sale of the stolen artwork, titled ""America,"" by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan.The theft occurred in September 2019, when a group of masked thieves armed with sledgehammers and crowbars broke into the palace, removed the fully functioning gold toilet, and fled the scene in stolen vehicles. The heist, which lasted just five minutes, caused significant damage to the historic property due to flooding from the plumbed-in installation. The toilet, weighing approximately 98 kilograms, was never recovered and neither was any gold, which is believed to have been melted down.Doe's role in the crime was as a foolish middleman attempting to facilitate the sale of the stolen gold, said Judge Ian Pringle.“You had a limited function, you had no personal gain, you had no wider involvement and you were involved for a short period,"" he said, according to a report by AFP.He added that the perpetrators of the “audacious heist"" clearly aimed to offload the artwork without delay.He was found to have communicated with one of the burglars, James Sheen, about finding a buyer for the gold, referring to it using the code word ""cars."" Despite his limited involvement, Doe was convicted due to his attempts to convert the stolen property into cash.Judge Ian Pringle noted that while Doe's actions were ""foolish,"" he had been exploited by the actual thieves and did not benefit financially from the crime. The judge also considered Doe's previously good character, family responsibilities including caring for a sick wife and four children and his charitable work running a boxing club for underprivileged youth. These factors contributed to the decision to suspend his sentence and order him to complete 240 hours of unpaid community service.Two other men, James Sheen and Michael Jones, who played more direct roles in the crime, are due to be sentenced next month.

'One extreme to another'





RAMSEY: UK farmers are praying for rain as Britain suffers its driest spring in well over a century, which has left the soil parched and crops stunted from lack of water.At his 400-hectare (988-acre) farm near the eastern town of Peterborough, Luke Abblitt sadly surveyed his fields of thirsty sugar beets and potatoes struggling to grow.Not a drop of rain has fallen since March.""I'm not quite sure how I'm going to handle it on the farm, I'm hoping that we're going to get some rain, if not, then I'll have to somehow magically do something,"" Abblitt, 36, told AFP.The tiny green shoots of the sugar beets poking through the cracked, dusty earth ""should be at least twice the size,"" he sighed.In a neighbouring field, he has just planted potatoes with the help of his father, Clive, toiling to break up the baked soil.A total of 80.6 millimetres (3.1 inches) of rain has fallen since the start of spring, which covers the months of March, April and May, according to the national weather agency.That is well below the all-time low of 100.7 millimetres, which fell in 1852, according to the Met Office.""This spring has so far been the driest for more than a century,"" the Met Office told AFP, cautioning that it would be necessary to wait until the end of May to confirm the record.According to the Environment Agency, levels in the reservoirs have fallen to ""exceptionally low"".It called a meeting of its national drought group last week, at which deputy director of water Richard Thompson said climate change meant ""we will see more summer droughts in the coming decades"".The dry start to the year meant water companies were ""moving water across their regions to relieve the driest areas"", a spokesperson for Water UK, the industry body representing water suppliers, told AFP.Memories linger in Britain of July 2022 when temperatures topped 40 degrees (104 Fahrenheit) for the first time.In a barn, the Abblitts worked side-by-side with a noisy machine packing potatoes harvested last year into 25-kilo sacks.""Potatoes are a lot heavier users of water ... and they're also a lot more high value. So, we desperately need some rain,"" Luke Abblitt said.Without water, a potato ""will only reach a certain stage before it stops and then it won't grow any bigger,"" he added.If his potatoes are stunted he will not be able to sell them to his main clients which are British fish and chip shops.""I need to make sure they're a fair size, because everyone wants big chips, no one wants tiny chips do they?"" he said.The weather is going from ""one extreme to the other,"" he said dejectedly.""We're having a lot of rain in the wintertime, not so much rain in the spring or summer time. We need to adapt our cultivation methods, look at different varieties, different cropping possibly to combat these adverse weather conditions.""In recent years, Britain has been battered by major storms, as well as being hit by floods and heatwaves.""As our climate changes, the likelihood of droughts increases,"" said Liz Bentley, chief executive at the Royal Meteorological Society.""They're likely to become more frequent, and they're likely to be more prolonged,"" she warned.In past years the country used to experience a severe drought every 16 years.""In this current decade, that's increased to one in every five years, and in the next couple of decades, that becomes one in every three years.""And a fall in harvests risks pushing up prices in the supermarkets, she added.Some farmers have begun irrigating their crops earlier than usual, the National Farmers' Union said, calling for investment to improve water storage and collection systems.Vice President Rachel Hallos warned ""extreme weather patterns ... are impacting our ability to feed the nation"".Abblitt applied two years ago for a licence to install an irrigation system on the lands he rents from the local authorities.He is still waiting. ""I'm just praying for the rain,"" he added.","UK farmers are praying for rain as Britain suffers its driest spring in well over a century.

UK strikes EU trade and defence reset in 'new era' for relations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-strikes-eu-trade-and-defence-reset-in-new-era-for-relations/articleshow/121276728.cms,"UK PM Keir Starmer (File photo)





LONDON/BRUSSELS: Britain agreed the most significant reset of defence and trade ties with the European Union since Brexit on Monday after US President Donald Trump's upending of the global order pushed the two sides to move on from their acrimonious divorce.Nearly nine years after it voted to leave the bloc, Britain reached a wide-ranging deal with the EU, including a security and defence pact, fewer restrictions on British food exporters and visitors, and a contentious new fishing agreement.British PM Keir Starmer, who backed remaining in the EU in the Brexit referendum, also bet that offering benefits to Britons such as the use of faster e-gates at EU airports will drown out the cries of ""betrayal"" from Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage. Flanked by EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and European Council president Antonio Costa at London's Lancaster House, Starmer said the deal marked ""a new era in our relationship"". Britain said the reset would reduce red tape for agricultural producers - making food cheaper - improve energy security and, by 2040, add nearly 9 billion pounds ($12.1 billion) to the economy, which is about 2.6 trillion pounds in size.It is the third deal Britain has struck this month, after agreements with India and the US, and while it is unlikely to lead to an immediate economic boost, it could lift business confidence, drawing much-needed investment. At the heart of the reset is a defence and security pact that will let Britain be part of any joint procurement and pave the way for British companies to take part in a 150 billion euro ($167 billion) programme to rearm Europe.On fishing, British and EU vessels will have access to each other's waters for 12 years in return for a permanent reduction in paperwork and border checks that had prevented small food producers from exporting to Europe. In return, Britain has agreed to the outline of a limited scheme to let young EU and British people live and work in each others' territories for periods. Farage, head of the right-wing Reform UK party, called the deal an ""abject surrender - the end of the fishing industry"".","UK agrees most significant reset of defence and trade ties with the European Union.

Man who tried to sell $6.4m gold toilet stolen from English country house is spared jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/man-who-tried-to-sell-6-4m-gold-toilet-stolen-from-english-country-house-is-spared-jail/articleshow/121272676.cms,"AI image





A man who tried to help a burglar cash in from the theft of a golden toilet worth £4.74 million ($6.4 million) was spared jail on Monday after a British judge said he had been taken advantage of by the thieves. Frederick Doe , 37, also known as Frederick Sines, was given a suspended sentence at Oxford Crown Court for his role in helping to sell the 18-carat gold fully functioning toilet which was taken in 2019 from Blenheim Palacem, the country mansion where British wartime leader Winston Churchill was born.""Those responsible for this audacious heist, five individuals could be seen on CCTV, were clearly intent on disposing of their ill-gotten gains quickly,"" Judge Ian Pringle told Doe. ""You foolishly agreed to assist.""The toilet was part of a satirical art installation, titled ""America,"" by Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan , which aimed to poke fun at excessive wealth. It weighed just over 215 pounds (98 kilograms). The value of the gold at the time was 2.8 million pounds and it was insured for nearly 5 million pounds.The piece had previously been on display at The Guggenheim Museum, in New York, which had offered the work to US President Donald Trump during his first term in office after he had asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting.The theft of the toilet - which has never been recovered and is believed to have been cut up and sold - caused considerable damage to the 18th-century property, a UNESCO World Heritage site filled with valuable art and furniture that draws thousands of visitors each year.Of the group who smashed a window to get into the palace before dawn on Sept 14, 2019, only two have been charged and convicted.James Sheen, 40, previously pleaded guilty to burglary, conspiracy and transferring criminal property. Michael Jones, 39, was convicted of burglary at the trial where Doe was convicted. Sheen and Jones will be sentenced June 13.Doe punched his fist in the air as he emerged from court, saying he was a good person who ""got caught up in something I should not have.""The judge said Sheen approached Doe because he had contacts in London's jewelry district.In a WhatsApp message, Doe told Sheen he could ""sell the gold in a second."" Doe said he had no idea the gold was looted and wouldn't have sold stolen gold ""in a million years.""Doe, who was convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property, was given a two-year suspended term and ordered to perform 240 hours of unpaid work.""You agreed to assist Mr Sheen without any hope or expectation of a reward for yourself,"" the judge said. ""You no doubt, for the last five-and-a-half years, regret doing (that) for James Sheen every day since your arrest.""","Frederick Doe, 37, was given a suspended sentence for helping to sell the gold toilet.

Tense Rome Meeting: US Vice President Schooled On Trade By EU Chief; Meloni Plays Mediator | Watch

Poll Do you think the new UK-EU Security and Defence Partnership is a positive step forward? Yes, absolutely! No, not really.





The United Kingdom and European Union have agreed a major new security and defence partnership, Downing Street said on Monday, marking what the government called “a historic day” and the start of a new chapter in relations between the two sides.The deal, unveiled during a summit in London, will allow the UK defence industry to participate in the EU’s proposed €150 billion (£129 billion) Security Action for Europe (SAFE) fund, a significant step towards greater military cooperation post-Brexit. According to the UK government, the partnership will support thousands of British jobs and stimulate economic growth.“Today will also see the agreement of the new Security and Defence Partnership, which will pave the way for the UK defence industry to participate in the EU’s proposed new £150 billion Security Action for Europe (SAFE) defence fund supporting thousands of British jobs and boosting growth,” the UK government said in a statement. “At a time of increasing global uncertainty and volatility, this will formalise UK-EU co-operation on defence to ensure Europe’s safety and security. ”Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as a turning point. “It’s time to look forward. To move on from the stale old debates and political fights to find common sense, practical solutions which get the best for the British people,” he said. “We’re ready to work with partners if it means we can improve people’s lives here at home.So that’s what this deal is all about – facing out into the world once again, in the great tradition of this nation. ”The security deal was part of a wider UK-EU strategic agreement that also included a new sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) accord, designed to ease trade in food and drink, reduce border red tape and revive British exports of products such as burgers and sausages. The government claims the measures, alongside closer cooperation on emissions trading and trade protections for sectors like steel, could deliver nearly £9 billion to the UK economy by 2040.Nick Thomas-Symonds, the minister for European Union relations, said: “Today is a historic day, marking the opening of a new chapter in our relationship with the EU that delivers for working people across the UK… Our new UK-EU Strategic Partnership achieves all three objectives. It delivers on jobs, bills and borders.”",The UK and EU have agreed a major new security and defence partnership.

UK judge flagged ‘confidential impediment’ blocking Nirav Modi’s extradition to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-judge-flagged-confidential-impediment-blocking-nirav-modis-extradition-to-india/articleshow/121251255.cms,"PTI file photo





Nirav Modi’s extradition to India is being held up by a “confidential impediment,” according to a London High Court ruling issued this week, reported PTI. Justice Michael Fordham remarked while rejecting Modi’s latest bail application, noting that a legal barrier—whose details remain undisclosed—is stopping UK authorities from handing over the 54-year-old to India.Modi, who is wanted in India on charges of fraud, money laundering, and witness interference, has been in prison since March 2019. Although the UK government approved his extradition in 2021, the process has not moved forward. The judge said the confidential nature of the issue limits what the court can realistically assess, particularly when reviewing the long delay and the risk of granting bail.“There is a legal reason which relates to confidential proceedings,” Justice Fordham said. The court said that this information is known to Nirav Modi, his lawyers, and the Home Office—but not to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the Indian authorities, or the court itself.CPS lawyer Nicholas Hearn, representing the Indian side, acknowledged the existence of the issue and said it must be respected, without disclosing further.The confidential matter is widely believed to involve an asylum application, but the court has not confirmed this.Meanwhile, Modi’s legal team argued for bail on health and humanitarian grounds, pointing to physical and mental deterioration and risks in prison. But the judge found that these concerns did not outweigh the likelihood that Modi would flee if released.There are three ongoing criminal cases against Nirav Modi in India, including one by the CBI over fraud linked to Punjab National Bank, another by the Enforcement Directorate for money laundering, and a third for interfering with witnesses. All bail attempts so far have been denied.","Nirav Modi is wanted in India on charges of fraud, money laundering, and witness interference.

LONDON: British pop legend Elton John branded the UK government ""absolute losers"" on Sunday over planned copyright law changes that would hand exemptions to tech firms.In a blistering interview broadcast by the BBC, ""Rocket Man"" star John said he felt ""incredibly betrayed"" and accused the government of preparing to ""rob young people of their legacy and their income"".The changes which he branded ""criminal"" would allow tech firms to use creators' content freely unless the rights holders opt out.But John, 78, who has sold over 300 million records worldwide in his decades-long career, said young artists did not have the resources ""to fight big tech"".He said he was not against artificial intelligence (AI) but that when it came to music and creativity a line should be drawn.The government's Data (Use and Access) Bill is currently going through parliament.The parliament's upper house supported an amendment designed to ensure copyright holders would have to give permission over whether their work was used and, in turn, see what elements had been taken, by who and when.But on Wednesday MPs in the lower house, in which the Labour government has a huge majority, voted down the changes.If the government's planned changes to copyright laws went ahead they would be ""committing theft, thievery on a high scale"", John told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.""The government are just being absolute losers and I'm very angry about it,"" John said, blasting Technology Secretary Peter Kyle as a ""bit of a moron"".Prime Minister Keir Starmer has previously said the government needs to ""get the balance right"" with copyright and AI while noting that the technology represented ""a huge opportunity"".""They have no right to sell us down the river,"" John added, urging Starmer to ""wise up"" and ""see sense"".More than 1,000 musicians including Kate Bush, Annie Lennox and Damon Albarn released a silent album in February to protest at the proposed changes, saying they would legalise music theft.Earlier this month, writers and musicians including John and Bush also condemned the proposals as a ""wholesale giveaway"" to Silicon Valley in a letter to The Times newspaper.Other signatories included musicians Paul McCartney, Ed Sheeran, Dua Lipa and Sting, and writers Kazuo Ishiguro, Michael Morpurgo and Helen Fielding.A Department for Science, Innovation and Technology spokesperson said the bill was focused on ""unlocking the secure and effective use of data for the public interest -- boosting the economy by an estimated £10 billion over the course of the next 10 years"".","British pop legend brands UK government 'absolute losers' over planned copyright law changes.

British mountaineer Kenton Cool on Sunday morning climbed Mount Everest for the 19th time, setting a new record for the most ascents of the world’s highest peak by a non-Sherpa climber.The 51-year-old was reported to be in good health while descending, confirmed Iswari Paudel of Himalayan Guides Nepal , which managed the expedition, according to agency AP.Cool, from Gloucestershire in southwest England, first summited Everest in 2004 and has since scaled the 8,849-metre (29,032-foot) mountain nearly every year.His climbing schedule was interrupted only in 2014, 2015, and 2020, years when Everest expeditions were either cancelled due to deadly avalanches or the Covid-19 pandemic.The accomplished climber was accompanied by Dorji Gyaljen Sherpa, who completed his 23rd ascent during the same climb, reported The Himalayan Times.They reached the summit around 9:15 am, using the standard Southeast Ridge route pioneered by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953.Cool's achievement was widely celebrated in the climbing community. Adrian Ballinger of US-based Alpenglow Expeditions was quoted by Reuters as saying, “His experience, charisma, and strength make him a valuable part of the Everest community.He’s just a great person to share stories from two decades on the mountain.”While Cool holds the record among non-Sherpa climbers, Nepali legend Kami Rita Sherpa remains the overall record holder with 30 Everest summits and is currently on the mountain aiming for another, according to AP.Nepal, which hosts eight of the world’s 14 highest peaks, has issued 468 Everest climbing permits this season, each costing $11,000, as per Reuters.The current spring window is the most popular for Everest expeditions, typically closing at the end of May before the monsoon season begins.Cool has also achieved other milestones in high-altitude climbing.In 2013, he became the first British mountaineer to summit Mt Nuptse, Mt Everest, and Mt Lhotse in a single season. In 2021, he scaled Lhotse less than 29 hours after reaching the top of Everest, as per The Himalayan Times.","British mountaineer Kenton Cool on Sunday morning climbed Mount Everest for the 19th time.

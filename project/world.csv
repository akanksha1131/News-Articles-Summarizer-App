US to Denmark: Greenlanders 'don't want to be part of you' anymore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-to-denmark-greenlanders-dont-want-to-be-part-of-you-anymore/articleshow/119999718.cms,"US secretary of state Marco Rubio (Pic credit: AP)

In a blunt message, US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Friday said Denmark must reckon with the reality that ""Greenlanders don't want to be a part of it.""""Denmark should focus on the fact that the Greenlanders don't want to be a part of Denmark,"" Rubio said following a Nato foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels. The remark adds a new edge to the ongoing diplomatic tension over Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory rich in natural resources and strategically located in the Arctic.Rubio's comments come amid growing US interest in Greenland and rising concerns over potential Chinese influence in the region. He made it clear that while Washington respects Greenland's right to decide its own future, it will not allow the island to fall into China's economic orbit.""What we're not going to do is let China come in now and offer them a bunch of money, and become dependent on China,"" Rubio said, reiterating America's strategic concerns in the Arctic.Greenland, home to around 57,000 people, has long expressed a desire for independence. Polls show a significant majority support breaking away from Denmark, though there's little indication they would favor joining the United States instead.The tension was heightened last week when US Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland. Rubio defended the trip, saying it underscored the US position of respecting the island's self-determination. However, the visit was viewed as provocative by both Nuuk and Copenhagen .Despite the diplomatic friction, Rubio said he had reassured his Danish counterpart of the ""strong"" relationship between the two nations during a meeting on the sidelines of the Nato summit.","US secretary of state Marco Rubio says Denmark must reckon with the reality that ""Greenlanders don't want to be a part of it"" The remark adds a new edge to the ongoing diplomatic tension over Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory rich in natural resources.

'Going to fight back': New York rejects Trump’s threat to cut school funds over DEI order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/going-to-fight-back-new-york-rejects-trumps-threat-to-cut-school-funds-over-dei-order/articleshow/119998852.cms,"The New York state education department rejected demands from the Trump administration to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in public schools, arguing that there is no legal basis for such orders.The state's response came after a federal memo threatened to withhold critical Title I funding—meant for schools with high numbers of low-income students—from districts that do not comply. The administration had demanded that schools submit signed compliance forms within 10 days, certifying that DEI programmes were shut down, claiming these initiatives violate civil rights laws.In a letter sent on Friday, Daniel Morton-Bentley, deputy commissioner for legal affairs at the New York state education department, pushed back: “We understand that the current administration seeks to censor anything it deems ‘diversity, equity & inclusion’.” He continued, “But there are no federal or state laws prohibiting the principles of DEI,” as quoted by The New York Times.Morton-Bentley also questioned the legal foundation of the administration’s demand, stating that the federal government had failed to specify which DEI practices allegedly violate civil rights. He criticised the administration’s interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision that struck down affirmative action in college admissions, pointing out that the ruling does not apply to K-12 education.The letter warned federal officials not to confuse political agendas with legal mandates, stating the case does “not have the totemic significance that you have assigned it.” It concluded with a defiant message: “No further certification will be forthcoming.”New York's stand is in sharp contrast to the more cautious response seen from several universities, many of which have removed DEI content or cancelled related events under federal pressure. The state, however, appears determined to uphold its commitment to equity and inclusion.Morton-Bentley also noted that the Trump administration’s position represents “an abrupt shift,” referencing former education secretary Betsy DeVos, who had previously stated that “diversity and inclusion are the cornerstones of high organisational performance” and “key elements for success.” He added, “This is an abrupt shift,” and pointed out that the administration had “provided no explanation for how and why it changed positions.”Elsewhere, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson echoed New York’s resistance, saying the city would take legal action if federal funds were withheld. “We’re not going to be intimidated by these threats,” Johnson told reporters. “It’s just that simple. So whatever it is that this tyrant is trying to do to this city, we’re going to fight back.”Public school districts may also have more leeway than universities to resist such federal pressure, as around 90 per cent of their funding typically comes from state and local sources.","The New York state education department rejected demands from the Trump administration to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in public schools.

The video then cuts to wider aerial shots of the blast site, nearby vehicles, and a crater left by the strike.Trump captioned the post: “These Houthis gathered for instructions on an attack. Oops, there will be no attack by these Houthis!” He added, “They will never sink our ships again!”This week, Houthi officials and media outlets have reported multiple deaths in dozens of strikes that they blamed on the United States. The Iranian-backed group has said its strikes on commercial and military vessels are a response to Israel’s ongoing military operations in Gaza.According to Houthi-affiliated media, US airstrikes in the past week alone have killed at least 67 people across the country. Multiple strikes have targeted key areas including Hodeida, Saada, Sanaa, and Hajjah, with four people reportedly killed at a water project site in Hodeida’s Mansuriyah District.The US military has not confirmed whether any senior Houthi leaders have been killed, though messages from leaked Signal conversations and public comments from Trump administration officials suggest a figure from the rebel group’s missile command was among the targets.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday, “Iran is incredibly weakened as a result of these attacks, and we have seen they have taken out Houthi leaders.”""They've taken out critical members who were launching strikes on naval ships and on commercial vessels and this operation will not stop until the freedom of navigation in this region is restored.""She also confirmed that more than 200 strikes had been carried out on Tuesday alone.The Pentagon also announced further deployments to the region, including additional squadrons and A-10 Thunderbolt IIs from the Idaho Air National Guard.

"Cockles, mussels & bodyguards: Dublin acts to protect Molly Malone statue",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/cockles-mussels-bodyguards-dublin-acts-to-protect-molly-malone-statue/articleshow/119997371.cms,"In song, and then in bronze, she has become an emblem of Irish culture and an enduring symbol of working-class Dublin. But to the familiar folklore of Molly Malone represented in her statue on Suffolk Street in central Dublin - a pretty young face, a hawker's cart of cockles and mussels , a low-cut frilly dress - a new element will soon be added: wardens, provided by Dublin City Council.The life-size statue was erected to commemorate the central figure of ""Molly Malone"" or ""Cockles and Mussels,"" a song belted out during St Patrick's Day celebrations. The city council said it was responding to complaints about people touching the statue. More specifically, the problem is with visitors grabbing and rubbing the statue's breasts, supposedly for luck - something they do so often that its bust has become discoloured.The stewards will be positioned for a week in May, and will also try to educate tourists about the statue. The counsil is responding in part to a ""Leave Molly mAlone"" campaign led by Tilly Cripwell, a student at Trinity College Dublin, a regular busker on Suffolk Street. She welcomed the restoration work, but was less impressed by the idea of wardens. ""The stewarding system feels like a figurative barrier, which defeats the point, and the point is mind-set reform around behavior toward the statue.""People coming to see Malone help make Suffolk Street a lucrative busking spot. Singing there, Cripwell said, she could collect at least 60 euros an hour. But she grew infuriated at seeing tourists and nighttime drinkers grope the statue. While touching parts of statues for luck is a widespread tradition, treatment of one of Dublin's few statues of women struck Cripwell as crude and sexist.To protest, Cripwell has used an alternative version of the popular folk song. In the song, Malone is a fishmonger who sells her wares on Dublin's streets and eventually dies of a fever. People have long debated whether the song is based on a real person. The design of the statue, and the publicity surrounding it, may have encouraged undignified treatment, said Sean Murphy, a historian, adding the sculpture represented Malone as ""a prosperous trader who freelanced as a prostitute."" Cripwell is seeking to give the disputed history a new chapter. Her campaign has sought to have the statue placed on a raised plinth, although the city's statement dismissed that option as ""costly."" And in place of stewards explaining the statue, Cripwell says she would prefer a plaque. ""People don't know the story - whether it's fictional, whether it's real, they don't know it,"" she said.","Dublin City Council says it is responding to complaints about people touching the statue.

China has struck back at President Trump on Friday. In a rapid fire series of policy announcements from Beijing, including 34% across-the-board tariffs, three Chinese govt agencies showed that China has no intention of backing down in the trade war that Trump began this week with his own steep tariffs on imports from around the world.China's finance ministry said it will match Trump's plan for 34% tariffs on goods from China with its own 34% tariff on imports from the US. Separately, China's ministry of commerce said it was adding 11 American companies to its list of ""unreliable entities,"" essentially barring them from doing business in China or with Chinese companies. It also imposed a licencing system to restrict exports of seven rare earth elements that are mined almost exclusively in China and are used in everything from electric cars to smart bombs.The ministry will start two investigations into US exports of medical imaging equipment - one of the few manufacturing categories in which the US remains globally competitive.China's general administration of customs said it would halt chicken imports from five big US exporters of agricultural commodities and sorghum imports from a sixth company. China's new tariffs will hit fewer goods than Trump's tariffs because China sells far more to the US than it buys. China bought $147.8 billion worth of American semiconductors, agricultural goods and other products last year. It sold $426.9 billion worth of smartphones, toys and other items.But while Trump's tariffs exempted some large categories of imports, Chinese tariffs have no exemptions.

The Fallout Begins



Timing Is Everything



Cyber Threats, Real and Present



Five Eyes intelligence community.

Capitol Hill Reacts

The Morale Problem

Demand for Answers

The abrupt dismissal of National Security Agency (NSA) Director General Timothy Haugh and his civilian deputy Wendy Noble has lit a firestorm of speculation across Washington’s national security circles. No official explanation has been offered by either the Pentagon or the White House. What’s left is a void—one rapidly filling with questions, theories, and quiet panic.That such a high-level purge would occur without context is startling enough. That it would happen at a time of escalating global cyber threats only deepens the unease. The NSA, America’s nerve centre for electronic espionage and cyber defence, now finds itself rudderless—its leadership ejected without warning or cause.General Haugh, a four-star Air Force officer, had led the NSA since February 2024 while simultaneously heading US Cyber Command. His dual-hatted role made him one of the most influential figures in American intelligence, responsible for countering adversaries like China and Russia in an increasingly volatile digital arena. Haugh’s tenure was defined by modernization initiatives and high-stakes cyber manoeuvring. His ouster, without even the courtesy of a press release, has left senior officials dumbfounded.Wendy Noble, his long-serving deputy, was similarly shown the door—“reassigned” to the Office of the Undersecretary of Defence for Intelligence. Noble had been with the NSA since 1987 and was revered as an institutional compass. Her removal wasn’t just surprising; it was unthinkable.In their place: Lt. Gen. William Hartmann, Haugh’s deputy at Cyber Command, has been installed as acting NSA director. Sheila Thomas, formerly the agency’s executive director, will serve as acting deputy. These temporary appointments may ensure bureaucratic continuity, but they don’t resolve the central mystery: Why were Haugh and Noble removed—and why now?Their exit coincided with a broader round of unexplained firings. That same day, several National Security Council staffers were dismissed, following a White House meeting between President Trump and far-right provocateur Laura Loomer. Loomer, a fringe activist with a flair for conspiracy and a direct line to Trump’s inner circle, reportedly urged the president to purge officials she deemed “disloyal” to his second-term agenda.The optics are damning. Within hours of Loomer’s Oval Office audience, some of the government’s most seasoned national security officials were out.Whether her influence was the spark or the excuse, it has turned a personnel decision into a political flashpoint.Critics, including former intelligence officials, worry the firings suggest a deeper rot: political purges dressed up as bureaucratic reshuffles. With no transparency, the most dangerous question is now the most logical one: was the NSA leadership removed for doing their jobs too well—or not politically enough?The stakes couldn’t be higher. Just weeks before the shake-up, US cyber analysts were responding to “Salt Typhoon,” a sophisticated intrusion attributed to Chinese state actors. The breach targeted secure government networks and demonstrated advanced exfiltration techniques—raising alarms across theTo remove seasoned cyber strategists in the middle of a high-profile response effort is more than questionable. It borders on sabotage.Intelligence veterans warn that leadership instability can hamstring operations, stall innovation, and weaken morale. The NSA doesn’t just intercept emails—it anchors America’s cyber defence posture. Shake that foundation, and the consequences ripple outward—from Wall Street servers to battlefield communications.Lawmakers from both parties are rattled, though Democrats have been more vocal. Some have called for hearings to uncover the rationale—or lack thereof—behind the dismissals. Others are pressing for answers about whether fringe advisers or political operatives outside traditional government channels influenced the firings.So far, silence.Without transparency, rumours flourish. Was there a clash over surveillance policy? A leak investigation gone too far? Or is this simply the latest chapter in a pattern of loyalty tests masquerading as governance?Inside the intelligence community, fear is metastasizing. Officials who have spent decades in government now whisper about “career risks” and “political unpredictability.” Haugh and Noble were not rebels; they were insiders. Professionals. Their removal sends a chilling message: even the most competent aren’t safe if they’re not in favor.It’s not just about cyber operations anymore. It’s about whether America’s intelligence agencies can function under an administration that seems more interested in obedience than expertise.Pressure is mounting. Advocacy groups, cybersecurity experts, and a growing chorus in Congress are demanding clarity. The public, too, deserves an explanation. The NSA is not a backroom agency—it is a bulwark of national security. The lights may still be on at Fort Meade, but the question remains: Who's pulling the plug? Until the White House steps forward with a credible account, the nation is left in the dark—hoping that its most sensitive defences haven’t just been compromised from within.",National Security Agency Director General Timothy Haugh and his civilian deputy Wendy Noble were dismissed without warning or cause. No official explanation has been offered by either the Pentagon or the White House.

DOGE Is Done: Musk’s Washington Exit Strategy

Musk’s $21 Million Faceplant in Wisconsin



Tariffquake: A Billionaire’s Brutal Thursday



The Week Musk Fell Back to Earth



No one lived that paradox quite like Elon Musk . For the better part of a year, Musk couldn’t stop winning. He helped install a president, muscled his way into the Cabinet via a meme-laced department called DOGE, bought Twitter just to torch it and rebuild it as X , caught rockets from space, and played geopolitical puppeteer with the kind of arrogance that only comes from owning rockets, satellites, and factories on multiple continents. He caught boosters, launched DOGE, threatened democratically elected leaders, and made bureaucrats in DC tremble like interns at a SpaceX launchpad. For a while, Musk wasn’t just shaping markets—he was reprogramming reality. In fact, Musk has been so successful that people have even been wondering if he's in fifth or sixth simulation in The Matrix (or high on Ketamine). And then came this week. Musk’s golden run skidded to a halt. Tesla ’s stock cratered after a dismal earnings report and a botched price-slashing gamble. His favourability plummeted. His $21 million intervention in Wisconsin turned into a double-digit defeat. His chaotic tenure at the Department of Government Efficiency looks set to end in a quiet, undignified exit. And to top it all off, Trump’s tariff barrage wiped $11 billion off Musk’s net worth overnight—because what’s another trade war when you’ve already declared war on public goodwill?It was a week when everything that once made Musk appear invincible began to look like overreach. A correction, perhaps. A reckoning, more likely. Because if Musk’s rise was the stuff of techno-mythology, this week was the start of the hangover—the moment the man who once bent governments, platforms, and orbit to his will learned that even emperors hit turbulence on re-entry.Tesla’s stock didn’t just dip—it spiralled, shedding billions in market value like a rocket losing panels on descent. The trigger? A brutal slump in first-quarter deliveries that no amount of 0% financing or desperate markdowns could disguise. The demand problem was undeniable. And the brand? No longer bulletproof.This wasn’t just a commercial failure—it was a political one too. Musk’s full-throttle dive into right-wing politics, from gutting government agencies with DOGE to cringeworthy rallies in swing states, has scorched Tesla’s image. Showrooms have become protest zones. “De-Musk America” hashtags trend online. Bumper stickers now apologise for owning a Tesla before the CEO, as some put it, “went rogue.”Once hailed as the iPhone of cars, Tesla now feels more like the MySpace of EVs—still around, but fading fast. What once symbolised sleek innovation now drags the baggage of Musk’s personal crusades. And consumers are voting with their wallets.Wall Street took note. Shares plunged. Forecasts were slashed. Even the faithful started whispering: Tesla’s biggest risk may not be competition—it may be its CEO. For years, Musk's antics were the secret sauce. This week, they resembled toxic waste.Musk came to Washington promising to make government efficient. Instead, he made it chaotic—and now even Trump’s inner circle is slamming on the brakes.After months of wielding the axe at the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk is stepping away. Officially, it’s to refocus on business. Unofficially? The White House is tired of the spectacle. What began as a bold experiment in bureaucracy-slashing became a migraine for the administration.Cabinet secretaries were blindsided by Musk’s erratic decrees. Agency heads were whiplashed by weekend email purges. DOGE accidentally cut Ebola prevention programmes and became a rallying cry for Democrats. By the time Musk’s handpicked judge lost in Wisconsin, even Trump loyalists were done.His 130-day stint as a special government employee is quietly winding down. Behind closed doors, the consensus is clear: thanks for the fireworks, Elon—now please stop setting them off under our feet.Trump still praises Musk as a “patriot”, but insiders say he’s tired of being blindsided by Musk’s unfiltered X posts and Pentagon-level leaks. The exit may be soft, but it’s still an exit. And as ever, while Musk is excellent at breaking things, someone else must always clean up the DOGE mess.The Wisconsin Supreme Court race was more than just another contest for Musk—it was a power play. And it ended in disaster.Liberal Judge Susan Crawford defeated conservative Brad Schimel in the most expensive judicial election in American history. Musk, through his America PAC, pumped over $21 million into the race to tilt the court’s balance. Instead, he earned a 10-point drubbing, a liberal majority on the bench, and a state that rejected his brand of billionaire overreach.This wasn’t about jurisprudence—it was about control. Musk wanted a conservative court to pave the way for redistricting, voter suppression, and favourable rulings for Tesla. What he got was a backlash.Crawford’s campaign cast Musk as a cartoon villain : a plutocrat with a federal job trying to buy justice with million-dollar cheques. The pitch worked. The electorate recoiled. Musk’s gimmicks—cash-for-signatures and seven-figure giveaways—only inflamed the opposition.Inside the White House, the tone shifted. Trump still offers polite soundbites, but advisers are already planning Musk’s exit. After Wisconsin, the question isn’t if Musk should go—it’s how fast.His response to the defeat? A bitter X post blaming “the long con of the left” while grasping for relevance by touting an unrelated voter ID amendment. It sounded less like defiance and more like damage control. The message from Wisconsin was unmistakable: justice is not for sale. Not even to the richest man on Earth.And then came the economic gut-punch.On 3 April, markets convulsed as Trump unveiled sweeping new tariffs. The result: $208 billion evaporated from the fortunes of the world’s 500 richest people—the fourth-largest one-day drop in history. Musk alone lost $11 billion, pushing his 2025 losses to a brutal $110 billion.Tesla’s stock fell 5.5% as investors weighed the cost of new tariffs on batteries and key materials. Just days earlier, there had been optimism that Musk would refocus on Tesla after his DOGE detour. That optimism didn’t survive Thursday.The irony? Musk had lobbied for tariffs to weaken Chinese EV rivals. But the ones that landed hit Tesla too—raising costs across its global supply chain and inviting Chinese retaliation on Tesla’s Shanghai operations. Musk got his moat. It just happens to be filled with crocodiles.For a man who once promised to die on Mars—not crash in Madison—this was a humbling re-entry. In seven days, Musk lost political capital, investor confidence, billions in net worth, and the illusion that he was untouchable. The techno-myth cracked. The aura of inevitability dimmed.Wisconsin said no. The markets said no. Even Trump now refers to him in the past tense. Musk isn’t finished—he still commands satellites, factories, and platforms—but momentum, the one thing he always had, is no longer on his side. This wasn’t the end of Elon Musk. But it may have been the end of Musk as inevitable. A week where the man who wanted to bend the future finally met gravity. Out of juice. Out of favour. And out of Wisconsin—with a brutal, billion-dollar thud.And like the house, gravity always wins.But then again, betting against Elon Musk has always been a fool’s game.After all, this is the man whose adolescent sci-fi dreams now materialise in steel and fire. The Starship booster caught by Mechazilla wasn’t just a feat of engineering—it was a statement: the laws of physics may be immutable, but costs, constraints, and timelines are negotiable. SpaceX’s fully reusable Starship threatens to do to spaceflight what container ships did to global trade. Launch costs are plummeting. Cargo-to-orbit is scaling. The sci-fi is becoming logistics.For all the critics who see Musk as a privileged charlatan riding on others’ coattails, his peers beg to differ. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang admitted Musk’s xAI achieved in 19 days what would take most firms over a year. From Zip2 to PayPal, from Tesla to Starlink, from Neuralink to reusable rockets—Musk’s fingerprints are all over the architecture of tomorrow.Gravity may win the day. But history tends to side with the mad ones who dare to fight it. As Steve Jobs once said: “People who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.” After all, it would be foolish to bet against a man who can catch rockets from space. Metaphorically of course.","This week was the week when everything that once made Musk appear invincible began to look like overreach.

Former president Barack Obama Thursday said he has been watching the new administration of President Donald Trump for little bit and has not spoken publicly for quite a long time. In an on-stange interview at Hamilton College, Obama said he does not think Trump's new tariffs will be good for America but he said he is moe concerned with what he described as the White House's infringement of rights.“So, this is the first time I’ve been speaking publicly for a while,” Obama said. “I’ve been watching for a little bit.” “Imagine if I had done any of this,” Obama said, later adding: “It’s unimaginable that the same parties that are silent now would have tolerated behavior like that from me, or a whole bunch of my predecessors.”“I’m more deeply concerned with a federal government that threatens universities if they don’t give up students who are exercising their right to free speech,” Obama told the crowd of college students.“The idea that a White House can say to law firms, if you represent parties that we don’t like, we’re going to pull all our business or bar you from representing people effectively. Those kinds of – that kind of behavior is contrary to the basic compact we have as Americans.”Obama's comment on law firms referred to Trump's announcement of a deal with a law firm which agreed to provide at least $100 million in pro bono legal services throughout his second term. Interestingly, Kamala Harris's husband Doug Emhoff works at the firm -- Willkie Farr & Gallagher.Kamala Harris too spoke up against the administration after her long absence. “Fear has a way of being contagious.

Trump Tariffs TikTok Deal: Were Donald Trump’s tariffs responsible for delay in TikTok deal?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/were-trumps-tariffs-responsible-for-delay-in-tiktok-deal/articleshow/119994151.cms,"Were Trump’s tariffs responsible for delay in TikTok deal? (Picture credit: AP)

A long-anticipated deal to shift TikTok’s US operations into American hands was nearly sealed, until US President Donald Trump’s sweeping new tariff announcement derailed it, according to sources familiar with the negotiations, reported news agency Associated Press.The Trump administration had been working for months to secure a plan that would see TikTok spun off into a new, US-based entity, backed by American investors and independent from ByteDance , its Chinese parent.According to AP, the near-finalised agreement had the backing of ByteDance, US investors, new stakeholders and administration officials. It also included a 120-day closing period to finalise paperwork and financing.US Vice President JD Vance’s team reportedly played a key role in crafting the deal alongside firms like Oracle and Blackstone.But on Thursday, just as the White House was preparing to announce a breakthrough, Beijing pulled back.According to a person familiar with the matter, ByteDance officials told the White House they could not move forward without fresh negotiations over trade and tariffs, following Trump’s announcement of broad global tariffs, including measures directly targeting China.This sudden policy move appears to have rattled Chinese regulators, leading to a pause in talks and uncertainty over ByteDance’s ability to send a clear signal about the deal’s terms without endangering its standing with Beijing.The timing of the collapse has sparked questions over whether Trump’s aggressive trade stance unintentionally sabotaged the very deal his administration had spent months pursuing.The President’s response was to sign an executive order Friday, delaying enforcement of a federal law banning TikTok unless ByteDance divests. The extension grants another 75 days, pushing the new deadline to mid-June.“My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to save TikTok… which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days,” Trump posted on Truth Social.While Trump framed it as an extension, critics argue it’s more of a legal bypass. “He’s not extending anything,” law professor Alan Rozenshtein told AP. “All he’s doing is saying that he will not enforce the law for 75 more days. The law is still in effect.”ByteDance confirmed talks were ongoing but warned that “any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law.”Analysts say the heart of the deal remains the control of TikTok’s powerful algorithm.Cybersecurity expert Chris Pierson told AP that as long as ByteDance retains that control, “the underlying risks” remain unchanged.","Deal to spin off TikTok's US operations was nearly sealed, according to sources.

Rumeysa Ozturk: Judge transfers case of detained Turkish PhD student Rumeysa Ozturk to Vermont,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-transfers-case-of-detained-turkish-phd-student-rumeysa-ozturk-to-vermont/articleshow/119993601.cms,"Judge transfers case of detained Turkish PhD student Rumeysa Ozturk to Vermont (Picture credit: AP)

A federal judge on Friday ordered the case of Rumeysa Ozturk , a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University , to be moved from Massachusetts to Vermont , where she was briefly held after her arrest by immigration officers last week.Ozturk’s lawyers had filed a petition for her release in Boston, but the department of justice sought to dismiss it or shift it to Louisiana , where she is currently detained.US district judge Denise Casper ruled Vermont was the appropriate venue since Ozturk was held overnight in St Albans, Vermont, when the habeas petition was filed. “Here, because Ozturk was confined overnight in Vermont when the petition was filed, the District of Vermont is the proper transferee court,” Casper wrote in her decision, as per news agency AP.Casper rejected the government’s argument that the case should be moved to Louisiana, stating the transfer to Vermont serves “the interest of justice.” She also blocked any attempt to remove Ozturk from the US until Vermont courts decide on jurisdiction.According to NBC News, the deportation ban remains in place unless lifted by the transferee court.Ozturk was arrested on March 25 in Somerville, Massachusetts, after her student visa was revoked. Footage showed Homeland Security agents in plain clothes surrounding her and placing her in a vehicle as she screamed. After stops in New Hampshire and Vermont, she was flown to Louisiana the next day.Ozturk’s lawyers said her sudden arrest and cross-state transfer were attempts to manipulate jurisdiction and prevent her from challenging her detention. Judge Casper acknowledged this concern, writing that “the irregularity of the arrest, detention and processing… is coupled with the failure to disclose Ozturk's whereabouts” even after the government knew she had legal representation.As per CBS News, the department of homeland security has accused Ozturk, without offering evidence, of supporting Hamas, which the US classifies as a terrorist organisation. However, her lawyers argue that her detention violates her First Amendment rights and due process protections.Ozturk had co-authored a Tufts Daily op-ed last year criticising the university’s stance on student resolutions calling for divestment from companies linked to Israel.On Thursday, her attorney released a statement from Ozturk in which she reaffirmed her commitment to justice and dialogue: “I believe the world is a more beautiful and peaceful place when we listen to each other and allow different perspectives to be in the room.”“Let’s be clear: Rumeysa should never have been arrested or detained by ICE in the first place,” said her lawyer Mahsa Khanbabai, as per AP. “What matters most right now is our continued fight to ensure her immediate release and safe return home”, Khanbabai added.","Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was briefly held after her arrest by immigration officers last week.

Supreme Court Decision: Supreme Court backs Trump in scrapping $600m education grants linked to DEI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/supreme-court-backs-trump-in-scrapping-600m-education-grants-linked-to-dei/articleshow/119992911.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

The US Supreme Court on Friday handed a major victory to the Trump administration by allowing it to terminate over $600 million in federal teacher-training grants , part of its broader campaign to dismantle diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.The 5-4 decision overruled a lower court’s block on the cuts, marking US President Donald Trump’s first Supreme Court win in his second term.The court’s conservative majority, minus Chief Justice John Roberts who sided with the liberal justices in dissent, said the government was not legally bound to continue payments under the Teacher Quality Partnership and Supporting Effective Educator Development programs.These grants, focused on preparing teachers in critical subjects such as science, maths, and special education, have shown strong results in improving retention, particularly in under-resourced schools, according to multiple states challenging the decision.According to CNBC News, the Trump administration argued the programs violated a new executive order aimed at eliminating DEI-related spending. Education officials described the grants as “woke” and unnecessary, and had halted payments abruptly in February without prior notice.In response, a coalition of eight Democrat-led states led by California sued the federal government, saying the cancellation lacked legal justification and disproportionately impacted efforts to address America’s worsening teacher shortage.A federal judge in Boston, Myong Joun, appointed by the previous US President Joe Biden, initially blocked the cuts through a temporary restraining order, saying the cancellations likely violated federal law and were already harming teacher development programs. However, the Supreme Court’s majority ruled the states could maintain the programs using their own funds for now, arguing the federal government would have no way to recover the money if it ultimately prevails in the case.Justice Elena Kagan, writing in dissent, criticised the court’s intervention as unnecessary and hasty. “Nowhere in its papers does the government defend the legality of canceling the education grants at issue here,” she wrote, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson adding in a separate opinion that it was “beyond puzzling” to treat the administration’s request as an emergency.As per news agency AP, this legal fight is just one of several where lower courts have delayed or blocked Trump’s second-term agenda, prompting his administration to escalate disputes to the Supreme Court. Trump has also signed an executive order calling for the dismantling of the Department of Education, pushing to eliminate DEI elements across government institutions.California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Wisconsin remain parties in the ongoing lawsuit as the legal battle continues.","The US Supreme Court on Friday handed a major victory to the Trump administration by allowing it to terminate over $600 million in federal teacher- training grants.

As financial markets continue to reel from a sweeping new tariff plan, US President Donald Trump spent his weekend in Florida, playing golf and attending a lavish $1 million-a-plate dinner, doubling down on his hardline economic strategy and dismissing mounting fears of a looming recession.Trump repeatedly insisted that his policies were the path to prosperity. “This is a great time to get rich,” he wrote on Truth Social Friday, adding, “My policies will never change.”Later on Friday, he wrote “Only the weak will fail”, further emphasising his defiant stance even as stock markets plunged for a second consecutive day.While Trump golfed near his private club, US markets opened to another bloodbath, intensifying criticism of the former president's apparent indifference to economic fallout. “What a disgrace,” said Republicans Against Trump in a post on X, noting his weekend retreat came amid “a crashing market, looming recession, and rising global isolation.”As per the news agency AP, Democrats slammed Trump for being “in a billionaire bubble” and ignoring everyday Americans. “While people are trying to put food on the table, Donald Trump’s playing golf,” said Senator Ben Ray Luján. “Maybe he should visit a grocery store and talk to folks”, he added.The tariffs, which analysts warn could cost families thousands of dollars annually, were described by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as “significantly larger than expected” and “highly likely” to push inflation further.Yet Trump remains firm. “To the many investors coming into the United States… my policies will never change,” he wrote online and urging Powell to “Cut interest rates, Jerome, and stop playing politics!” in a separate post.Trump’s actions have prompted concern even within his own party. Senator Ted Cruz warned on his podcast that if a recession takes hold, Republicans could face a “political bloodbath” in the 2026 midterms. Meanwhile, Senator John Barrasso said Trump’s tariff strategy was about leverage, “He’s going to continue to deal country by country.”Despite the market fallout, Trump celebrated a report showing the US added 228,000 jobs in March, calling it proof his strategy is working—even though the data predates the tariff rollout.“Hang tough, we can’t lose!!!” he urged supporters.","US President Donald Trump spent his weekend in Florida, playing golf and attending a lavish $1 million-a-plate dinner.

Inter-American Foundation: Federal judge blocks Donald Trump’s attempt to dismantle Inter-American Foundation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/federal-judge-blocks-donald-trumps-attempt-to-dismantle-inter-american-foundation/articleshow/119992000.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: PTI)

A US federal judge on Friday blocked US President Donald Trump’s move to dismantle the Latin America development agency , Inter-American Foundation (IAF), ruling that the administration likely overstepped its authority when it removed the agency’s leadership and froze its grants.US district judge Loren AliKhan , an appointee of US President Joe Biden, ordered that ousted IAF president and CEO Sara Aviel be reinstated immediately and blocked the Trump administration ’s efforts to dissolve the agency’s operations. “Because neither President Trump nor Mr Marocco had the authority to fire her from her position… Ms. Aviel is likely to succeed on the merits of her case,” AliKhan wrote in her decision, according to the news agency Associated Press.Established by Congress in 1969, the IAF is an independent US agency that funds grassroots development efforts to combat poverty, migration and instability in Latin America and the Caribbean. Since its inception, the agency has disbursed more than $945 million in grants across roughly three dozen countries.Trump had signed an executive order on February 19 aiming to drastically shrink the federal government, listing the IAF among the agencies to be “eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law,” reported The Hill. The following day, representatives from the department of government efficiency (DOGE), led by Trump advisor Elon Musk, appeared at IAF’s offices.Days later, the administration removed the agency’s board, fired Aviel, and installed Peter Marocco as acting board chair. Marocco, who had previously worked on dismantling the US agency for international development, later appointed himself as Aviel’s temporary replacement.As per The Hill, the IAF was left with just one employee and one active grant.AliKhan’s order invalidated Marocco’s role and actions, including the cancellation of nearly all IAF grants and plans to fire most of its staff. “If those terminations go into effect, those staff will never return,” Aviel’s attorneys warned, adding that the foundation’s long-standing relationships and reputation in Latin America would be “gutted,” AP reported.Nine grantee organisations have also sued to preserve the agency, including groups that combat school violence in Peru, support rural women in Mexico, and train small-scale farmers. Several have already laid off employees or are facing closure.The justice department argued that Trump lawfully replaced the board and that the administration’s actions were part of broader efforts to ensure government leadership aligns with the president’s goals. But judge AliKhan pushed back strongly. “That reading eviscerates the Appointments Clause,” she wrote, calling the administration’s theory of unchecked executive power “frightening,” reported The Hill.","US district judge Loren AliKhan ordered that ousted IAF president and CEO Sara Aviel be reinstated immediately.

Who is Abrego Garcia?



Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador last month has to be brought back to the US no later than 11.59 pm on April 7, a federal judge ruled Friday. This came after the Trump administration, in a surprise move, acknowledged that they did a mistake deporting the Maryland father of three because of an administrative order. The government said they could not bring him because he is in Salvadoran custody.“This case is certainly important to Abrego Garcia and his family,” judge Paula Xinis said. “In recognition of that. I feel like I can’t wait on giving my order.”During the hearing, the judge flagged that Garcia was apprehended last month without legal basis and deported without justification. Garcia's alleged ties to the MS-13 gang which Trump officials maintained did not have sufficient evidence, the judge said.“When someone is accused of membership in such a violent and predatory organization, it comes in the form of an indictment, complaint, criminal proceeding that has a robust process,” she said. The Justice Department didn’t provide additional evidence beyond what’s already been submitted in the case. “The government made a choice here to produce no evidence,” DOJ attorney Erez Reuveni told the judge.Abrego Garcia, 29, was among the hundreds of alleged members of crime gangs MS-13 and Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua the government expelled from the US to El Salvador last month. He fled El Salvador as a teenager to escape gang violence. On March 12, he was pulled over by ICE agents near his home and three days later he was expelled and sent back to El Salvador even though he won a legal battle six years earlier barring his removal.Abrego Garica’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, and their 5-year-old son, who are both US citizens, sued the government demanding his return.","Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia has to be brought back to the US no later than 11.59 pm on April 7, a federal judge ruled Friday.

US President Donald Trump on Friday called on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates immediately, even as the central bank faces mounting pressure over inflation concerns triggered by his administration’s sweeping new tariffs.“This would be a perfect time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Energy prices are down, Interest rates are down, inflation is down, even eggs are down 69%, and jobs are UP, all within two months — A big win for America. Cut interest rates, Jerome, and stop playing politics!” he added.Trump’s comments come just two days after he announced aggressive new tariffs, which have rattled global markets and sparked fears of a fresh inflationary wave.Earlier on Friday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had warned that the tariffs are “significantly larger than expected” and are “highly likely” to cause at least a temporary rise in inflation. He added, “It is also possible that the effects could be more persistent.”Powell, speaking to reporters in Arlington, Virginia, emphasised the Fed's cautious approach, saying the central bank is “well positioned to wait for greater clarity” before adjusting interest rates. “There’s a lot of waiting and seeing going on, including by us,” he said. “And that just seems like the right thing to do in this period of uncertainty”, Powell added.According to CNBC News, the market has already responded to growing recession fears, with the 10-year US treasury yield falling below 4%. Meanwhile, traders are now pricing in at least four 0.25-point rate cuts this year, up from the Fed’s earlier projection of two.However, the Fed’s main concern remains inflation. “Our obligation is to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,” Powell said, pointing to the complexities created by Trump’s trade policies.Economists, including Kathy Bostjancic of Nationwide, believe the Fed is in a difficult position. “The Fed is in a tough spot with inflation set to accelerate and the economy poised to slow,” she said, as quoted by the news agency AP.Despite market jitters, Trump has dismissed concerns, comparing the volatility to a patient undergoing surgery.

Trump tariffs and their aftershocks



A White House official told Washington Post that President Donald Trump is ""at the peak of just not giving a f**k anymore"", explaining the rationale behind the reciprocratory tariffs that the president announced on April 2. ""Bad news stories? Doesn't give a f**k. He's going to do what he's going to do. He's going to do what he promised to do on the campaign trail,"" a Washington Post report quoted a White House official as saying.The report said the president was given a menu of tariff options, but he personally selected a formula to arrive at the percentage of tariffs for countries.

The White House has postponed its annual spring garden tour originally set for Saturday, citing security concerns over a “massive” anti-Trump protest expected near the premises. The tours will now take place on Sunday, April 6, between 10 am (local time) and 2:30 pm (local time), with all previously issued tickets for Saturday honoured regardless of the original time slots, confirmed a statement from the First Lady’s office.“This decision has been made out of an abundance of caution and to ensure the safety of all within proximity to public demonstrations planned near the White House on April 5,” said the official statement.The change comes as the “Hands Off!” rally, part of a National Day of Action , is set to draw more than 12,000 demonstrators to the National Mall, according to Washingtonian magazine.Organisers say the protest is a response to what they describe as “a hostile takeover” of the American government and economy by US President Trump and his wealthy allies. “Trump, Musk, and their billionaire cronies are orchestrating an all-out assault on our government, our economy, and our basic rights,” reads a statement on the movement’s website.The demonstration is expected to be the largest single-day protest since Trump took office.As per Axios, more than 1,100 rallies and events are being held across all 50 states, with nearly 250,000 RSVPs recorded by March 29. Protesters plan to rally against a wide array of policies linked to Trump, including attacks on consumer protections, transgender rights, Social Security benefits, and immigration. The involvement of Elon Musk in federal governance via DOGE has also drawn criticism, further fuelling the movement.While President Trump is not scheduled to be in Washington during the protests—he is expected to attend a LIV Golf event in Doral, Florida, and later visit Mar-a-Lago—security agencies remain on alert.The White House has said it is “working closely with the United States Secret Service and National Park Service to safely accommodate all ticket holders,” reported The Hill.The annual spring garden tours offer the public a rare chance to view iconic areas like the Rose Garden, the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden and the White House Kitchen Garden. The tours are free, but tickets are distributed on a first-come-first-served basis outside the White House Visitor Center.Melania Trump first announced the April 5–6 tour dates last month.Sunday tourgoers are expected to arrive at their scheduled times, while Saturday’s attendees can use their tickets without rescheduling.","The White House has postponed its annual spring garden tour originally set for Saturday, citing security concerns.

Who are the militant groups?



Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim. It said that the Taliban provided support to the TTP and that some attacks were launched from Afghan territory.As a consequence, the Pakistani government has urged the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan to act against the allegedly responsible criminals. Kabul, on the other hand, denies that the militants are in Afghanistan.","Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.The operation, in Katlang, a remote hilltop area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was aimed at militant hideouts and resulted in the deaths of 12 suspected terrorists. However, it also led to the deaths of 10 civilians, including women and children, sparking outrage.Government spokesman Muhammad Ali Saif confirmed the casualties and said that the location was being used as a hideout and transit point for terrorists. He admitted that unarmed civilians were present at the site.""The safety of civilians is always a top priority during such operations. However, due to complex geography, terrorists using civilian populations as cover, and the urgent nature of the operation, unintended consequences can sometimes occur,"" said Saif, as quoted by the Associated Press.The provincial government has now promised an inquiry into how the operation led to civilian deaths.Local residents reported that the victims were nomads from the Swat region who had been living in the Shamozai mountains with their livestock. Their families protested by placing their bodies on the Swat Highway, demanding justice.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur called the incident “highly condemnable and tragic.” He assured that every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties but acknowledged the challenges of military operations in complex terrains where militants embed themselves among civilians.The government said medical aid is being provided to the injured, and compensation for the victims' families is being arranged. A provincial press note said the operation had ""neutralised several high-value militant targets"" but admitted that the “fog of war” sometimes leads to unintended consequences.","Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.

IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme | Dawn News English

Pakistan's citizens may have to pay additional taxation as a new carbon levy is anticipated following a USD 1.3 billion agreement with the IMF for climate change initiatives PTI reported citing official sources.Alongside this, the IMF agreed to release approximately USD 1 billion as the second tranche of the previously agreed USD 7 billion loan.""The IMF team has reached a SLA with the Pakistani authorities on the first review of the 37-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), and a new 28-month arrangement under the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) with total access over the 28 months of around USD 1.3 billion,"" the Fund said in a statement.The total IMF loan now amounts to USD 8.3 billion with this RSF arrangement. Upon approval from the IMF's Executive Board, Pakistan would receive immediate access to approximately USD 2 billion to strengthen its balance of payment position.The new agreement requires additional commitments from the tax-burdened population, including a new carbon levy, increased water rates, and liberalisation of the automobile sector. Dawn newspaper reports that a reduction in power rates is expected, funded by reallocating the existing petroleum levy.Senior officials familiar with the SLA and MEFP indicated that the prime minister would announce an approximate Rs 7 per unit reduction in average electricity rates, effective from April 1, 2025.The implementation of new measures - carbon levy, water pricing and automobile sector reforms - will commence from July 1, 2025. Fiscal consolidation will continue through reduced energy subsidies and controlled development spending.Officials confirmed that whilst the government sought GST reduction on electricity, the IMF instead permitted the use of increased petroleum levy to offset power tariffs. A Rs 10 per litre increase in petroleum levy would provide approximately Rs 1.80 per unit relief.The government has agreed to implement a carbon levy of Rs 3-5 per litre or equivalent on all hydrocarbons, including petroleum products and coal, with gradual increases planned. The revenue will fund climate-related initiatives.Automobile sector trade tariffs will decrease from 10.5% to 6% by FY 2030, ending what both parties agreed was excessive protection. These measures require cabinet approval before implementation through the finance bill 2025-26.The authorities aim to achieve an FY25 underlying primary surplus of 1% of GDP minimum, maintaining consolidation in FY26. The focus remains on revenue mobilisation, spending efficiency and tax base expansion.Pakistan has committed to maintaining strict monetary policy to keep inflation within the SBP's 5-7% target range and preserve foreign exchange market functionality while building reserves.The RSF programme includes strengthening public investment processes, improving water resource management, enhancing disaster financing coordination, addressing climate-related risks, and promoting environmental-friendly transportation to reduce pollution impacts.",IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme.

Rajab Butt: Pakistani YouTuber slapped with blasphemy charges over perfume launch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-youtuber-slapped-with-blasphemy-charges-over-perfume-launch/articleshow/119484680.cms,"Pakistani YouTuber slapped with blasphemy charges over perfume launch (Picture credit: X)

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

Sacked Nepal official crowdfunds to pay fine imposed on Gyanendra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sacked-nepal-official-crowdfunds-to-pay-fine-imposed-on-gyanendra/articleshow/119960937.cms,"KATHMANDU: Supporters of Nepal's former king Gyanendra Shah have raised Nepal Rs 4.8 lakh (INR 3 lakh) so far through a crowdfunding campaign launched by a recently sacked govt-appointed tourism promoter, who was removed for publicly supporting the ex-monarch and criticising the govt as corrupt. The funds are being collected to help Shah pay a Nepal Rs 8 lakh (Rs 5 lakh)-penalty imposed by Kathmandu Metropolitan City for damage to public property during last week's pro-monarchy protest in central Kathmandu.This came even as govt sanctioned Nepal Rs 10 lakh (Rs 6.3 lakh) each for families of the two people killed in the violence. Meanwhile, Shah on Thursday denied any role in the unrest, saying the incident was triggered ""because of lapses and failures within govt"", rejecting the charge by PM K P Sharma Oli that the ex-king had incited the violence.A statement issued by Shah's secretariat said, ""The govt's shortcomings and weaknesses are responsible for this tragic incident."" Shah's communication secretary added that neither the palace nor the former monarch's supporters would take responsibility for the violence, vandalism or looting.""By holding him responsible for the deaths and arson, Oli govt is attempting to hide its own failures."" Rameshraj Bastola , who was dismissed from his role as tourism promoter in Lisbon, Portugal, on March 10 after he publicly supported Shah, contributed Nepal Rs 50,000 (Rs 31,000) and urged others to join the effort. Bastola said he did not wish to serve under a ""corrupt govt"".He wrote, ""If you have any objections to my support for the king and religion, you may keep the post for yourself.""RPP member Swati Thapa said, ""Yes, there's a spontaneous wave of support.

"In counter to Yunus's remark, PM Modi says Northeast integral to Bimstec",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/in-counter-to-yunuss-remark-pm-modi-says-northeast-integral-to-bimstec/articleshow/119956990.cms,"Modi to meet Yunus today, claim top Bangladesh officials

As he departed for Thailand to participate in the 6th Bimstec summit, PM Narendra Modi asserted India's Northeast lies at the heart of the inter-regional group, underlining the primacy of the northeastern states in the region, days after Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said in China the ""7 sisters"" are landlocked with no way of reaching the ocean. Modi's remark came ahead of a likely bilateral meeting between the two on Friday on the summit's margins.Modi and Yunus came face to face for the first time at the dinner hosted by Thailand PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra.Modi was seated between Yunus and Nepal PM KP Sharma Oli. An Indian govt source speaking on condition of anonymity said the meeting, as sought by Dhaka, is ""in the works"". Senior officials in Dhaka were quoted as saying that the leaders would meet on Friday afternoon, shortly after the Bimstec summit. The meeting, if it happens, would be the first between the leaders since the interim govt took charge in Bangladesh in Aug 2025.Separately, in a Bimstec ministerial, Jaishankar said that the North-East had emerged as a connectivity hub for the Bimstec and the completion of the India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway will connect the region all the way to the Pacific Ocean. This, he said, would be a veritable game-changer.Yunus's office had clarified on Wednesday that his remarks about India's North-East had been made with ""honest intentions"" but were interpreted wrongly. The fact that he was speaking in China, while inviting Beijing to take advantage of Bangladesh's geographical location, raised eyebrows in India.Modi had last week written to Yunus on Bangladesh National Day, extending his felicitations and underlining the significance of working together on the basis of mutual sensitivity to each other's interests and concerns. India also remains concerned about the law-and-order situation in Bangladesh, and the threat to minorities amid increasing radicalisation in the country.According to govt sources, bilateral meetings are likely also with Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli and Myanmar junta chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who is undertaking a rare visit abroad amid the civil war in the country for Bimstec.In his departure statement, Modi also said that Bimstec has emerged as a significant forum for promoting regional development, connectivity and economic progress in the Bay of Bengal region. ""I look forward to meeting the leaders of the Bimstec countries and engaging productively to further strengthen our collaboration with the interest of our people in mind,"" said Modi.Bimstec or the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation is an inter-regional grouping comprising five South Asian countries and two Asean states, lying in the littoral and adjacent areas of the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh will take over as the chair of Bimstec at the Bangkok summit.At the last summit in Colombo in 2022, the leaders adopted the Bimstec Charter, completing its transition from a grouping to a regional organisation. With Saarc now non-functional because of the lack of any diplomatic engagement between India and Pakistan, the Indian govt has pushed Bimstec as an alternative for regional trade, connectivity and security. Addressing the Colombo summit, Modi had also called for expediti ng ongoing talks for a Bimstec free trade agreement (FTA) that would enhance mutual trade.The PM will also visit Sri Lanka from Bangkok. ""This follows the highly successful visit of President Dissanayaka to India last Dec. We will have the opportunity to review progress made on the joint vision of fostering partnerships for a shared future and provide further guidance to realise our shared objectives,"" he said in his departure statement.","Modi and Yunus came face to face for the first time at the dinner hosted by Thailand PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra.

"In Nepal's classrooms, youngsters wonder if republic has delivered",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/in-nepals-classrooms-youngsters-wonder-if-republic-has-delivered/articleshow/119923470.cms,"Poll Should schools engage students in political discussions? No, focus should be on academics Yes, it's important for awareness

KATHMANDU: They were still in the womb or a crib when Narayanhiti Palace became a crime scene. On the night of June 1, 2001, gunfire echoed through the marble halls, leaving nearly the entire royal family, including King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya, dead. Gyanendra Shah, the king no one expected, took the throne days later. But by 2008, amid a peace deal with Maoists and end of a decade-long civil war that left more than 17,000 dead, monarchy was abolished. For Nepal's post- 2000 generation, the palace is more museum than memory.And yet, the past is back. Not as nostalgia whispered in old homes, but as chants - 'Raja aau, desh bachau' - rising from TikTok and Facebook feeds, protest portals, and campuses. In private institutes, youngsters are asking hard questions of the republic. What has it delivered, besides a carousel of prime ministers and a nation in drift? Since becoming a republic in 2008, Nepal has had 13 different PMs, often through fragile coalitions. A school administrator said, ""They've come of age amid rolling blackouts, political instability, and a broken job market. It's not just the changing faces. It's the lack of direction. Every few months, there's a new education policy... a different entrance exam.""In classrooms where teachers once prepped students for exams and jobs, conversations now veer into who should lead the country - elected politicians or a king - and whether their votes would matter at all. ""We're supposed to be teaching maths and science,"" said Sagar Acharya, a principal in Chitwan. ""But these days, it feels like we're moderating parliament."" Smriti Acharya, a 20-year-old student, never imagined she'd attend a protest rally. ""I didn't live through the monarchy... But I've lived through this system - and it's not working."" Her friend added, ""When every year brings a new PM, what future are we supposed to plan for?""The churn isn't just political - it's personal. Students watch classmates vanish abroad in search of something better. According to International Organisation for Migration, over 3,00,000 students have left the country for higher education in past five years. Nepal's department of foreign employment said over 1,10,000 student visa recommendations were issued in 2022. Student absenteeism has spiked since the March 28 crackdown on protests. Even in schools that avoid overt political discussion, the tensions are palpable. ""There's a strange energy right now - a hunger to belong to something larger than themselves,"" said a teacher. Sociologist Tara Rai said the protests are more than just a royalist revival. ""This is a generation that has only known chaos. The generation's activism is rooted in disillusionment, not nostalgia. For them, the king is less a figure than a symbol - of order, identity, something to rally around.""For many, though, monarchy is not the solution. ""Given the choice, I'd still opt for a democracy,"" said another student. ""It may be messy, but it gives us rights and a chance to participate. I just want a system that works."" Despite rising tensions, education ministry has issued no formal advisory. But insiders say informal instructions have been sent to ""avoid sensitive political discussion"" in classrooms. Still, it's hard to silence what students are already debating online. Hashtags and remixed protest chants continue to spread across Instagram and TikTok. ""That's how students engage now,"" said a digital media analyst.","Since becoming a republic in 2008, Nepal has had 13 different PMs, often through fragile coalitions.

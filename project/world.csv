Australia won't repatriate 34 women and children from Syria,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australia-wont-repatriate-34-women-and-children-from-syria/articleshow/128448220.cms,"Family members of suspected Islamic State militants who are Australian nationals board a van heading to the airport in Damascus during the first repatriation operation of the year, at Roj Camp in eastern Syria (AP photo)





MELBOURNE: The Australian government will not repatriate from Syria a group of 34 women and children with alleged ties to the Islamic State group, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Tuesday.The women and children from 11 families were supposed to fly from the Syrian capital Damascus to Australia but Syrian authorities on Monday turned them back to Roj camp in northeast Syria because of procedural problems, officials said.Only two groups of Australians have been repatriated with government help from Syrian camps since the fall of the Islamic State group in 2019. Other Australians have also returned without government assistance.Albanese would not comment on a report that the latest women and children had Australian passports.""We're providing absolutely no support and we are not repatriating people,"" Albanese told Australian Broadcasting Corp. in Melbourne.""We have no sympathy, frankly, for people who traveled overseas in order to participate in what was an attempt to establish a caliphate to undermine, destroy, our way of life. And so, as my mother would say, 'You make your bed, you lie in it,'"" Albanese added.Albanese noted that the child welfare-focused international charity Save the Children had failed to establish in Australia's courts that the Australian government had a responsibility to repatriate citizens from Syrian camps.After the federal court ruled in the government's favor in 2024, Save the Children Australia chief executive Mat Tinkler argued the government had a moral, if not legal, obligation to repatriate families.Albanese said if the latest group made their way to Australia without government help, they could be charged.It was an offense under Australian law to travel to the former Islamic State stronghold of al-Raqqa province without a legitimate reason from 2014 to 2017. The maximum penalty was 10 years in prison.""It's unfortunate that children are impacted by this as well, but we are not providing any support. And if anyone does manage to find their way back to Australia, then they'll face the full force of the law, if any laws have been broken,"" Albanese added.The last group of Australians to be repatriated from Syrian camps arrived in Sydney in October 2022.They were four mothers, former partners of Islamic State supporters, and 13 children.Australian officials had assessed the group as the most vulnerable among 60 Australian women and children held in Roj camp, the government said at the time.Eight offspring of two slain Australian Islamic State fighters were repatriated from Syria in 2019 by the conservative government that preceded Albanese's center-left Labor Party administration.The issue of Islamic State supporters resurfaced in Australia after the killings of 15 people at a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach on Dec. 14. The attackers were allegedly inspired by IS.",The women and children from 11 families were supposed to fly from the Syrian capital Damascus to Australia.

Trump's Most Shocking New Epstein Secret Out; Disturbing Reveal On Underage Girls | DOJ Kills Link





US President Donald Trump has once again denied any involvement with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, saying he has been “totally exonerated” and has “nothing to hide.”Addressing reporters, Trump said investigations had cleared him of wrongdoing. “I have nothing to hide. I've been exonerated. I have nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein,” he said, adding that Democrats “went in hoping that they'd find it and found just the opposite. ”Trump also claimed that Epstein had opposed his political ambitions. “Jeffrey Epstein was fighting that I don't get elected with some author, a sleazebag, by the way,” he claimed.During the interaction, Trump further suggested that other political figures, including former president Bill Clinton, had been drawn into scrutiny related to Epstein. Taking jabs at the Democrats, he added, ""it's really interesting because they've been pulled in. Think of it. They've been pulled in. Clinton and many other Democrats have been pulled in.""He also hit back at Hillary Clinton's claims that, ""she and her husband are getting pulled into the Epstein matter to divert attention from [Trump]"" and that his ""administration has something to hide"". In response to reporter's questions on the accusations, Trump said, ""No, no.They're getting pulled and that's their problem. I don't know. They're going to have to see what happens. But I watched her in Munich, and she seriously has Trump derangement syndrome. ""Epstein died in 2019 in federal custody while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. His links to prominent figures across politics, business and entertainment have remained a subject of public attention and ongoing scrutiny.This comes after a batch of released Justice Department files referenced past contact between Donald Trump and investigators probing Jeffrey Epstein. According to a 2019 FBI interview summary, former Palm Beach police chief Michael Reiter claims Trump called during the mid-2000s investigation and expressed relief authorities were taking action, stating that people had long known about Epstein’s conduct. The document also records Trump as saying he had banned Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago club and left a gathering after noticing teenagers present. Trump has previously said he cut ties with Epstein more than 20 years ago.The release of the Epstein files led to investigators reviewing allegations and tips involving several prominent figures, including Trump, but officials said they did not find credible information warranting further investigation into sexual misconduct claims against him. The records also confirm prosecutors issued a subpoena to Mar-a-Lago in 2021 during their case against Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell , who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.","President Donald Trump has denied any involvement with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

UAE Employers Can Now Limit Your Annual Leave: What You Need to Know

Can you carry leave forward to the next year in the UAE?



You may carry forward up to half of your annual leave from one year to the next i.e., up to 15 days if your entitlement was 30 days, with employer consent.

If you leave your job before using your leave, you must be paid for any unused days, calculated on your basic salary.

Cash in lieu of leave



Can You Really Carry Over Your UAE Annual Leave? New Rules Clarified

Key takeaways for employees



Plan ahead: Annual leave should normally be taken in the year it’s earned.

Annual leave should normally be taken in the year it’s earned. Carry-forward requires agreement: You must get employer approval to carry days over to next year.

You must get employer approval to carry days over to next year. Unused days have value: If you quit or can’t take your leave, you are still entitled to payment for those days.

If you quit or can’t take your leave, you are still entitled to payment for those days. Two-year protection: Employers can’t block you from using long-unused leave for more than two years unless you request it carried forward or paid.





In February 2026, the UAE’s Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) clarified how annual leave works, especially around carrying over unused days to the next year. This has become a key topic for workers planning time off or negotiating leave with employers.Employees in the UAE are entitled to at least 30 days of fully paid annual leave for each completed year of service after six months on the job. If you have worked more than six months but less than a full year, you earn 2 days of leave for each month worked.Most full-time workers thus see their 30 days credited once they hit a year on the job and employers typically schedule this in agreement with staff or on a rotational basis with at least one month’s notice.Yes but only with employer approval. The ministry confirms that unused annual leave can be carried forward to the next year if both the employee and employer agree. However, key legal interpretations (under Cabinet Resolution No. 1 of 2022) say:These rules reflect Federal Decree-Law No. 33 of 2021 on labour relations and its executive regulations.The law also states that employers cannot stop employees from using their accrued annual leave for more than two years unless the employee asks to carry it forward or to be paid instead.In practice this means many employers will try to schedule a worker’s unused leave within two years or negotiate a carry-forward or payout well before that deadline and they must grant at least some leave in any two-year period.If you and your employer agree, unused leave days can be converted into cash instead of time off. The payout is based on your basic salary at the time the leave was due.This option often comes up when workers and employers cannot agree on leave dates but legally, cash in lieu is not automatic. It depends on mutual consent or company policy.As workplaces in the UAE continue adapting in 2026, with a strong emphasis on employee wellbeing and compliance with updated labour laws, understanding your annual leave rights can help avoid disputes, support better work–life balance planning, and ensure you receive full benefits you are legally entitled to.","In February 2026, the UAE’s Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) clarified how annual leave works.

The fashion impact beyond the blue shirt

Why the blue shirt trending now





In an era of viral gowns and headline-grabbing couture, it is not a crystal-encrusted dress or archival tiara setting the fashion agenda but a crisp, powder-blue button-down shirt. The most talked-about piece in royal and style circles this week is this sharply tailored Oxford shirt from London label With Nothing Underneath, worn within days by Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales, Meghan Markle , Duchess of Sussex and American Vogue’s editorial heavyweight Chloe Malle.In fashion terms, that is less coincidence and more cultural signal because when three women who define modern power dressing across monarchy, media and Montecito reach for the same quietly confident staple, it tells us that 2026 is not about excess. It is about precision, polish and above all, it is about the enduring magnetism of a perfectly cut shirt.The blue button-down, it seems, is having its royal renaissance as an icon of quintessential British style. The British fashion label is suddenly dominating the style conversation and it is not for a gown or a handbag but the classic blue button-down shirt.The light-blue button-down from London label With Nothing Underneath, popularly known as WNU, has popped up on multiple high-profile figures within days as Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales wore it under a tailored blazer during a visit to Castle Hill Academy in South London to mark Children’s Mental Health Week while Chloe Malle, editorial head of American Vogue, styled it in a video interview alongside icon Anna Wintour . Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, too has worn WNU shirts in the past, including a linen version on her Netflix seriesIt is rare for figures from different royal households, especially ones with distinct personal brands and a top fashion editor to converge on the same piece, which speaks to both the shirt’s versatility and subtle cultural momentum.Founded in 2017 by Pip Durell, a former Tatler and British Vogue professional, With Nothing Underneath specialises in classic shirting inspired by men’s tailoring but sized and proportioned for women. The shirts are inspired by men’s tailoring, British heritage and timeless style, out of Durell’s personal search for shirts that were perfectly adjusted for women, sustainably sourced and stood the test of time.They were borne after years of adjusting men’s shirts for her own use. Combining her fashion knowledge and styling credentials with her own very English, effortless approach to dressing, the brand was launched from her home city of London. Today it has grown to encompass an array of wardrobe essentials, from shirts to tailored trousers, that are not led by trends or fleeting style moments instead, they are designed to be forever items in which to live a life of simplicity. In other words, With Nothing Underneath is not just selling shirts; it is helping define a moment in style that blends classic elegance, accessibility and modern wardrobe versatility.They are pared back, laid back, timeless and effortless clothing and inspired by Carolyn Bessette, Jane Birkin and Charlotte Rampling . The label’s success is measurable with £5.7 million in sales in 2024 and 88% growth over three years. It ranked 52nd on The Sunday Times Hundred list of fastest-growing UK private companies. These numbers suggest that WNU is more than a fleeting celebrity endorsement, it is a brand on the rise.The “Royal effect” still matters. Kate’s sartorial choices have long influenced high street fashion, an impact sometimes referred to as the Kate effect, which can boost British brands by hundreds of millions annually and it is not just high-end. Mainstream retailers are seeing similar spikes. For example:These accessible pieces benefit when “royal style” filters down to everyday wardrobes. This moment also fits a wider fashion pattern in early 2026. Light-blue button-downs are showing up in style guides as versatile essentials for office and casual wear.Colour combinations like pale blue with chocolate brown are being touted as must-try seasonal pairings. Meghan has long embraced similar shirting pieces, reinforcing that timeless tailoring, especially shirts, remains central to polished and “quiet luxury” wardrobes.This is not just about one shirt. It shows how royal wardrobes can shape fashion trends globally. It marks a rare fashion overlap between two of the most watched public figures of the decade and highlights how quality basics, not only flashier pieces, can become cultural touchpoints.","The blue button-down, it seems, is having its royal renaissance as an icon of quintessential British style.

As ‪Ramadan 2026‬ approaches, expected to begin around February 18–19, 2026 depending on the crescent moon sighting, Muslims worldwide are preparing for a month of fasting, reflection and community. The holy month lasts approximately 29–30 days and culminates in Eid ul-Fitr celebrations.During Ramadan, observant Muslims fast from dawn (suhoor meal) until sunset (iftar) daily and abstain from food, drink, smoking and other physical needs during daylight hours. The exact suhoor and iftar times vary by location and are based on sunrise and sunset each day.Since Ramadan falls earlier this year in the Gregorian calendar, many parts of the world will also experience shorter fasting hours compared with summer months.Ramadan 2026 falls close to the spring equinox, which means fasting durations are more uniform globally than in years when Ramadan sits in summer or deep winter. In many cities, the daily fast will be around 12–14 hours:Locations closer to the poles or distant latitudes show more variation but by the end of Ramadan these differences narrow as daylight hours converge.While specific times depend on your city and date, approximate examples for 2026 include:Suhoor times mark the last moment you can eat before the fast begins (Fajr) and iftar is at sunset (Maghrib) each day.Moon sighting anticipation is building among Muslims across the world. The start of Ramadan continues to depend on local moon sightings, a tradition upheld by many Muslim communities, adding uncertainty until the night before the official beginning.In parts of the UAE and Middle East, working and school hours are being adjusted to accommodate fasting schedules.

What is the ‘Ring of Fire’ eclipse?

How to watch from the UAE?



The partial phase begins at 1:56 PM UAE time (GST), with the ""Ring of Fire"" reaching its peak at 4:12 PM UAE time.

Look for live streams from NASA or the Virtual Telescope Project. These broadcasts will provide high-definition views from the frozen continent, allowing you to enjoy the celestial choreography without the 14-hour flight or the sub-zero temperatures.

Next eclipse coming in August





Tomorrow, Tuesday, February 17, the world will witness the first solar eclipse of 2026. Known as an ""annular"" eclipse, it happens when the Moon is too far from Earth to completely cover the Sun, leaving a brilliant, fiery ring visible around its edges.However, for those of us in the UAE, there is a catch: the ""Path of Annularity"" is incredibly narrow and remote, sweeping almost exclusively over Antarctica.Because the alignment happens while the Sun is below our local horizon, the eclipse will be entirely invisible from the UAE sky. While we won’t see the sky go dark over the Burj Khalifa, the event remains a major global scientific milestone. Tomorrow, Tuesday, February 17, the world will witness the first solar eclipse of 2026.The term “ring of fire” refers to the bright circle of sunlight that remains visible during an annular solar eclipse. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, temporarily blocking sunlight. However, during an annular eclipse, the Moon is slightly farther away from Earth in its orbit.Because of this increased distance, the Moon appears smaller in the sky and cannot completely cover the Sun’s surface.Instead of plunging the sky into darkness like a total solar eclipse, a thin, brilliant ring of sunlight surrounds the Moon’s dark silhouette.This glowing halo creates the dramatic “ring of fire” effect that captivates skywatchers. Unlike a total solar eclipse, an annular eclipse never produces full darkness because a portion of the Sun always remains visible. During the February 17, 2026 event, this striking ring effect will last for up to about two minutes and twenty seconds at peak viewing locations.Just because you can't see it from your balcony doesn't mean you have to miss the show. Since the eclipse unfolds in one of the most desolate places on Earth, several space agencies and research stations in Antarctica are preparing to share the view.If February feels like a missed opportunity, there is good news. A total solar eclipse will occur on August 12, 2026, visible across parts of Europe including Spain and Iceland. While it will still not be visible from the UAE, it is geographically closer and may attract eclipse chasers from the region planning travel.Additionally, 2026 will feature other astronomical highlights, including lunar eclipses and meteor showers that may be visible from UAE skies.","The first solar eclipse of 2026 will occur on February 17, 2026. Known as an ""annular"" eclipse, it happens when the Moon is too far from Earth to completely cover the Sun. The ""Path of Annularity"" is incredibly narrow and remote, sweeping almost exclusively over Antarctica. The partial phase begins at 1:56 PM UAE time (GST), with the ""Ring of Fire"" reaching its peak at 4:12 PM.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128409393,imgsize-8444,width-400,resizemode-4/solar-eclipse.jpg"

'Steep Consequences': Trump Warns Iran Of Action Despite First Round Of Nuclear Talks





United States president Donald Trump on Monday said he would be involved “indirectly” in talks with Iran on its nuclear programme scheduled for Tuesday in Geneva and urged Tehran to be reasonable.He also referred to the June 2025 B-2 bomber strike and said he believed Iran wanted to reach an agreement.""So I will be involved in those talks, indirectly, and they will be very important, let’s see what can happen. Iran is a very tough negotiator, I would say they're bad negotiators because we could’ve had a deal instead of sending the B2s into knockout, their nuclear potential, and we had to send the B2s. I hope they’re gonna be more reasonable, they wanna make a deal,"" Trump said to reporters.He said Tehran now appeared motivated to negotiate.""I think they wanna make a deal. I don’t think they want the consequences of not making a deal,"" Trump said.The United States and Iran are expected to hold the next round of nuclear talks on Tuesday (local time) in Geneva, Switzerland, CNN reported.US special envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are expected to attend the meetings.Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araqchi met the UN nuclear watchdog chief on Monday and said in a post on X that he was in Geneva to “achieve a fair and equitable deal.”The International Atomic Energy Agency has for months urged Iran to account for its stockpile of 440 kg of highly enriched uranium after Israeli-US strikes and to allow full inspections to resume, including at Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan, which were bombed in June last year.Iran has repeatedly warned it could close the Strait of Hormuz in response to any attack, a move that would disrupt about one-fifth of global oil flows and push crude prices higher.Meanwhile, Iran’s deputy foreign minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi has said Tehran would consider compromises on its uranium stockpile if Washington lifted sanctions that have affected the country’s economy, as cited by the BBC.Iran and the United States held previous rounds of nuclear talks in April 2025 in Muscat and Rome.However, on June 21–22, 2025, the United States carried out strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan under “Operation Midnight Hammer,” which Iran condemned as a violation of international law and the UN Charter.",U.S. president Donald Trump said he would be involved “indirectly’ in talks with Iran on its nuclear programme scheduled for Tuesday in Geneva.

‘Exercised terrible judgment’: Hyatt chief Thomas Pritzker steps down as chairman over Epstein ties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/exercised-terrible-judgment-hyatt-chief-thomas-pritzker-steps-down-as-chairman-over-epstein-ties/articleshow/128444771.cms,"



Billionaire Thomas Pritzker has announced that he will be stepping down as the executive chairman of Hyatt Hotels. The news comes after newly disclosed US justice department files revealed his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The 75-year-old, who has held the role since 2004, said on Monday that he would not seek re-election to the company’s board in 2026. In a statement, Pritzker addressed his past contact with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, expressing regret over the relationship. “Good stewardship also means protecting Hyatt, particularly in the context of my association with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell which I deeply regret,” he said, adding, “I exercised terrible judgment in maintaining contact with them, and there is no excuse for failing to distance myself sooner. ”The newly released records indicate that Pritzker remained in recurring contact with Epstein even after the financier’s 2008 guilty plea to prostitution charges, including soliciting an underage girl. One exchange from 2018 shows Epstein seeking Pritzker’s help with hotel reservations for a woman travelling through Asia who was reportedly his girlfriend. When Pritzker asked about her plans, the woman responded by email, “Going to try to find a new girlfriend for Jeffrey.” Pritzker replied, “May the Force be with you,” accompanied by a smiley face emoji, according to CNN.Pritzker is among several influential figures facing consequences as the US justice department moves towards more disclosures. Economist Larry Summers was banned for life from the American Economic Association over his ties to Epstein, while Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, head of DP World, was replaced over his intimate friendship with the financier. Other global figures have also encountered public backlash and various repercussions linked to their relationships with him.During his time at Hyatt, Pritzker reached key milestones including taking the company public, implementing an “asset-light” strategy and guiding the business through the COVID-19 pandemic.Following his resignation, Hyatt’s board appointed Mark Hoplamazian, the company’s president and chief executive, as chairman with immediate effect.","Billionaire Thomas Pritzker has announced that he will be stepping down as the executive chairman of Hyatt Hotels.

"Video shows chaos as man shoots wife, 2 kids at hockey game in Rhode Island; gunshots send crowd fleeing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/video-shows-chaos-as-man-shoots-wife-2-kids-at-hockey-game-in-rhode-island-gunshots-send-crowd-fleeing/articleshow/128445285.cms,"Key details about the Rhode Island shooting



The shooting occurred at the Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket during a boys’ high school hockey game.

Police say three people, including the suspected gunman, were killed. The suspect died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Three additional victims were taken to hospital and remain in critical condition.

The suspect was identified as a father who may have been wearing women’s clothing at the time of the attack, according to reporting by NBC 10's Dan Jaehnig.

Authorities believe the incident was targeted and linked to a family dispute.

Investigators are reviewing video footage from inside the arena and interviewing witnesses. Unverified social media clips appear to show players diving for cover as multiple shots are heard.

Schools involved in the game confirmed that students on the ice were safe. The shooting is understood to have involved spectators.

Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee said he was monitoring the situation and in contact with local law enforcement. The FBI’s Boston office confirmed it was ready to assist and said there was no ongoing threat.

Mayor Don Grebien called the incident “very tragic”, saying: “These are high school kids… a fun time, and it turned into this.”





Three people are dead after a gunman opened fire during a youth hockey game in Rhode Island, turning what should have been a routine high school fixture into a scene of panic and devastation. The shooting took place on Monday evening at an ice rink in Pawtucket, just north of Providence, with families and students gathered in the stands.Police say the suspected gunman was a father who may have been dressed in women’s clothing. According to local reports, he intentionally targeted family members attending the game. Authorities believe the violence stemmed from a domestic dispute.Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves described the incident as “a targeted event” that “may be a family dispute”. She confirmed that three people, including the suspect, died. The gunman is believed to have shot himself. Three others remain in hospital in critical condition.Inside the arena, witnesses described scenes of chaos as shots rang out shortly after the start of the first period. Players reportedly fled the ice in full kit, while spectators ducked for cover and rushed towards exits. Outside, tearful families embraced as police sealed off surrounding roads and helicopters circled overhead.The attack comes less than two months after a separate gun tragedy in the state, but officials have said the two incidents are not connected.","Police say three people, including the suspected gunman, were killed.

Why the flood threat is serious

What flash flood warnings mean

Risk factors across Los Angeles

Burn scar areas — Hillsides affected by wildfire lack vegetation to absorb water, increasing the chance of debris flows and mudslides.

Urban zones — Heavy rain can quickly overwhelm storm drains and cause water to pool on streets and freeways.

Official advice





Los Angeles and much of Southern California are facing flash flood risks as a series of strong storms moves through the region, bringing heavy rain, thunderstorms and hazardous conditions. Officials and forecasters warn residents to stay alert and prepared because flash floods can develop quickly and with little warning.A powerful weather system has brought intense rainfall to Southern California, including Los Angeles County. The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued flash flood warnings and watches for parts of the county as rainstorms dump significant moisture over the area.Heavy rain has already triggered warnings for places including the Santa Monica Mountains and burn scar zones like the Palisades and Franklin areas, where recent wildfires have left the ground more prone to dangerous debris flows and rapid runoff.Forecasters say this weather pattern is part of a larger system that could bring several days of precipitation, with the heaviest rainfall expected early in the week. Coastal and valley regions may see between 1 to 3 inches of rain, while mountain areas could receive between 2 to 5 inches or more.Storms may also be accompanied by strong winds and isolated thunderstorms. In some conditions, even weak tornado activity cannot be ruled out as part of the larger threat.A flash flood warning means flooding is imminent or already happening. Water can rise rapidly along streams, in urban streets, and in poorly drained areas. A flood watch, on the other hand, means conditions are favourable for flooding.Because flash floods can occur within minutes of heavy rain, authorities urge people not to drive through flooded roads and to seek higher ground if necessary.Certain areas are especially vulnerable:Authorities recommend monitoring local weather bulletins, signing up for emergency alerts, and preparing for possible evacuations in vulnerable locations. Roads may become dangerous, and officials warn that flash flooding can strike fast and without much notice.Staying informed through trusted weather services such as the NWS and local emergency management is essential during these conditions.",A powerful weather system has brought intense rainfall to Southern California.

US State Department has reiterated that visas are not a guaranteed right and can be taken away if foreign visitors act against America’s national interests, following remarks by secretary of state Marco Rubio during a visit to Hungary.In a video shared by the department, Rubio said he had made the point repeatedly and wanted to make it clear again.“I’ve said this repeatedly. I don’t know why it’s so hard for some to comprehend it,” he said. “No one is entitled to a visa,"" he added.The top Trump aide was speaking in Budapest on Monday during a bilateral visit that included a joint press event with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.Rubio explained that a visa is essentially permission to enter the United States. “A visa is a permission to enter our country as a visitor,” he said.He added that if someone enters as a visitor, whether as a student, tourist, journalist or in any other capacity, and then undertakes activities that go “against the national interest, the national security of the United States, we will take away your visa.” Rubio also said that if officials had known in advance about such activity, they probably would not have issued the visa in the first place.The State Department’s warning comes with a bigger push by the US government to treat visas as conditional and subject to revocation under existing law. The department has emphasised that consular officers around the world routinely deny visas for a range of reasons, including concerns over overstaying or criminal behaviour.Rubio has made similar points in the past, telling lawmakers that a visa is a privilege rather than a right and with a hardline ant-immigrant stance saying that there is no constitutional entitlement to one.","US State Department has reiterated that visas are not a guaranteed right and can be taken away if foreign visitors act against America’s national interests.

Conspiracy theories and public suspicion

What remains unresolved





After decades of frozen diplomacy and political hostility, the United States and Cuba cautiously turned a page. Under US President Barack Obama , diplomatic ties were restored and the US Embassy in Havana reopened. On the Cuban side, the country was led by Raul Castro, who had taken over from his brother Fidel Castro. American diplomats, intelligence officers and support staff arrived for what was expected to be a routine overseas posting. The mission carried political sensitivities, but nothing unusual. There was no expectation of danger beyond standard surveillance risks. The early months passed quietly and as planned.Then something unexpected began to unfold. It was not a political crisis or a security breach. Instead, US personnel started reporting intense head pressure, piercing headaches, dizziness and nausea. Some struggled to concentrate or remember simple details. Others experienced ringing in their ears or sudden balance problems. A few said they heard odd sounds shortly before symptoms appeared, while others fell ill without any sensory trigger.Medical tests produced no clear answers. There was no obvious toxin, no visible injury and no explanation anyone could point to. What began as scattered complaints soon formed a troubling pattern. The phenomenon would later be known as Havana syndrome.Nearly a decade later, the mystery has returned to the spotlight. A Norwegian government scientist has revived debate after building and testing a homemade microwave device on himself. Following the experiment, he developed symptoms similar to those reported by US personnel in Havana. The incident was reported to the CIA. While the experiment does not explain what caused Havana syndrome, it has reopened long-standing questions and renewed scrutiny of an illness that was never fully understood.As reports increased in late 2016, US officials grew concerned. The symptoms appeared suddenly and affected trained professionals with no shared medical history. Some individuals said their symptoms intensified in certain locations and eased when they moved away. Several affected personnel were quietly withdrawn from Havana for further evaluation.When the illnesses became public in 2017, the US reduced embassy staffing and expelled Cuban diplomats from Washington. Cuba denied any involvement and invited international investigation. At that stage, no device had been found and no cause had been identified.The story did not remain confined to Havana. Similar symptoms were later reported by US personnel in China, parts of Europe and other regions. Cases were even recorded inside the United States. The geographic spread complicated every theory. Environmental explanations struggled to account for such varied locations. Psychological explanations raised doubts because of the sudden onset and physical nature of the symptoms. Claims of an attack lacked a clear weapon or perpetrator.The US government launched multiple intelligence and scientific reviews. Some experts argued the symptoms could be explained by stress-related or functional neurological disorders. Others said those explanations did not fully account for the reported sensory experiences or neurological findings.In 2023, a major US intelligence assessment concluded that it was very unlikely a foreign adversary was responsible for most cases. The report said many incidents were better explained by common medical or environmental factors. It did not dismiss all cases, nor did it deny that those affected were genuinely ill.Other reviews took a more cautious approach. A scientific panel convened by US intelligence agencies found that pulsed electromagnetic energy could plausibly explain some core symptoms. The lack of consistent data and wide variation between cases prevented firm conclusions.The debate shifted again after developments in Norway. A government scientist who was sceptical of directed-energy theories decided to test the idea himself. He built a homemade device that emitted pulsed microwave or radio-frequency energy and exposed himself to it.According to officials briefed on the case, the scientist later developed neurological symptoms resembling those reported by US personnel years earlier. Norwegian authorities alerted the United States. Officials from the CIA, the Pentagon and the White House reviewed the incident.The experiment did not prove Havana syndrome was caused by an attack. It did show that pulsed energy can affect the human nervous system under certain conditions. That alone was enough to reopen questions many believed were settled.Scientists and intelligence officials have warned that a single self-experiment cannot resolve a mystery as complex as Havana syndrome. David Relman, who chaired a US intelligence advisory panel on the illness, has said that similar symptoms do not automatically point to a single cause. He has argued that while pulsed energy remains plausible, the evidence is incomplete.US intelligence agencies have echoed that caution. The 2023 multi-agency assessment warned against confirmation bias driven by fear or geopolitics and urged restraint in drawing conclusions without stronger evidence.Other prominent voices have also questioned government messaging. A bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee criticised the CIA for inconsistent handling of cases and unclear communication. CIA Director William J. Burns acknowledged that affected personnel were genuinely ill, while saying investigations had not found credible evidence of a foreign attack. Former CIA officer Marc Polymeropoulos challenged early sceptical views and argued that the pattern of cases deserved serious investigation rather than reassurance. Together, these voices underscored a central tension. The symptoms were real. The cause remained unknown.Sceptics have argued that Havana syndrome does not behave like a single disease or weapon effect. Some neurologists and psychologists have pointed to functional neurological disorders, stress responses or environmental exposure as more likely explanations. They note that symptoms varied widely and diagnostic findings often failed to align.The National Academies of Sciences previously acknowledged that electromagnetic energy could plausibly explain some symptoms, while stressing the lack of direct evidence linking it to real-world attacks. This divide has left the scientific community split between those urging deeper investigation and those warning against fixation on exotic explanations.As years passed without clear answers, speculation filled the void. Online forums dissected embassy floor plans and analysed audio recordings. Some claimed the symptoms matched secret Cold War weapons. Others blamed foreign intelligence services or covert surveillance devices. A few suggested a hidden global campaign that governments were refusing to admit.For those who were ill, the theories were often painful rather than entertaining. Many said speculation distracted from their suffering and turned a medical mystery into an online battleground. Intelligence agencies repeatedly stated there was no evidence of a coordinated attack. Still, secrecy, uncertainty and real human harm allowed rumours to spread faster than facts.No device was ever recovered in Havana. No attacker was identified. No single explanation accounts for every reported case. Yet the people affected were real, and many saw their health and careers permanently altered.The Norwegian experiment did not solve the Havana syndrome mystery. It reopened it. Whether what happened in Havana in 2016 was an attack, an environmental exposure, a medical phenomenon or a combination of factors remains one of the most persistent unanswered questions in modern diplomacy and security.What is clear is that something happened. Nearly a decade later, the world is still trying to understand what it was.","US personnel reported intense head pressure, piercing headaches, dizziness and nausea.

White House former Speaker of Nancy Pelosi is a “fan girl” of Gavin Newsom and set her sights on getting him in the White House, a report claimed.The 85-year-old, who is serving out her last term before stepping down this year, believed the California governor would make a “great President”, according to Axios.“She’s a Gavin fan girl and she doesn’t crush on many people,” one former Pelosi aide said. “I will say this: She’s hardly ever wrong.

The hidden MAGA message in Marco Rubio's 'civilisational erasure' warning to Europe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-hidden-maga-message-in-marco-rubios-civilisational-erasure-warning-to-europe/articleshow/128429758.cms,"The Treaty of Westphalia

End of history: Marco Rubio edition

Europe hears the ultimatum





There’s a hilarious BBC skit titled The Treaty of Westphalia (part of it’s the Complete History of Everything) which imagines the dialogues between European superpowers as they divide the continent, taking digs at each other’s fish-eating habits (pickled herring), bonding over the desire to kick German arse, figuring out how to split Luxembourg, and wondering whether they ought to have a common currency.Great Britain, for its part, says it is more interested in its colony in America. This leads the lead negotiator to wonder what good America is other than “tobacco, potatoes, and the high-grade narcotics” that you are fond of (while pointing at France, played by Hugh Laurie). Of course, that particular joke becomes wonderfully time-layered because years later Hugh Laurie would play Dr Gregory House, a version of Sherlock Holmes with whom he shares both a manic desire to solve cases and a drug addiction. Of course, a longer historical joke is how Britain’s “new colony” is the one dictating Europe’s fate centuries later.While Western Europe — since 1945 — has becoming increasingly dependent on America, in time the Monroe Doctrine gave way to the Donroe Doctrine, which is simply Trump doing whatever he wants.Read: The real Trump Doctrine Since his return from political exile — something even Napoleon couldn’t do — Trump has gone out of his way to treat Europe the way it once treated the rest of world: like a body bag without impunity.Throughout history, Europeans have been adept at using civilisational language to create a grammar of violence to justify its barbarisms. Land grabs were Crusades to restore Christian lands. Colonialism was a White Man’s Burden, not a ploy to sell opium and take slaves. Trump is largely immune to such niceties of linguistics but Marco Rubio , his Secretary of State, National Security Advisor, and the most competent man in the Trump administration is a bit of the dyed-in-the-wool Republican which explains why he took a more conciliatory tone at this year’s Munich Security Conference.For decades after the Cold War till 9/11, Western policymakers lived under what might be called the Fukuyama spell: the belief that, whatever turbulence the world produced, liberal democracy would win upcoming battles: economic, ecumenic, and, ideological.For the uninitiated, the argument that political theorist Francis Fukuyama espoused in The End of History was that liberal democracy, powered by capitalism and free markets, would remain undefeated, that no rival system could hope to challenge that hegemony.Many folks disagreed.The most famous of them was Samuel Huntington, who argued in The Clash of Civilisations that the future axis of conflicts would not be ideological but civilisational. He even handpicked a few civilisations which he believed would challenge Western hegemony: the Orthodox order led by Russia, the Sinic order led by China, the Islamic world, and the Hindu civilisation centred in India.That civilisational pushback is no longer theoretical.China has risen not by copying Western liberal democracy but by strengthening a distinct political model rooted in civilisational continuity with a mix of cafeteria communism or capitalism. Russia has returned somewhat to its Orthodox roots and is flexing its muscle. India’s rise is also tied to the rediscovery of its civilisational identity rather than buying into Western constructs. Even across the Islamic world, political rhetoric increasingly speaks the language of cultural authenticity rather than ideological alignment. And even within Europe, Islam has become a spanner in its liberal order which has hastened the rise of right-wing populism across Europe and America.Without mentioning Fukuyama or Huntington or any civilisation by name, Rubio took a hammer to the so-called rules-based international order in Munich. “We convinced ourselves that we had entered the end of history — that every nation would eventually become a liberal democracy,’ he said.From that assumption flowed a series of choices: Western governments came to believe that “trade would replace geopolitics” and that international institutions could substitute for national sovereignty. It didn’t factor in the rise of other civilisational forces.In a speech reminiscent of someone reminding a chicken that it has descended from dinosaurs, Rubio evoked Europe’s greatness, reminding it that it was the land of Beethoven and the Beatles, before laying the blame for Europe’s plight on deindustrialisation, mass migration, climate orthodoxy, and excessive dependence on international institutions. Thankfully, he didn’t mention wokeism by name.He argued: “Acting together in this way, we will not just help recover a sane foreign policy. It will restore to us a clearer sense of ourselves. It will restore a place in the world, and in so doing, it will rebuke and deter the forces of civilizational erasure that today menace both America and Europe alike.”Calling America a “child of Europe”, he signed off: “We should be proud of what we achieved together in the last century, but now we must confront and embrace the opportunities of a new one — because yesterday is over, the future is inevitable, and our destiny together awaits.”For its part, most European leaders publicly celebrated the remarks, seeing them as a thaw in relations after last year’s JD Vance speech, which was far blunter. Privately, however, European officials understood the subtext perfectly. One EU official cautioned, telling Politico: “It is a milder way of telling us that the time of unicorns riding bicycles across rainbows laced with tofu and almond milk is over. This is not simply about being reassured or not. It is about whether we want to live in reality or in an artificial la la land of big announcements.”The notion, in truth, was very simple — and exactly what Rubio left unsaid: Join us, or else.Last year, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte had jokingly referred to Trump as “daddy”. Since then, Europeans have tried to show greater independence. But beneath Rubio’s civilisational rhetoric lies the same strategic warning. Speaking of civilisational language, in India’s capital there is a rustic phrase often used during street fights when one politely flaunts the true nature of one’s patriarchal lineage: “Tu janta hai mera baap kaun hai?"" (Do you know who's my daddy?)""That's what Rubio was politely doing, asking Europe: do you know who is your daddy? And reminding Europe what would happen if America decided to stop being said daddy. While reminding Europe of its history, he also politely reminded it that what Rubio is perhaps telling Europe — exactly what Trump and Co think of them — is that they are on the verge of irrelevance. Join Trump and Co and return to that civilisational parity, but only if one is willing to bend the knee.The child it would appear is the father of man. The Treaty of Westphalia was a long time ago. The days when Europe could sail the world and challenge anyone is long gone. The world will no longer fight – or even care for Europe’s wars – and call them World Wars. Instead, the shoe is now on the other foot and Rubio is asking Europe if it wants to be part of that history or fade into irrelevance.Just a tad more politely than Trump ever did. He is essentially quoting the T-800 from Terminator 2: Come with me if you want to leave. Whose Trumpian version is: come with us or face civilisational erasure.","The Monroe Doctrine gave way to the Donroe Doctrine, which is simply Trump doing whatever he wants.

Trump’s ICE ‘operation metro surge’ cost Minneapolis $203 million: Official,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-ice-operation-metro-surge-cost-minneapolis-203-million-official/articleshow/128427394.cms,"‘Stop This Invasion’: Minnesota Sues Trump Admin Over ICE Surge After Fatal Minneapolis Shooting





Minneapolis officials said on Friday that Operation Metro Surge, a federal immigration enforcement deployment by the Trump administration, cost the city at least $203 million.The statement came on Friday as the White House began winding down the operation across Minnesota following months of occupation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents.Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, and emergency management officials detailed losses to wages, restaurants and small businesses, housing stability, food security, and mental health services as agents surged personnel into the metro beginning in December 2025.The assessment also came as calls for Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem to resign continued, following the operation that resulted in the deaths of US citizens Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti.The Trump administration insisted that it pursued only illegal immigrants with criminal records in its operation.City leaders said the scale of the reported impacts threatened core municipal services and amplified needs among vulnerable residents as the operation disrupted daily life and commerce across Minneapolis.The assessment pointed to up to 3,000 federal agents operating in neighbourhoods and estimated that about 76,000 people faced food insecurity tied to the surge. Officials also warned the city’s budget absorbed more than $6 million in police overtime, staff payroll, and operational costs in January, compounding a pre-existing fiscal challenge, The Minnesota Star Tribune reported.Minneapolis released a “Preliminary Impact Assessment & Relief Needs Overview” that tallied at least $203.1 million in January impacts, including an estimated $47 million in lost wages among residents who stayed home from work out of fear, and about $81 million in restaurant and small-business revenue losses.The assessment cited an additional $15.7 million in rent assistance needs and a weekly $2.4 million cost to meet food needs for approximately 76,200 people.Officials emphasised the totals likely understated the full impact, noting the business-loss figures drew from a voluntary survey with responses from 82 of nearly 1,300 restaurants.The Minneapolis Police Department was also forced to extend shifts and cancel days off, driving overtime that, over 5 days in January, exceeded the department’s full-year overtime budget, according to city officials.","Minneapolis officials said on Friday that Operation Metro Surge, a federal immigration enforcement deployment by the Trump administration, cost the city at least $203 million.

Pakistan Army Chief Asim Munir was briefly stopped and asked to produce his identity card by security staff at the Munich Security Conference in Germany.A video that went viral on social media showed a security officer asking the Pakistani army chief to keep his identity card visible. Just steps away from the conference entry, a security official is heard saying, “Stop… where is your ID? Please flip your ID card. ”The Munich Security Conference, widely regarded as a key platform for dialogue and conflict resolution, annually brings together world leaders, diplomats, and security experts to address international peace and security challenges.Meanwhile, Munir’s visit was also objected to by Germany-based Sindhi political organisation Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), which called the invitation “deeply regrettable.” Members of the JSMM protested outside the venue, highlighting alleged human rights violations in Pakistan.In a formal statement addressed to the United Nations, the European Union, the German government, and international human rights bodies, JSMM Chairman Shafi Burfat expressed what he described as “deep shock and regret” over Munir’s presence at the high-level global forum.JSMM alleged that Pakistan’s military establishment has a historical record of human rights violations and political interference.The group referred to the 1971 events in former East Pakistan that led to the creation of Bangladesh, describing them as genocide. It also accused Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies of supporting extremist elements in the region — allegations that Islamabad has consistently denied.The organisation further claimed that Pakistan’s military wields disproportionate influence over the country’s political and judicial institutions. It cited the assassinations of former leaders, including Liaquat Ali Khan and Benazir Bhutto, as well as the execution of former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, as examples of alleged instability linked to military dominance.

'Imran Khan’s Health Stable, But Facing Mental Torture', Claims Sister After Jail Visit





PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan underwent an eye examination at Adiala Jail on Sunday following a Supreme Court order, with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) calling the process as “malicious” and questioning the exclusion of his family and personal doctors.According to news website Dawn, a five-member medical team conducted a detailed examination that lasted about an hour. The doctors collected blood samples, measured his blood pressure and brought their own equipment. The process reportedly began after a two-and-a-half-hour wait and a report is expected to be compiled soon.Shortly after the examination ended around 5.30 pm, PTI issued a statement on X rejecting the procedure and objecting to the absence of Imran’s family and personal physicians.“Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf categorically rejects the recent conduct of the government and jail administration regarding the medical examination of former prime minister Imran Khan's eye in Adiala Jail. The government's claim that a message was sent to the party leadership to arrive at the jail at the time of the examination is, in fact, a crude attempt to divert attention from the core issue,” the party said.Explaining its objection, the statement added, “This matter was never about the presence or absence of the party leadership.In such sensitive and delicate medical matters, the constitutional, moral, and legal right to make decisions belongs to Imran Khan's family. The family cannot make an informed decision until Imran Khan's personal doctors are present for the examination. Therefore, inviting the party leadership symbolically has neither any moral rationale nor any legal justification. ”Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum also said that no medical board would be accepted without the approval of his personal doctors.Referring to reports that he might be shifted to Al-Shifa Eye Hospital in Rawalpindi, she reiterated, “Our demand has been clear from the beginning. Imran Khan shall not be given any treatment without the presence and approval of his personal doctors and family members.”She further said, “We do not accept any medical board they set up and control! We do not accept any reports or results they manufacture.”Questioning the exclusion of family members and doctors recommended by Imran’s team, she asked, “Why are they rejecting the supervision by Imran Khan's personal doctors? Why are they rejecting the presence of Imran Khan's family members? Why such fierce resistance? Are they hiding something?”The examination was carried out after the Supreme Court directed the formation of a medical board to assess Imran’s condition. The order followed his claim on February 12 that his right eye retained only 15 per cent vision. The court also allowed him to speak with his children before February 16.Although government officials had indicated on Saturday that Imran might be transferred to a hospital, no shift had taken place by Sunday afternoon. At 3.45 pm, his sister Noreen Khanum said that an ambulance had arrived at the jail to move him.“But, this is unacceptable to us without us and Khan sahib's personal doctors being taken into confidence,” she said.The jail superintendent dismissed reports of a transfer as a “rumour” and clarified that only a medical examination was underway.“The medical team will examine Imran's eyes, conduct different tests, and decide whether there is a requirement to move him to a hospital or if he can be retained in jail and continue the treatment here,” the superintendent said.Imran had earlier undergone a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad on the night of January 24, a development that was confirmed later amid limited information shared with his family.Imran’s personal physicians, Aasim Yusuf and Faisal Sultan, also called for a comprehensive evaluation at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad, news agnecy PTI reported citing Dawn.In a joint video statement they said, “In addition to urgent retina specialist care for his central retinal vein occlusion and severe vision loss, Imran Khan needs a full multidisciplinary evaluation of his underlying conditions at a tertiary hospital like Shifa International Islamabad.”Meanwhile, the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) alliance continued its sit-in at Parliament House for the third day, demanding that Imran be treated at a hospital chosen by his personal doctors.PTI MNA Asad Qaiser told reporters, “We will not compromise on Imran's health.”A TTAP leader said that the initial understanding to shift Imran to Shifa International collapsed due to demands to change the composition of the medical board. The alliance also alleged that access to food, water and medicines inside Parliament House had been blocked for the third day.Describing the reported denial of medicine to Senator Abbas as an “extreme and condemnable act,” the alliance said, “Prioritising any political disagreement over human compassion and medical needs is the worst form of oppression.”Vowing to continue the protest, TTAP stated, “History bears witness that tyrannical tricks, sieges, and oppression have never suppressed movements, nor forced those standing firm on the right side to back down from their demands.”The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan expressed grave concern over the health of PTI-affiliated prisoners, particularly Imran Khan and Yasmin Rashid and urged authorities to ensure immediate independent medical examinations and uninterrupted access to treatment.",Imran Khan underwent an eye examination at Adiala Jail on Sunday following a Supreme Court order.

The recent disappearances of several people in Balochistan have been linked to Pakistan’s security apparatus, sparking fear and anxiety among families.At least seven individuals are reported missing in incidents connected to Panjgur and Karachi.Residents of Pulabad, a locality in Panjgur, described a recent raid where armed personnel searched homes and detained at least six people. Witnesses said those taken were transported to unknown locations. Locals mentioned two names, Inayat and Rasheed, while the identities of the other detainees could not be independently confirmed, reported ANI citing The Balochistan Post.In a separate case, 23-year-old Zulfiqar, son of Hameed and a resident of Tasp, was reportedly seized from a marketplace on February 13, 2026. Locals alleged that men linked to a state-backed armed faction, commonly described as a “death squad,” carried out the detention. Family members have not received any information regarding his condition since the incident.Another case raising alarm involves Zakir Noor, a student from Panjgur, who was allegedly detained in Karachi on December 30, 2025.The Baloch rights organisation Paank said he was taken by security personnel without legal documentation.Noor has not contacted his family since, fueling fears he may have been transferred to an undisclosed detention site.Paank said secret confinement places detainees at serious risk and violates international safeguards against arbitrary arrest. Activists added that the pattern disproportionately affects students and young men, especially those who migrate to major cities for education or work.","At least seven individuals are reported missing in incidents connected to Panjgur and Karachi.

'We were not consulted': Imran Khan’s sister

(With AP inputs)





Pakistan’s information minister Ataullah Tarar on Saturday announced that imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan will undergo treatment for an eye condition at a specialised medical facility, days after the Supreme Court ordered a medical evaluation amid growing concerns about the cricketer-turned-politician’s eyesight.Tarar wrote on X that an examination would be conducted by leading eye specialists as part of Khan’s ongoing treatment, which began in late January after the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder-chairman claimed ""partial loss of vision"" in his right eye.The minister, however, did not specify the medical facility or the date of treatment and urged the public to avoid speculation.“A detailed report will also be submitted to the Supreme Court. Conjecture, speculations, and efforts to turn this into political rhetoric and mileage for vested interests may please be avoided,” Tarar posted.Earlier this week, Khan’s lawyer and PTI member Salman Safdar told the Supreme Court that the ex-premier had lost roughly 85% of vision in his right eye. The court subsequently directed authorities to arrange a medical assessment by a panel of doctors and facilitate a telephone call between Khan and his two UK-based sons before February 16.PTI supporters have staged protests in the capital, Islamabad, and other cities, demanding that their party chief be shifted from prison to a hospital for specialised treatment. Some lawmakers from PTI and its allies are also staging a sit-in outside Parliament.Meanwhile, Khan’s sister Aleema Khan reacted angrily to Tarar's announcement, saying the family had not been consulted and demanding that family members and his personal physician be present during any future procedures.She confirmed that, following the Supreme Court’s directive, authorities had arranged a call between her brother and his two sons, who live with their mother and his former wife, British screenwriter and producer Jemima Goldsmith.Khan was removed from office in a parliamentary no-confidence vote in April 2022. He has alleged that his ouster was the result of a US-backed “conspiracy” involving political rivals and Pakistan’s then army chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa — allegations denied by Washington, Pakistan’s military, and Khan’s political opponents.The issue of Khan’s partial vision surfaced in late January when the federal government said the former prime minister had undergone a medical procedure for an eye condition and was in ""good health.""The PTI made a strong showing in the February 2024 parliamentary elections but did not secure a majority in the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament. The party alleged the vote was “rigged,” a claim the government has denied.","Pakistan’s information minister Ataullah Tarar on Saturday announced that imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan will undergo treatment for an eye condition.

Imran Khan’s Family Stages Prayer Protest After Being Barred From Meeting Him At Adiala Jail





The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Thursday directed authorities to constitute a medical board to assess the health of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan after reports surfaced about a loss of vision in one of his eyes.A bench comprising Chief Justice Yahya Afridi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan also instructed officials to facilitate communication between Khan and his two sons, who live in the United Kingdom with his former wife, British producer and screenwriter Jemima Goldsmith.“The issue of Imran’s health is most important. Intervention is necessary. His phone calls with his son are also important,” Chief Justice Afridi said during the hearing.The order came after the bench resumed hearing a case about the jail conditions of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder-president and ordered a detailed medical check-up before February 16. During the hearing, Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan said it was the state’s responsibility to provide the former prime minister with medical care.The order also came two days after the court asked PTI leader and lawyer Salman Safdar to meet Khan at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where the cricketer-turned-politician has been held since August 5, 2023, following his conviction in a corruption case.Safdar later submitted his report to the court after meeting Khan. It was the first meeting with the jailed leader since December 2, when his sister, Uzma Khan, was allowed to see him for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, Dawn newspaper, citing the report, noted that it detailed Safdar’s meeting with Khan, the condition of his cell, the facilities provided to him, a description of his living area and the process the lawyer followed to reach the jail.In the report, Safdar quoted Khan as stating that despite receiving treatment, including an injection, he has only 15% vision left in his right eye.Khan reportedly told Safdar that until October 2025, he had normal vision in both eyes. He later began experiencing constant blurred and hazy vision, which he repeatedly reported to the then jail superintendent, but no action was taken.The report added that Khan eventually suffered a sudden and complete loss of vision in his right eye. An eye specialist from Pims Hospital, Dr Muhammad Arif, was then called to examine him.He was diagnosed with a blood clot that caused serious damage. Despite treatment, including an injection, his vision in the right eye remains at only 15 per cent.A day earlier, Safdar denied making any statement about Khan’s health on Tuesday, clarifying that anything attributed to him on the matter had been misrepresented or misreported.However, on the day he met Khan, Safdar told reporters that the jailed leader was “fine and healthy.”","The Supreme Court of Pakistan has ordered a medical board to assess the health of Imran Khan.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has delivered a scathing assessment of his country’s past alliances with Washington, telling the National Assembly that Islamabad had been “used like toilet paper and then discarded” after serving American interests in Afghanistan.Speaking during a debate on terrorism following a deadly suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Islamabad, Asif said Pakistan had repeatedly joined “superpower wars” that were never its own.“We took part in two wars that were fought on the soil of Afghanistan,” Asif told lawmakers. Referring to the Soviet intervention in 1979, he claimed it was carried out “at the invitation of the government in Kabul” and that the narrative of an outright invasion was shaped by the United States.Pakistan, he said, entered those conflicts “in the name of Islam and religion”, but in reality two former military dictators sought legitimacy and the backing of a global power.“These were not our wars; they were superpower wars,” he said, adding that Pakistan and its land were used and then discarded ""like toilet paper.""Asif went on to describe terrorism in Pakistan as the “blowback of mistakes committed by dictators in the past”.He added that Pakistan had failed to learn from history, continuing to shift between Washington, Moscow and London in pursuit of short-term interests.""For our own interests, we sometimes turn to Washington, sometimes to Moscow, and sometimes to Britain. We have built strong franchises here, which was not the case 30 or 40 years ago,"" Asif said.Recalling then US President Bill Clinton’s brief stop in Islamabad in 2000, a visit lasting only a few hours at the end of a longer India trip, Asif said it underscored how transactional the relationship had become. Clinton’s engagement with then military ruler Pervez Musharraf was framed by US demands on democracy, non-proliferation and militancy, reinforcing.Asif’s remarks came as parliament passed a resolution condemning the attack on Imambargah Qasr-e-Khadijatul Kubra in Islamabad’s Tarlai area, where a suicide bomber killed 31 people and wounded 169 during Friday prayers. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. Thousands attended funerals across the capital as grieving families demanded accountability. “What happened yesterday has left us extremely angry and deeply hurt,” said Bushra Rahmani, whose brother was among the wounded.The minister urged political unity, lamenting what he called a lack of consensus even in condemning terrorism. “It is very important that we have a national identity on which no one disagrees,” he said, criticising those who, for political reasons, avoided attending the funerals of victims.","Defence minister Khawaja Asif criticises Pakistan's past alliances with the U.S. and Russia.

Pakistan’s Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday launched a sharp attack on Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy, questioning how extremist elements continue to cross the border even as trade remains blocked.Speaking at a public gathering in Rawalpindi, Rehman highlighted what he described as a glaring contradiction in Islamabad’s approach towards Afghanistan. “In all these decades, we never paused to ask why our Afghan policy failed so miserably. Not a single pomegranate or melon can enter Pakistan, yet terrorists keep crossing the border,” he said, smiling as he made the remark.Referring to repeated claims by Pakistani authorities that militants were entering from Afghanistan, Rehman added, “Authorities say terrorists are coming from there. If they are coming, stop them. If they are coming, eliminate them. The Afghan government has never objected to your actions.”The JUI-F leader also criticised Pakistan’s broader foreign and economic policies, calling them “complete failures”. He said Islamabad’s diplomatic approach had left the country increasingly isolated.“India is our enemy, Afghanistan is our enemy, and even Iran and China are upset with us,” Rehman said, adding that the public deserved answers.“A nation cannot survive when its policies produce only isolation, mistrust and insecurity.”He argued that Pakistan’s foreign policy was being driven not by elected governments but by the military establishment. “One general comes and says we will negotiate; another comes and says we will wage war,” he said.Rehman also took aim at the government’s handling of the China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC), claiming that the flagship infrastructure project had stalled due to declining Chinese confidence.“CPEC has seen no real progress during this tenure because China no longer trusts us,” he said, questioning whether “even a single brick” had moved under the current government. He claimed Beijing had expected the Pakistan democratic movement (PDM) government to stabilise relations and revive projects, but remained dissatisfied.Rehman’s remarks come amid heightened tensions following a suicide bombing at a mosque in Islamabad on Friday that killed 69 people and injured more than 170, according to local media reports citing hospital officials. The blast occurred during Friday prayers at Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra in the Tarlai area, Dawn reported.After Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif suggested on X that preliminary findings pointed to the attacker having travelled to and from Afghanistan, Kabul rejected the allegation. Afghanistan’s ministry of national defence termed the claim “irresponsible and baseless” and urged Pakistani authorities to take responsibility for internal security lapses, Afghan media outlet Ariana News reported.The Afghan ministry said similar accusations had been made in the past following attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, without conclusive evidence.","Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman criticises Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy.

'Not Vassals Of Trump & Elon Musk': Spain's Deputy PM Makes Blistering Exit From 'Place Of Hate' X





Pakistan’s decision on granting a licence to Starlink to operate in its satellite internet market has been delayed amid data security concerns, geopolitical sensitivities and competition from Chinese firms, local media reported on Sunday.Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk , is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan. However, officials say unresolved security considerations and broader geopolitical factors have slowed the clearance process.According to the Express Tribune, the government has raised concerns that Starlink’s services could allow certain data transmissions to bypass Pakistan’s monitoring, regulatory and safety checks. “We cannot allow a license to Starlink without ensuring a safety check to ensure the safety of the data of consumers in Pakistan,” a senior government official was quoted as saying by Express Tribune.Sources cited by the newspaper said authorities had tested scenarios in which Starlink was expected to pick up sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services. “But the real reason is that the government has tested some cases in which Starlink was supposed to pick up some sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services,” sources said.Officials added that the government is working to address these issues, which have delayed the approval process.The report also cited the fallout between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk as a factor being weighed by the Pakistani establishment. While Trump and Musk had enjoyed a close relationship in the past, they later drifted apart. Officials indicated that Pakistan, which has seen improved ties with the United States since Trump returned to power last year, is cautious about taking steps that could draw scrutiny from Washington.At present, Pakistan maintains control over internet data traffic largely through Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited, which holds a majority stake in the country’s undersea cable infrastructure. Authorities are concerned that similar oversight may not be feasible with satellite-based services, raising fears of potential data breaches or loss of regulatory control.Satellite internet services are expected to focus primarily on remote and underserved regions, including Balochistan, where conventional broadband infrastructure remains limited. Currently, authorities are able to monitor internet traffic and suspend connectivity when required for security reasons. Officials have expressed concern that enforcing similar controls over satellite-based networks could prove more challenging.The Pakistan Space Activities Regulatory Board has confirmed that five companies, including Starlink and China-based Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology Limited, have shown interest in entering the satellite internet market. Chinese firms already have a strong presence in Pakistan’s telecommunications sector and are viewed as direct competitors to US-based companies such as Starlink.While consultations with stakeholders have been completed, the PSARB has yet to finalise the licensing framework. According to officials, additional time is needed to establish safety mechanisms before satellite-based internet services are permitted to begin operations.","Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday. Toll rose to 36 on Saturday after some critically injured people died in hospitals, said a PTI report.In a related development that has attracted the attention of Indian security establishment, the Islamic State in its latest al-Naba issue called on members of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) to defect and join the Islamic State in Khorasan Province.The claim regarding the blast was issued via IS central's mouthpiece, Amaq, stating the attack was a Fidayeen operation carried out by a soldier of the Islamic State in Pakistan Province (ISPP) -- active since 2019 -- inside the mosque compound. Amaq claimed over 200 casualties in contrast to the official Pak govt admission of 36 deaths and injuries to scores.The suicide bomber was identified by Amaq as Saifullah Ansari. His photograph taking the bayah (oath of allegiance) was also posted by the IS mouthpiece. The statement also mentioned that hundreds of Pakistani Shias had joined the pro-Iran 'Zaynabiyoun brigade' militia in Syria.The claim by Amaq followed an official denial by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which strongly rebutted any involvement in the incident.The blast, which occurred during prayers at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque in Tarlai area, was the deadliest in Islamabad since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.The explosion coincided with the visit of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to Pakistan. The attack is being seen as a result of growing sectarian tensions in the country.Earlier in Jan, ISKP had claimed responsibility for a blast in Bajaur district that killed a senior Lashkar commander named Najibullah.","Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday.

'Home-Grown Ills': Islamabad Mosque Blast Triggers Blame Game As India Rejects Pakistan's Blame





The Islamic State on Saturday claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad, which killed at least 36 people and injured many others.In a statement released through its Amaq News Agency, the Islamic State in Pakistan, an offshoot of Daesh, said the bomber opened fire at security guards when they tried to stop him at the entrance and then exploded inside among worshippers.The group also said Shiite Muslims in Pakistan were a target, claiming they provided recruits to militias fighting the Islamic State in Syria.The blast took place on Friday at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque-cum-shrine in the Tarlie area of the capital. The attacker, identified as 32-year-old Yasir from Peshawar, entered the mosque while worshippers were offering weekly prayers and detonated explosives.Authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said they arrested four suspects, including three alleged facilitators and the mastermind, during intelligence-based raids in Peshawar and Nowshera.Investigators said an identity card recovered during the probe confirmed the attacker’s identity. Official records showed his permanent address in Abbas Colony on Charsadda Road in Peshawar.Officials also said the attacker had spent around five months in Afghanistan before the bombing, where he allegedly received training in weapons handling and suicide attacks.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif had earlier claimed that India and Afghanistan were involved in the attack, without presenting any evidence.India had strongly rejected the allegations, saying, ""It is unfortunate that, instead of seriously addressing the problems plaguing its social fabric, Pakistan should choose to delude itself by blaming others for its home-grown ills. India rejects any and every such allegation, which is as baseless as it is pointless.""","The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad.

Dhaka: Amid preparations by Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) to form the next govt, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami on Saturday called for a recount in 30 constituencies for the 13th parliamentary election, alleging irregularities in the vote-counting process.Speaking at a press conference, Jamaat leaders said a recount could significantly alter the outcomes at several of the 30 seats. Jamaat assistant secretary general and head of its central publicity department Ehsanul Mahbub Zubayer urged the authorities to suspend the swearing-in of declared winners in the disputed constituencies until the recount process is completed.He alleged that the results were ""deliberately altered to defeat the candidates of Jamaat and the 11-party alliance,"" claiming that certain officials in the administration and Election Commission were complicit in the poll irregularities.

Newly elected members of Bangladesh parliament are set to take oath on February 17, Dhaka Tribune reported on Saturday. The cabinet members are scheduled to be sworn in later the same day, the the report said, citing Election Commission secretary Akhtar Ahmed.The 13th parliamentary election took place on February 12, with polling conducted in 299 of the country’s 300 constituencies. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) emerged dominant, securing 209 seats, while Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami won 68. The National Citizens Party (NCP), a member of the 11-party alliance, captured six seats, and Bangladesh Khelafat Majlis, contesting under the same coalition, won two.Earlier, in his first address to the nation post victory in polls, BNP chief Tarique Rahman talked about ""Bangladesh First"" policy when it comes to the foreign relations with its neighbours.""We have cleared ourselves regarding the foreign policy which is in the interest of Bangladesh, and the interest of the Bangladeshi people comes first. By protecting the interest of Bangladesh and the Bangladeshi people, we will decide our foreign policy,"" he said.He also said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should be invited for the swearing-in.His return to Bangladesh signals a major realignment in Dhaka’s political landscape. After spending 17 years in exile, the 60-year-old leader is set to assume the prime minister’s office following the BNP’s sweeping electoral victory.His ascent is likely to reshape India-Bangladesh ties, which had strengthened during Sheikh Hasina’s rule but experienced friction after her removal. Rahman has indicated a practical, measured stance toward New Delhi, underscoring the need for “mutual respect and understanding” in bilateral engagement.Several core issues are expected to define the next phase of relations: border management, allegations of illegal migration and insurgent activity across frontiers; the sharing of transboundary river waters, particularly the Teesta and Padma; the safety of Hindus and other minorities amid recent incidents; and economic cooperation, including prospects for expanded trade and investment.","The 13th parliamentary election took place on February 12, with polling conducted in 299 of the country’s 300 constituencies.

A mandate with strategic implications





Bangladesh’s 13th national parliamentary elections have handed the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) a commanding mandate, marking a decisive political shift after months of turbulence.But beyond the scale of victory, the outcome has drawn attention for another reason, the return of several controversial leaders whose past convictions, later acquittals and anti-India links are likely to shape regional calculations.The polls, which saw BNP chief Tarique Rahman secure a two-thirds majority, were widely viewed as a reset following the mass uprising that led to the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.The BNP-led alliance won 212 seats, securing more than a two-thirds majority in Parliament, while the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance won 77 seats. Hasina’s Awami League was barred from contesting the elections.Hasina fled to India in 2024 amid the unrest, after which Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus headed an interim administration. Since her departure, relations between Dhaka and New Delhi have remained strained.While Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Rahman on his party’s “decisive victory” and expressed hope of strengthening ties, the electoral success of figures such as Lutfozzaman Babar, Abdus Salam Pintu, ATM Azharul Islam and Hasnat Abdullah adds a more complex layer to India-Bangladesh engagement.Former state minister for home affairs Lutfozzaman Babar, contesting on a BNP ticket, secured a sweeping win in the Netrokona-4 (Madan–Mohanganj–Khaliajuri) constituency..Babar received 160,351 votes, defeating Jamaat-e-Islami candidate Al Helal Talukder, who polled 39,309 votes, a margin of 121,042 votes. He was unofficially declared elected.“This victory is the victory of the people. I will continue to work for the development of the area, strengthening infrastructure, and fulfilling the expectations of the people,” Babar said, thanking voters for a peaceful poll, according to Dhaka Tribune.His return marks a dramatic reversal of fortune. In 2014, a special tribunal sentenced him to death in the 10-truck arms haul case, one of the largest arms smuggling cases in Bangladesh’s history.The case stemmed from the seizure of 10 truckloads of weapons at the Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Limited jetty on April 1, 2004.Investigators had believed the consignment was intended for the Indian separatist group ULFA.However, in 2024, the Bangladesh high court acquitted Babar and several others in the case, overturning the earlier death sentences.The sentences of others, including ULFA chief Paresh Baruah, were reduced. Former Jamaat chief Motiur Rahman Nizami, also convicted in the case, was executed in 2016.Former BNP vice-chairman Abdus Salam Pintu has also returned to Parliament after securing 1,98,867 votes in Tangail-2, the highest tally in the district, reported The Daily Star.He defeated his Jamaat rival by a margin of 1.38 lakh votes. His younger brother, Sultan Salahuddin Tuku, won from Tangail-5.Pintu’s political comeback follows nearly 17 years behind bars. He was arrested in 2008 in connection with the 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally that killed 24 people and injured more than 300. In 2018, a trial court sentenced him and 18 others to death.In December 2024, he was released from prison after the high court acquitted him.However, his name has also surfaced in connection with alleged anti-India activities. Pintu was accused of aiding the Pakistan-based militant group Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI) in carrying out attacks against India.He was also accused of funding extremist elements operating from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Bangladesh. There was, however, no official confirmation of these specific allegations.The grenade attack case itself is regarded as one of the most heinous political crimes in Bangladesh’s history. Despite the acquittal, Pintu’s past continues to attract scrutiny, particularly in the context of India-Bangladesh security cooperation.Following his electoral win, Pintu and his brother pledged to work for the welfare of the people.Jamaat-e-Islami leader ATM Azharul Islam won the Rangpur-2 seat with 135,556 votes, defeating BNP candidate Mohammad Ali Sarkar, who secured 80,538 votes.Azharul had been sentenced to death in 2014 after being convicted by the International Crimes Tribunal for crimes against humanity during the 1971 Liberation War, including charges of rape, murder and genocide.In 2025, Bangladesh’s Supreme Court overturned his conviction, terming the earlier judgment flawed. He was released after more than a decade in custody.His acquittal triggered polarised reactions. Jamaat supporters welcomed the ruling, while student groups at Dhaka University and Rajshahi University staged protests, accusing the interim administration of “rewriting history”. Clashes were reported between rival student groups following the verdict.Azharul had been a senior Jamaat leader at a time when the party opposed Bangladesh’s independence in 1971, a deeply sensitive chapter in the nation’s history that continues to shape political narratives.In Cumilla-4, National Citizen Party (NCP) candidate Md Abul Hasnat, widely known as Hasnat Abdullah, won with 1,66,583 votes, defeating his nearest rival, who secured 49,885 votes.Hasnat has drawn attention in India for his sharp rhetoric. In late 2025, he warned that India’s northeastern states could be “isolated” and suggested offering refuge to separatist groups if Bangladesh were destabilised.He described India’s northeast as geographically “vulnerable” due to its reliance on the narrow Siliguri Corridor, often referred to as the “Chicken’s Neck”.His remarks came at a time of heightened tensions following the killing and subsequent death of student activist Sharif Osman Hadi, whose death sparked large protests in Dhaka.Prior to the attack on him, Hadi had shared a controversial map related to India on social media, which drew criticism. In the aftermath of his death, anti-India slogans were heard during some protests and sections of public discourse increasingly reflected nationalist sentimentAmid these developments and reported threats near the Indian High Commission in Dhaka, India summoned Bangladesh’s High Commissioner Riaz Hamidullah, conveying “strong concerns” over the deteriorating security situation and the activities of certain extremist elements around the mission.In a recent video, he was seen calling for a ban on ISKCON and saying that Chinmoy Krishna Das, a Bangladeshi Hindu monk, should be hanged.Abdullah’s rise indicates the growing political space occupied by figures who adopt overtly nationalist or anti-India positions, a development closely watched in New Delhi.In addition to the electoral success of these leaders, the return of the BNP to power has also revived Dhaka’s demand for the extradition of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina from India, creating an early diplomatic challenge for New Delhi.Soon after the party’s landslide win, senior BNP leader Salahuddin Ahmed made it clear that the new government would pursue her return. “The foreign minister has already placed the case for her extradition, and we also support it,” he said, adding that the matter should be handled “according to the law” between the foreign ministries of both countries.Hasina has been in New Delhi since August 2024 after being removed from office during a mass uprising. In November 2025, a special tribunal in Bangladesh sentenced her to death in absentia for crimes against humanity linked to the violent crackdown on protesters during the 2024 unrest.She is also facing multiple other cases filed by the interim administration.India has confirmed that Dhaka sent an official request for her extradition, including a note verbale and a formal letter. The MEA has said the request is being “examined”.External affairs minister S Jaishankar earlier stated that Hasina’s stay in India was her personal decision following developments in Bangladesh.Hasina, however, has rejected the charges, calling them politically motivated. She has said she was not given a fair opportunity to defend herself and claimed she was denied lawyers of her own choice during the trial in absentia.She has also expressed willingness to face proceedings in what she described as a neutral and fair international forum.In its election manifesto, unveiled by Tarique Rahman, the BNP outlined a firmer foreign policy approach under the slogan “Friend Yes, Master No” and a doctrine described as “Bangladesh Before All”.While India was not explicitly mentioned, the document emphasised taking a stricter stand on issues such as alleged “border killings”, “push-ins”, smuggling, and securing Bangladesh’s fair share of water from shared rivers including the Teesta and the Padma.Senior BNP leader Salahuddin Ahmed said Dhaka sought normal relations with all neighbours, including India, but on the basis of equality and mutual respect.Rahman reinforced that message in his first public address after the results were declared. He said Bangladesh’s foreign policy would be guided by the principle that “people come first”, stressing that national interest would determine the country’s external engagement, including with New Delhi.“The interests of Bangladesh and its people comes first and it will determine our foreign policy,” Rahman said.Calling for unity after the decisive mandate, he described the victory as belonging to “freedom loving pro-democracy people” and urged political forces to work together despite differences.Even as Rahman adopted a measured tone, his adviser Humayun Kabir made pointed remarks about regional radicalisation. In an interview with news agency PTI, Kabir said extremism was a broader South Asian challenge, referring to “Hindu extremism and far-right intolerance” in India and extremist elements in Pakistan.He added that Bangladesh would pursue balanced relations and would not limit its partnerships to any single country, an apparent reference to criticism that the previous administration was overly aligned with New Delhi.Soon after the results were announced, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Rahman and reaffirmed India’s commitment to a “democratic, progressive and inclusive Bangladesh”.The two leaders also spoke over the phone, signalling an intent to maintain engagement despite policy differences.With the BNP holding a strong mandate and Hasina remaining in India, the extradition question is likely to become one of the first major tests of how the two sides recalibrate ties after Bangladesh’s political shift.The BNP’s emphatic victory may restore electoral legitimacy after a turbulent political chapter. However, the composition of the new Parliament introduces uncertainty about the direction of policy.The return of leaders once sentenced in major criminal cases, alongside figures associated with hardline rhetoric on India, complicates the diplomatic landscape at a sensitive moment in bilateral ties.The renewed push for Sheikh Hasina’s extradition adds further pressure to an already delicate equation.For India, which, under Hasina, developed close security coordination and counter-insurgency cooperation with Dhaka, the transition will require careful diplomatic calibration.Issues such as border management, cross-border militancy, water sharing and minority safety are likely to resurface more prominently in the coming months.Whether the BNP’s mandate translates into substantive policy shifts or remains anchored in domestic political positioning will determine the trajectory of India-Bangladesh relations.What is clear is that the political reset in Dhaka has introduced new variables into a relationship that both sides describe as strategically important.","Bangladesh's 13th national parliamentary elections have handed the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) a commanding mandate. The polls were widely viewed as a reset following the mass uprising that led to the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The electoral success of figures such as Lutfozzaman Babar, Abdus Salam Pintu, ATM Azharul Islam and Hasnat Abdullah is likely to shape regional calculations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128350742,imgsize-1113838,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-2026-02-14t195044.jpg"

BNP Demands Sheikh Hasina's Extradition From India After Bangladesh Poll Win

Adviser’s remarks on ‘Hindu extremism’

PM Modi congratulates Rahman

What the BNP’s victory means for India





Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chief Tarique Rahman on Saturday said that Dhaka’s foreign policy would be guided by the principle that “people come first,” including in its ties with India.In his first address after the party’s sweeping electoral victory, Rahman said that the country’s national interest would remain the central focus of his government’s external engagement.Responding to a question on relations with New Delhi, Rahman said: “The interests of Bangladesh and its people comes first and it will determine our foreign policy,” he said.Rahman also used his first address to call for national unity following the decisive mandate. The BNP secured more than a two-thirds majority in the parliamentary elections, the first since the 2024 uprising that led to the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.According to the Election Commission, the BNP-led alliance won 212 seats, while the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance secured 77 seats. Hasina’s Bangladesh Awami League was barred from contesting the polls.In his speech, Rahman dedicated the victory to those who, he said, had sacrificed for democracy.“Freedom loving pro-democracy people of the country have once again brought victory to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party,” he said.“This victory belongs to Bangladesh, belongs to democracy, this victory belongs to people who aspired to and have sacrificed for democracy,” he added.He urged political forces to work together despite differences. “Our paths and opinions may differ, but in the interest of the country, we must remain united,” Rahman said.Even as Rahman adopted a measured tone on foreign policy, his adviser Humayun Kabir made pointed remarks about radicalisation in the region.In an interview with PTI, Kabir said, “Radicalisation is a problem in South Asia. We see Hindu extremism and far-right intolerance growing in Indian society, and in Pakistan, we also hear of extremist elements. In Bangladesh, it is not at that level, but there are some issues.”He called for stronger regional cooperation and information sharing to counter extremism and said a BNP government would seek “balanced relations” with all countries, including India.“What we want are balanced relations. We will not limit our relationships to a single country,” Kabir said, referring to criticism that the previous government was overly aligned with New Delhi.Soon after the results were declared, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Rahman on his party’s victory and reaffirmed India’s commitment to strong bilateral ties.In a post on X, PM Modi wrote: “I convey my warm congratulations to Mr Tarique Rahman on leading BNP to a decisive victory in the Parliamentary elections in Bangladesh. This victory shows the trust of the people of Bangladesh in your leadership.” He added, “I look forward to working with you to strengthen our multifaceted relations and advance our common development goals.”PM Modi also spoke with Rahman and reaffirmed India’s commitment to close bilateral ties. In a post on X, PM said, “Delighted to speak with Mr. Tarique Rahman. I congratulated him on the remarkable victory in the Bangladesh elections.”He added, “I conveyed my best wishes and support in his endeavour to fulfil the aspirations of the people of Bangladesh.”The BNP, in turn, thanked India for recognising the electoral verdict and expressed hope that relations would strengthen under the new government.Rahman’s return marks a significant political shift in Dhaka. The 60-year-old leader returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain. He is the son of former president Ziaur Rahman and former prime minister Khaleda Zia.Under Sheikh Hasina’s tenure, India and Bangladesh developed close strategic and security ties. However, relations saw strains after her ouster.The BNP’s earlier terms in office were marked by periodic friction with India, particularly during its 2001–06 coalition with Jamaat-e-Islami, when New Delhi raised concerns about insurgent groups allegedly operating from Bangladeshi territory. In contrast, India viewed Hasina as a dependable partner on security cooperation.Despite that history, Rahman has recently signalled a pragmatic approach. In previous remarks, he has emphasised “mutual respect and mutual understanding” in ties with India.Several sensitive issues are expected to shape the next phase of bilateral relations — including border security, alleged illegal migration, water-sharing of transboundary rivers such as the Teesta, and the safety of minorities.The safety of the Hindu community, in particular, remains a closely watched issue. Just days before the elections, a 62-year-old Hindu trader, Susen Chandra Sarkar, was hacked to death in Mymensingh district. Authorities have said investigations are ongoing.

UK to add AI chatbots to safety laws after Grok row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-to-add-ai-chatbots-to-safety-laws-after-grok-row/articleshow/128443246.cms,"UK PM Keir Starmer (File photo)





The UK govt said Monday that it would include AI chatbots in online safety laws, closing a loophole exposed after Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok was used to create sexualised deepfakes.Providers of chatbots will be responsible for preventing them from generating illegal or harmful content, extending rules that currently apply only to content shared between users on social media. ""Govt will move to shut a legal loophole and force all AI chatbot providers to abide by illegal content duties in the Online Safety Act or face the consequences of breaking the law,"" UK PM Keir Starmer said.Under the Online Safety Act, which entered force in July, platforms hosting potentially harmful content are required to implement strict age verification through tools such as facial imagery or credit card checks. It is also illegal for sites to create non-consensual intimate images, or child sexual abuse material, including sexual deepfakes created with AI.In Jan, UK's media regulator Ofcom opened a probe into the social media platform X, which hosts Grok, for failing to meet its safety obligations. Ofcom has noted that not all AI chatbots are regulated, including those which ""only allow people to interact with the chatbot itself and no other users"". ""Tech moves on so fast that the legislation struggles to keep up, which is why, for AI bots... we need to take necessary measures,"" he said.","UK govt to include AI chatbots in online safety laws, closing a loophole exposed after Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok was used to create sexualised deepfakes.

"UK resident Gurpreet Randhawa jailed for 18 years for assaulting minors, threatened victims into sending indecent images",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-resident-gurpreet-randhawa-jailed-for-18-years-for-assaulting-minors-threatened-victims-into-sending-indecent-images/articleshow/128436798.cms,"



A 21‑year‑old man from Wolverhampton, UK has been jailed for 18 years for a series of sex offences against children involving two 15‑year‑old girls and a 12‑year‑old girl, police said.Gurpreet Randhawa, of Wellington Road, was sentenced at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Thursday after pleading guilty to multiple serious offences. These included four counts of rape, two counts of taking indecent images of a child, and two offences of sharing indecent images and engaging in sexual communication, West Midlands Police said.The offences took place between July 2024 and September 2025. Randhawa persuaded two 15‑year‑old girls he had met online to meet him in person. He raped one of the girls on three separate occasions over the period from August to September last year, police added.In the third of these attacks, he took the victim to a car park in Wolverhampton and raped her in the back of his vehicle. When she tried to resist, he grabbed her by the throat. The girl later told school staff about the attack, and they alerted police, who arrested Randhawa on the same day.Officers also found that Randhawa had used different identities online to contact a 12‑year‑old girl.Through social media, he engaged in sexualised conversations with her and sent inappropriate videos and pictures of himself. He threatened to harm her if she did not send indecent images in return and encouraged her to involve her friends in doing the same, the force added. Officers said he also smoked drugs with the girls during one of the attacks.Detective Constable Mark Tallis, from the West Midlands Police public protection unit, said Randhawa had targeted and exploited young girls “for his own sexual desires”.He added that it was the bravery of the victims in coming forward that enabled police to build a strong case and secure convictions. Randhawa has been placed on the sex offenders register for life.","Gurpreet Randhawa, 21, from Wolverhampton, UK, jailed for 18 years. He pleaded guilty to multiple serious offences against children.

"‘Lucky to be alive’: British woman survives 30ft plunge at Wales waterfall, demands stricter safety measures",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/lucky-to-be-alive-british-woman-survives-30ft-plunge-at-wales-waterfall-demands-stricter-safety-measures/articleshow/128358469.cms,"Rescue effort took four hours

Dispute over warning signs

Rising safety concerns





A 50-year-old British woman has said she feels “lucky to be alive” after plunging nearly 30 feet off a narrow, eroded path at a popular waterfall trail in Wales, an area that has seen multiple fatalities in recent years.She is now urging authorities to introduce stronger safety measures to prevent further tragedies. Suzie Dyer, a gardener from Hereford and mother of one, was hiking with a friend along the scenic Four Waterfalls Walk in Waterfall Country, located in Bannau Brycheiniog, also widely known as the Brecon Beacons, on New Year’s Day when the accident occurred.The circular trail passes several well-known waterfalls, including Sgwd Clun-Gwyn, Sgwd Isaf Clun-Gwyn, Sgwd y Pannwr and Sgwd yr Eira.According to Dyer, after visiting the first waterfall on the route, she proceeded onto what appeared to be a continuation of the path. “It was narrow and badly eroded,” she said. “The next minute, I was over the edge. My friend was shouting and screaming, it was horrific.”She fell into a gorge below, sustaining severe injuries to her hip, pelvis and back.Her husband later revealed that she also shattered her elbow, with the bone protruding, and required multiple surgeries, including reconstructive arm surgery, pelvic repairs and spinal treatment.She was reportedly hypothermic on arrival at hospital.Three fellow hikers rushed to help her before members of the Central Beacons Mountain Rescue Team and emergency services arrived. The complex rescue operation lasted four hours before she was stabilised and airlifted to hospital.Recalling the ordeal, Dyer said, “When I was lying there, all I could think was, ‘I’m not ready to leave my daughter.’ I don’t think anyone thought I would survive, but I did for some reason.”The area is jointly managed by Natural Resources Wales (NRW), the Bannau Brycheiniog National Park Authority and local councils. NRW stated that the fall likely occurred on a Public Right of Way that is not part of the official waymarked Four Falls Trail and insisted that “clear” warning signs were in place, including notices about unstable ground, falling rocks and previous fatal accidents.The national park authority also maintained that signage clearly indicated the forward path was closed due to dangerous conditions.However, Dyer disputes this claim. “No one warned me. There were no barriers, no tape to say it was shut. I would never break the rules,” she said, calling for stronger preventative measures such as physical barriers and clearer hazard warnings.Waterfall Country has witnessed a surge in visitors since the Covid-19 pandemic, with approximately 300,000 people visiting annually. Since 2023, three walkers have died in the area, prompting renewed scrutiny over safety standards.In earlier inquests into similar deaths, a coroner had called for clearer and more direct signage at key points near waterfalls, warning that “future deaths could occur unless action is taken.” Concerns were also raised about the inadequate mobile phone signal in the remote terrain.Local residents say rescue call-outs have become frequent, especially on weekends, and have echoed demands for improved supervision and clearer warnings.While authorities say improvements have been made to footpaths, steps and signage, Dyer believes more decisive action is needed.“The road to recovery is long,” her husband said, adding that she remains in good spirits despite being largely confined to her sofa as she heals.For Dyer, the message is simple: better safety measures could save lives, and spare families the trauma she narrowly escaped.","Suzie Dyer, 50, was hiking with a friend on New Year's Day in Wales.

"Major row over Britain's Nato envoy Angus Lapsley bringing intern girlfriend, half his age, to official residence: 'They are not hiding it'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/major-row-over-britains-nato-envoy-angus-lapsley-bringing-intern-girlfriend-half-his-age-to-official-residence-they-are-not-hiding-it/articleshow/128274284.cms,"



Britain's ambassador to Nato, Angus Lapsley, has triggered a major diplomatic row after he brought his Italian girlfriend into his official residence in Brussels. The woman is nearly half her age and has been identified as Francesca Cortini, an intern, in reports. They met each other at Nato headquarters in Belgium. The couple has now set tongues wagging as insiders observed that they are not even trying to hide their relationship. The girlfriend was present at the residence for Christmas and summer receptions.The official residence, however, is not only meant for him.The lavist British residence in Belgium, a converted five-storey hotel, is also the address of two other Brotish ambassadors -- to Belgium and to the EU.The UK's incoming ambassador to the EU, Dame Caroline Wilson, who is yet to take charge and to shift to the address, said it was ""inappropriate"" for the pair to live together at the official residence.The relationship has been deemed so significant that Admiral Sir Keith Blount, Nato’s deputy supreme allied commander [in] Europe and the most senior British officer in the alliance, has reportedly been alerted.But the relationship won't cost Lapsley his pose as Nato policy does not prohibit a relationship between a senior official and a subordinate.Nato requires managers to declare any real or perceived conflict of interest and Lapsley made his bosses aware of the relationship that began after his separation from wife Gina.Lapsley, the father of two, is known for delinquency as he had his security clearance suspended in 2021 after he left top secret documents at a bus stop in Kent. The files had the locations of British special forces in Kabul.Lapsley also left behind at least one personal diary, which resulted in Ben Wallace, the defence secretary at the time, later calling for his security clearance to be reconsidered. Lapsley used the diary to express his frustration at the department and wrote about his relationships with individuals.The UK's incoming ambassador to the EU, Dame Caroline Wilson, said it was ""inappropriate"" for the pair to live together at the official residence.","Angus Lapsley has brought his Italian girlfriend into his official residence in Brussels.

'Fishing expedition': US Judge limits Elon Musk-led DOGE's access to social security system data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fishing-expedition-us-judge-limits-elon-musk-led-doges-access-to-social-security-system-data/articleshow/119280914.cms,"People protest against DOGE access to Social security data

A federal judge has temporarily blocked Elon Musk and members of his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from accessing sensitive records within the Social Security Administration ’s (SSA) systems, citing privacy concerns.The directive requires the team to eliminate any personally identifiable information they currently possess.US District Judge Ellen Hollander determined that the team received extensive access to sensitive Social Security Administration data without adequate justification for their fraud investigation . ""The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion,"" she stated.""To be sure, rooting out possible fraud, waste, and mismanagement in the SSA is in the public interest. But, that does not mean that the government can flout the law to do so,"" Hollander further wrote.The directive permits DOGE staff to access redacted data without personal identifiers, provided they complete training and security clearances.The current administration maintains DOGE addresses federal government inefficiencies. Musk has particularly scrutinised Social Security, labelling it a ""ponzi scheme"" and advocating waste reduction as crucial for decreasing government expenditure.The decision, subject to appeal, stems from legal action by unions, pensioners and Democracy Forward. They contended that DOGE's access violates privacy regulations and poses security risks. A former Social Security official's testimony expressed serious concerns about data protection.Court documents reveal DOGE deployed ten federal employees at SSA, with seven granted read-only access to agency systems or personal information. The government argued these federal employees were legally permitted to access data under privacy laws, with no evidence of improper information sharing. The Justice Department maintained that DOGE's access aligned with standard agency practices of database searching.However, the plaintiffs' lawyers termed this access unprecedented. Lee Saunders, AFSCME president, celebrated the ruling as beneficial for workers and retirees nationwide. Democracy Forward's president, Skye Perryman, commended the court's recognition of DOGE's concerning actions.Meanwhile, DOGE has reportedly accessed other government databases, including Treasury and IRS systems. At SSA, DOGE staff arrived shortly after the inauguration, seeking rapid access to restricted data systems, according to a former official's court testimony.Tiffany Flick, former acting chief of staff, indicated the team's fraud investigation was based on misunderstandings.Judge Hollander, 75, based in Baltimore and appointed by President Obama, joins other judges in reviewing DOGE cases. The initiative faces numerous lawsuits. Recently, another Maryland judge ruled DOGE's USAID restructuring likely unconstitutional.","US District Judge Ellen Hollander determined that the team received extensive access to sensitive Social Security Administration data without adequate justification for their fraud investigation.

"US denies Mexico’s water request, citing treaty violations",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-denies-mexicos-water-request-citing-treaty-violations/articleshow/119280223.cms,"The United States refused a request from Mexico for additional water deliveries, citing ongoing shortfalls in Mexico’s water-sharing commitments. This marked the first time that the US had turned down such a request under the 1944 treaty that governed water allocation from the Rio Grande and Colorado rivers.The requested water would have gone to Tijuana, a major border city heavily reliant on the Colorado River. However, the US state department justified its decision by pointing to Mexico’s failure to meet its obligations under the treaty, which operates on five-year cycles. The current cycle ends in October 2025.Mexico has fallen behind in its water payments due to drought conditions in the arid north of the country, as per the Guardian.""Mexico's continued shortfalls in its water deliveries under the 1944 water-sharing treaty are decimating American agriculture-- particularly farmers in the Rio Grande valley,"" the state department’s Latin America bureau said in a post on X.The treaty has come under strain in recent years due to increasing water demands, prolonged droughts, and climate change. While US officials argue that Mexico has repeatedly delayed its water transfers until the last minute, falling short in the latest cycle, Mexico itself is struggling with severe drought conditions.The issue is particularly sensitive for farmers in southern Texas, who rely on Mexican water deliveries for crops such as cotton and citrus. A year ago, the region’s last sugar mill was forced to shut down, with operators blaming a lack of water from Mexico.To ease the crisis, the United States and Mexico reached an agreement in November, days after Donald Trump’s election victory, to improve water deliveries. The deal, hailed by then-President Joe Biden’s administration, committed Mexico to more timely transfers, rather than waiting until the end of each five-year cycle.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, speaking before the state department’s announcement, said the matter was being handled through the countries’ boundary and water commission.""There's been less water. That's part of the problem,"" she told reporters.The dispute has also triggered political tensions, with Texas lawmakers pushing for stronger action.""Texas farmers are in crisis because of Mexico's noncompliance,"" Senator Ted Cruz wrote on X, welcoming the State Department’s stance.""I will work with the Trump administration to pressure Mexico into complying and to get water to Texas farmers.""In response to the crisis, US agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins announced a $280 million relief package for Rio Grande Valley farmers.The water dispute is unfolding as Trump takes a tough stance on Latin America, particularly on migration. He has vowed to crack down on undocumented arrivals, deployed troops to the border, and imposed tariffs on Mexico, though those have been temporarily paused until 2 April.","The US refused a request from Mexico for additional water deliveries, citing ongoing shortfalls in Mexico’s water-sharing commitments.

Israel PM Netanyahu fires internal security agency chief Ronen Bar amid 'lack of trust',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-pm-netanyahu-fires-internal-security-agency-chief-ronen-bar-amid-lack-of-trust/articleshow/119279776.cms,"Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed Ronen Bar , the head of the country’s internal security agency, Shin Bet , because of an “ongoing lack of trust.” The decision, approved unanimously by the government on Friday, cuts short Bar’s five-year term, which was set to end in 2026.Bar was appointed in October 2021 by the previous Israeli government, which briefly removed Netanyahu from power. His tenure had been marked by tensions with the prime minister, particularly over proposed judicial reforms that divided the country. Their relationship further deteriorated following the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, which led to the war in Gaza.An internal Shin Bet report, released on March 4, acknowledged failures in preventing the attack but also pointed to a government-backed policy of maintaining “quiet” with Hamas, which allowed the group to build up its military strength. Bar had previously indicated that he would resign before completing his term, accepting responsibility for the agency’s shortcomings.Earlier, attorney general Gali Baharav-Miara had challenged Netanyahu’s move to remove Bar, questioning the basis for the dismissal. She argued that the Shin Bet chief’s role was not dependent on the prime minister’s personal trust, calling attempts to frame it as such a “linguistic manipulation.”Netanyahu dismissed her concerns, asserting in a letter posted on X that the decision to fire Bar was within the government’s “exclusive authority” under Israeli law. He accused Baharav-Miara of overstepping her role and attempting to interfere in security matters during wartime.Bar responded to his dismissal by reaffirming his loyalty to the Israeli people, stating that Netanyahu’s “expectation of a duty of personal loyalty is fundamentally misguided.”This is the latest in a series of dismissals and forced departures of senior officials since the Hamas attack. Critics argue that Netanyahu is using these firings to consolidate power and shift blame, while his supporters maintain that he is taking necessary steps to restore security and stability.","Ronen Bar was appointed in October 2021 by the previous Israeli government.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to call snap election on April 28: Reports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canadian-prime-minister-mark-carney-to-call-snap-election-on-april-28-reports/articleshow/119260891.cms,"File photo: Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney (Picture credit: AP)

The Globe and Mail

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is set to call a snap election, according to reports by local media, with the vote likely to take place on April 28. The announcement is expected this Sunday, and it marks the beginning of an election campaign that is set to focus heavily on the escalating trade war with the United States and the contentious rhetoric of US President Donald Trump, who has suggested that Canada could become the 51st state.As perthe major political parties—the Liberals, Conservatives, and New Democrats—have already made preparations, with campaign planes and buses in place and their war rooms primed for action.The Liberal Party has reportedly attracted several high-profile candidates, including former Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson and former CTV host Evan Solomon. Former Quebec finance minister Carlos Leitão is also expected to run for the Liberals, the report said.Carney, a former Bank of England governor, was sworn in as Prime Minister last week after Justin Trudeau's resignation. The 60-year-old, who has no prior political experience but is widely regarded for his leadership during the 2008 financial crisis, has made it clear that his focus will be on protecting Canadian workers and families, particularly in the face of Trump’s trade actions.Trump’s imposition of tariffs on Canadian goods has led to growing nationalistic sentiments in Canada, with many Canadians voicing frustration over the economic impact and US sovereignty threats. Public opinion polls suggest that many Canadians reject Trump's rhetoric, especially his repeated remarks about annexation.In response to these pressures, Carney has sought to strengthen Canada's global alliances, making his first trip abroad as Prime Minister to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron. The trip was viewed as a signal of Carney’s intention to reduce Canada’s reliance on the U.S. and diversify its trade and security ties, particularly with European allies.","The Liberal Party has reportedly attracted several high-profile candidates, including former Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson and former CTV host Evan Solomon.

How to get involved

The International Day of Happiness is celebrated annually on March 20 to mark the importance of happiness and well-being as universal goals and aspirations in the lives of people worldwide.Established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2012, this day recognizes that progress should be about increasing human happiness and well-being, not just growing the economy.The initiative for the International Day of Happiness was introduced by Bhutan, a country that has prioritized Gross National Happiness over Gross Domestic Product since the early 1970s.In July 2012, the UN General Assembly adopted resolution 66/281, proclaiming March 20 as the International Day of Happiness.The theme for this year's Happiness Day is ""Caring and Sharing"", emphasising the importance of kindness and generosity in building stronger communities and enhancing overall well-being.Studies have shown that engaging in acts of generosity and expecting kindness from others significantly contribute to happiness.The International Day of Happiness serves as a reminder that happiness is a fundamental human right and goal.It elaborates on the need for a more inclusive, equitable, and balanced approach to economic growth that promotes the happiness and well-being of all people.The day also aligns with the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which seek to end poverty, reduce inequality, and protect our planet—three key aspects that lead to well-being and happiness.Globally, various events and initiatives are organised to mark this day, including educational seminars, community activities, and social media campaigns aimed at spreading joy and raising awareness about the importance of happiness in our lives.Individuals are encouraged to engage in acts of kindness, reflect on positive aspects of their lives and foster connections with others to build a more compassionate world.The World Happiness Report 2025, released today, ranks Finland as the happiest country in the world for another consecutive year, followed by Denmark, Iceland, and Sweden.The rankings are based on a three-year average of people's life evaluations, measuring factors such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.The report highlights a continued gap between the happiest and least happy countries, with Afghanistan remaining at the bottom.The report ranks India at 126th position, the same as in 2024. Over the past few years, India has seen gradual progress in some social and economic indicators, yet it continues to lag behind its South Asian neighbours like Nepal and surprisingly Pakistan too, which ranked higher at 93rd and 109th positions respectively.People can participate in Happiness Day by spreading kindness, volunteering, and promoting mental well-being.Simple acts like expressing gratitude, engaging in meaningful conversations, and supporting community initiatives can make a difference.Schools, workplaces, and social organizations worldwide mark the occasion with discussions, wellness activities, and events focused on fostering happiness and positivity.","The International Day of Happiness is celebrated annually on March 20.

US immigration authorities have detained an Indian post-doctoral researcher studying and teaching at Washington DC's Georgetown University and flagged him for deportation for his pro-Hamas activism they say violated terms of his exchange visitor visa.Badar Khan Suri , a post-graduate from Delhi's Jamia Millia, whose wife Maphaz Saleh is Palestinian, was taken from his home in Rosslyn just outside Washington DC on Monday and transferred to Louisiana pending deportation proceedings, according to the college newspaperMaphaz's father Ahmed Yousef is said to be a senior political advisor to Hamas, which the US has designated as a terrorist organisation.The couple met in Gaza when Suri was part of a humanitarian convoy in 2011. They married in 2014, after which Maphaz moved to Delhi and enrolled at Jamia Millia eventually earning a master’s degree in conflict analysis and peace-building from the Nelson Mandela Centre for Peace & Conflict Resolution.They came to the US sometime after 2020 following Suri's PhD; while he enrolled as a Peace & Conflict Studies Postdoctoral Fellow at Georgetown University's Alwaleed Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (ACMCU), Maphaz is also pursuing a master’s degree at the School of Foreign Service’s (SFS) Center for Contemporary Arab Studies. Suri is currently teaching a class on majoritarianism and minority rights in South Asia and researching peace-building in Iraq and Afghanistan.Homeland Security officials said Suri was arrested under a US law that allows deportation of noncitizens whom “the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.” He was accused of “spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,” with ""close connections"" to a senior advisor to Hamas.Georgetown University said it was not aware of Suri engaging in any illegal activity and had not received a reason for his detention. “We support our community members’ rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable. We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly,” a university spokesperson said.Suri's lawyer Hassan Ahmad suggested that his client had been abducted, saying he had no criminal record and nor has be been charged with any crime. ""Seeing our government abduct and jail another innocent person is beyond contemptible. And if an accomplished scholar who focuses on conflict resolution is whom the government decides is bad for foreign policy, then perhaps the problem is with the government, not the scholar."" the attorney Hassan Ahmad, said in a statement.A brief scrutiny of Suri's social media posts, which were infrequent, showed trenchant criticism of Israel's attacks on Gaza, including India's support for Israel. In a June 6, 2024 post, Suri mocked the Modi government for its purported support for Israel and abandonment of Palestine after a Palestinian network posted a video of a missile fragment with an India imprint on it.""From being an ally of Palestinians, to enabler if a genocide. What a disgrace for Made in India, to supply missiles to Israel so that Palestinian children can be butchered. Change of values for blood money. Shame,"" he wrote.While Suri was identified by Georgetown University as an Indian national,said ""Maphaz was a US citizen, raising questions in the MAGA sphere as to how the daughter of a Hamas representative came to acquire American citizenship.""","Badar Khan Suri, a post-graduate from Delhi's Jamia Millia, whose wife Maphaz Saleh is Palestinian, was taken from his home in Rosslyn just outside Washington DC on Monday and transferred to Louisiana pending deportation proceedings.

Legal battle over Riibe’s detention

Sudiksha Konanki missing case

An Iowa man who was previously named a person of interest in the disappearance of missing University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki has returned to the United States after nearly two weeks of detention in the Dominican Republic .Joshua Riibe , 22, was able to leave after securing a new passport from the US Consulate on the Caribbean island. He was accompanied by his father on the journey home, as per his lawyers, quoted by the New York Post.“The prosecutor’s office of La Altagracia informed [Riibe] of their readiness to return his passport,” said the Dominican law firm Guzman Ariza in an email to The Post. “While Joshua appreciated this decision, he chose, for privacy reasons, to apply for a new passport at the US Consulate, which was promptly issued. We are pleased to announce that Joshua and his father are currently traveling back to their home in the United States.”Riibe, a student at St Cloud State College, had been detained in the Dominican Republic since March 6, when Sudiksha Konanki vanished after the two went for an early morning swim in rough waters at the RIU Hotel & Resort in Punta Cana.Riibe told authorities that he had managed to pull Konanki to safety but lost consciousness on the beach, after which she was never seen again.Though officials identified Riibe as a person of interest, he was never formally named as a suspect in the case. However, his passport and phone were confiscated, preventing him from leaving the island.During a court hearing on Tuesday, tensions escalated as prosecutors pushed back against claims that Riibe was being unlawfully detained.Judge Edwin Delgado ruled in Riibe’s favour, granting his request to end police surveillance and allowing him to leave the resort, but he was still unable to leave the country.Finally on Wednesday, Riibe boarded a flight home to Rock Rapids, Iowa, bringing an end to his legal ordeal.Sudiksha Konanki, a 20 year old Indian-origin pre-med student from Chantilly, Virginia, went missing while on spring break with five friends at the Riu Republic Resort in Punta Cana on March 6.Konanki's father initially suspected foul play and egged on the administration to widen their search when the mysterious disappearance of the Pitt University student was seen as a case of drowning.Konanki and a group of friends were at the beach before most of them decided to return to their hotel, leaving her behind with a male companion, according to Dominican media reports.After a massive search on land, water, and air turned yield no results even after 12 days, Sudiksha’s parents, Subbarayudu and Sridevi, finally gave up hope of their daughter returning alive. They wrote a letter to the Dominican Republic authorities, asking them to declare their daughter 'dead'.","Joshua Riibe, 22, has returned to the United States after nearly two weeks of detention in the Dominican Republic.

'US deeply concerned about persecution of minorities in Bangladesh': Tulsi



France embassy in Dhaka called a post ""ridiculous, baseless and intellectually weak statement"" which was claiming that they support Mohammad Yunus-led Bangladesh interim government's criticism against US intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard on persecution of minorities in the country.Reacting to a post, France embassy said, ""How ridiculous, baseless and intellectually weak statement @kawsarc @mainul_haque @carmel_trish.""A former Navy official Manoj Rawat, sharing the screenshot of French embassy sharing the Yunus' statement on Gabbad's post in his post on X, claimed that they are supporting the Yunus Government 's criticism of Gabbard's statement on the genocide of Hindus in Bangladesh.He further said that it seems that the the Indo-French Strategic partnership is just a business arrangement for France to secure lucrative Defence contracts from India.""Time to call out the French mischief in the sub-continent,"" he said in a post on X.Bangladesh released a statement challenging Gabbard's observations, calling them ""misleading and damaging"" to the nation's standing.""This statement is both misleading and damaging to the image and reputation of Bangladesh, a nation whose traditional practice of Islam has been famously inclusive and peaceful, and that has made remarkable strides in its fight against extremism and terrorism,"" Bangladesh's interim government said in a statement.""Gabbard's comments are not based on any evidence or specific allegations. They paint an entire nation with a broad and unjustified brush. Bangladesh, like many countries around the world, has faced challenges with extremism, but it has continuously worked in partnership with the international community, including the US, to address these issues through law enforcement, social reforms, and other counterterrorism efforts. Bangladesh strongly condemns any efforts to link the country to any form of 'Islamist caliphate,"" the statement added.Bangladesh also urged Gabbard to base her statements on ""actual knowledge"" when discussing sensitive issues, warning that such remarks could reinforce harmful stereotypes.""Political leaders and public figures should base their statements, especially about the most sensitive issues, on actual knowledge and take care not to reinforce harmful stereotypes, to fan fears, and potentially even stoke sectarian tensions,"" the statement said.In media interviews later, Gabbard said the US was deeply concerned about the persecution of minorities in Bangladesh and the Trump administration was committed to defeat ""Islamist terrorism"" globally. She noted that PM Modi also took this threat seriously and added that the two leaders would work together to identify and defeat the threat.""The long-time unfortunate persecution, killing and abuse of religious minorities like Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and others has been a major area of concern for the US govt and President Trump and his administration,"" Gabbard told NDTV World.She spoke about the ideology of an ""Islamic Caliphate"" and how extremist elements and terror groups globally aimed for such an outcome. ""The threat of Islamist terrorists and the global effort of different terror groups are routed in the same ideology and objective - which is to rule or govern with an Islamist Caliphate,"" she said, adding, ""This obviously affects people of any other religion, other than the one that they find acceptable, and they choose to carry this out with terror and very violent ways and means.""Her remarks mark a strong indictment of Mohammad Yunus-led interim dispensation in Dhaka which had enjoyed support from the Biden administration. In her meeting with Singh, Gabbard reaffirmed the growing strength of the India-US bilateral defence partnership, drawing from the joint statement issued after the recent Modi-Trump meeting in DC, while laying emphasis on intelligence-sharing.","France embassy in Dhaka called a post ""ridiculous, baseless and intellectually weak statement"" which was claiming that they support Mohammad Yunus-led Bangladesh interim government's criticism against US intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard on persecution of minorities in the country.

The move, announced in a ceremony at the White House on Thursday, raised major questions about the future of public education, student loans, and federal grants across the country.Speaking from the East Room, Trump, surrounded by schoolchildren seated at desks, declared ""We’re going to shut it down, and shut it down as quickly as possible."" However, closing a cabinet-level agency would require congressional approval, something Trump’s officials acknowledge they lack. Instead, the executive order directs education secretary Linda McMahon to take ""all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the department of education and return education authority to the states.""While the full impact of the order remains unclear, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the agency would be significantly reduced, but key functions like student loans and funding for at-risk students would still be managed by the federal government. Trump also backed this, saying that key responsibilities would be ""redistributed to various other agencies and departments that will take very good care of them.""However, this transition could prove challenging for McMahon, who is legally bound to uphold congressionally mandated functions like federal student aid and grants for low-income schools. The executive order highlighted Trump’s belief that returning control of education to the states will improve school performance, citing poor test scores despite high per-student investment.""I really believe that they’ll be as good as any of them,"" Trump said, referencing schools in Europe and China. ""And then you’ll have some laggards, and we’ll work with them. And we can all tell you who the laggards will be right now.""Trump also extended appreciation for the teachers, calling them ""among the most important people in this country,"" adding, ""I don’t care if they’re in the union or not in the union. That doesn’t matter. But we’re going to take care of our teachers.""As news of the order spread, education department employees struggled from the decision as nearly half of the department’s workforce had been put on notice for potential layoffs, and 1,300 staff members already terminated. Affected employees received an email on Wednesday evening instructing them to schedule time to collect personal belongings and return government-issued devices. Each individual was given 30 minutes to pack up, with instructions to bring their own boxes and tape.One current employee described the order as ""a slap in the face and kicking us while we’re down.""""This EO underscores that Linda McMahon, Donald Trump, and the rest of this administration remain ignorant about what our agency actually does and how their efforts to dismantle it will negatively affect kids and families throughout the country,"" CNN quoted.Trump, who pledged during his campaign to dismantle the agency, has previously suggested moving some of its responsibilities to other departments. For example, he proposed shifting oversight of the $1.8 trillion student loan program, 40 per cent of which is past due, to the small business administration. However, finding a viable alternative agency to manage the debt has proven difficult.The executive order is expected to face legal challenges, particularly from teachers’ unions. National education association president Becky Pringle condemned the move, saying, “Donald Trump and Elon Musk have aimed their wrecking ball at public schools and the futures of the 50 million students in rural, suburban, and urban communities across America, by dismantling public education to pay for tax handouts for billionaires.""She continued that in case Trump’s actions are successful, “they will hurt all students by sending class sizes soaring, cutting job training programs, making higher education more expensive and out of reach for middle class families, taking away special education services for students with disabilities, and gutting student civil rights protections.”Despite strong opposition, Trump remains adamant in his mission. ""I told Linda (McMahon), ‘Linda, I hope you do a great job in putting yourself out of a job.’ I want her to put herself out of a job – education department,"" he said earlier in February.","US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to begin dismantling the US Department of Education.

Trump threatens to impose US tariffs on India from April 2,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-threatens-to-impose-us-tariffs-on-india-from-april-2/articleshow/119277688.cms,"Donald Trump

US President Donald Trump said he has a “very good relationship” with India, but the “only problem” he has with the country is that it is “one of the highest tariffing nations in the world.” Trump reiterated his threat to impose reciprocal US tariffs starting April 2. In an interview with Breitbart News, an American news, opinion, and commentary website, Trump discussed the US’ relationship with India.On his summit with PM Narendra Modi last month, Trump said: “I have a very good relationship with India... I believe they’re going to probably be lowering those tariffs substantially, but on April 2, we will be charging them the same tariffs they charge us”. On India-Middle East-Europe-Economic Corridor (IMEC), Trump said it was a “group of wonderful nations” banding together “countering other countries that look to hurt us on trade”. “We have a powerful group of partners in trade,” Trump said. “Again, we can’t let those partners treat us badly, however, we do better in many ways frankly with our foes than we do with our friends.”“The ones that wouldn’t be as friendly to us in some cases treat us better than the ones that are supposed to be friendly, like the European Union, which treats us terribly on trade. India and everybody would think of them as an ally,” the US president said, adding, “I can say the same for others. But this is a group of wonderful nations that is countering other countries that look to hurt us on trade.” In the past, Trump has called India “tariff king” & a “big abuser”. Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal told a parliamentary panel on March 10 that negotiations are still on and no agreement on trade tariffs has been reached so far between India and the US. India had said it was looking at deepening trade ties with the US, including by reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers, under a bilateral trade agreement.","US President Donald Trump said he has a “very good relationship’ with India.

Violence against Tesla called 'domestic terrorism'



'Brand tornado crisis moment' for Tesla



Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) celebrates her birthday on March 29 and this time she has a birthday wishlist ready in place as she announced on a live stream set up by #TeslaTakedown. She said she wanted Elon to be taken down as her birthday protest leading to massive outrage that she urged for violence against Elon Musk. TeslaTakedown has organized several protests outside Tesla showrooms in the past few weeks -- as a statement against Elon Musk , his growing influence in the government, his decisions to shut government departments sending hundreds of people out of jobs.The group is planning its biggest day of action on Match 29 with planned protests at 277 Tesla locations in the US and 500 abroad.“I am truly here for very selfish reasons, starting with on March 29 it’s my birthday and all I want to see happen on my birthday is for Elon to be taken down,"" Crockett said.“Obviously, everything that I am promoting is non-violent,” she added.Crockett's call for 'taking down' Elon Musk came as Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that three people accused of destroying Tesla cars and charging stations are facing 20 years in reason for 'domestic terrorism'. “The days of committing crimes without consequence have ended,” Bondi said in a statement.“Let this be a warning: If you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars,” she added.President Donald Trump denounced that attack on Tesla and vowed to take action against them, as he bought a Tesla car to show his support for Tesla.Tesla Thursday announced a recall of 46,000 Cybertrucks in the US to fix an exterior panel that could detach while driving. Vancouver International Auto Show removed Tesla from its event citing security concerns.

'Being Palestinian is an experience that transcends borders'



In his first public statement since his arrest on March 8, Mahmoud Khalil said he is a Palestinian political prisoner as the Donald Trump administration cracked down on Ivy League institutes vowing deportation of 'illegal immigrants'. Khalil is not an illegal immigrant but the administration said his green card which he obtained as he married an American would be revoked.Khalil's statement was dictated over the phone from his Louisiana detention center. ""Before I knew what was happening, agents handcuffed and forced me into an unmarked car. At that moment, my only concern was for Noor’s safety. I had no idea if she would be taken too, since the agents had threatened to arrest her for not leaving my side. DHS would not tell me anything for hours — I did not know the cause of my arrest or if I was facing immediate deportation,"" Khalil said giving an account of how his arrest unfolded.""My arrest was a direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech as I advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza, which resumed in full force Monday night. With January’s ceasefire now broken, parents in Gaza are once again cradling too-small shrouds, and families are forced to weigh starvation and displacement against bombs. It is our moral imperative to persist in the struggle for their complete freedom,"" he said.Describing his childhood at a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria, Khalil said his circumstances have similarities to Israel's use of administration detention -- imprisonment without trial or charge.Blaming his university, Khalil said Columbia targeted him for his activism. ""Columbia surrendered to federal pressure by disclosing student records to Congress and yielding to the Trump administration's latest threats,"" he said.""The Trump administration is targeting me as part of a broader strategy to suppress dissent. Visa-holders, green-card carriers, and citizens alike will all be targeted for their political beliefs. In the weeks ahead, students, advocates, and elected officials must unite to defend the right to protest for Palestine.

"US officials say Indian scholar is accused of spreading Hamas propaganda, antisemitism",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-officials-say-indian-scholar-is-accused-of-spreading-hamas-propaganda-antisemitism/articleshow/119270743.cms,"Georgetown Univ campus in Washington. Homeland security officials said Badar Khan Suri was arrested under a US law that allows deportation of non-citizens whom ‘the secy of state has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the US'

TOI correspondent from Washington:

(With inputs from Sugandha Jha in New Delhi)

Georgetown University researcher Badar Khan Suri , who has been detained and flagged him for deportation for his pro-Hamas activism , is married to Maphaz Saleh, who is a Palestinian. Maphaz's father Ahmed Yousef is said to be a senior political advisor to Hamas , which the US has designated a terrorist organisation.The couple met in Gaza when Suri was part of a humanitarian convoy in 2011. They married in 2014, after which Maphaz moved to Delhi and enrolled at Jamia Millia, eventually earning a master's degree in conflict analysis and peace-building from the Nelson Mandela Centre for Peace & Conflict Resolution.They came to the US sometime after 2020 following Suri's PhD; while he enrolled as a Peace & Conflict Studies Postdoctoral Fellow at Georgetown University's Alwaleed Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding, Maphaz is also pursuing a master's degree at the School of Foreign Service's Center for Contemporary Arab Studies. Suri is currently teaching a class on majoritarianism and minority rights in South Asia and researching peace-building in Iraq and Afghanistan.Homeland security officials said Suri was arrested under a US law that allows deportation of non-citizens whom ""the secretary of state has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the US"". He was accused of ""spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,"" with ""close connections"" to a senior advisor to Hamas.Georgetown University said it was not aware of Suri engaging in any illegal activity and had not received a reason for his detention.Suri's lawyer Hassan Ahmad suggested that his client had been abducted, saying he had no criminal record and nor has he been charged with any crime. ""Seeing our govt abduct and jail another innocent person is beyond contemptible. And if an accomplished scholar who focuses on conflict resolution is whom the govt decides is bad for foreign policy, then perhaps the problem is with the govt, not the scholar,"" Ahmad said.A brief scrutiny of Suri's social media posts, which were infrequent, showed trenchant criticism of Israel's attacks on Gaza, including India's support for Israel. In a June 6, 2024, post, Suri mocked the Modi govt for its purported support for Israel and abandonment of Palestine after a Palestinian network posted a video of a missile fragment with an India imprint on it.""From being an ally of Palestinians, to enabler of a genocide. What a disgrace for Made in India, to supply missiles to Israel so that Palestinian children can be butchered. Change of values for blood money. Shame,"" he wrote. While Suri was identified by Georgetown University as an Indian national, 'The Hoya' said Maphaz was a US citizen, raising questions in the MAGAsphere as to how ""the daughter of a Hamas representative came to acquire American citizenship"".In Delhi, Badar's classmate at Jamia, Amir Khan, told TOI: ""Badar was an introverted and shy person with a great sense of humour. We studied together for our Master's from 2009 to 2011, and he later pursued his PhD at the same centre."" Khan added that Badar had strong opinions on the Palestinian issue, which he often voiced, but emphasised that he was never involved in street activism. ""During our time at the university, he was more academically focused,"" Khan explained.In 2010, Badar participated in a solidarity delegation supporting Palestine, which included participants from various countries. It was during this event that he met Maphaz.""Badar comes from a humble background, with his family living in Saharanpur. His father was a food inspector and is now retired. The news has deeply disturbed the family,"" Khan said, terming the deportation move ""a witch hunt"".","Badar Khan Suri was arrested under a US law that allows deportation of non- citizens.

The administration did not comply with that order, prompting concerns about a constitutional showdown. Trump subsequently said on social media that Boasberg should be impeached.Musk contributed on Wednesday to Reps.

France scraps modern 'Beauty and the Beast' for schoolkids:

If your eight-day work trip was unexpectedly extended by nine months, you might expect to rack up some overtime pay. Not so for Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore , the Nasa astronauts who spent 278 extra days on the International Space Station after their spacecraft malfunctioned. On Tuesday, they splashed down off the Gulf Coast of Florida. But despite their far-flung destination, when it comes to pay, Williams and Wilmore are treated like any other govt employee who takes a business trip to the next state over. ""While in space, Nasa astronauts are on official travel orders as federal employees,"" Jimi Russell, a spokesperson for the agency's Space Operations Mission Directorate, said. Astronauts aboard the ISS receive no overtime, holiday or weekend pay, Russell said. Their transportation, meals and lodging are covered, and like other federal employees on work trips, they receive a daily ""incidentals"" allowance, Russell said. The incidentals allowance for travel to any location is $5 per day, Russell said. This means that in addition to their annual salary - about $152,258, according to Nasa - Wilmore and Williams got around $1,430 for their 286 days in space.France's education ministry has cancelled an order for ""Beauty and the Beast'' with modern illustrations, saying a cartoonist's 21st-century version was inappropriate for tweens. Julien Berjeaut, whose pen name is Jul, had been asked to illustrate an 18th-century version of the famous fairy tale for a govt scheme to give 800,000 primary school graduates a revamped classic to read for the summer holidays. A digital copy of the book intended for publication showed the original 1756 text by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont. Jul's accompanying cartoons depicted the heroine with dark Mediterranean features, the Beast as a comic toothy hair ball, and her selfish sisters as addicted to their smartphones. To illustrate Beauty's father exploring the Beast's castle after ""a few glasses of wine'', according to the 18th-century text, Jul draws him drunk, clutching a bottle and singing a famous French song.

Growing worries about deportations

Calls for international help

Zahra Mousavi, a women's rights activist, fled from Afghanistan to neighboring Pakistan in March 2022 after months of fighting and protesting the oppressive Taliban regime She now lives in hiding and constant fear of being apprehended by the Pakistani police and deported to her home country.Mousavi actively participated in street protests against the Taliban regime after the Islamic fundamentalist group seized power in the war-ravaged country in August 2021.She advocated for women's rights by taking part in public gatherings and demonstrations, and tried to make the voices of Afghan women heard in the rest of the world.But with the Taliban slapping broad restrictions on women and girls and gradually squeezing them out of public life, Mousavi was forced to leave.In Pakistan, however, she has struggled to secure the necessary documents to stay in the country.""I could not obtain a valid Pakistani visa for myself and my family due to high costs and Pakistan's strict visa policies,"" the 29-year-old told DW.""This led to my arrest by Pakistani police on February 22. They entered my home in plain clothes, conducted an intense search, and arrested both me and my young daughter, taking us to a deportation detention camp,"" she said.""We were kept there in extremely harsh conditions for two days and one night, and we were only released after providing guarantees and due to the pressure of human rights activists.""DW spoke to several other Afghan female activists, who are also living in hiding as Islamabad looks to accelerate deportations to Afghanistan.Jamila Ahmadi, 27, said many of her fellow Afghan women had already been sent back to Afghanistan and warned that their lives, as well as hers, were in danger.""My activism, especially my efforts toward women's capacity-building before the Taliban takeover, my reporting on Taliban crimes, and my involvement with the National Directorate of Security (NDS), has placed me in significant danger,"" Ahmadi said.""If I am compelled to return to Taliban rule, it would clearly be a certain death.""Many women's rights activists only sought asylum in Pakistan when the situation became untenable in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.""In February 2021, I was attacked, resulting in a broken leg, but my determination remained unshaken,"" said Ahmadi.""Again, in September 2021, we were brutally beaten by the Taliban.""Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades.But over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with Afghanistan has deteriorated.Islamabad is angry with the Taliban authorities over the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions escalate, concerns about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan have increased.Islamabad is currently carrying out a huge drive to repatriate the roughly 4 million Afghans who have crossed the border in the past four decades.Pakistan already repatriated more than 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year, according to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).Legal experts and refugee rights activists have criticized the Pakistani government's deportation plans, particularly when it comes to deporting Afghan women's rights activists .""Sending activists back to Afghanistan, where they are very likely to be subjected to torture at the hands of the Taliban regime, would put them in greater risk,"" Osama Malik, a refugee lawyer in Islamabad, told DW.Ahmadi said her health had been affected by the deportation drive.""Unfortunately, for more than a month, the Pakistani police have made life difficult for refugees, including issues with visas and visa extensions.

My personal, psychological and emotional problems are due to not having a visa and being unable to extend it,"" she said.While rights groups have accused the Pakistani authorities of harassing Afghan refugees, Islamabad has denied the allegations and stressed that the removals were part of a 2023 campaign called the ""Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan.""There ""is no specific category for activists among those being deported,"" a Pakistani official, who asked not to be named, told DW. ""The responsibility of hosting Afghan refugees should not fall solely on Pakistan, as other countries can also accommodate them,"" the official added.Qaiser Khan Afridi, spokesperson for the UNHCR in Pakistan, said the agency was worried about the deportations.""UNHCR is especially concerned for Afghans who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, single women, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians.""""In view of these mounting challenges, UNHCR urged Pakistan to continue to provide safety to Afghans at risk, irrespective of their documentation status,"" said Afridi.Maria Noori, a 34-year-old activist from Kabul facing deportation, called on the international community to intervene and save the lives of Afghan female activists living in fear in Pakistan.""Being sent back to Afghanistan would mean facing torture, imprisonment, or even death. The international community must understand that deporting human rights activists, particularly women, is a direct threat to our lives, and immediate action is needed to protect us,"" she told DW.The lawyer Malik criticized Western governments for their inaction.""It is unfortunate that none of the Western countries have stepped up to immediately allow these female activists to travel to their countries,"" he said.Noori explained that the lack of a legal status and residency documents poses a big challenge.

While the raid successfully led to the detention of more than two dozen individuals, including foreign nationals, it quickly descended into disorder as locals swarmed the premises to seize valuables, as reported by the local Pakistani newspaper The Nation. Laptops, monitors, keyboards, and other electronic equipment intended for investigative purposes were instead carried away by opportunistic looters.Videos circulating on social media captured scenes of individuals, young and old, forcing their way into the building and openly making off with electronic devices. A large crowd gathered outside, and despite the presence of law enforcement, the looting continued unabated. Eyewitnesses reported that FIA officials struggled to control the situation, allowing the ransacking to proceed unchecked. Amid the chaos, some foreigners linked to the scamming operation reportedly escaped.Sources within the FIA, quoted by The Nation, indicated that the agency had been aware of the call center's illegal activities for some time but delayed action while awaiting approval from senior authorities. The center was allegedly involved in defrauding individuals across multiple countries, using Pakistani employees to execute scams and extort money.The individuals detained during the raid were transferred to the FIA office for further questioning. However, the agency has remained tight-lipped about the broader investigation, declining to provide additional details despite repeated inquiries. The FIA now faces criticism for its handling of the operation and its failure to prevent the looting during what was meant to be a major crackdown on international cybercrime.","Chaos erupted in Islamabad's Sector F-11 after a raid by Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency spiraled into an unexpected spree of looting.

At least two Pakistsoldiers and nine terrorists were killed after the Pak security forces raided two hideouts used by an armed group in the restive northwest, triggering gun battles, Al Jazeera reported.The raids were conducted on Saturday in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Mohmand and Dera Ismail Khan districts, which border Afghanistan.According to local police, the fighters belonged to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban.Notably, TTP -- banned in Pakistan -- is a separate group but an ally of the Afghan Taliban, who reseized power in neighbouring Afghanistan in August 2021 as the United States and other NATO troops were in the final stages of a withdrawal from the country after 20 years of war.Many TTP leaders and fighters have found sanctuaries and have even been living openly in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, which also emboldened the Pakistani Taliban, according to Al Jazeera.In a separate incident on Saturday, fighters ambushed security forces in northwestern Pakistan's Kurram district, bordering Afghanistan, the report said, citing local police. Authorities have yet to confirm any casualties in that attack.Pakistan's military is engaged in an ongoing operation in Kurram, an area that has witnessed years of violence between Sunni and Shia Muslim communities, as reported by Al Jazeera. Hundreds of people have been killed in fighting between armed groups, exacerbating tensions in the region.Kurram has remained isolated since last November, after authorities blocked key roads following sectarian violence. The closure has led to severe shortages of medicine and food, deepening a humanitarian crisis.In another incident, a bomb exploded outside a mosque in the northwestern city of Peshawar, killing a religious leader, local police said on Saturday.

Balochistan train attack

A powerful blast at a seminary-cum-mosque in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province’s Peshawar district killed a senior cleric and injured three others on Saturday, marking another attack on religious institutions in the region within 24 hours.Mufti Munir Shakir , the founder of the outlawed militant group Lashkar-i-Islam , succumbed to his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), hospital authorities confirmed. The explosion took place in Urmur Bala village, prompting a swift response from police, the Counter-Terrorism department, and bomb disposal teams, who are now investigating the scene.Mohammad Asim, an LRH spokesman, confirmed the cleric's passing, stating, “Mufti Shakir was brought to LRH in a critical condition and succumbed to his injuries.”Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister’s Advisor on Health, Ihtesham Ali, expressed his condolences, calling Shakir’s death a ""martyrdom"" and mourning the loss.Mufti Munir Shakir was a controversial figure in Khyber tribal region, known for founding Lashkar-i-Islam in 2004. However, his extremist views and conflicts with another militant leader, Haji Namdar, led to his expulsion from Bara Qambarkhel within six months.After continued internal strife, a tribal jirga forced both Shakir and Pir Saifur Rehman out of Bara in early 2005. The group later came under the leadership of Mangal Bagh, a former bus driver turned militant, who was elevated to amir in May 2005.Pakistani security forces launched their first military operation against Lashkar-i-Islam in mid-2005, demolishing the house of Haji Rabat and destroying an FM radio station the group had set up inside a mosque.The blast comes less than a day after another explosion at Maulana Abdul Aziz Mosque in South Waziristan on Friday. The attack, carried out using an improvised explosive device (IED), left Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) district chief Maulana Abdullah Nadeem and several others injured.The province has witnessed repeated attacks on mosques, particularly during Friday prayers when large gatherings make them vulnerable.Last month, a suicide blast at Darul Uloom Haqqania seminary killed six people, including JUI-S leader Maulana Hamidul Haq Haqqani, and injured 15 others.The Pakistan Army on Friday said that 18 of the 26 hostages killed in the Balochistan Liberation Army's recent ambush on a train were army and paramilitary soldiers.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General, Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, stated during a press conference with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti that militants executed all 26 hostages before the military operation began.“The 26 hostages include 18 army and paramilitary soldiers, three other government officials and five civilians,” he confirmed.","Mufti Munir Shakir, the founder of the outlawed militant group Lashkar-i-Islam, succumbed to his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), hospital authorities confirmed.

Did it take off without a wheel?

Smooth landing, rough questions

Passengers aboard Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight PK-306 got an unexpected surprise when their aircraft landed in Lahore—with one of its rear wheels missing. Despite what sounds like a scene from an action movie, the landing was smooth, and no injuries were reported.The big mystery now: Did the wheel vanish midair or was it never there to begin with?PIA officials have launched an investigation to determine whether the aircraft took off from Karachi already missing a wheel or if it fell off during takeoff. Some wheel fragments were reportedly found at Karachi airport, raising eyebrows about the plane’s condition before departure.""It appears that one of the rear wheels was in shabby condition when the aircraft took off,"" an official admitted, reported PTI.PIA’s damage control mode kicked in quickly. A spokesperson assured that the landing was “smooth and uneventful,” and passengers disembarked as usual—only for the captain’s routine inspection to reveal the missing wheel .""Passengers disembarked as per routine. During a walk-around inspection by the aircraft captain, it was revealed that one out of the six-wheel assemblies on the main landing gear (rear) is missing,"" a PIA spokesperson said, quoted PTI.""As per the standard flight practices, the matter was taken up by PIA flight safety and the Lahore airport teams who are investigating the matter and will submit their report later,"" the spokesperson said.While officials claim the aircraft is designed to handle such contingencies, the biggest question remains—was the wheel stolen? Although unlikely, investigators are leaving no stone unturned.One thing’s for sure—this flight gave ""landing on your last leg"" a whole new meaning!","Passengers aboard Pakistan International Airlines flight PK-306 got an unexpected surprise when their aircraft landed in Lahore.

Afghanistan is unfortunately prone to these shallow earthquakes, due to the region's tectonic plates often slipping past one another, as opposed to colliding directly.","A 4.9-magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan on Friday, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS) The earthquake occurred at a depth of 160 km, as per NCS data.

Recently, India has increased security around the Dalai Lama in response to Beijing’s growing interest in his succession. The United States has consistently supported Tibet’s religious freedom.

The Dalai Lama’s succession has long been a point of contention between Tibetans and China, but his latest statement has escalated the dispute. In his newly published book,, the 89-year-old Tibetan spiritual leader has explicitly stated for the first time that his successor will be born in the ""free world""—outside of China. This defies Beijing’s longstanding claim that it has the sole right to choose the next Dalai Lama.For China, controlling the Dalai Lama’s succession is about more than religion—it’s about political authority and maintaining control over Tibet. The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, has long been regarded as a “separatist” by Beijing. With his 90th birthday approaching in July, the question of who will succeed him has become urgent, as it could determine the future of Tibetan Buddhism and Tibet’s political movement. Below, we break down the key issues surrounding this controversy.Also read: ‘Will be born in free world’: Dalai Lama declares successor will be born outside China; Beijing counters China considers the Dalai Lama to be a symbol of Tibetan resistance and fears that an independent successor could fuel separatist sentiments. By controlling the reincarnation process, Beijing hopes to install a Dalai Lama loyal to the Chinese government, ensuring tighter control over Tibet. The current Dalai Lama, however, has made it clear that any successor appointed by China will not be respected by Tibetans:According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, the Dalai Lama is reincarnated, and his successor is identified by senior monks through visions, signs, and tests. Historically, this process has been free from political interference. However, China insists that it has the final say, citing historical conventions:– Mao Ning, Chinese foreign ministry spokespersonIn, the Dalai Lama explains that his successor must be free from Chinese control to continue his spiritual and humanitarian mission:This move is intended to prevent China from appointing a successor who would serve its political interests rather than uphold the spiritual and cultural values of Tibetan Buddhism.Beijing has dismissed the Dalai Lama’s remarks, insisting that it alone has the authority to choose his successor. The Chinese Foreign Ministry called him:They also reiterated that the reincarnation must follow government regulations:The controversy over the Panchen Lama—a senior figure in Tibetan Buddhism—illustrates China’s approach to religious succession. In 1995, the Dalai Lama identified a six-year-old boy, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, as the 11th Panchen Lama. Shortly after, the Chinese government abducted the child and appointed its own Panchen Lama, Gyaltsen Norbu, who is seen by many Tibetans as illegitimate.The original Panchen Lama has not been seen since, with China claiming that he is now living a ""normal life."" This fuels fears that Beijing will follow the same strategy with the next Dalai Lama.If China installs a Dalai Lama of its choosing, Tibetans and the global Buddhist community are unlikely to accept him. This could lead to two rival Dalai Lamas—one recognized by Tibetans in exile and another by China. The Dalai Lama himself has warned:A divided leadership could deepen the Tibetan resistance against Chinese rule and further strain China’s relations with the international community.The dispute over the Dalai Lama’s succession has global implications, especially for China’s relations with India and the US.Beijing has condemned such foreign involvement as an attempt to destabilize China.In, the Dalai Lama expresses concern over Tibet’s fate under Chinese rule but remains hopeful:He also reaffirmed that the struggle for Tibetan freedom will continue beyond his lifetime:(With inputs from agencies)","Dalai Lama says his successor will be born in the ""free world""—outside of China.

He also praised Bangladesh's “extraordinary generosity” in sheltering more than one million Rohingya refugees and described it as a testament to the country’s humanitarian spirit.Guterres visited Cox’s Bazar, where most of the Rohingya refugees live in overcrowded camps, and described the impact of global aid cuts on vulnerable populations as “a crime”, reported AP.He criticised the United States and European countries for slashing humanitarian assistance while increasing defence budgets.According to AP, the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) has warned that without urgent funding, food rations for Rohingya refugees could be cut by half next month. A recent WFP letter stated that $81 million is needed to sustain operations until the end of the year, including $15 million for April alone.Guterres assured that the UN will continue efforts to secure funding and stressed that Rohingya refugees must not be forgotten.

An airstrike by Myanmar’s military on a central village controlled by resistance forces killed at least 27 civilians and injured 30 others, according to opposition groups and local media reports on Saturday.The attack took place on Friday afternoon in Let Pan Hla village , Singu township, about 65 kilometers north of Mandalay. The Mandalay People’s Defense Force (MDY-PDF), which has been resisting military rule, claimed the strike targeted a crowded market area, not a military site.A spokesperson for the group, Osmond, stated that six children were among the dead and at least 10 houses were destroyed. Myanmar Now reported the death toll had risen to 30, with seven critically injured.The military junta has not commented on the attack. Since the 2021 coup that ousted Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, Myanmar has faced widespread armed resistance.

Indian radiographer suspended in UK for not knowing how to X-ray hand or foot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/unable-to-perform-x-ray-indian-radiographer-suspended-in-uk/articleshow/119130183.cms,"Representative AI image: Indian radiographer suspended in UK

LONDON: A radiographer from Kerala has been suspended from practising in Britain for six months after a panel found she was not able to do basic procedures like X-raying a hand or foot that a radiographer “straight out of training would be able to do”, and that she was putting the health of UK patients at risk.Smitha Johny, an Indian national who trained in India, had declared her first language as English on her application to be registered with the health and care professionals council (HCPC) in 2021. By law, radiographers must be registered with it to work in the UK. She had also declared English as her first language on her application to work as a radiographer at the private hospital, North Downs Hospital, in Surrey, where she started working in Jan 2023. She also claimed to have 23 years of experience.Johny had to resign and is back in India.However, the health and care professions tribunal service found that she struggled to communicate with patients and colleagues in English, was unable to answer basic questions about the radiography process, could not identify basic anatomy, did not follow required guidelines, was unable to set a up an X-ray machine, failed a mandatory life support course, and misrepresented her experience. Theyfound her performance reflected incompetence rather than “misconduct”, saying she was “naïve” and “did not understand the expectations in the UK, which may be different from those where she was working in a remote part of India”.Her line manager, Fernando Pinto, was so concerned about her performance that he presented himself as a patient coming for a hip X-ray. She pointed the machine towards his knee, not his hip, which was a radiation breach causing unnecessary exposure, which could cause cancer. Pinto told the panel she showed “no knowledge about the X-ray machine”, did not know how to position it and did not know what any of the buttons were for. She also did not ask him enough about his personal details to check she was X-raying the correct patient.She was unable to recognise the scaphoid bone in the wrist, nor could she identify a fracture in the neck from an X-ray, and did not know what a femur bone was. She also failed the life support course because she could not understand anything the instructor was saying.At her three months review in April 2023, when confronted with her poor performance, she said she was “more like a manager in her previous role” and had worked on the hospital reception desk in India checking in patients. She also said she had worked with CT scanners and not X-rays. She was then told she would be put on authorised leave that could leave to termination.On April 24, 2023 she resigned.On April 26, 2023 her manager referred her to the HCPC raising concerns about her command of English and lack of professional knowledge. The hospital also contacted the home office, which gave her 60 days to leave the UK.In an earlier stage of the proceedings, Johny had said the X-ray machines in India were “entirely different to those at the hospital” and alleged there was “racism in the workplace”.Johny required a Malayalam interpreter to attend her virtual video hearing, which was held in March this year. She was in India at the time and only attended on the first day, saying she was ill and her “family condition is very bad”. She did not attend after that and did not make any submissions.","Smitha Johny, an Indian national who trained in India, had declared her first language as English on her application to be registered with the health and care professionals council (HCPC) By law, radiographers must be registered to work in the UK.

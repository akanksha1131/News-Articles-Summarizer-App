Who is Inah Canabarro?

'I’m young, pretty'

Inah Canabarro , a Brazilian nun, has become the world’s oldest living person at almost 117 years old. LongeviQuest, a group tracking supercentenarians, declared her the oldest person with validated records on Saturday. Tomiko Itooka of Japan, the previous oldest person, died in December.Inah Canabarro was born on June 8, 1908, in southern Brazil, according to LongeviQuest. However, her nephew, Cleber Canabarro , 84, says she was actually born on May 27 but was registered two weeks later. She currently lives in a retirement home in Porto Alegre, Brazil.Canabarro’s great-grandfather was a Brazilian general who had taken up arms during the turbulent period following Brazil’s independence from Portugal in the 19th century.Cleber Canabarro said Inah was frail as a child, and many did not think she would survive her childhood.Inah Canabarro became a nun as a teenager, working in Uruguay and Rio de Janeiro before returning to Rio Grande do Sul. She taught General João Figueiredo, Brazil’s last military dictator, and started two marching bands.“I’m young, pretty and friendly – all very good, positive qualities that you have too,” Canabarro said in a video recorded by LongeviQuest in February. She attributes her long life to her Catholic faith. The video shows her telling jokes, displaying miniature paintings of wildflowers, and reciting the Hail Mary.Her nephew visits her every Saturday and sends voice messages between visits to lift her spirits after two hospitalizations left her weak and struggling to talk.“The other sisters say she gets a jolt when she hears my voice,” Cleber says. “She gets excited.”Canabarro is a fan of the local soccer club, Inter. “White or black, rich or poor, whoever you are, Inter is the team of the people,” she said in a video celebrating her 116th birthday.Inah Canabarro is the second-oldest nun ever recorded. Pope Francis also honored her for her 110th birthday. She now ranks as the 20th oldest documented person ever. Jeanne Calment of France, who died in 1997 at age 122, topped the list.","Inah Canabarro, a Brazilian nun, has become the world’s oldest living person at almost 117 years old.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to announce his resignation as leader of the Liberal Party this week, the Globe and Mail reported, citing information from three people it didn’t name.Trudeau has been under pressure from elected lawmakers in his party to quit for months — and it increased further when Chrystia Freeland , his finance minister, stepped down on December 16, saying she and the prime minister were at odds on policy.Liberal lawmakers are scheduled to hold a caucus meeting on Wednesday. Trudeau’s resignation would trigger a race for the party leadership, with the winner becoming prime minister.After the split with Freeland, some of Trudeau’s closest advisers held the view that the prime minister couldn’t survive the political fallout, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News.More than 20 Liberal members of parliament have publicly called for Trudeau’s departure, and more have said in private meetings that the prime minister has no choice but to leave. The Liberals have 153 seats in the House of Commons, including Trudeau’s.The Canadian currency strengthened as much as 0.4 per cent to C$1.4388 per dollar after the reports, advancing for the first time in five sessions. The currency is trading near its weakest level since March 2020 and has lost more than 7 per cent against the greenback in the past year.The prime minister has largely disappeared from public view since Freeland posted her stinging resignation letter. Trudeau spent much of the holidays at a ski resort in western Canada and hasn’t spoken with reporters since returning to Ottawa.The Globe story didn’t say that Trudeau has firmly made up his mind to resign.A new survey by Nanos Research, taken in late December, has the Conservative Party extending a huge lead going into an election year.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to announce his resignation as leader of the Liberal Party this week, the Globe and Mail reported.

Bangladesh’s interim government has cancelled a planned training programme for 50 judges and judicial officers in India, amidst the ongoing diplomatic spat between Dhaka and New Delhi.The Bangladesh's law ministry confirmed the decision on Sunday, saying only that a previous notification permitting the programme had been revoked. Reports from The Daily Star noted that the decision to revoke the programme aligns with the Bangladesh Supreme Court ’s directives, though no official explanation has been provided.The programme, scheduled to take place at India’s National Judicial Academy and State Judicial Academy in Madhya Pradesh from 10 February, would have been fully funded by the Indian government.Selected participants included district and sessions judges, additional district judges, and officers of equivalent rank. The cancellation came shortly after state-run Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha had publicised the initiative, and no specific reasons were disclosed by authorities.Relations between the two nations have been tense following political upheavals in Bangladesh. Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, ousted by a student-led protest in August last year, fled to India after her Awami League’s 16-year rule ended.Since the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus assumed power, there have been rising concerns about minority rights in Bangladesh, further complicating ties with India.The Hindu community has reported increasing violence under the Yunus administration, including attacks on places of worship. India has raised its concerns with Bangladesh, particularly after the arrest of Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das on sedition charges.Das, a former ISKCON leader, was accused of desecrating the national flag, an allegation his defence lawyers vehemently denied. Protests following his arrest led to violent clashes, resulting in a lawyer’s death and amplifying tensions within the country.On January 2, Das' bail application was rejected by a court in Bangladesh's Chattogram.""The hearing continued for some 30 minutes when (Metropolitan Sessions) Judge Mohammad Saiful Islam heard both the prosecution and the defence lawyers and then rejected his (Das') bail petition,"" a court official said, as reported by news agency PTI.The ministry of external affairs reaffirmed India's commitment to supporting a ""democratic, stable, peaceful, progressive, and inclusive Bangladesh.""

He also stressed that the two countries' relationship should be built on mutual trust, respect, and sensitivity to each other's concerns.""He (Misri) also emphasized that people are the main stakeholders in Bangladesh-India relations and noted that India's development cooperation and multi-faceted engagements with Bangladesh, including in areas of trade, connectivity and other capacity-building areas, are all geared towards the benefit of the people of Bangladesh.

Security concerns and prior planning

Weaknesses in the city’s Bollard system

Attack execution and vulnerabilities in security planning

Challenges in security

At least 14 people were killed, and about 30 others were injured early on New Year’s Day when a man drove a pickup truck with the Islamic State group flag into a crowd in the French Quarter of New Orleans, city in Louisiana, US, and opened fire. Officials have labeled it a deliberate attack, and the FBI is investigating it as a potential act of terrorism.The attack unfolded on Bourbon Street, known worldwide as one of the largest destinations for New Year’s Eve parties. Large crowds had gathered in the city ahead of the College Football Playoff quarterfinal at the Sugar Bowl, which was postponed.Months before the deadly New Year's Day attack, city officials in New Orleans had modeled potential scenarios in which a vehicle could enter Bourbon Street at various intersections, specifically using a Ford F-150 pickup truck, similar to the one involved in the attack, news agency Reuters reported.According to a study, such a truck could reach speeds ranging from 12 to 70 mph while driving through the crowded tourist area. However, despite these concerns, the city had decided to install new street barriers—bollards—that can only withstand impacts at speeds of up to 10 mph. This decision was based on an engineering analysis and city bidding documents, the report said.These new bollards, planned to be installed before the Super Bowl in February 2025, were not yet in place during the New Year's Day attack. The Reuters report claimed that the documents reviewed made it clear that these bollards would not have been able to stop a vehicle traveling at moderate-to-high speeds, highlighting a potential flaw in the city’s security planning. The decision to prioritize ease of operation over crash safety was largely due to problems with the old bollard system, which required frequent maintenance.New Orleans had been under pressure to improve its security measures since at least 2020, following a string of deadly vehicle attacks globally, including the 2016 attack in Nice, France, that killed 86 people.The city's earlier bollard system, installed in response to increasing concerns about vehicle attacks globally, had its own set of issues, the Reuters report said. The initial system used the Heald HT2 Matador, which allowed workers to move barriers along tracks in the street.However, this system became frequently inoperable because debris, such as Mardi Gras beads, jammed the tracks. Additionally, the mechanism to lock and unlock the barriers was often submerged in what one source, speaking to Reuters, called “Bourbon Street juice”—a mix of street grime, spilled drinks, and trash—making it difficult for workers to operate.Following these issues, city officials decided to choose a new bollard system rated for 10-mph impacts. These bollards were lightweight and easier to operate daily, with each post weighing just 44 pounds compared to the 86-pound posts rated for 20 mph.However, this new system, which was intended to be installed by a single city worker each day, would not have prevented the attack on New Year's Day. The system selected was insufficient to stop vehicles traveling at higher speeds, such as those modeled in the city's earlier engineering analysis, where an F-150 could have reached speeds of 50 mph or 70 mph.On New Year’s Day, the attacker, identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a US combat veteran from Texas, took advantage of gaps in the city's security planning.He managed to squeeze his seven-foot-wide pickup onto an eight-foot-wide sidewalk between a drugstore and a police vehicle, then accelerated and drove through the crowd. Jabbar died after a shootout with police, and US federal authorities have said he was radicalized and had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.The city's earlier security modeling, which focused on scenarios where a vehicle entered Bourbon Street on the road, did not account for the possibility of a vehicle entering from the sidewalk. The study found that most of Bourbon Street's narrow sidewalks had existing barriers, like fire hydrants and streetlights, which would have prevented vehicles from entering.However, Jabbar exploited this vulnerability by driving his vehicle onto the sidewalk.Since the attack, New Orleans officials have faced criticism regarding their security planning, with many questioning whether the city had left residents vulnerable while transitioning from the old bollards to the new ones. Despite these concerns, both the old and new systems would not have stopped the vehicle from entering the area, the Reuters report said, quoting the city's security planning sources.New Orleans city officials have been studying how to improve New Orleans' security infrastructure since 2020, with a focus on protecting Bourbon Street from vehicle attacks. In 2017, following international vehicle attacks, the city installed its first bollard system.However, this system’s inefficiencies, combined with the challenges of protecting pedestrians while allowing normal vehicle and pedestrian traffic, led to the decision to replace it with a more easily operable system.The decision to select the 10-mph bollard system was based on the city's need to balance safety with operational efficiency. The new bollards were easier to install and remove daily compared to higher-rated bollards that would require specialized equipment to move.","At least 14 people were killed, and about 30 others were injured early on New Year’s Day when a man drove a pickup truck with the Islamic State group flag into a crowd in the French Quarter of New Orleans.

Reason for suspension

Canada in 2025 will stop accepting new applications for permanent residence under the Parents and Grandparents sponsorship programme. IRCC has said they will only process family sponsorship applications submitted in 2024 under the Parents and Grandparents Program .For 2025, IRCC aims to process no more than 15,000 sponsorship applications.For those Canadian citizens and permanent residents wanting their parents and grandparents to stay longer in Canada, the super visa option remains available, permitting visits lasting up to five years per stay.The Parents and Grandparents Program enables Canadian citizens and permanent residents to sponsor their parents or grandparents for permanent residency in Canada.The programme uses a lottery system for sending application invitations, as interested sponsors significantly outnumber available positions. IRCC sent invitations to sponsors who submitted their interest forms during the 2020 intake period, continuing this process from 2020 through 2024.IRCC has lowered its permanent resident targets for 2025 by 20%, impacting allocations under the Parents and Grandparents Program (PGP). The new target for PGP landings in 2025 is set at 24,500 foreign nationals.This marks a notable decrease compared to the Immigration Levels Plan released in 2023, which had set higher targets of 32,000 for 2024 and 34,000 for 2025.","Canada will stop accepting new applications for permanent residence under the Parents and Grandparents sponsorship programme in 2025.

American Airlines prohibits staff from wearing unauthorised pins that aren't part of the official uniform. The policy allows staff to wear company-issued pins for anniversaries, awards, military service, and pins that represent religion, ethnicity, or LGBTQ pride.Since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel , tensions have remained high worldwide, especially with the US providing military aid to Israel. The ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict has resulted in the deaths of over 45,000 Palestinians, according to health ministry of Gaza.","Incident took place on a Miami-bound flight and was captured by the passenger.

"NYC charges congestion fee for peak-hour traffic, a first in US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nyc-charges-congestion-fee-for-peak-hour-traffic-a-first-in-us/articleshow/116973989.cms,"New York's new toll for drivers entering the centre of Manhattan debuted Sunday, meaning many people will pay $9 to access the busiest part of the Big Apple during peak hours. The toll, or ""congestion pricing"", is meant to reduce traffic gridlock in the densely packed city while also raising money to help fix its ailing public transit infrastructure.""We've been studying this issue for five years. And it only takes about five minutes if you're in midtown Manhattan to see that New York has a real traffic problem,"" metropolitan transportation authority CEO Janno Lieber said Friday after a court hearing cleared the way for the tolls. ""We need to make it easier for people who choose to drive, or who have to drive, to get around the city.""The cost to drivers depends on what time of the day it is and if drivers have an E-ZPass, an electronic toll collection system thats used in many states. Most drivers of passenger cars with E-ZPasses will get dinged the $9 fee to enter Manhattan south of Central Park on weekdays between 5am and 9pm and on weekends between 9am and 9pm. During off hours, the toll will be $2.25. That's on top of tolls drivers pay for crossing bridges and tunnels to get to the city in the first place, although there will be a credit of up to $3 for those who have already paid to enter Manhattan via certain tunnels during peak hours.Motorcyclists will pay $4.50 during peak hours and $1.05 off-peak. Those driving smaller commercial trucks and some buses will pay a toll of $14.4 at peak hours and $3.60 at other times. Drivers of larger trucks will be charged $21.60 at peak hours and $5.40 off-peak.Prez-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, has vowed to kill the programme when he takes office, but it's unclear if he will follow through. The plan had stalled during his first term while it waited on a federal environmental review. In Nov, Trump, whose Trump Tower is in the toll zone, said congestion pricing ""will put New York City at a disadvantage over competing cities and states, and businesses will flee"".Other big cities around the world, including London and Stockholm, have similar congestion pricing schemes, but it is the first in the US. The toll was supposed to go into effect last year with a $15 charge, but Democratic governor Kathy Hochul abruptly paused the programme before 2024 election, when congressional races in suburban areas - the epicentre of opposition to the programme - were considered to be vital to her party's effort to retake control of Congress.Not long after the election, Hochul rebooted the plan but at the lower $9 toll. She denies politics were at play and said she thought the original $15 charge was too much. Congestion pricing also survived several lawsuits, including a last-ditch effort from New Jersey to have a judge put up a temporary roadblock against it.","The toll, or ""congestion pricing"", is meant to reduce traffic gridlock in the densely packed city.

At least 8 inches of snow were expected, as the National Weather Service issued storm warnings from Kansas and Missouri- where blizzard conditions were reported - to New Jersey into Monday.

"Hong Kong's cabbies, frustrated and long scorned, face end of an era",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hong-kongs-cabbies-frustrated-and-long-scorned-face-end-of-an-era/articleshow/116973916.cms,"HONG KONG: The air is laced with cigarette smoke and profanities as a half-dozen taxi drivers hang out by their fire-engine-red cabs in the gritty Prince Edward neighbourhood of Hong Kong. It is the afternoon handover, when day-shift drivers pass their taxis to those working in the night. They are surrendering cash to a taxi agent, a matriarchal figure who collects rent for the vehicles, manages schedules, and dispenses unsolicited advice about quitting smoking. The drivers wave her off.There may be no harder task in this city of more than 7 million than trying to change a taxi driver's habits. Often grumpy and rushing to the next fare, cabbies in Hong Kong have been doing things their way for decades. But taxi drivers are under pressure to get with the times. Their passengers are fed up with being driven recklessly, treated curtly and, in many cases, having to settle fares with cash. The practice is so ingrained that airport staff often have to alert tourists at taxi ranks that they need to carry bills.The govt - both because of the complaints and to revitalise tourism - has tried to rein in taxi drivers. Officials ran a campaign last year urging drivers to be more polite. They imposed a point system in which bad behaviour by drivers, such as overcharging or refusing passengers, would be tracked and could result in the loss of licenses. In early Dec, the govt proposed requiring all taxis to install systems to allow them to accept credit cards and digital payments by the end of 2025, and to add surveillance cameras by the end of 2026. Predictably, many cabbies have opposed the idea. ""Would you want to be monitored all the time?"" said Lau Bing-kwan (75). ""The govt is barking too many orders.""The new controls, if put in place, would signal the end of an era for an industry that has long been an anomaly in Hong Kong's world-class transportation system. To many cabbies, the impatience and brusqueness is a reflection of their harsh reality: When scraping by in a business with shrinking financial rewards, no time can be wasted on social niceties. For instance, Lau Man-hung, 63, skips meals and bathroom breaks just to stay behind the wheel long enough to take home about $2,500 a month, barely enough to get by in one of the most expensive cities in the world.Tension between the public and taxi drivers plays out with mutual finger-pointing. When the govt introduced the courtesy campaign, a driver told a reporter that it was the passengers who were rude. ""There is an impression among the public that all taxi drivers are bad when most of them just want to earn a living,"" said Hung Wing-tat, a retired professor who has studied the taxi industry.",Cabbies in Hong Kong have been doing things their way for decades.

He recalled hearing a ‘massive noise’ before being violently ejected from his wheelchair, landing near the truck's tires. “I’m assuming I got hit by the truck, but honestly, nobody’s ever told me that, so I don’t know,” Sensky told NBC News. ""But my wheelchair was completely bashed and the pieces were all over the place, so something hit me.""His daughter, Heaven Sensky Kirsch, confirmed to the Daily Mail that the damaged wheelchair found at the scene belonged to her father.Sensky described the chaotic scene as he lay on the ground. ""I just heard screaming and I heard gunfire,"" he said. ""No one would come, and so I pushed myself on my back... I was screaming out for help, and people were just looking at me."" He added, ""I kept asking for someone to help me and get me out of there, and it took a while. I realised that it was a bad scene.""His family grew worried when they couldn’t reach him.

But owner Mollie Engelhart said adding meat and dairy to the menu this year to draw new customers backfired.The decision to serve items like bison burgers and cheese, sourced through regenerative farming methods, was intended to align with Engelhart’s passion for sustainable agriculture. “I thought maybe we could merge these two things, my restaurants and my passion for regenerative agriculture , and come to some new pathway,” she told Eater, a digital media brand that covers food and dining in Los Angeles.The change upset Sage’s loyal vegan customers, who felt betrayed. Angry diners flooded Yelp with one-star reviews. “Will never eat here now that they serve meat,” one wrote, while another said, “You’ve abandoned your core values and the animals. So disappointing.”Despite their efforts to revive the business—Engelhart and her husband even sold their home to inject funds—Sage struggled to recover. The backlash came to a head when the restaurant announced its closure on Instagram.Animal rights group Peta was among the critics, commenting on the closing saying, “Serving humane-washed meat, dairy, and eggs under the sham of ‘regenerative farming’ betrayed animals, the planet, and kind customers.”Many vegans celebrated the closure, calling it “karma” for abandoning its roots. “This is what happens when you betray the animals and your customer base,” read one comment.","Sage Regenerative Kitchen & Brewery is closing after 14 years.

The man behind the deadly New Year’s attack in New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar , had planned the assault for weeks, using Meta smart glasses to record videos of the city in the lead-up to the attack, the FBI revealed in a press conference on Sunday.Jabbar, 42, visited New Orleans twice in the months before the attack, first in October and again in November. During his visits, he used the smart glasses to film a bicycle tour of the French Quarter, seemingly planning his assault, the New York Post reports.FBI Special Agent in Charge Lyonel Myrthil explained that the glasses allow users to record videos and photos hands-free, with livestreaming options. However, they were not activated during the New Year’s Day attack. ""They were not actively recording during the attack,"" Myrthil confirmed.On January 1, Jabbar drove a rented Ford F-150 Lightning truck through a crowd on Bourbon Street, killing 14 people and injuring 35 others.The FBI also discovered new security footage showing Jabbar placing two homemade bombs on the street before carrying out the attack. The glasses and a brown coat found inside the truck were seen in the video footage.The FBI also confirmed Jabbar's involvement with ISIS, revealing that he had posted videos online claiming to have “joined ISIS earlier this year.” While he acted alone in the attack, investigators are continuing to probe Jabbar’s associates both in the US and abroad.In addition to the explosives, two firearms— a semiautomatic pistol and a rifle— were recovered, with the rifle purchased in a private sale in Arlington, Texas, on November 19. The FBI believes Jabbar also set fire to a short-term rental home in New Orleans, where bomb-making materials were discovered.Although Jabbar’s attack was devastating and took many lives, neither of the homemade bombs he placed in the area detonated.","Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, had planned the assault for weeks, using Meta smart glasses to record videos of the city in the lead-up to the attack.

TikTok creators left in limbo while awaiting decision on potential platform ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tiktok-creators-left-in-limbo-while-awaiting-decision-on-potential-platform-ban/articleshow/116970964.cms,"That’s the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban.At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not.For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump's recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter.If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures.“A lot of my other creative friends, we're all like freaking out. But I'm staying calm,” said Gillian Johnson , who benefited financially from TikTok’s live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films “Gambit” and “Awaken!My Neighbor .”Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is “hard to accept.”Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they’ve invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content.For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson , who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli , the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down.“I believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,"" said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands.It's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional.Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief — written by his pick for solicitor general — Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban “sweeping and troubling"" and said he wants a “negotiated resolution” to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail.While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content.Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn’t found a place quite like TikTok, she’s begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes.According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027.Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform — and its algorithm — with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups.Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens.“I’m anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,"" said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he’d struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom.""For me, this has been my sole way of doing business,"" Hurst said.Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency’s founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said.But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million monthly U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences.If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn't have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions — which will prevent them from updating the app — will eventually make the app ""unworkable,” the Justice Department has said.TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees.","The Supreme Court will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance.

His remark, delivered during a televised interview, stunned many in a country where school textbooks have long celebrated Mahmud for his raid on the Somnath temple in India in 1026. This dispute put the spotlight on naming of missiles after figures who invaded India to rile the country.Pakistan has named its missiles after Ghazni who raided and destroyed the legendary Shiv Mandir at Somnath, after Ahmad Shah Abdali who won the third battle of Panipat after defeating the Marathas and massacring thousands of them, and after Muhammad Ghori who defeated Prithviraj Chauhan.The choices of invaders from Afghanistan were deliberately meant to not only rile India but also leave no doubt that Pakistan's ballistic missile programme was India-centric, a narrative that resonated domestically, while deflecting international scrutiny.Asif is a hardliner himself. This time, however, he seemed to target a different audience. His comment came amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistan recently conducted airstrikes in Afghanistan, claiming it targeted Pakistani Taliban operatives allegedly harboured by the Afghan Taliban. Analysts suggest Asif's critique of Mahmud was less about historical revisionism and more an attempt to antagonize the Afghan Taliban.The Afghan govt promptly denounced Asif's statements as reckless. Within Pakistan, the remarks sparked a polarizing debate. Some welcomed the re-evaluation of Mahmud's legacy, while others, including members of Asif's own political party, rebuked him. Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, a former information minister, urged Asif to consult Romila Thapar's work on Somnath. Thapar, a respected Indian historian, posits that Mahmud's attack was motivated by economic and political factors rather than religious zeal, challenging the colonial-era framing of it as a Hindu-Muslim conflict.As the controversy lingers, it raises a provocative question: If Mahmud of Ghazni is no longer regarded as a hero, should the Ghaznavi missile be renamed? This debate transcends mere symbolism, hinting at broader shifts in Pakistan's foreign policy, historical narratives, and regional positioning, amid growing international and domestic pressures.","Defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif described Mahmud of Ghazni as ""merely a plunderer"" His comment came amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

World Bank to approve $20 billion programme for Pakistan: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/world-bank-to-approve-20-billion-programme-for-pakistan-report/articleshow/116966227.cms,"Representative image.

Key focus areas of the framework

Reducing child stunting



Combating learning poverty



Enhancing climate resilience



Decarbonising the environment



Expanding fiscal space



Boosting private investment to improve productivity



Approval from World Bank

Shielding projects from political shifts

Pioneering 10-year partnership

Private sector lending boost

Shifting World Bank strategy

Implementation through rolling business plans

The World Bank is set to approve a $20 billion package for Pakistan, marking the launch of a 10-year initiative to shield development projects from political instability. The programme, "" Pakistan Country Partnership Framework 2025-35 "", will target crucial areas of improvement in Pakistan’s most neglected sectors, with a focus on long-term, stable development, according to reports from Pakistan-based daily newspaper The Express Tribune.The framework will focus on six areas:These priorities have garnered broad support across Pakistan’s political spectrum, making them more likely to remain stable throughout the 2025-2035 period, which is expected to include at least three general elections.The framework is scheduled for approval by the World Bank board on January 14, 2025, following which, the World Bank’s vice president for South Asia, Martin Raiser, is expected to visit Islamabad to discuss the programme’s implementation. This initiative is seen as a long-term solution to protect development projects from Pakistan’s volatile political environment.According to the World Bank’s assessment, this strategy ""will help shield the programme from the country's volatile polity and frequent swings in priorities and requests that follow government changes.""The official documents reveal that past transitions in government have led to the ""fragmentation of the World Bank portfolio and diluted impacts."" A key official, who was part of the framework development, said that the World Bank picked Pakistan as the first country where it would introduce the 10-year partnership strategy.""The World Bank's total indicative lending envelope for fiscal year 2025 to 2035 will total around $ 20 billion,"" as per a draft of the framework quoted by the Express Tribune.Of this, $14 billion will come from the World Bank’s concessional arm, the International Development Association (IDA), while the remaining $6 billion is expected to be provided through the relatively expensive International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).However, these loans rely on several factors, including the evolution of IDA funding, Pakistan’s performance under the Sustainable Development Finance Policy, and the country’s debt vulnerability indicators.In addition to the $20 billion in loans to the Pakistani government, the framework also aims to facilitate $20 billion in private sector lending through the World Bank’s two other arms: the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). This brings the total value of the World Bank’s engagement in Pakistan to $40 billion. However, the official loans to the government will remain capped at $20 billion.This new lending initiative marks a significant shift in the World Bank’s approach. Rather than focusing on smaller, short-term projects, the framework will concentrate on larger, more impactful investments. It will phase out lending to 10 less impactful sectors like transport, power transmission, telecoms, tertiary healthcare, and higher education, which are seen as less impactful in terms of long-term development.Instead, the World Bank will focus on ""larger projects on average, more frequent scale-ups and expansions, and less pilots and one-off operations"", according to the planning document.The implementation of the 10-year framework will be guided by two-year rolling business plans, which will be agreed upon by both the World Bank and the Pakistani government. By concentrating on long-term, high-impact areas, the World Bank’s new strategy aims to help Pakistan tackle its most pressing socio-economic challenges.","The World Bank is set to approve a $20 billion package for Pakistan, marking the launch of a 10-year initiative to shield development projects from political instability.

"Pakistan: Imran Khan's party says it will only talk to government, doors closed on military for now",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-imran-khans-party-says-it-will-only-talk-to-government-doors-closed-on-military-for-now/articleshow/116936691.cms,"KARACHI: PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan revealed that his party had engaged in ""backdoor contacts"" with Pakistan's military before the November 2024 protests but clarified that these talks have now been severed. Gohar confirmed that all ongoing discussions are solely with the government, Dawn reported.According to Gohar, the PTI leadership initially pursued discussions with the military, acknowledging the army's significant role in decision-making in the country. These contacts were heading in a ""positive direction"" until the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan in a new case.Gohar detailed that Khan had been granted bail in the Toshakhana case, which involved the controversial purchase of a Bulgari jewellery set, but was soon rearrested on charges related to the September 2024 protest, leading to the collapse of talks with the military.""Now, the PTI is not holding backdoor talks with the establishment,"" Gohar said. However, he emphasised that the possibility of future talks with the military has not been completely closed, leaving room for potential negotiations later. This statement reflects PTI's focus on engaging in dialogue exclusively with the government at this juncture.The PTI chairman also responded to rumours about an alleged offer to move Imran Khan from Adiala Jail to his residence in Banigala. Gohar swiftly dismissed the claims, reiterating that Khan views his detention as illegal. ""There is no point in considering such an offer,"" Gohar stated, aligning with Khan's position on the matter. The PTI leader's refusal to entertain any conditional release further reinforces the party's stance on his unjust incarceration, reported Dawn.Furthermore, Gohar rejected the idea of a trilateral meeting between Imran Khan, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP's Asif Ali Zardari, which had been suggested by PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah to resolve the nation's ongoing political crises. He characterised the proposal as ""idealistic,"" citing the irreconcilable differences between the political figures involved.""I might see this day [talks between the three leaders] in my life, but for now, this isn't possible,"" Gohar remarked, indicating that such a dialogue is highly unlikely at the present time.Meanwhile, in Peshawar, PTI's Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram addressed the issue of the ongoing talks with the government. He assured that the expected judgment in the £190 million case on January 6 would not derail the negotiations.""The talks will continue, keeping in view the government's seriousness,"" Akram stated, emphasising that the party had not linked the verdict to the discussions. He also spoke about the release of PTI workers who had been sentenced by military courts, clarifying that their freedom had no connection to the ongoing talks with the government.""Our workers were released because they were innocent, and it was not possible to further keep them in jail,"" Akram asserted.The PTI has also been actively engaged in a civil disobedience movement , which began with an appeal to overseas Pakistanis not to send remittances. Akram suggested that the impact of this action would begin to show within two months. He said the PTI would evaluate the situation and consider withdrawing the movement if the government met their demands, such as releasing all imprisoned party members and forming a judicial commission to probe the May 9 and November 26 protests, Dawn reported.""The civil disobedience movement is necessary for a country where the Constitution, laws, and human rights are violated and lawmakers are abducted,"" Akram explained, underscoring the PTI's ongoing commitment to reform. He also criticised the internet disruptions, warning that they would negatively affect Pakistan's digital economy, particularly the youth who contribute significantly to the sector.","Gohar Ali Khan confirms that all ongoing discussions are solely with the government.

The deadly attack had sparked further violence and road closures in the district, restricting access to medicine, food and fuel in the area as casualties in fighting between Sunni and Shia tribes surged to 136.

He reminded the public that such reckless actions would lead to serious legal consequences.""The police would register cases under the attempted murder section for aerial firing incidents that occurred on New Year's Eve,"" AIG Odho said. He added that last year, 31 individuals were injured in similar incidents, with several individuals subsequently being booked by the police, ARY News reported.","Aerial firing incidents in Karachi left at least 29 people injured, including women and children. In Liaquatabad, three people were injured by stray bullets. Other locations, including Agra Taj, Malir Kala Board, Tipu Sultan, Ferozeabad, and Alfalah Dastagir reported bullet injury cases.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116855227,imgsize-1026304,width-400,resizemode-4/116855227.jpg"
A Parsi family that knows all about booze in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/a-parsi-family-that-knows-all-about-booze-in-pakistan/articleshow/116842907.cms,"In 1947, when the British transferred power to India and Pakistan, many businesses also changed hands. One of them was Murree Brewery , among the oldest distilleries in Asia, which was then largely owned by a British family. The Bhandaras of Lahore became its new owners. They were a Parsi family that had thrived in the liquor business.Isphanyar Bhandara now runs Pakistan's top brewery. He recently made a brief halt in New Delhi on his way to Nepal. ""It's my tenth visit to India,"" the businessman-politician said cheerfully, a Pakistan flag lapel pin on his coat the only green in his otherwise blue attire.Liquor business is heavily regulated in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. About 96% of the country's population is Muslim. The brewery, accordingly, points out on its website, ""Under the country's laws Pakistan Muslims are prohibited from consuming alcoholic drinks. Non-Muslims and foreigners require a consumption permit.""Nonetheless, the business has been rewarding for the Bhandaras. ""The forbidden fruit is always sweet,"" said Isphanyar. ""We make beers from Australian barley. Our vodkas and single malts are also doing very well. It's all about quality. We also make and export fruit juice and are heavily into (bottled) water,"" he added.Success though hasn't been limited to the arena of trade. Isphanyar is also a member of the Pakistan National Assembly . His father was a central minister under Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s and an MP during the Pervez Musharraf regime.But, as a community, the Parsis have wilted. In 1947, Isphanyar says, about 20,000-25,000 of them lived in Pakistan. Like in India, they played a major role in nation-building, especially in cities like Karachi. They were among the top businessmen and jurists and were engaged in philanthropic work. In the 19th century, Parsis were also among the early cricketers of Karachi. According to an article in scoreline.org, a team of Parsi cricketers toured England in 1886. In 1952, when Pakistan's cricket team toured India, southpaw batter Rusi Dinshaw was part of the squad, although he didn't get to play a Test.""Today, we are less than 1,000,"" says Isphanyar. ""Most of the Parsi population is in its 80s or 90s, a bit like the Japanese. There are very few young Parsis in Pakistan today,"" he said.Many left due to economic reasons, others due to law and order issues. One such migrant was the renowned writer Bapsi Sidhwa, whose novel, Ice Candy Man, was made into a feature film called 'Earth' by director Deepa Mehta. Sidhwa passed away in Houston on Dec 25 last year; she was Isphanyar's aunt.The 54-year-old businessman gets raw material and machinery from India. ""A lot of companies in Pakistan do. The problem is, it is via Dubai,"" he said. But there are other reasons why he wants more trade between the two neighbours.""We can disagree on Kashmir, put it on the back burner. We don't have to concede our position and India doesn't have to concede theirs. But we should keep the baggage of history aside and look at the common good of the common people. We should open the Wagah border,"" he said.More business will benefit the underprivileged, he believes. ""We need it for the common man - dal, roti, cheeni, stuff like that. It will lower the inflation in Pakistan. I've made my presentations to our Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saab. I'm keeping my fingers crossed,"" he said.Not many know that the brewery - it gets its name from the scenic resort town - was set up in 1860, just three years after the 1857 revolt, to mainly service British troops. Edward Dyer, father of Reginald Dyer, the perpetrator of the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre, was its first manager. By 1890, water shortage and other logistical issues had forced the distillery to shift to the Rawalpindi area, where it continues to be headquartered.There was a time when Murree Beer was sold in India. ""In fact, Pakistan railways had put up tracks inside the brewery that used to carry beer to places like Kabul, Amritsar and, of course, to Karachi port,"" he said. But the state of politics and, consequently, policies, changed in Pakistan in the late 1970s when, exceptions aside, alcohol was banned. But as reputed Dawn columnist Nadeem Paracha wrote in 2013, ""Despite the violence and the eventual prohibition on the (open) sale of alcohol and bars in Pakistan in April 1977, Pakistanis never did stop drinking.""About two decades back, a possible joint venture project proved abortive. ""In 2006, when Vijay Mallya (former chairman of United Spirits) visited Pakistan to watch a cricket match, the prospect of doing something together was broached with my father. But politics did not allow them to come together,"" he said.Political relations between the two countries have further dipped now. But Isphanyar is an optimist. He wants the situation to improve. And more Indo-Pak trade , he insists, is the way to begin.","In 1947, when the British transferred power to India and Pakistan, many businesses also changed hands. The Bhandaras of Lahore became its new owners. They were a Parsi family that had thrived in the liquor business. In 1947, Isphanyar says, about 20,000-25,000 of them lived in Pakistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116842932,imgsize-935512,width-400,resizemode-4/116842932.jpg"
Pak PM Sharif unveils national economic plan to transform country in next 5 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-pm-sharif-unveils-national-economic-plan-to-transform-country-in-next-5-years/articleshow/116838721.cms,"Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday unveiled a national plan for fast-track economic development aiming to transform the country in the next five years. The ' Uraan Pakistan ' five-year National Economic Transformation plan is aimed at steering the country towards sustainable growth from macroeconomic stability, the premier said while addressing the launching ceremony here.The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader said the government has set an investment target of USD 10 billion annually and an enabling environment is being created to attract local investments as well.Sharif said privatisation and outsourcing are vital to save huge losses for which political dialogue is necessary and for which the private sector will be encouraged""Today is a historic day as we commence the journey of Uraan Pakistan,"" he said, and added that the purpose of the programme is development and it is important that all stakeholders work together.The prime minister credited the public for enduring economic hardships and pledged to build on the current stability, describing it as ""only the beginning"".Sharif also criticised the previous government for straining relations with ""friendly nations"", stating that their conduct left Pakistan isolated on the global stage.He outlined goals for economic reforms, expressing hope that Pakistan's current agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would be its last.""Through hard work, we can achieve success. Inflation has visibly decreased and the collaboration between the government and institutions continues to strengthen,"" he said.The prime minister stressed on the need for reducing the cost of inputs like electricity and gas to ensure sustainable growth. He said local industries should be made more compatible to save foreign exchange and expand exports, emphasising that export-led growth is the only option to make Pakistan a stronger economy.He also highlighted the coalition government's struggle to stabilise the economy during Pakistan's 2023 financial crisis.""When we were on the brink of default and striving for the IMF programme, we decided to prioritise saving the state over politics,"" he said.Praising the collaboration between government institutions, he said, ""I have never seen such a partnership before. My prayer is for this unity to endure as we move forward with solidarity and determination, learning from past mistakes.""Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said ""Uraan Pakistan"" aims at attaining a sustainable GDP growth rate of six per cent by 2028, one million jobs annually, and ten billion dollars private investment per year.He said this plan is accompanied by a comprehensive implementation mechanism to hit the export target of 60 billion dollars by fiscal year 2028.He added that PM Sharif established a delivery unit at the prime minister's office (PMO) to coordinate the implementation of sectoral plans and roadmaps.""Pakistan recorded a fiscal surplus for the first time in 24 years, reduced inflation from 38 per cent to 5 per cent and improved the policy rate from 13 per cent to 22 per cent. The stock market is now the second-best performing globally, and investor confidence - both local and foreign - has surged,"" he said.Aurangzeb emphasised that the programme is laying the groundwork for sustainable economic growth, adding, ""This is a turning point for the nation's economic stability.""Radio Pakistan reported that Uraan Pakistan is built on pillars of 5Es, entailing exports, e-Pakistan, environment, including food and water security, energy and infrastructure as well as equity, ethics and empowerment.The plan would place Pakistan on a path of sustainable high growth moving towards a stronger and more prosperous future with the commitment to build a solid foundation to transform Pakistan into a trillion dollar economy by 2035 and a three trillion dollar economy by 2047.",Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif unveils national plan for fast-track economic development.

"Pakistan's textile exports face setback, fall short of $17 billion amid political instability",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-textile-exports-face-setback-fall-short-of-17-billion-amid-political-instability/articleshow/116833378.cms,"Pakistan's textile industry, which was once poised to achieve higher export earnings, started to lose its momentum, as per The Express Tribune.2024 has been a challenging year for this crucial sector, often referred to as the backbone of the nation's industrial economy.In the fiscal year 2023-24, textile exports saw a modest growth of 0.93 per cent, generating a substantial USD 16.7 billion in export revenues. However, during the first five months of FY25, textile exports reached USD 7.607 billion, reflecting a 10.51 per cent increase compared to the same period last year Express Tribune reported.In the first 11 months of 2024, textile exports totaled just USD 15.43 billion. Industry millers anticipate that the December figure could be approximately USD 1.5 billion, resulting in the year ending with exports falling short of USD 17 billion.Ijaz Khokhar, Patron-in-Chief of the Pakistan-textile-exports, stated, ""The early months of this calendar year were relatively good for the textile industry, particularly exports, as they showed a positive trend.""The positive trend started to decline after the initial months. The primary cause was ongoing political instability, which has persisted for more than two years. Khokhar remarked, ""We have lost at least 40 per cent of our export orders because buyers, hesitant to trust Pakisttextile millers due to political challenges, are shifting their orders to Vietnam.""Others noted that Pakistan also missed the chance to secure orders that were diverted from Bangladesh due to its political turmoil. Waqas Hanif, a mid-sized textile miller from Lahore, said, ""Textile millers in Pakistan should have fully taken advantage of the opportunity created by the political change in Bangladesh. However, our millers have been unable to meet the demand because of price differences.""According to the Express Tribune report a significant portion of the demand was once again redirected to Vietnam, as Pakistani millers lacked product diversification. Hanif highlighted, ""Vietnam is far more advanced in the textile and other sectors. They offer a wide range of products and are able to offer lower prices.""Pakistan was once the top choice for international buyers due to its competitive prices. However, the country has consistently struggled with product diversification. Over the past decade, the government, textile millers, analysts, and foreign buyers have all emphasized the need for diversification.While a few millers are making efforts, the industry as a whole remains far from developing the new products required by European Union and American buyers. The government's support in this area has also been lackluster. Some economists caution that ongoing political tensions, along with stringent measures from the finance ministry and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), could severely harm the sector, which remains the largest source of export revenue.""The local industry has not been growing for years, so how can we expect product diversification or an increase in export revenue?"" asked Ahmad Aziz Subhani, an economist based in the UAE.Recently, the FBR included the textile sector in the standard tax regime, requiring millers to pay a 2 per cent advance tax instead of the previous 1 per cent. Furthermore, they are now obligated to submit all their business information to the FBR.Subhani stated that following the tax increase, many Pakistani textile companies have been relocating to Dubai. ""So far, about 400 companies have set up offices in Dubai and registered with the Dubai Chamber of Commerce. This will likely lead to under-invoicing of export orders by several Pakistani millers, further reducing export revenue,"" he added.The report further stated that many textile industry leaders highlight that the sector is heading in the wrong direction.""We are struggling with high energy costs, which have led to a reduction in mills and a shift of orders to Vietnam. We are uncertain about how many billions of dollars we've lost because of this,"" said Ashraf Ali, a textile retailer based in Faisalabad. He further mentioned that a cotton crisis is looming, as nearly half of the spinning units have shut down due to a liquidity shortage and delays in the FBR's release of sales tax refunds.""We should expect a rise in yarn prices and a shortage of the product in 2025,"" Ali added. The industry is also awaiting the start of Trump's second term, as many factors depend on the policies the incoming US president will implement.Many millers argue that any restrictions, whether due to political instability or other factors, would have a detrimental impact on Pakistan's textile industry. They also pointed out that the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East could further escalate tensions and affect the global economy.In summary, textile exports for the current fiscal year are likely to decline or remain flat due to the various challenges the industry is facing. The sector has almost given up on reaching its USD 25 billion export target, as they believe that without a clear textile policy and the active involvement of key stakeholders in decision-making, achieving this goal would remain an unrealistic aspiration.

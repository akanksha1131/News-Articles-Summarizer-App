UK Signs Historic Chagos Deal With Mauritius; Cedes Control, But Retains Military Base





A 6-year old British boy was apprehended along with multiple adults in Mauritius in connection with a significant £1.6million (Rs 18.78 crore approx) drug trafficking operation, according to by several UK media outlets.The incident reported occurred last Sunday at Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport (MRU), Mauritius's primary international gateway, where authorities allegedly found 161kg of cannabis concealed in their luggage. Report from the Mirror indicate the child's luggage contained 24 packages totalling 14kg. His 35-year-old mother allegedly carried 29 packages, while her Romanian companion was found with 32 packages.Local authorities estimated the seized substances would value approximately £1.6million in the regional drug market. The operation resulted in the detention of five British women, one British man, one Romanian man, and the child. The adults subsequently appeared before a Mahebourg court, facing provisional drug-related charges.Additionally, according to Mauritian newspaper Defi Media, the adults remain in custody after police opposed their conditional release.The British High Commission was notified regarding the child's situation following his and his mother's arrest. Subsequent UK media reports claimed that the child returned home on Wednesday, with his father receiving him at the airport.A Foreign Office spokesperson told The Mirror: ""We are supporting several British nationals who are detained in Mauritius and are in contact with the local authorities.""Reports suggest customs and police officials maintained surveillance on the group from their arrival on British Airways flight BA 2065 from London Gatwick Airport on Sunday.","A 6-year old British boy was apprehended along with multiple adults in Mauritius.

Musk vs Big Beautiful Bill







Former Doge chief and Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Saturday reinforced his criticism of US President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill, warning that the legislation, pushed urgently by Republican senators, would destroy millions of jobs in America and cause harm to the country.Calling the bill ""Utterly insane and destructive,"" in a post on X, Musk said that this will severely damage the industries of the future.""The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country! Utterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,"" he said.The Senate was holding a key test vote on ""big, beautiful bill"" Saturday evening, June 28. According to the CBS news, Trump has pressured Congress to pass the bill. In a statement, obtained by CBS News on Saturday, the White House said that a failure to pass the bill would be the ""ultimate betrayal.""""The One Big Beautiful Bill Act reflects the shared priorities of both the Congress and the Administration. Therefore, the Congress should immediately pass this bill and send it to the President's desk by July 4, 2025, to show the American people that they are serious about 'promises made, promises kept,'"" the statement said.""President Trump is committed to keeping his promises, and failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal. ""The bill includes modifications to Medicaid provider tax rates, food benefit cost-sharing, SALT deduction limits and reduced wind and solar incentives. New guidelines restrict credits to projects starting before 2028 and implement additional taxes thereafter.This is not for the first time when Musk disagreed with Trump regarding the administration's ""big, beautiful"" spending bill.Earlier, on June 3, Musk had criticised the initial version, describing it as a ""massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill [that] is a disgusting abomination.""""Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong,"" Musk wrote in the June 3 post. ""You know it.""Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, R-SC, presented the revised version on Friday evening, with Republicans aiming to present it to the president by July 4.Musk argued that the bill favours traditional industries whilst harming future-focused sectors. The American Clean Power Association shared similar concerns, warning about frozen energy investments and increased household costs.""With no warning, the Senate has proposed new language that would increase taxes on domestic energy production,"" Fox news quoted ACP CEO Jason Grumet stated.""In what can only be described as 'midnight dumping,' the Senate has proposed a punitive tax hike targeting the fastest-growing sectors of our energy industry.""Grumet expressed concerns about threatened investments, energy security and manufacturing growth, particularly affecting rural communities.Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced her efforts to ensure a complete reading of the extensive bill, stating on X: ""Democrats need to use every second to fight back against the Big Beautiful Bill.""","Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticises US President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill.

Hundreds of protesters marched through central Venice on Saturday as billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez concluded their three-day wedding celebrations in the lagoon city.On Friday, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and media personality Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent wedding ceremony on the island of San Giorgio, joined by about 200 celebrity guests.In pics: Eat the cake or eat the rich? Hundreds march in Venice against Bezos-Sanchez wedding; fiery slogans echo through historic city On Saturday, hundreds of locals and activists marched through the city, waving banners that read “Kisses Yes, Bezos No” and “No Bezos, No War.” Many Venetians expressed frustration over what they saw as the billionaire's lavish intrusion into a city already grappling with the pressures of overtourism, rising housing costs, and climate change.Protesters criticized the extravagance of the event and its symbolic disconnect from the daily challenges faced by residents.The couple stayed at the Aman Venice hotel on the Grand Canal and hosted a series of exclusive events throughout the weekend.The guest list featured several prominent names, including Oprah Winfrey, Tom Brady, Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, Bill Gates, and members of the Kardashian-Jenner family.Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner also attended the festivities with their children.Activists claimed their demonstration led to a last-minute venue change for Saturday’s party, reported AP.Bezos has donated €1 million each to three environmental organisations working to preserve Venice, including Corila, a Venetian research association. However, the gesture was met with skepticism by many demonstrators, who viewed the donation as insufficient.“Those donations are just a misery and only aimed at clearing Bezos’ conscience,” said Flavio Cogo, a local activist.Despite the backlash, the city’s administration defended the high-profile wedding, stating that Venice has always welcomed visitors—from emperors to celebrities—and that such events align with its tradition as an open and global city.","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and media personality Lauren Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent wedding ceremony on the island of San Giorgio on Friday.

'If you want war, send your own kid',

A political hot potato in combat boots





As US bombed three Iranian soil last week amidst Israel-Iran conflict, a different kind of battle waged online aimed at one unexpected figure: Barron Trump.The 19-year-old son of President Donald J Trump, who just wrapped up his freshman year at NYU, has found himself at the center of a growing social media firestorm where netizens react to Trump's Iran bombings with the growing demand of enlisting Barron Trump in the US army.On X, many have echoed a common refrain: if President Trump is prepared to send other people’s children into harm’s way, shouldn’t his own son be first in line?""Trump has us at war. Barron should sign up for the Army now"", reacted one user.Another commented, ""POTUS @Trump should order his son Barron to immediately enlist into US Army and be sent to fight Iran. Bravo”""And with the first pick of the 2025 US Draft, the US Army Selects…Barron Trump out of Mar-a-Lago""There is no legal requirement for the children of US presidents to serve in the military.Barron Trump, by all public accounts, has maintained a low profile since his father returned to office. But the renewed scrutiny stems not solely from Barron Trump’s personal choices, but from a broader debate over political accountability and military service. President Donald Trump, now serving his second term, avoided the Vietnam War draft five times, once citing bone spurs. No member of the Trump family has served in the armed forces.As the administration faces questions about the legality and consequences of the strikes on Iran, online discourse has increasingly invoked what critics label “Chickenhawk Syndrome” — a term referring to political leaders who support military action without having direct personal or familial involvement in combat.Also read | Let Bibi go': Trump slams Netanyahu trial as ‘witch hunt’; warns of stalled Hamas, Iran talks","Netizens react to Trump's Iran bombings; calls for Barron Trump to enlist in US army after Iran strikes.

Why is Netanyahu facing courtroom trial ?





US President Donald Trump has lashed out at Israeli prosecutors for what he describes as a “POLITICAL WITCH HUNT” against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Trump in his recent post on Truth Social defended Netanyahu, describing him as a ""War Hero"" and praising his leadership, especially in working closely with the US to counter Iran’s nuclear ambitions. He credited Netanyahu with playing a key role in what he called a ""Great Success"" in curbing Iran's nuclear threat.“It is terrible what they are doing in Israel to Bibi Netanyahu. He is a War Hero, and a Prime Minister who did a fabulous job working with the United States to bring Great Success in getting rid of the dangerous Nuclear threat in Iran.”, Trump wrote.Highlighting the Israeli leader’s current diplomatic efforts, Trump emphasized that Netanyahu is in the middle of crucial negotiations with Hamas aimed at securing the release of hostages. He questioned how someone in such a high-stakes position could be expected to ""sit in a Courtroom all day long"" over what he described as trivial matters—mockingly referencing items like “Cigars” and even a “Bugs Bunny Doll” to downplay the severity of the charges.He ended his statement with a rallying cry of support for Netanyahu:“We just had a Great Victory with Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu at the helm — And this greatly tarnishes our Victory. LET BIBI GO, HE’S GOT A BIG JOB TO DO!”This isn’t the first time Trump has criticized Netanyahu’s trial.Just last week, he made a similar statement following the implementation of the ceasefire between Israel and Iran.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is currently facing several corruption charges, first filed in 2019, including bribery, fraud, and breach of trust.In the first case, Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, are accused of accepting over $260,000 in luxury items—such as cigars, champagne, and jewelry—from wealthy businessmen in return for political favors. The two remaining cases claim he sought to secure more favorable media coverage from prominent Israeli news outlets.If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison. Since the trial began in May 2020, it has seen numerous delays, many of which were requested by Netanyahu himself—initially citing the conflict in Gaza, followed by the escalation in Lebanon.Also read | 'Let Bibi go': Trump slams Netanyahu trial as ‘witch hunt’; warns of stalled Hamas, Iran talks","US President Donald Trump has lashed out at Israeli prosecutors for what he describes as a “POLITICAL WITCH HUNT” against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

‘Only one to focus on New York’: Republicans laud NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani; contrasts earlier criticism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/only-one-to-focus-on-new-york-republicans-laud-nyc-mayoral-candidate-zohran-mamdani-contrasts-earlier-criticism/articleshow/122135469.cms,"Marjorie Taylor Greene (left), Zohran Mamdani (ANI,AP)





In a surprising departure from usual partisan rhetoric, prominent Republican figures, including Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and political commentator Tucker Carlson, have extended rare praise to New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, acknowledging his grassroots-focused campaign strategy, even as they continue to oppose his political ideology.Mamdani, a Muslim and Indian-American assemblyman,pulled a surprise victory in the Democratic primary this week, defeating former New York governor Andrew Cuomo.Carlson, on his show, lauded Mamdani’s debate performance for staying focused on New York’s local issues while other candidates discussed foreign policy.“That guy was the only person in the New York City mayor’s debate to say he wanted to focus on New York City. They were, all the candidates were asked if you could visit a foreign country, what would it be? And they all, of course, all had an answer. I think most said Israel,” Carlson said during the Friday episode of “The Tucker Carlson Show.”Carlson remarked Mamdani was the only one to say he wouldn’t travel abroad, he’d stay in New York and connect with constituents directly.The former Fox News host added about Mamdani’s performance in the mayoral debate earlier this month, “and he said, ‘I wouldn’t go anywhere.I’d stay in New York. And like, if I want to meet Jewish constituents, I go to their synagogues, their homes or whatever, but I’d be here in New York because that’s what I’m doing. I’m running New York. That’s my job,” adding, “I totally oppose his program, but at least he’s talking about economics and not just foreign affairs. ”Greene, who had earlier shared a doctored image of the Statue of Liberty in a burqa in response to Mamdani’s rise, has since revised her stance. Speaking on Steve Bannon’s podcast, she said, “He really ran a campaign where he talked directly to the people… Even though his solutions are insane and socialist, he focused on their problems.”She also took a swipe at Cuomo, labelling him a “dirty establishment Democrat” and praised Mamdani for offering “unique and smart” outreach.Both Greene and Carlson have recently criticised the administration’s handling of the Israel-Iran conflict, exposing growing rifts within the MAGA movement, between those who favour strong support for Israel and others who fear the US could be drawn into a broader war.Despite the acknowledgment, hostility remains strong in Republican circles. The New York Young Republican Club called for Mamdani’s deportation under the Communist Control Act, while representative. Andy Ogles branded him “antisemitic” and called for denaturalization proceedings.President Trump, writing on Truth Social, referred to Mamdani as a “100% Communist Lunatic,” adding, “He looks terrible… and he’s backed by AOC+3 and Cryin’ Chuck Schumer.”Mamdani has responded positively to criticism from Republican lawmakers and even the president, who labeled him a “100% Communist Lunatic” due to his policy agenda.“You know, this is not the first time that President Trump is going to comment on myself, and I encourage him, just like I encourage every New Yorker, to learn about my actual policies to make the city affordable,” Mamdani told ABC News’s Rachel Scott in an interview Wednesday.Mamdani’s campaign, which includes proposals such as free buses and rent freezes, continues to draw criticism from conservatives. Still, the recognition of his campaign tactics from unlikely quarters underscores a rare moment of bipartisan acknowledgment in an otherwise divided political landscape.","Mamdani, a Muslim and Indian-American assemblyman, pulled a surprise victory in the Democratic primary this week, defeating former New York governor Andrew Cuomo.

WIDE RAMIFICATIONS BEYOND BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP:

Trump Dragged To Court By 22 U.S. States: Order Ending Birthright Citizenship Sparks Furore

THE BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP EO:

THE SPECIFIC FALL OUT:

SUMMING UP:





In a 6-3 decision, the US Supreme Court (SC) made a partial ruling on President Trump's executive order (EO) regarding birthright citizenship. Deciding on the procedural issue, the SC held that judges of federal district courts cannot issue nationwide injunctions to block a government policy (The birthright citizenship-EO, in this case). It is important to note that the SC did not decide whether the EO itself is constitutional or not – this issue is still being examined by the federal district courts.The order, which has upended decades of precedent and curtailed federal courts’ power to issue injunctions, is seen as having wide-reaching, onerous ramifications, which would not be restricted to just the issue of birthright-citizenship. Jath Shao, immigration attorney, explained, “This would potentially mean that every affected party would have to file a lawsuit on their own, and not benefit from being similarly situated. This may also mean that activists have to fight in multiple jurisdictions, and can't just win nationwide relief in one federal courtroom anymore.”Todd Schulte, President at FWD.us said, “Moreover, we are deeply concerned this will create new incentives for an administration to press ahead on unlawful, harmful actions by placing a new, substantial burden on any harmed individuals, for whom seeking relief and justice will now be more challenging.”Abhinav Tripathi, immigration attorney and founder of Protego Law Group, said, “This decision to limit nationwide injunctions is a major shift in how unlawful federal policies can be challenged. While class actions remain available, they are no substitute, especially in urgent immigration matters where delay can mean detention, deportation, or family separation. Class certification takes time, often excludes many affected, and lacks the immediacy that nationwide injunctions once provided. This ruling in short, fragments relief, weakens judicial oversight, and concentrates power in the executive, undermining due process and equal protection at a structural level.”Greg Siskind, co-founder of Siskind Susser, an immigration law firm, viewed that federal courts could be brought to a screeching halt as thousands of separate lawsuits are filed. And now ordinary people will need to file suits to protect their constitutional rights, no matter how many courts say a policy is unconstitutional.Jeff Joseph, President, American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), said, “In a 6-3 decision, the SC has limited the ability for district judges to grant universal relief in cases where the government is facially violating the Constitution in ways that have implications for the entire country. Now, plaintiffs will have to go through the burdensome process of establishing a nationwide class of similarly situated individuals and then seek a nationwide injunction. Or cases will have to be filed on an individual and piecemeal basis, resulting in chaos in the courts. By requiring piecemeal suits and protection in this manner, the Court is setting American families up for failure. For example, if a young scientist, here on an H-1B visa, who is working and contributing to our economy, gives birth, she would need to join a class action suit or sue individually to try to fight for her child’s constitutionally guaranteed right. This is impractical and will result in clogging up the courts on an issue that facially violates the Constitution and should not even be under question. The Constitution is clear—birthright citizenship is guaranteed under the 14th Amendment. Once again, the rule of law is the loser today with this decision.”According to the EO, US citizenship is denied to children born in the United States if they are not born to at least one biological parent who is a US citizen or green card holder. Thus, if the mother is in the US lawfully but temporarily (eg: as a visitor or on a non-immigrant visa – be it a dependent visa like H-4 or even a work visa) and the father is not a green card holder or US citizen, the child even if born in the US will not get automatic American citizenship.TOI had analysed the EO. Read also: Citizenship by birth curtailed even for legal immigrants; over 1 million Indians in green card queue impacted Previously, three different lower courts (federal district courts) had issued orders that stopped this EO from being put into effect across the entire country. These were the district courts of Maryland, the Western District of Washington and Massachusetts.The Supreme Court's new ruling means these original court orders will now only protect the specific individuals, organisations, and states that filed the lawsuits against the executive order. The 22 protected states are: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, plus Washington D.C. and San Francisco. For everyone else not involved in those lawsuits, the government will be allowed to start implementing the executive order in 30 days.According to Cyrus D. Mehta, founder of a NY-based immigration law firm, “The order means that the practice of extending citizenship to the US-born children of undocumented immigrants and some temporary residents and visitors would end in the 28 states that have not challenged the measure. The only way out is to file a class action. Or each person would have to make an individual constitutional challenge.”Rajiv Khanna, managing attorney at Immigraiton.com said, “The injunctions blocking the policy remain in effect for 30 days, giving time for new legal strategies. The reality check: This creates a complex patchwork. The policy remains blocked in the 22 states that sued, but could theoretically be implemented elsewhere, though the practical challenges of selective enforcement are enormous.”Charles Kuck, an immigration attorney, was aghast. He posted on a social media platform, “Anyone who wants to challenge Trump's illegal executive order on birthright citizenship (it's illegal because there is a federal law on this), has to sue INDIVIDUALLY to secure their child's citizenship. A truly moronic decision. (The court did NOT rule on the legality of Trump's order, just the process to challenge it).” ""Nearly 3,50,000 lawsuits a year to verify citizenship, that is what the Supreme Court ordered. Nice work for lawyers. Terrible for America!"", he quipped.David Leopold, an Ohio based immigration attorney, on a social media platform, pointed out the dissenting voice of Justice Sotomayor, who said, “Newborns subject to the Citizenship order will face the gravest harms imaginable. If the order does in fact go into effect without further intervention by the district courts, children will lose, at least for the time being, 'a most precious right,' and 'cherished status' that 'carries with it the privilege of full participation in the affairs of our society. The order will cause chaos for families of all affected children, too, as expecting parents scramble to understand whether the order will apply to them and what ramifications that will have.”Indeed, the ramifications could be gut-wrenching as newborns could face deportation even as their parents remain lawfully in the country (eg: those on temporary work visas).Bhumireddy Sai Srinivas Reddy, a high court advocate in India and an Indiana based legal consultant raised some important issues. “While the SC has allowed the executive order to take effect after 30 days, it hasn’t provided a clear framework for how it should be enforced or challenged. This opens the door to a troubling scenario — what happens if different federal courts issue conflicting rulings? For instance, if the Southern District of Indiana blocks the order but the Northern District allows it, does that mean a child born in one district qualifies as a US citizen, while another child, born just a few miles away, does not?”“This could lead to a situation where families might be forced to seek jurisdictions with favorable court rulings to secure citizenship for their children. It also raises the question of whether citizenship will now depend on the location of the hospital where the child is born or the legal residence of the parents,” he added.“The SC’s ruling today undermines equal justice under the law. The Court’s decision means that constitutional protections now depend on which state you live in or whether you can afford to file a lawsuit,” was a statement given by Senator Alex Padilla, Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Immigration Subcommittee.“Today’s decision emboldens President Trump’s unconstitutional attack on birthright citizenship, designed to stoke fear and persecute immigrant communities. It also fails every American who looks to the court to serve as a check to ensure that the executive branch follows the law. The SC is supposed to serve as a safeguard against presidential overreach, not incentivize it. We must heed Justice Jackson’s warning that today’s decision will permit the Executive to violate the Constitution with respect to anyone who has not yet sued,” added the statement.Ben Johnson , AILA’s executive Director, summed up: “Rather than try to defend an obviously unconstitutional executive order directly, the Trump administration manipulated the legal process to avoid swift judicial review, delaying justice for those affected and setting the stage for confusion and chaos. And today, the SC played along.”“ Instead of stepping in to declare this EO unconstitutional, the SC has greenlit a prolonged and punishing legal battle across the country. We are now facing the prospect of hundreds of individual lawsuits and likely multiple class actions to protect a right that is plainly guaranteed by the Constitution. It’s a shameful dereliction of duty. By refusing to allow federal judges to block an executive action that clearly violates the Constitution, the SC is forcing millions of individuals affected by this Executive Order to bear the full burden of seeking justice on their own. This not only imposes an enormous cost—financially and emotionally—on those families, but it also squanders government resources litigating the same issue over and over again. Birthright citizenship is not ambiguous, nor is it a vague legal question; it is a cornerstone of American democracy enshrined in the Constitution. This decision fails us all, fails the courts, and fails our Constitution,” said Johnson.","In a 6-3 decision, the US Supreme Court (SC) made a partial ruling on President Trump's executive order (EO) regarding birthright citizenship.

As Sean “Diddy” Combs' criminal trial approaches its conclusion, his son Christian “King” Combs has dropped a new EP titled Never Stop, featuring seven tracks including a song pointedly named “Diddy Free. ” The release coincided with the day Diddy's legal team was scheduled to deliver its closing arguments, marking a bold musical statement from the younger Combs in collaboration with Kanye West.“Diddy Free” opens with the line, “n***as ain’t going to sleep till we see Diddy free.”The track, credited to King Combs and Ye (formerly Kanye West), features pointed lyrics criticizing those who ""try to play the victim"" and boldly declares, ""f*** the world, critics and the witness.""In one verse, 27-year-old King Combs raps, “this Bible might come in handy / this rifle might come in handy,” while the chorus pledges to stay awake and vigilant “’til we see Diddy free.”North West, daughter of Ye, is also credited as a featured artist on the EP’s opening track, “Lonely Roads.”During the closing arguments on Friday morning, lead attorney Marc Agnifilo denounced the case as a “fake trial.”A demo version of the track by Ye, without King Combs, had surfaced online last month.Ye, who has faced widespread backlash and isolation in the music industry due to his ongoing antisemitic remarks, has been one of the few high-profile celebrities to publicly support Sean “Diddy” Combs, who is facing charges of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy.Earlier this month, Ye made a brief appearance at the Manhattan courthouse where the trial is taking place, showing solidarity with Combs amid his continued run of controversial and inflammatory statements throughout 2025.Ye is listed as the executive producer of King Combs’s new EP, Never Stop, which features cover art that seemingly shows the rundown headquarters of Bad Boy Worldwide, Sean Combs’s entertainment label. According to Ye, her involvement in an earlier version of the track had previously caused tension with ex-wife Kim Kardashian.Sean Combs, who has pleaded not guilty to all charges, could face a life sentence if convicted. Following more than a month of witness testimony and evidence, he chose not to take the stand in his defense earlier this week. On Thursday, federal prosecutors delivered an over four hours long closing argument, urging the jury to find Combs guilty and describing him as “the leader of a criminal enterprise.”All of this evidence paints a clear picture of how the defendant committed crimes,” assistant US attorney Christy Slavik said Thursday.“Up until today, he was able to get away with it because of his money, his power (and) his influence. That stops now. It’s time for justice. It’s time to find the defendant guilty,” he added.","Christian ""King"" Combs has released a new EP titled Never Stop.

California slashes spending: New budget scales back immigrant healthcare to tackle $12 Billion deficit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-slashes-spending-new-budget-scales-back-immigrant-healthcare-to-tackle-12-billion-deficit-gop-says-fiscally-irresponsible/articleshow/122133665.cms,"California governor Gavin Newsom (AP)





California governor Gavin Newsom on Friday signed a $321-billion budget that rolls back several progressive initiatives, including a major healthcare expansion for low-income undocumented immigrants, in a bid to bridge a $12-billion budget deficit.This marks the third consecutive year that America’s most populous state has been forced to cut or delay programmes backed by Democratic leaders amid declining revenues and economic uncertainty. The budget was passed by lawmakers earlier in the day following a consensus between Newsom and legislative Democrats.However, the budget agreement could be void if lawmakers fail to pass related housing legislation by Monday. That bill is aimed at making it easier to build housing across the state.Despite the cuts, state leaders say the budget protects critical safety net programmes. The deficit will be managed primarily through the use of state reserves, internal borrowing from special funds, and delayed payments, rather than by introducing new taxes.“It’s balanced, it maintains substantial reserves, and it’s focused on supporting Californians,” Newsom said in a statement.The state also faces looming risks from potential federal policy changes, including those related to tariffs and immigration enforcement, which could cut state revenues by as much as $16 billion, Newsom warned in May.Senate president pro tempore Mike McGuire acknowledged the difficult decisions involved in finalising the budget.“We’re not going to please everyone, but we’re doing this without any new taxes on everyday Californians,” he said.Republican lawmakers criticised the budget process, saying they were excluded from negotiations and that the plan fails to address long-term fiscal sustainability.“We’re increasing borrowing, we’re taking away from the rainy day fund, and we’re not reducing our spending,” said Republican senator Tony Strickland. “This budget also does nothing about affordability in California.”","California governor Gavin Newsom has signed a $321-billion budget.

First challenge to courthouse arrest: Family with ailing child fights US Immigration detention; lawsuit alleges rights violations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/first-challenge-to-courthouse-arrest-family-with-ailing-child-fights-us-immigration-detention-lawsuit-alleges-rights-violations/articleshow/122133143.cms,"Represented image (AP)





In a first of its kind lawsuit involving children, a Honduran mother and her two young children have sued the US government over their arrest outside a Texas courthouse, alleging violations of constitutional rights. The family, who legally entered the US using the CBP One app, is detained at the Dilley immigration processing center and is fighting for release, according to the news agency AP.Filed in Texas, the lawsuit argues that their arrest violated the Fourth Amendment’s protection against unlawful searches and seizures and the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of due process. According to their legal team, led by Columbia Law School professor Elora Mukherjee, the family complied fully with immigration procedures before being taken into custody.The mother and her children fled Honduras in October 2024 following death threats. After being paroled into the US by the department of homeland security, they were scheduled to appear before an immigration court in Los Angeles on May 29. But immediately after the judge dismissed their case, ICE agents allegedly arrested them outside the courtroom, placing them in expedited removal, a fast-track deportation process.Their lawyers argue the arrest was traumatic, especially for the 6-year-old boy, a leukemia patient who missed a vital check-up due to the detention.""He’s pale, bruising, and suffering bone pain,” Mukherjee said, adding that the boy urinated on himself in fear after an officer exposed a firearm.Though their appeal is pending, the family could be deported any day. Advocates say the case highlights growing concerns about the Trump administration’s continuation of aggressive immigration enforcement, particularly at courthouses.""This family followed every rule,"" said attorney Kate Gibson Kumar of the Texas civil rights project. “With young children involved, there must be protections.”The department of homeland security has not commented. The government has until July 1 to respond to the lawsuit.","A Honduran mother and her two young children have sued the US government over their arrest outside a Texas courthouse.

Senate Republicans are eyeing a key procedural vote at noon on Saturday to advance the sweeping megabill, though the final timeline is yet to be decided. The tentative plan was laid out during a closed-door luncheon on Friday, according to Senators John Kennedy and John Hoeven, reported Politico.A senior GOP aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, to the same agency, confirmed the proposed schedule but said internal consensus was still evolving.Senate majority leader John Thune has not indicated whether he has the 50 votes needed to move the bill forward. “We’ll find out tomorrow,” he told reporters, hinting at continued resistance from some members over Medicaid provisions and deficit concerns.In the meeting, house speaker Mike Johnson pitched the terms of a tentative SALT (state and local tax) compromise to senate Republicans. The deal, Johnson argued, represents the best Republicans can hope for.However, he acknowledged one remaining holdout, reportedly New York representative Nick LaLota, who later stated he was not part of any agreement.“I believe they will,” Johnson said when asked if Senate Republicans would back the SALT deal. “They’re going to digest the final calculations, but I think we’re very, very close to closing that issue.”Under the compromise deal, the SALT cap would be increased to $40,000 for five years, before reverting to the current $10,000 cap. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent and Johnson outlined the plan, which would cost approximately $192 billion, half the original proposal.Meanwhile, the Senate has agreed to retain its provider tax clause but delay implementation, a move aimed at ensuring compliance with budgetary rules.Johnson also told senators that another reconciliation bill is on the cards, potentially allowing Republicans to pursue spending cuts and policy measures excluded from the current package.However, dissent lingers on multiple fronts. Senator Lisa Murkowski expressed concern over proposed cuts to food aid, particularly a SNAP cost-sharing change that could disproportionately impact her constituency Alaska. The provision is expected to transfer billions in food aid costs to state governments, hitting states with high payment error rates the hardest.As Republicans inch closer to a vote, uncertainties around Medicaid, SNAP provisions, and internal GOP disagreements continue to pose challenges.","Senate Republicans are eyeing a key procedural vote at noon on Saturday to advance the sweeping megabill.

What Is Birthright Citizenship?

Trump’s executive order and the legal backlash



The Supreme Court’s ruling: what it changes

What comes next for immigrants?





The US Supreme Court has curtailed the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, clearing the way for President Donald Trump’s controversial order to end birthright citizenship to take effect in over half the country. The ruling does not address whether the order is constitutional but allows it to be enforced in 28 states that had not challenged it, while keeping it temporarily blocked in 22 Democratic-led states. Immigrant rights groups have warned the decision could result in stateless newborns and a chaotic patchwork of laws across the US.The 6–3 decision came in response to President Donald Trump’s controversial executive order ending birthright citizenship for children born to undocumented or temporary visa holders on US soil.The ruling was immediately hailed by Trump as a “monumental victory for the Constitution,” while immigrant rights groups and Democratic leaders voiced concern that it could lead to a patchwork of legal standards across the country and leave some newborns stateless. “By denying lower courts the ability to enforce that right uniformly, the Court has invited chaos, inequality, and fear,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge.Although the policy remains blocked in 22 Democratic-led states that sued to stop the order, the Supreme Court imposed a 30-day delay before it can take effect in the rest of the country. That window gives immigrant rights groups time to regroup and possibly file new challenges as class-action lawsuits. But with the door now open for selective enforcement, immigration advocates warn that confusion and legal uncertainty could have devastating consequences for vulnerable families.Birthright citizenship is a constitutional right enshrined in the 14th Amendment, ratified after the Civil War to ensure citizenship for formerly enslaved people. It states, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”The principle was reinforced in the landmark 1898 Supreme Court case *United States v. Wong Kim Ark*, where the court ruled that a man born in the US to Chinese parents was a citizen, regardless of his parents’ immigration status. Since then, birthright citizenship has been a cornerstone of US constitutional law.Exceptions have been extremely limited, such as children born to foreign diplomats. Trump's order seeks to broaden those exceptions dramatically.Signed in January, Trump's executive order attempts to end automatic citizenship for babies born to undocumented immigrants or temporary visa holders. He has described the policy as a “magnet for illegal immigration,” arguing that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” in the 14th Amendment justifies excluding these children from citizenship.Lower federal courts, however, repeatedly blocked the order from taking effect. “This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,” said US District Judge John Coughenour in Seattle. In Maryland, Judge Deborah Boardman wrote that “the Supreme Court has resoundingly rejected and no court in the country has ever endorsed” Trump’s view of the 14th Amendment.Despite these rulings, the Supreme Court declined to weigh in on the constitutionality of the order itself, focusing instead on the scope of the injunctions issued by the lower courts.The court’s conservative majority, led by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, ruled that federal district judges do not have the authority to block a presidential policy nationwide. “Federal courts do not exercise general oversight of the Executive Branch,” Barrett wrote.The decision sends the current challenges back to the lower courts, instructing them to narrow their injunctions to only cover plaintiffs with standing in the 22 states that sued. In the remaining 28 states — including Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas — Trump’s order could go into effect after the 30-day delay.Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the dissent, called the decision “nothing less than an open invitation for the government to bypass the constitution.”Immigrant rights groups are already adjusting their legal strategies, preparing class-action lawsuits in states like Maryland and New Hampshire. However, legal experts warn that such efforts face numerous procedural hurdles. “It’s not the case that a class action is a sort of easy, breezy way of getting around this problem,” said Suzette Malveaux, a law professor at Washington and Lee University.The immediate concern is for babies born during the transition period. In the 28 states where the order may soon apply, children born to undocumented or temporary residents may be denied citizenship, risking statelessness and potential deportation.Sotomayor urged the lower courts to “act swiftly” in adjudicating new challenges to the executive order, while Trump indicated he would move quickly on a broader slate of policies that had previously been blocked by nationwide injunctions.“This morning, the Supreme Court has delivered a monumental victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers and the rule of law,” Trump declared at the White House, flanked by Attorney General Pam Bondi. “We can now promptly proceed with numerous policies, including birthright citizenship.”",The US Supreme Court has curtailed the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions.

Education associations file amended lawsuits as international students continue to face ‘unlawful’ SEVIS termination,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/education-associations-file-amended-lawsuits-as-international-students-continue-to-face-unlawful-sevis-termination/articleshow/122124638.cms,"Representative image

Hold unlawful and set aside the policy under which the mass visa revocations were carried out, and enjoin the government from using this practice again; Order the government to stop sending false and coercive emails to international students; and Hold unlawful and set aside the policy that purports to permit the termination of SEVIS records based solely on visa revocation.





The ‘unlawful’ practices of terminating SEVIS records of international students based on visa revocations and alleged criminal histories continue, even as many records have been reactivated following lawsuits and favourable injunctions by district courts.In this backdrop, the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, a coalition of over 570 campus leaders, together with the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts (AICUM), has filed an amended lawsuit-complaint in the district court. It updates the original lawsuit-complaint submitted on April 24. These associations are challenging the unlawful mass termination of SEVIS records for F-1 students and participants in the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program.The lawsuit-complaint states that the US Department of State (DOS) has also misled affected students, and continues to do so, by sending emails falsely claiming they must leave the US immediately, even though visa status governs entry, and is inapplicable to whether an already-admitted student may remain in the country. DHS has since formalised a policy allowing SEVIS record terminations based on visa revocations, continuing this unlawful practice, it adds.Through this amended complaint, the associations are primarily asking the court to do three things:Miriam Feldblum, President and CEO of the Presidents’ Alliance, stated, “We are asking the court to prevent the government from engaging in similar actions in the future and to hold the agencies accountable for these unprecedented and damaging practices. The actions of the government have created chaos and fear. Even students whose SEVIS records have been reinstated continue to face uncertainty, unanswered questions about their education and career prospects, and ongoing vulnerability under the new policy. ”“ Colleges and universities have faced academic disruption, administrative burdens, and reputational harm, all of which compromise their ability to support international students. This instability jeopardises global talent recruitment, threatens academic freedom, and places undue strain on campus systems. Through this amended complaint, higher education is standing together to defend the rights and contributions of international students and scholars, whose presence, innovation, and ideas strengthen our communities and grow our economy,” she added.Rob McCarron, President and CEO of AICUM, stated: “Our overarching goal for this litigation is to ensure due process, and that any changes to the SEVIS program be done in full compliance with statutory and regulatory procedures. More than 80,000 international students travel to Massachusetts to pursue a higher education, adding vibrancy and innovation to our campuses and often founding startups in Massachusetts. Providing due process, proper notice, stability and clarity – to students and the institutions that serve them – is critical so that everyone fully understands what needs to be done to enroll in a college or university in Massachusetts.”A joint release points out the significant role played by international students. In the 2023-2024 academic year alone, international students contributed approximately $44 billion to the US economy and supported more than 3,78,000 jobs.Yet policies like the one challenged in this lawsuit threaten to undermine our ability to attract and retain top global talent, harming not only individual students and campuses but also long-term economic strength, innovation capacity, and national security. Through this legal action, the higher education community reaffirms its commitment to international students and scholars.","A coalition of over 570 campus leaders, together with the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts (AICUM), has filed an amended lawsuit-complaint in the district court.

Suicide car bomb attack kills 14 soldiers in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/suicide-car-bomb-attack-kills-14-soldiers-in-pakistan/articleshow/122137689.cms,"NEW DELHI: A suicide car bomb attack targeted a Pakistan army military convoy in North Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, resulting in significant casualties. At least 14 soldiers were killed and over 24 others injured in the attack, according to officials.A 'fidayeen' rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a mine-resistant vehicle belonging to the bomb disposal unit, a source said. The explosion caused widespread damage and the casualties. Security sources said over 500 kg of explosives was used in the attack to breach an ambush protected vehicle.The Hafiz Gul Bahadur (HGB) group, linked to the Afghan Taliban, has claimed responsibility for the attack, attributing it to their ongoing operation 'Khandak'.

Led by tribal leader Hafiz Gul Bahadur, the group also maintains ties with the Haqqani Network.In July last year, militants from this group had launched a pre-dawn attack on the Bannu Cantonment in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The fighters breached defences and detonated a vehicle-borne explosive, damaging cantonment infrastructure. Eight soldiers were killed and over 141 injured, including seven civilians.Saturday's VB-IED (vehicle borne-improvised explosive device) attack is the second strike on Pakistan military personnel in a week.

Heart-wrenching footage has emerged showing several people stranded on a narrow elevated strip in the middle of Pakistan's Swat River, moments before a deadly flash flood swept them away on Friday morning.The video, which went viral across social media platforms, captures their desperate cries for help as torrents of water surge around them.At least nine people from a single extended family lost their lives in the tragedy, according to Geo TV.The victims, including children, had gathered near the riverbank for breakfast while on a leisure trip from Sialkot. According to officials, the group was unaware of the sudden rise in water levels caused by heavy rains upstream.“They were taking selfies, and there wasn’t much water at the time,” said a family member, as quoted by news agency Reuters. “Suddenly, a massive wave came and swept them all away”, the member added.As per Swat deputy commissioner Shehzad Mehboob, 17 individuals were caught in the floodwaters. “We have recovered nine bodies so far and rescued four people alive. The search for the remaining four is ongoing,” he was quoted as saying by Geo News.Among the dead were women and children. Residents said it took over two hours for rescue teams to arrive at the scene.The devastating moment prompted an outpouring of grief in Sialkot, where the bodies of seven victims were received by wailing family members. “My children were calling for help in front of my eyes. We couldn’t save them,” said a distraught relative.The Pakistan Army has since joined local rescue teams, while the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has ordered a high-level inquiry to investigate the lapses. The committee has been given seven days to submit its report and recommend preventive measures.According to Reuters, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority has warned of continued heavy rains and potential flash floods across northern Pakistan until next week.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed sorrow over the tragedy, calling it a “painful reminder” of nature’s fury and urging tourists to follow safety advisories, as cited by Reuters.Heavy rains have affected parts of Pakistan since earlier this week, blocking highways and damaging homes.However, weather forecasters predict that the country will experience less rainfall compared to 2022, when climate-induced downpours caused rivers to swell and flooded one-third of Pakistan, resulting in 1,739 fatalities.","At least nine people from a single extended family lost their lives in the tragedy.

Local media reported that families had been swept away and that the flooding had damaged 56 houses along the Swat river.Pakistan's local daily newspaper Dawn reported that rescue operations were underway in several other districts with people trapped in the water.Meanwhile, the national meteorological department warned of heavy rainfall and a possibility of more flash floods until Tuesday.Pakistan is among the world's more vulnerable countries to the effect of climate change with an increasing frequency of flash floods and other climate-related events impacting its 240 million inhabitants.In May, some 24 people were killed in severe storms in Pakistan. In August 2022, a third of the country was flooded due to unprecedented monsoon rainfall with more than 33 million people affected. Scientists from across the globe have since said that the climate crisis was to blame and that rising global temperatures will only make monsoons more intense in future.Pakistan's former climate change minister Sherry Rehman took to X, saying that the nation continued to ""sleepwalk"" on climate change and the threat it posed. She pointed to regular alerts issued by the national disaster management agency and said that local authorities had failed to take them seriously.""Not only did the provincial administration fail to understand the magnitude of the crisis, I keep repeating, so did denialist tourists. This is endemic to a system that thinks that climate change can just be put on a back burner, or that crises will not multiply in scale and intensity,"" she wrote.""These are not ""natural disasters"" which absolve all actors of responsibility, local, national and global. Super monsoons and flash floods are not the norm. They have been intensifying for decades,"" she added, urging the country to ""wake up"" the to the issue.","Flash floods in Pakistan's northwest have killed 11 people, including four children.

'Iran can never get nukes': US secretary of state Marco Rubio talks tough with PM Shehbaz Sharif; Pakistan criticised strikes on Tehran's nuclear sites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/iran-can-never-get-nukes-us-secretary-of-state-marco-rubio-talks-tough-with-pm-shehbaz-sharif-pakistan-criticised-strikes-on-tehrans-nuclear-sites/articleshow/122103638.cms,"Iran Agrees To Help Pak Defuse Tensions With India After Putin 'SNUBS' Sharif | Details





US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a firm warning to Pakistan on Friday, saying that Iran must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. The statement came during a call with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif amid high tensions in the Middle East.“Secretary Rubio emphasised Iran can never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon,” said US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce.According to Bruce, both leaders “acknowledged the importance of working together to promote a durable peace between Israel and Iran and maintaining regional stability.”The message to Islamabad comes at a sensitive time, as the country has historically tried to balance its ties with both Iran and the West. Rubio’s call comes just days after a major US military strike on Iran’s underground nuclear facilities.The strikes triggered political controversy in Islamabad which had just days earlier recommended US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.The nomination, signed by deputy Prime Minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, praised Trump’s role in easing tensions with India. However, criticism erupted after Islamabad condemned the strikes as a breach of international law.JUI-F leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman demanded the nomination be withdrawn, calling Trump’s peace claims “false” and accusing him of backing Israeli aggression. Opposition figures, including Mushahid Hussain, slammed Trump for starting an “illegal war” and urged the government to revoke the nomination.PTI’s Raoof Hasan said the move brought “shame and embarrassment”, while other leaders, including Maleeha Lodhi and Afrasiab Khattak, labelled it undiplomatic and misguided.Pakistan’s foreign ministry issued a statement defending Iran’s right to self-defence under the UN Charter and warned of regional destabilisation. The backlash reflects a rapid shift from recent praise of Trump’s diplomacy.On June 22, the United States launched airstrikes targeting Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. Three critical sites — Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan — were struck using 30,000-pound GBU-57 “bunker buster” bombs, delivered by stealth B-2 bombers.On President Donald Trump’s orders, US Central Command carried out what the Pentagon described as a “deliberate and precise strike” to “severely degrade Iran’s nuclear weapons infrastructure.”“At approximately 6:40 PM EST, 2:10 am Iran time, the lead B-2 dropped GBU-57 MOP weapons on the first of several aim points at Fordow,” said General Dan Caine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.The military operation followed Israel’s “Operation Rising Lion” on June 13 and Iran’s retaliatory “Operation True Promise 3.”","US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a firm warning to Pakistan on Friday, saying that Iran must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.

A Pakistan military officer who had claimed to have captured Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman was killed in a clash with Taliban militants in the Sararogha area of South Waziristan, near the Afghan border.According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah was killed along with Lance Naik Jibran Ullah during an operation against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters.ISPR added that the Pakistan Army killed 11 TTP militants and wounded seven others in the same operation.Major Moiz’s funeral prayers were held at Chaklala Garrison in Rawalpindi, with Pakistan Army Chief General Asim Munir in attendance.“Major Syed Moiz Abbas fought bravely in the face of resistance and ultimately laid down his life in the line of duty, upholding the highest traditions of bravery, sacrifice, and patriotism,” the ISPR statement quoted Munir as saying.His body was flown to his hometown of Chakwal in Punjab, where he was laid to rest with full military honours.A resurfaced clip of his old interview with Geo TV, now circulating on social media, shows Moiz — then a captain — detailing the events surrounding the capture of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman.Varthaman had shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter in February 2019 before his MiG-21 was hit and he was captured. He was held in Pakistan for three days before being released.The TTP, also known as the Pakistan Taliban, was formed in 2007 as an umbrella group of several militant outfits. Its primary aim is to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law across Pakistan.Believed to have close ties with al-Qaeda, the TTP has been blamed for numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan, including the 2009 assault on army headquarters, attacks on military bases, and the 2008 bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad.Pakistan has described the TTP as “Fitna al-Khawarij,” referencing a historical Islamic sect known for violent rebellion.",Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah was killed along with Lance Naik Jibran Ullah during an operation against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters.

Is Pakistan building an ICBM?

FATF Report Reveals Pakistan’s Missile Programme Link to 2020 Cargo Seized in India

What is ICBM?

Change in US strategy?





Another growing concern stems from Pakistan. US intelligence agencies have assessed that Pakistan is actively developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the continental United States.According to a report by, the Pakistani military is pursuing a nuclear-armed ICBM, particularly in the wake of Operation Sindoor that took place in May.While Islamabad maintains that its nuclear program is aimed solely at deterring India—its conventionally superior neighbor—US intelligence agencies have assessed that Pakistan is actively developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the continental United States.By pursuing such long-range capabilities, Pakistan may be attempting to deter potential US actions—whether a preemptive strike on its nuclear facilities or intervention in a future conflict with India.ICBM is a long-range missile with a reach exceeding 5,500 kilometers (3,400 miles), primarily designed to deliver nuclear payloads—typically one or more thermonuclear warheads. While ICBMs are theoretically capable of carrying conventional, chemical, or biological weapons, such payloads have never been operationally deployed on these systems.Modern ICBMs often feature multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), enabling a single missile to deliver several warheads to different targets simultaneously.Countries currently known to possess operational ICBMs include the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Israel, and North Korea. Pakistan, despite being a nuclear-armed nation, remained the only such state without an ICBM capability.Advancements in missile technology, such as those seen in second- and third-generation systems like the US LGM-118 Peacekeeper, significantly increased accuracy, allowing ICBMs to hit even small, fortified targets with high reliability.ICBMs stand apart from other ballistic missile classes due to their extended range and faster speed. They surpass intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs), medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs), short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), and tactical ballistic missiles in both capability and strategic impact.US officials have pointed out, the acquisition of ICBMs capable of targeting American territory would compel Washington to categorize Pakistan as a nuclear threat. Historically, no nation with such reach has been treated as an ally by the United States. In effect, the threat of nuclear escalation now shadows every region central to US strategic interests.While each emerging nuclear adversary—Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran—poses a significant threat on its own, the prospect of coordination or strategic collusion among them presents a far more alarming challenge.","According to a report by, the Pakistani military is pursuing a nuclear-armed ICBM.

ISLAMABAD: Former Pakistan foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari issued a blunt warning on Monday to India over its unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), saying Pakistan would not hesitate to respond if its water rights were violated.Speaking during the budget session of the National Assembly, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman said, “India has two options: share water fairly, or we will take it from all six rivers.” He described India’s move to suspend the 1960 treaty after the April 23 terrorist attack in Pahalgam as both illegal and provocative.The remarks came nearly two months after India suspended the IWT. New Delhi has blamed Pakistan-based militants for the assault, triggering fresh tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours.Bilawal argued there is no clause allowing unilateral withdrawal. “India’s claim that the treaty is in abeyance has no legal basis.

But our diplomacy prevailed,” he claimed.He questioned the logic of what he called “PM Modi’s new abnormal”, where any terror incident is met with immediate threats against Pakistan. “We suffer terrorist attacks far more frequently than India — many traced to Indian funding or involvement. Should we adopt the same policy of automatic retaliation? That would mean surrendering our future to the agenda of terrorists,” he said.Bilawal insisted that peace in South Asia was not possible without dialogue and mutual trust. “We are not only fighting for Pakistan’s future, we are fighting for regional stability, for the people of both countries,” he said.The IWT, one of the few surviving agreements between India and Pakistan, allocates water from six rivers in the Indus basin.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Monday extended its airspace ban on Indian aircraft for another month, citing ongoing tensions between the two countries following the Pahalgam terrorist attack and subsequent military operations.The ban, originally imposed on April 23, was first extended on May 23 after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7. The Indian military action targeted and reportedly dismantled several terror camps in Pakistan-administered territory, triggering four days of intense cross-border clashes that concluded with a ceasefire on May 10.A fresh Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) issued by the Pakistan Airports Authority now extends the restriction from June 23 to July 24. The notice states, “Pakistan airspace not available for Indian registered aircraft and aircraft operated/owned or leased by Indian airlines/operators including military flights.”The situation remains tense despite the end of direct hostilities. Diplomatic channels have yet to yield any breakthroughs in repairing the fractured bilateral relationship. Indian and Pakistani officials have not resumed formal dialogue since the flare-up.The initial ban followed the Pahalgam terrorist attack, which killed at least 26 people, further deepening mistrust and heightening military alertness on both sides.","The ban, originally imposed on April 23, was first extended on May 23 after India launched Operation Sindoor.

Pakistan Condemns U.S. Strikes On Iran A Day After Nobel Peace Prize Endorsement For Donald Trump





The Pakistani government and its powerful military establishment are facing a wave of public backlash after formally recommending US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, a move that drew widespread condemnation following the US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities.Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar sent a letter to the Nobel Committee in Norway, crediting Trump’s “decisive diplomatic intervention” during the recent India-Pakistan standoff. But the recommendation triggered a storm on social media after Trump ordered attacks on Iran’s Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear sites, an operation he called a “historic moment” and one that escalated regional tensions.On X (formerly Twitter), users accused the Pakistani government of appeasing its “master.” One user mocked, “Pakistanis, beware! After the attack on Iran, PM Shehbaz might not only award Trump the Nobel Peace Prize, but also Tamgha-e-Jurat, Tamgha-e-Shujaat, Tamgha-e-Basalat, Tamgha-e-Imtiaz, and perhaps even the Nishan-e-Haider!”Veteran journalist Ameer Abbas recalled that PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique had once likened Trump to Genghis Khan and Hitler.“Now, the same government nominates him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Who is orchestrating such shameful and cowardly decisions?” he asked.Raheeq Abbasi, political analyst and columnist, noted the irony, “Trump, who vetoed the Gaza ceasefire 8 times and is protested across the West for war crimes, is being nominated for a Nobel by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Is there no sense of honour left?”The backlash cut across ideological lines. Some users accused the military establishment of calling the shots. “The uncrowned kings are ready to sell out the nation whenever they please,” wrote Major (R) Asim.Another user, Jarjees Ahmad, called out the “supreme level of hypocrisy”, “We’re nominating someone involved in the massacre of Palestinians while claiming to stand with Iran.”Aamir Khan added, “What greater betrayal could there be to Muslims, our country, and the people of Pakistan?”The Pakistani government has yet to respond officially to the criticism.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar sent a letter to the Nobel Committee in Norway, crediting Trump’s “decisive diplomatic intervention” during the recent India-Pakistan standoff.

NEW DELHI: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) condemned the alleged abduction and forced religious conversion of four Hindu siblings in Pakistan's Sindh province, calling it a “horrible story” and denouncing the continued rise in anti-Hindu violence in the region. The incident, where three sisters and their cousin were allegedly coerced into converting to Islam by their teachers, has reignited concerns over minority rights in Pakistan.“It is a horrible story,” said VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal. “Conversion and atrocities are increasing. International bodies like the UNHRC, the UNO, and other concerned agencies remain silent when Hindus face violence at the hands of Islamic jihadis. Pakistan must honour the Nehru-Liaquat Pact to safeguard minorities and take immediate action. The religion that claims to preach peace is being exposed by such incidents, not only in Pakistan but also in Bangladesh. The world knows that the land now called Bangladesh was once the sacred land of Maa Durga. Today, not only are chants to the goddess banned, but devotees are being attacked and idols desecrated. This must stop.”The VHP’s remarks come in the wake of alarming reports from Shahdadpur, Sindh, where four Hindu siblings, two of them minors, were allegedly abducted and converted by their teachers. Despite protests by families and Hindu community leaders, local media portrayed the conversions as voluntary. Pakistani courts ruled that the minors be returned to their families, while the two adult girls, both medical students, were sent to a safe house. The accused, who are teachers, were granted bail after kidnapping charges were dropped, fuelling further outrage.In a separate incident, a Durga temple in Bangladesh was reportedly demolished and devotees assaulted during recent religious gatherings. Hindu organisations have linked this to an increasing pattern of targeted violence and state indifference in both Pakistan and Bangladesh. The VHP warned that Bangladesh is moving in the direction of Pakistan and Afghanistan in terms of intolerance, describing the trend as “serious and condemnable. ”Bansal added that while the Government of India has taken diplomatic steps, the lack of serious international response remains troubling. He also criticised sections of India’s opposition and Muslim organisations for remaining silent on such incidents, questioning their “credibility and partiality against Hindus.”","The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) condemned the alleged abduction and forced religious conversion of four Hindu siblings in Pakistan's Sindh province.

Footage captured the dramatic scene as the man was dragged off the aircraft, kicking and shouting, while airline staff tried to manage the situation, reported New York Post.The passenger allegedly complained about the lack of space in his window seat on a Thai Lion Air flight departing from Bangkok on Wednesday. He asked to be moved to an emergency exit seat after noticing it offered more legroom, but threw a major tantrum when flight attendants denied his request.The situation escalated to the point where authorities had to be called in to remove the disruptive passenger from the Boeing 737 aircraft.“At first, I thought we couldn’t take off because the man had fallen ill,” the passenger who filmed the video recalled, according to the New York Post. “It turned out he just thought the economy seat was too crowded and insisted on moving to the emergency exit.”Footage shows Thai police yanking the stubborn passenger, dressed in a bright orange Garfield shirt, out of his seat. In protest, he then lay down in the aisle, blocking it and prompting frustration from other passengers.“He is so f–king selfish,” shouted an irritated passenger, while another yelled at him to “get out of the way.”Eventually, police were able to carry the uncooperative passenger off the plane by his arms and legs.His disruptive behavior caused the flight to be delayed by a full hour before it finally took off from Don Mueang International Airport.","British tourist was forcibly removed from a plane in Thailand after reportedly insisting on an emergency exit seat to accommodate his larger frame.

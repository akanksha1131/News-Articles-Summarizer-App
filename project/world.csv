'We reject White House’s slander': Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum orders retaliatory tariffs against US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/mexico-president-claudia-sheinbaum-orders-retaliatory-tariffs-against-us-donald-trump/articleshow/117847850.cms,"President Claudia Sheinbaum

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced on Sunday that she had directed her economy minister to introduce tariff and non-tariff measures in response to new US tariffs on Mexican goods.This comes after US President Donald Trump signed an order imposing tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China. The decision has raised concerns about inflation and business disruptions across North America.Both Mexico and Canada have indicated they will respond with countermeasures.Sheinbaum stated in a post on X that Mexico aims for cooperation and dialogue rather than conflict with the US government. Mexico president also called Trump's claim of cartel alliance 'slander'.""We categorically reject the White House’s slander that the Mexican government has alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any intention of meddling in our territory,” Sheinbaum wrote.She also addressed fentanyl trafficking , a key issue in US-Mexico relations.“If the United States government and its agencies wanted to address the serious fentanyl consumption in their country, they could fight the sale of drugs on the streets of their major cities, which they don’t do and the laundering of money that this illegal activity generates that has done so much harm to its population,” she said.Sheinbaum highlighted her government’s efforts since she took office in October, including the seizure of 20 million doses of fentanyl and the detention of over 10,000 individuals linked to drug trafficking.The tariffs have created uncertainty in trade relations between the US, Mexico, and Canada, the three largest economies in North America.","Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced on Sunday that she had directed her economy minister to introduce tariff and non-tariff measures in response to new US tariffs on Mexican goods.

It's the 'manosphere': 'Boys-will be-boys' sensibility takes over planet Earth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/its-the-manosphere-boys-will-be-boys-sensibility-takes-over-planet-earth/articleshow/117847331.cms,"Mark Zuckerberg

Last month, Mark Zuckerberg sat down with Joe Rogan , the king of the podcasters, and delivered a bold message: American business culture needed to regrow its manhood. ""The corporate world is pretty culturally neutered,"" said Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta. ""A culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits . Masculine energy , I think, is good.""In one sense, this was an astonishing statement.Zuckerberg - who empowered Sheryl Sandberg, the country's foremost advocate of corporate feminism, to run the day-to-day operations of his company for more than a decade - was proclaiming that his world had overcorrected toward the female. But it was also a long time coming. For years, a masculinist current in American culture and politics has been rising, largely in digital spaces outside traditional media and entertainment. Now, it has flooded the banks of the mainstream.Zuckerberg offered his paean to the male virtues just days before Donald Trump returned to the White House. Since the election, many political observers have been grasping for language to talk about the resurgent masculine formation. "" Manosphere "" has become the most common shorthand. A term with hazy origins, it has come to refer to a wide range of media content aimed at men. At one end, it incorporates explicitly misogynistic influencers like Andrew Tate, who has said that women shouldn't vote and that they bear responsibility for their own sexual assault. At the other, there is the YouTube channel of the self-improvement influencer and neuroscientist Andrew Huberman, who doles out advice on sleep hygiene.And it is more than just an array of websites, podcasts, social networks, message boards, group chats. The brash, boys-will-be-boys sensibility can now be felt in the halls of power too. Pete Hegseth, the newly sworn-in defence secretary, was asked how many push-ups he can do during his confirmation hearing . Not long ago, the term ""manosphere"" referred only to the most extreme fringe of online communities. Clearly, no longer. At Trump's inauguration, guests included the mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor; the UFC chief executive Dana White; the boxer and influencer Jake Paul and his brother Logan, a wrestler and influencer. A group of macho men gathered to witness the ascent of their leader: This is a scene that has been repeated endlessly in the span of recorded human history, sung in songs, celebrated in paintings and recorded in books. One might say, just a bit facetiously, that the real ""manosphere,"" strictly speaking, is Planet Earth.","For years, a masculinist current in American culture and politics has been rising, largely in digital spaces outside traditional media and entertainment.

(AP)

More than 90% of the country's 313 air traffic control facilities operate below the Federal Aviation Administration's recommended staffing levels, according to an analysis of staffing data from the union representing controllers obtained by The New York Times.As of earlier this month, 285 facilities -- which include traffic control towers and other locations -- were below staffing thresholds set by the FAA and the union.At 73 of those facilities, staffing is so low that at least a quarter of the workforce is missing.The U.S. air travel system remains among the safest in the world. But persistent staff shortages and a underinvestment in safety systems have led to an alarming number of close calls between aircraft .The shortage is particularly severe in the New York region, where two crucial facilities on Long Island are operating with nearly 40% of the positions unfilled. These facilities direct air traffic for some of the busiest airports in the United States, including Newark, JFK and LaGuardia, which handled a combined 1.2 million flights in the last year, according to data from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.The FAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Efforts already underway to hire and train new controllers are expected to fall short of staffing demands, according to FAA projections. Nearly three-quarters of facilities will still remain below recommended staffing levels after a long training process.Improving the ranks may not happen quickly. It can take over four years to train a new air traffic controller at a certain facilities. At Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, the site of the crash this week, training takes nearly 16 months, the data shows.","As of earlier this month, 285 facilities were below staffing thresholds set by the FAA and the union.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has appointed Maj Gen Eyal Zamir as the next chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), replacing Lt Gen Herzi Halevi , who is set to step down in March.The announcement was made by Netanyahu's office on Saturday, confirming that Zamir will officially assume the role on March 6.Zamir, currently serving as the director general of Israel’s defense ministry, was among the top candidates considered for the position.Along with him, defense minister Israel Katz had shortlisted Maj Gen Amir Baram, the current IDF deputy chief of staff, and Maj Gen Tamir Yadai for the role, according to The Times of Israel.Halevi announced his resignation last month, taking responsibility for the security failures that led to Hamas ’ October 7, 2023, attack, widely regarded as the most severe security breach in Israel’s history.As per The Times of Israel, Halevi had initially intended to step down only after a ceasefire agreement was reached between Israel and Hamas.Following the announcement, Halevi issued a statement congratulating Zamir and assuring a smooth handover of command. ""I have known Eyal for many years, and I am confident that he will lead the IDF forward in the face of the challenges ahead,"" Halevi stated, as quoted by ANI. He also emphasized that the transition process over the coming weeks would be ""professional and high-quality.""Zamir, a seasoned military leader, previously served as the deputy chief of staff of the IDF and has held various command positions within Israel’s armed forces. His appointment comes at a critical time when Israel is dealing with complex security threats, including ongoing hostilities with Hamas in Gaza and heightened tensions with Hezbollah in Lebanon.Meanwhile, the Gaza ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas remains a key issue in Israel’s security landscape. Three Israeli hostages—Yarden Bibas, Ofer Kalderon, and Keith Siegel—were released on Saturday as part of the first phase of the truce. Israeli President Isaac Herzog expressed relief at their return but voiced concerns about the remaining captives.According to AP, the first phase of the ceasefire is expected to last six weeks, with a total of 33 Israeli hostages being freed in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. The agreement also includes the reopening of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, allowing medical evacuations for wounded Palestinians.Israeli and Hamas representatives are scheduled to begin negotiations on the second phase of the ceasefire in Washington on Monday, as confirmed by Netanyahu’s office.The discussions will focus on securing the release of remaining hostages and potentially extending the truce indefinitely. However, if no agreement is reached, the conflict could resume in early March.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has appointed Maj Gen Eyal Zamir as the next chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces.

Poll What's Your Opinion on the New Tariffs Imposed on Canada, Mexico, and China? They Could Lead to Significant Economic Disruptions They Are Necessary to Protect American Interests

US President Donald Trump has announced sweeping tariffs on three of the United States’ largest trading partners, Canada, Mexico, and China, citing an ""extraordinary threat"" from ""illegal aliens"" and drug trafficking.The White House confirmed that imports from Canada and Mexico will face a 25% tariff, with a lower 10% levy on Canadian energy resources.Additionally, an extra 10% duty will be imposed on Chinese goods, which already face various trade restrictions.Trump made the announcement on his account on social media platform Truth Social and wrote, ""Today, I have implemented a 25% Tariff on Imports from Mexico and Canada (10% on Canadian Energy), and a 10% additional Tariff on China. This was done through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl. We need to protect Americans, and it is my duty as President to ensure the safety of all. I made a promise on my Campaign to stop the flood of illegal aliens and drugs from pouring across our Borders, and Americans overwhelmingly voted in favor of it.""The White House stated that these tariffs are intended to hold all three nations ""accountable"" for halting illegal migration and curbing the flow of deadly drugs like fentanyl.According to The New York Times, the tariffs are set to take effect on Tuesday, with no exemption process for businesses. Notably, the executive orders contain a retaliation clause that will automatically increase US tariffs if any of the affected nations impose countermeasures.The tariffs have sparked strong reactions from US allies and trade experts.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has vowed a ""purposeful, forceful"" response, while Ontario premier Doug Ford warned that ""the impact of these tariffs will be felt almost immediately,"" potentially leading to job losses and economic slowdowns.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has assured the public that Mexico is ""prepared for any scenario"" and has met with business leaders to discuss possible responses.Industry analysts predict significant disruptions to supply chains, particularly in the automotive, energy, and food industries. As per S&P Global Mobility, about 70% of light vehicles manufactured in Canada and Mexico are destined for the US, meaning tariffs will likely increase production costs, potentially leading to higher prices for American consumers. Additionally, experts warn that tariffs on Canadian oil could lead to higher energy costs, particularly in the US Midwest, where refineries process large amounts of Canadian crude.Economists have expressed concerns that these tariffs could fuel inflation.Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY, predicts the tariffs will cause inflation to rise by 0.7 percentage points in the first quarter of the year before stabilising. The New York Times reports that analysts estimate American households could see an annual cost increase of up to $3,342 due to the tariffs.Despite these warnings, Trump defended his decision, writing on social media, ""We need to protect Americans, and it is my duty as President to ensure the safety of all."" His administration argues that tariffs will strengthen American industries and reduce dependence on foreign manufacturing.","US President Donald Trump has announced sweeping tariffs on three of the United States' largest trading partners, Canada, Mexico, and China.

Justin Trudeau's 'outlandish' remarks



Amid reports that Donald Trump may delay the proposed tariff on Canada and Mexico and may defer it to March 1, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that the tariffs are coming tomorrow, February 1, as announced earlier. ""The tariffs are incoming tomorrow on Canada and Mexico. Both have allowed an invasion of fentanyl and illegal criminals that are killing American citizens,"" Leavitt said.Trump announced 25 per cent tariffs on Mexico and Canada as well as a 10 per cent duty on China and they were scheduled to start from the weekend. However, the White House did not provide details of how these levies will be meted out.The proposed tariffs could hike the price of a gallon of gasoline for some drivers by as much as 70 cents and could also affect grocery bills, ABC News reported citing experts. Tariffs of this magnitude would likely increase prices paid by US shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers, experts said. The policy could raise prices for an array of products ranging from tomatoes to tequila to auto parts, the report said.GasTomatoes, avocadoesCars and auto partsTrump’s proposed tariffs could add $272 billion a year to tax burdens, according to Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay Cross-Border Solutions. The Peterson Institute has estimated Trump’s proposed tariffs would cost the typical US household over $2,600 a year, CNN reported.A day before the tariffs are implemented, Justin Trudeau said Canada is also ready with counter-tariffs which he said is a ""purposeful, forceful but reasonable and immediate response"". Trudeau said his government was already looking into the concerns that Trump expressed.Leavitt reacted to Trudeau's comments and said it would be wise for Trudeau to talk to Trump directly before making such ""outlandish comments"" to the media.""The tariffs are incoming tomorrow on Canada. The reason for that is because both Canada and Mexico have allowed an unprecedented invasion of illegal fentanyl that is killing American citizens and also illegal immigrants into our country...

Who is Jo Ellis?



'Blackhawk took a bizarre flight path'



After President Donald Trump blamed the DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) hiring policies of the Obama and Biden governments for the tragic mid-air collision between a Blackhawk and an American Airlines plane and an army helicopter, rumors spread that one of the pilots of the helicopter was a transgender person -- Jo Ellis. This was to connect Donald Trump's reasoning with the mishap -- until Jo Ellis issued a video claiming that she is indeed a Blackhawk pilot, but is alive and was not flying the ill-fated helicopter.""Interesting morning. This is Jo Ellis. I am a Blackhawk pilot with the Virginia Army National Guard. I understand some people have associated me with the crash in DC and that is false. It is insulting to the families to try to tie this to some kind of political agenda, They don't deserve that. I don't deserve this. And I hope you all know that I am alive and well and this should be sufficient for you all to end all the rumors,"" she said adding a statement that the Department of Defense handles casualty notifications and confirmed that no Virginia National Guard personnel were involved in the Black Hawk collision.Jo Ellis' social media posts were scanned after she was mistakenly identified as one of the pilots. Keen-eyed social media users found out that Ellis wrote many anti-Trump statements. ""Just ONE DAY before piloting the Blackhawk that collided mid-air with a passenger jet over DC, transgender military pilot Joe Ellis appeared on the Michael Smerconish podcast. In the interview, Ellis expressed anger over Trump’s ban on trans service members, calling it a direct threat to a career in the military,"" one social media post claimed asking whether the DC crash was ""another trans terrorist attack"" and whether Ellis crashed into the jet on purpose.""So now we’re learning that the Pilot/Co-Pilot ‘female’ who was on the Blackhawk is actually a transgender who wrote a long letter ONE DAY PRIOR about “Gender dysphoria” and depression,"" another post read.Ellis is a Chief Warrant Officer and Black Hawk helicopter pilot who has served in the Virginia National Guard for 15 years, reports said. She served in combat zones in Iraq, along with other operations overseas. She serves in the military part-time, and also works as an IT engineer in the private sector.Ellis began her gender transitioning in 2023 while serving in the Army and claimed that everyone in her unit was very supportive.Though the investigation is on, prima facie the army helicopter is being blamed for taking a bizarre flight path deviating from its scheduled route and also altitude. President Donald Trump this morning took to Truth Social claiming that the Blackhawk was flying higher than its 200-ft limit. A New York Times report said the helicopter pilot even confirmed seeing the American Airlines plane and the air traffic controller asked the pilot to go behind the plane but it did not follow that.","Jo Ellis, a Blackhawk pilot, issued a statement that she was not there in the army helicopter that crashed in DC.

Bilal Shabbir, Kalat’s deputy commissioner, said the attacks took place in Pidrang, Khazeni and Mangochar Bazaar areas of the town, where militants started conducting snap checks of passenger vehicles passing through town.In the first incident, Shabbir said a van carrying 17 soldiers from Panjgur to Quetta came under attack near the mountainous area of Khazeni, where armed men battled the security forces. He said one soldier of the Frontier Corps (FC), a paramilitary force, was separately killed in clashes with the militants.“The bodies of the slain soldiers were shifted to Quetta,” Shabbir said. “We don’t know how many attackers were killed because they took the bodies of their fighters into the mountains in the dark.”He said three FC personnel were also injured in the attack, adding that militants set a private bank on fire in Mangochar Bazaar.Separatist groups like BLA have long been at the forefront of a low-level insurgency in Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province by area and rich in mineral resources. Separatists claim that Islamabad is abusing the province’s natural wealth while ignoring the local population.In recent months, the BLA has become a major security threat, carrying out large-scale attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, targeting Chinese nationals and interests engaged in investment projects, security forces, and ethnic Punjabis they perceive as outsiders in Balochistan.",At least 18 soldiers killed and five injured in Balochistan attacks.

Social media users including Donald Trump Jr claimed that it was done by the 'White House digital team'.Social media fake claims tried to pass the screenshot as of the White House, but the screenshot was from Kamala Harris' own website for her presidential election. One social media user said it was a page for the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz campaign which does not exist now. However, it's not clear whether any section of the site is leading to the 404 page or whether it was led by typing '404' in the URL.All eyes are on the former vice president for her next move as she has not announced anything. According to insiders, she never had a plan B as she was certain that she would win the election and is now thinking about her future moves. This is the first time Harris is not in a public role since 2004. She and her husband Doug Emhoff moved to Los Angeles while Emhoff has also taken up a new job as a partner of the legal firm Wilkie Farr &Gallagher LLP.As far as politics is concerned, Kamala Harris has two options: running for California Governor in 2026 and preparing to run again as the president in 2028.

However, energy imports from Canada—including oil, natural gas, and electricity—would be subject to a reduced 10% tariff.""Today, I have implemented a 25% Tariff on Imports from Mexico and Canada (10% on Canadian Energy), and a 10% additional Tariff on China. This was done through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl.

PALM BEACH: President Donald Trump has fired the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , Rohit Chopra , in the latest purge of a Biden administration holdover .Chopra was one of the more important regulators from the previous Democratic administration who was still on the job since Trump took office on Jan. 20.During Trump's first term, the Republican had picked Chopra as a Democrat member of the Federal Trade Commission.Chopra was notified of his firing in an email from the White House, according to a person familiar with the notice who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.Chopra is an ally of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of Trump's favorite targets, and the Massachusetts Democrat said in a statement that the agency under Chopra held ""Wall Street accountable for cheating hard-working families"" and prevented ""the de-banking of Americans across the country, including consumers locked out of the financial system due to overdraft fees, religious organizations, and conservatives.""Under the law, Chopra was to serve a five-year term, which meant he could have stayed on as the CFPB director.

The Urge to Purge: Trump and Musk 'drain the swamp',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-urge-to-purge-trump-and-musk-drain-the-swamp/articleshow/117834365.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington

: A massive purge, the likes of which America has never seen and is often attributed to communist and dictatorial regimes abroad, is underway in Washington DC.Thousands of government officials, including career civil servants who have served for decades across administrations, are being cashiered and marched out of their offices.When they are not resigning, they are being fired and escorted from their offices after their security clearances and access to systems are withdrawn.In some cases, whole agencies -- such as USAID, the foreign aid arm of the US government -- are being shuttered down. Other government department websites are being wiped out. It's a bloodbath without blood -- for now.Depending on one's viewpoint, the perpetrators of the purge, directed by President Trump and executed mainly by Elon Musk, are being seen as revolutionaries freeing Washington DC from the stranglehold of the old order/establishment or bandits ransacking the capital.The face-off played out in a surreal manner on Friday when Musk literally asked for the keys to the treasury to see how government money was being spent, and an unelected bureaucrat who was the gatekeeper resigned rather than submit to Musk, who is also unelected but works under the directive of the President.David Lebryk, the highest ranking official in the Treasury department, announced his retirement on Friday, reportedly after a dispute with Musk’s aides over access to the payment system the U.S. government uses to disburse trillions of dollars every year. Lebryk, a respected bureaucrat with 35 years in the government, held the keys to the Treasury’s Department's payment systems that disburses more than $6 trillion annually to households and businesses, including Social Security and Medicare benefits, salaries for federal personnel, payments to government contractors and grant recipients, and tax refunds.Musk defended his incursion into the government and the way it spent money, which has long been the domain of Congress and its elected lawmakers, saying, ""This is the critical battle to restore power to the PEOPLE from the massive unelected bureaucracy!""""If your elected representatives cannot overcome the bureaucrats who control government, then you live in a BUREAUcracy, not a DEMOcracy!"" he wrote on X. Republican lawmakers were largely silent over their powers being usurped while Democratic lawmakers were apoplectic but seemingly powerless for now.Elsewhere, there is large scale ongoing purge at the Justice Department and FBI, where scores, perhaps hundreds of officials and investigators, associated with probes into Trump, were summarily sacked and escorted out of their offices. David Sundberg, the head of the FBI’s Washington Field Office, and a career FBI agent with more than two decades in the Bureau, was among those fired.In some agencies, officials who resisted termination were physically evicted from their offices. Phyllis Fong, a 22-year old government veteran who was inspector general of the US Department of Agriculture, was among those who was literally turfed out of office on Thursday.President Trump essayed what was virtually a ""good riddance"" to bureaucrats and officials in what he has long seen as a entrenched welfare establishment that has become a ""Deep State"" protecting vested interests.""We'd love to have them leave. We wanna clean it out. People have been trying to reduce the federal government now for 40 years, 45 years, and they haven't been able to do it. And this is a way of doing it very nicely. It's sort of a buyout too.” he said in remarks defending his administration seeking pre-emptive resignations from government employees.","Thousands of government officials, including career civil servants who have served for decades across administrations, are being cashiered and marched out of their offices.

US federal agencies removed references to gender and diversity from websites on Friday, complying with a directive from the office of personnel management (OPM) linked to President Donald Trump's executive orders.Instead, many of the sites showed “page not found”, while some displayed the message “access denied”.The OPM memo sent on Wednesday ordered agencies to eliminate “gender ideology” from online content, contracts, and communications by 5 pm Friday.It also required the removal of terms like “gender” from government forms and the termination of grants and programs related to the issue.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) took down multiple health pages, including guidance on contraception, a fact sheet about HIV and transgender people, and surveys showing higher rates of depression and bullying among transgender students.The Infectious Diseases Society of America criticized the move, stating that access to such health information is “critical to efforts to end the HIV epidemic.”The Bureau of Prisons retitled its ""Inmate Gender"" webpage to ""Inmate Sex,"" removing data on transgender inmates.The State Department removed the “X” gender marker option from passport applications, though the online application form was temporarily unavailable, citing maintenance. Additionally, all State Department employees were ordered to strip gender pronouns from email signatures, as per AP.USA Today reported that the Census Bureau's entire website went offline for an hour on Friday evening, with some pages remaining inaccessible.The National Park Service removed its page on the Stonewall National Monument, a landmark in LGBTQ history, while the Department of Education erased its LGBTQ student resource page. Environmental Protection Agency pages on climate change and environmental justice also vanished from the main navigation bar.Asked about the website removals, Trump responded, “I don’t know. That doesn’t sound like a bad idea to me,” reiterating his commitment to eliminating diversity and inclusion initiatives.The directive follows Trump's executive order defining sex strictly as male or female on official documents and policies.US defense secretary Pete Hegseth also instructed the military to halt recognition of identity-based events, stating they “erode camaraderie and threaten mission execution,” AP reported.Faith Williams, policy director at the project on government oversight, called the removals “a major blow to government transparency ,” as per USA Today. She added that while website updates are common under new administrations, the scope of these removals is unprecedented.","US federal agencies removed references to gender and diversity from websites on Friday, complying with a directive from the office of personnel management (OPM) linked to President Donald Trump's executive orders.

California firefighters have finally gained full control over the devastating Eaton and Palisades wildfires, marking an end to weeks of destruction. State fire officials confirmed on Friday night that both fires, which killed at least 29 people and displaced thousands, are now 100% contained, said Cal Fire, the state's firefighting agency.The Palisades fire tore through over 23,000 acres, destroying more than 6,800 structures, mainly in Pacific Palisades and Malibu.The Eaton fire burned more than 14,000 acres and left over 9,400 buildings in ruins in the Altadena area of Los Angeles County. At least 14 people are still unaccounted for—12 from the Eaton fire and two from the Palisades fire, according to a The New York Times report.Beyond the loss of homes and lives, recovery will be expensive and time-consuming. Experts estimate rebuilding costs could reach hundreds of billions of dollars. The Environmental Protection Agency has started clearing hazardous debris, but the full cleanup will take months.Health concerns also linger. The fires left behind days of toxic smoke, which could have long-term effects on residents. Many have reported breathing problems, and doctors warn of potential complications in the future.Firefighters had struggled to control the blazes for weeks, especially with strong Santa Ana winds spreading the flames. It wasn’t until light rain fell last weekend that they were able to make real progress. While the rain helped, it also triggered minor mudslides in burn areas.Officials are now shifting focus to rebuilding and future preparedness. Kathryn Barger, chair of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, praised firefighters and emergency personnel for their efforts. She stressed the need for better disaster readiness, saying, “The Eaton fire has taught us all that we must remain vigilant and prepare for the unimaginable,” quoted The New York Times.","Eaton and Palisades fires are now 100% contained.

What can the 'black box' tell us about plane crashes?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-can-the-black-box-tell-us-about-plane-crashes/articleshow/117824425.cms,"(AP photo)

What are black boxes?



What does the cockpit voice recorder do?



What are the origins of the black box?



Why the name 'black box'?



It's one of the most important pieces of forensic evidence following a plane crash: The so-called "" black box .""There are actually two of these remarkably sturdy devices: the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder . And they're typically orange, not black.Federal investigators on Friday recovered the black boxes from the passenger jet that crashed in the Potomac River just outside Washington on Wednesday, while authorities were still searching for similar devices in the military helicopter that also went down.One recovered flight data recorder was in good condition and its information is expected to be downloaded shortly. Water had gotten inside the cockpit voice recorder, which will make downloading the data more difficult. The collision killed 67 people in the deadliest US aviation disaster since 2001.Here is an explanation of what black boxes are and what they can do:The cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder are tools that help investigators reconstruct the events that lead up to a plane crash.They're orange in color to make them easier to find in wreckage, sometimes at great ocean depths. They're usually installed a plane's tail section, which is considered the most survivable part of the aircraft, according to the National Transportation Safety Board's website.They're also equipped with beacons that activate when immersed in water and can transmit from depths of 14,000 feet (4,267 meters). While the battery that powers the beacon will run down after about one month, there's no definitive shelf-life for the data itself, NTSB investigators told The Associated Press in 2014.For example, black boxes of an Air France flight that crashed in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009 were found two years later from a depth of more than 10,000 feet, and technicians were able to recover most of the information.If a black box has been submerged in seawater, technicians will keep them submerged in fresh water to wash away the corrosive salt. If water seeps in, the devices must be carefully dried for hours or even days using a vacuum oven to prevent memory chips from cracking.The electronics and memory are checked, and any necessary repairs made. Chips are scrutinized under a microscope.The cockpit voice recorder collects radio transmissions and sounds such as the pilot's voices and engine noises, according to the NTSB's website.Depending on what happened, investigators may pay close attention to the engine noise, stall warnings and other clicks and pops, the NTSB said. And from those sounds, investigators can often determine engine speed and the failure of some systems.Investigators are also listening to conversations between the pilots and crew and communications with air traffic control. Experts make a meticulous transcript of the voice recording, which can take up to a week.What does the flight data recorder do? The flight data recorder monitors a plane's altitude, airspeed and heading, according to the NTSB. Those factors are among at least 88 parameters that newly built planes must monitor.Some can collect the status of more than 1,000 other characteristics, from a wing's flposition to the smoke alarms. The NTSB said it can generate a computer animated video reconstruction of the flight from the information collected.NTBS investigators told the AP in 2014 that a flight data recorder carries 25 hours of information, including prior flights within that time span, which can sometimes provide hints about the cause of a mechanical failure on a later flight. An initial assessment of the data is provided to investigators within 24 hours, but analysis will continue for weeks more.At least two people have been credited with creating devices that record what happens on an airplane.One is French aviation engineer Francois Hussenot. In the 1930s, he found a way to record a plane's speed, altitude and other parameters onto photographic film, according to the website for European plane-maker Airbus.In the 1950s, Australian scientist David Warren came up with the idea for the cockpit voice recorder, according to his 2010 AP obituary.Warren had been investigating the crash of the world's first commercial jet airliner, the Comet, in 1953, and thought it would be helpful for airline accident investigators to have a recording of voices in the cockpit, the Australian Department of Defence said in a statement after his death.Warren designed and constructed a prototype in 1956. But it took several years before officials understood just how valuable the device could be and began installing them in commercial airlines worldwide. Warren's father had been killed in a plane crash in Australia in 1934.Some have suggested that it stems from Hussenot's device because it used film and ""ran continuously in a light-tight box, hence the name 'black box,'"" according to Airbus, which noted that orange was the box's chosen color from the beginning to make it easy to find.Other theories include the boxes turning black when they get charred in a crash, the Smithsonian Magazine wrote in 2019.""The truth is much more mundane,"" the magazine wrote. ""In the post-World War II field of electronic circuitry, black box became the ubiquitous term for a self-contained electronic device whose input and output were more defining than its internal operations.""The media continues to use the term, the magazine wrote, ""because of the sense of mystery it conveys in the aftermath of an air disaster.""","The cockpit voice recorder collects radio transmissions and sounds such as the pilot's voices and engine noises. The flight data recorder monitors a plane's altitude, airspeed and heading, according to the NTSB. They're orange in color to make them easier to find in wreckage, sometimes at great ocean depths.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117824519,imgsize-934005,width-400,resizemode-4/117824519.jpg"

She pointed out the influence of the 'War Room' audience, describing it as ""the most powerful in media history,"" and referencing political figures like Kevin McCarthy and Anthony Fauci to emphasize the impact of her reporting.Winters continued: ""It’s very clear that your misinformation attacks FAILED so now you’re pivoting by trying to depict me as some dumb, vapid bimbo. Good luck with that. I know the left loves transgenderism, obesity, and ugly people, but you should pick someone else to attack.""Her unfiltered remarks have sparked further controversy, with critics accusing her of using inflammatory language.

Her appointment garnered attention due to her choice of attire during her initial days in the role, which some critics labeled as unprofessional. Winters addressed the criticism by defending her credibility and suggesting that the focus on her appearance was an attempt to undermine her work as a journalist.Beyond her journalism career, Winters maintains an active presence on social media platforms, where she shares insights into her professional endeavors and personal interests.","Natalie Winters, 23, is an American journalist and producer.

Did Donald Trump 'ban' Black History Month? Here's the truth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-donald-trump-ban-black-history-month-heres-the-truth/articleshow/117750301.cms,"Trump celebrates Black History Month

Social media erupted with claims that President Donald J. Trump had banned Black History Month following a series of viral posts. Users across platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and TikTok shared posts expressing outrage and confusion, with some claiming that Trump had eliminated not only Black History Month but also other ""special observances."" Posts from high-profile accounts amplified the narrative, fueling widespread speculation and debate.Comments ranged from disbelief to anger, with many questioning the implications for cultural and historical recognition in the United States. However, these claims are inaccurate. In fact, Trump officially proclaimed February 2025 as National Black History Month, honoring the contributions of Black Americans throughout the nation's history.In his proclamation, Trump emphasized the pivotal role Black leaders have played in shaping the cultural and political landscape of the United States. ""Today, I am very honored to recognize February 2025 as National Black History Month,"" the president stated. He highlighted influential figures such as Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Thomas Sowell, and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, acknowledging their lasting impact on America's commitment to equality under the law. Trump also recognized sports icon Tiger Woods for his groundbreaking achievements in the world of athletics.Reflecting on the nation's progress, Trump expressed gratitude to Black Americans for their historical and ongoing contributions. ""This National Black History Month, as America prepares to enter a historic Golden Age, I want to extend my tremendous gratitude to Black Americans for all they have done to bring us to this moment,"" he said, adding that he looks forward to the future achievements of Black Americans under his administration.Despite longstanding accusations of racism from his political opponents, Trump secured significant support from Black voters and other minority groups in the 2024 US presidential election. This shift in voter demographics marked a notable change, reflecting a growing base of diverse supporters who resonated with his policies and leadership approach.Concluding his proclamation, Trump called on public officials, educators, librarians, and citizens across the United States to observe the month with ""appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities"" that honor Black history and culture.The proclamation was signed on January 31, 2025, marking the 249th year of American independence.

During her confirmation hearing for the position of Director of National Intelligence (DNI) on Thursday, Tulsi Gabbard , President Donald Trump’s nominee for the post, faced intense scrutiny over various aspects of her political views and past actions.The discussion became particularly contentious when it turned to her religious beliefs and her connection to the Science of Identity Foundation (SIF), a Hindu religious group.In a pointed remark, Gabbard addressed questions about her faith, specifically defending the principle of religious freedom enshrined in the US Constitution .“Unfortunately, there are some Democrat senators who still don't understand the principle of freedom of religion and Article 6 of the Constitution,"" she said, referring to the clause that states, ""no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.""Gabbard went on to accuse certain senators of fostering religious bigotry, claiming they were targeting her Hindu faith. “They're once again using the religious bigotry card, but this time trying to foment religious bigotry against Hindus and Hinduism ,"" she added.Gabbard also invited those interested in her spiritual path to learn more about her beliefs on her X account. “If anyone is sincerely interested in knowing more about my own personal spiritual path of Hinduism, I welcome you to go to my account on X where I'll share more on this topic.”The hearing, which lasted more than two hours, saw Gabbard grilled by senators on her past statements and actions. One of the key points of contention was her 2017 meeting with Syrian leader Bashar Assad, as well as her comments regarding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.She faced fierce criticism for some remarks that were seen as sympathetic to Russia’s stance, leading to concerns about her foreign policy judgment .Additionally, Gabbard’s previous support for Edward Snowden , the NSA leaker, was scrutinized, with senators questioning whether her views on surveillance posed a risk to national security.Despite the challenges, Gabbard defended her positions, arguing that her policy stances were often misinterpreted or taken out of context.","Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump's nominee for Director of National Intelligence, faced intense scrutiny during her confirmation hearing on Thursday.

Eighteen paramilitary personnel were killed and three others seriously wounded in an ambush in southwest Pakistan's Balochistan province, local officials confirmed on Saturday.The attack took place near the town of Mangochar, where a vehicle ""carrying unarmed Frontier Corps personnel"" was intercepted by 70 to 80 heavily armed assailants who had blocked the road, a police official told AFP on condition of anonymity.The gunmen opened fire, killing 17 of the passengers on board. A paramilitary who arrived to assist was also killed in the attack.Three others were critically injured, while two managed to escape unscathed.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack so far, but Balochistan has long been plagued by sectarian, ethnic, and separatist violence.The province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran, has seen a surge in attacks in recent months.In January, six people were killed in a bombing claimed by the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which has frequently targeted security forces and civilians, particularly those from other provinces.The BLA has also attacked foreign-funded energy projects, including those backed by China, accusing outsiders of exploiting the province’s vast natural resources while neglecting local communities.In November, the BLA took responsibility for a bombing at Quetta’s main railway station that killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers. Just months earlier, in August, the group launched a series of coordinated attacks that left at least 39 people dead, marking one of the deadliest escalations in recent years.Violence has also surged beyond Balochistan, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province witnessing an increase in militant attacks.The Pakistani military reported that in 2024 alone, 383 soldiers and 925 militants were killed in various clashes.","18 paramilitary personnel killed in ambush in southwest Pakistan's Balochistan province.

US policy shift and review timeline



Economic and social consequences for Pakistan



Geopolitical ramifications



Uncertain future for development initiatives



NEW DELHI: Donald Trump has temporarily suspended United States foreign assistance to foreign countries, including Pakistan, for re-evaluation, putting several critical development projects on hold.The decision follows an executive order issued by President Donald Trump, directing a comprehensive review of US foreign aid spending.The US aid suspension is set to impact several key sectors in Pakistan, including energy, economic growth, agriculture, governance, education, health, and cultural preservation. Projects such as the Power Sector Improvement Activity, Pakistan Private Sector Energy Initiative, and Clean Energy Loan Portfolio Guarantee Program face disruptions in the energy sector, as per a Geo news report.Economic growth initiatives, including the Social Protection Activity and Pakistan Private Investment Initiative, may also suffer setbacks. In agriculture, programmes like Water Management for Enhanced Productivity and Recharge Pakistan risk losing funding.The suspension has stalled numerous USAID-funded projects across various sectors, including health, education, agriculture, energy, and governance. The move halts initiatives such as the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP), the Power Sector Improvement Activity, and the Pakistan Private Sector Energy Activity. Economic growth initiatives, such as the Social Protection Activity and Investment Promotion Activity, are also affected.In the education sector, projects aimed at improving girls' education, strengthening higher education systems, and enhancing resilience in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been disrupted. The health sector has also taken a hit, with the suspension of tuberculosis treatment programmes, family health initiatives, and global health security efforts.Tammy Bruce, a spokesperson for the US Department of State, confirmed that all foreign aid funded by the State Department and USAID is under review. Secretary of State Marco Rubio justified the move, stating that every aid dollar must contribute to American security, strength, and prosperity.The White House has clarified that the suspension is temporary, with a 90-day review period. The final decision will be made by the relevant departments in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).The suspension of aid threatens Pakistan’s development trajectory, particularly in regions relying on US-funded initiatives for stability and growth. The decision could delay infrastructural advancements, limit economic opportunities, and disrupt healthcare access for vulnerable populations.Pakistan’s governance and democracy-building programmes are also affected, including projects on electoral reforms, land registration, and local governance. The decision may weaken institutional development efforts and impede progress in human rights and civic participation.The suspension highlights a shift in US-Pakistan relations , with Washington reassessing its financial commitments to Islamabad. Analysts believe this could push Pakistan to seek alternative funding sources, possibly from China or Gulf nations, altering its geopolitical alliances.While the pause in aid does not signify a complete severance of US-Pakistan ties, it raises concerns about future diplomatic engagements and financial support from Washington. The upcoming review will determine whether these programmes will resume, be modified, or face permanent cuts.With crucial projects now in limbo, Pakistani officials and aid-dependent communities await the US review’s outcome. The next three months will be critical in determining whether Washington reinstates its financial commitments or signals a long-term reduction in aid to Pakistan.For now, the suspension leaves Pakistan navigating an uncertain future, with potential setbacks in economic growth, infrastructure development, and humanitarian assistance.","Donald Trump has temporarily suspended United States foreign assistance to foreign countries, including Pakistan.

LONDON: Baloch leader Hyrbyair Marri brought attention to the ongoing horrors that the Pashtun and Baloch communities endure under Pakistan 's repressive control in a stirring statement to the Pashtun National Council (Jirga). Marri brought attention to the Pakiststate's systematic exploitation, enforced disappearances, and violence against various ethnic communities.""The sufferings of the Baloch and Pashtun under Pakistan's occupation are countless and unending,"" Marri stated, emphasizing the urgent need for unity between the two nations to resist colonial oppression.He recalled previous instances of solidarity, such as the treaty of kalat in 1758, in which Afghan and Baloch leaders promised to respect and support one another. He asked both groups to rekindle this spirit in their struggle for independence.Marri compared British imperialism to the colonial strategies that Pakistan acquired. He denounced Pakistan's continuous military actions in Balochistan , pointing to unlawful executions, torture, and enforced disappearances as means of quelling dissent. The Baloch leader cited the targeted profiling of Pashtuns and killings like the 1948 Barbra event in Charsadda, claiming that these practices were continuations of the British heritage of divide and conquer.Recalling how Pashtun tribes were utilized as frontline combatants in 1948 while Punjabi elites remained behind, he also denounced Pakistan's abuse of Baloch and Pashtun youth. He also drew attention to the fact that thousands of Baloch youths were forcibly drafted into the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and sent to die under pretences of religious salvation.Marri condemned Pakistan's racial profiling of Afghan refugees, primarily Pashtuns, and their forced deportation as a pressure tactic against Afghanistan. ""These people have lived here for generations, yet they are treated as disposable,"" he said.Calling for a renewed alliance between the Baloch and Pashtun nations, Marri declared, ""Our unity is the path to freedom.

He sentenced the four men to death and also fined them 4.6 million Pakistani rupees (approximately $16,000). They were identified as Rana Usman, Ashfaque Ali, Salman Sajjad, and Wajid Ali.According to the court order, dated Jan 24, the four individuals were sentenced to death by hanging for using derogatory remarks against the Holy Prophet. They were also sentenced to life in prison for defiling the Holy Quran and to 10 years’ imprisonment for deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. “All the sentences shall run concurrently,” the order read.The prosecution lawyer said the case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used. The men’s lawyer, Manzoor Rahmani, criticised the court’s order, saying doubts and uncertainties that arise in such cases are ignored by the courts, likely due to fear of a religious backlash and potential mob violence against the judge if the accused is acquitted.“We are preparing our appeals against the decision and will go to the high court,” Rahmani said. A member of a support group formed by the families of the accused was quoted by media as saying the pattern of arrests and prosecutions in this case was consistent with previous ones.“We urge the government to establish a commission to investigate the rise in these cases before these young individuals spend the best years of their lives behind bars,” said the support group member.Critics say blasphemy accusations, whether true or false, often lead to lengthy prison sentences on death row and solitary confinement. The laws, according to them, are often abused to settle scores or used to target members of Pakistan’s religious minorities.Hundreds of people have been accused of blasphemy since the draconian laws were introduced by former dictator Gen Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s.

An accountability court in Islamabad convicted the former first couple in the high-profile 190 million British Pounds case in a much-anticipated ruling earlier this month.As already indicated by the party, their lawyers filed an appeal in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) against the conviction and sentence, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf said in a WhatsApp message.""Legal Team representing Imran Khan & Bushra BiBi, challenges Al-Qadir Trust case decision at IHC,"" the party said, adding that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) ""maliciously misused its authority by announcing sentence, with incomplete investigation"".It further stated that the decision to approach the high court was taken to annul the decision and order acquittal of the former first couple.Judge Nasir Javed Rana of anti-corruption court announced the reserved verdict on January 17, convicting Khan and his wife Bibi guilty of corruption in the case and sentencing them to 14 and seven years respectively in prison.The NAB, the top anti-corruption body, in December 2023 had filed the case against Khan, Bibi and six others, accusing them of causing loss to the tune of Rs 50 billion to the national kitty.However, only the former first couple has been prosecuted as all others, including a property tycoon, were out of the country.The case was based on the charge that an amount of Rs 50 billion (190 million pound), returned to Pakistan by the UK's National Crime Agency as part of a settlement with a property tycoon was misused.The funds were reportedly intended for the national treasury but were allegedly redirected for personal benefit of the businessman who helped Bibi and Khan to set up a university.Bibi, as a trustee of the Al-Qadir Trust, was accused of benefiting from this settlement, including acquiring 458 kanals of land for Al-Qadir University in Jhelum.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, have been convicted of corruption.

4 Pakistani men sentenced to death for 'online blasphemy' against Quran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/4-pakistani-men-sentenced-to-death-for-online-blasphemy-against-quran/articleshow/117600872.cms,"Representative photo

A Pakistani court on Monday awarded death penalty to four men for ""online blasphemy"" against the Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book Quran.The four were charged with spreading blasphemous content online against Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book.""They were sentenced to death... on Friday for spreading blasphemous content online against the Prophet Mohammed and the Quran,"" Rao Abdur Raheem, a lawyer from the legal commission on blasphemy Pakistan, a private group which brought the case to court, told news agency AFP.""Our case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used in this heinous act,"" he added.The four men were sentenced in Rawalpindi, the garrison city that neighbours the capital Islamabad.A member of a support group formed by the families, however, said to AFP that they would challenge the conviction.""The pattern of arrests and prosecutions in this case is consistent with previous ones,"" said the support group member, who spoke on condition of anonymity told the news agency.""We urge the government to establish a commission to investigate the rise in these cases before these young individuals spend the best years of their lives behind bars,"" the member added.Blasphemy laws in Pakistan are among the strictest in the world, carrying severe punishments, including the death penalty, for offences against Islam.These laws, primarily enshrined in Sections 295-298 of the Pakistan Penal Code, criminalise acts such as insulting the Prophet Muhammad, desecrating the Quran, or offending religious sentiments.These laws have often been criticised for being misused to target minorities, settle personal disputes, and incite mob violence. The lack of safeguards against false accusations has led to numerous cases where individuals face imprisonment, violence, or even extrajudicial killings without substantial evidence.The blasphemy laws have sparked national and international debates about human rights and freedom of expression in Pakistan.Activists argue that these laws suppress religious minorities, limit free speech, and create a climate of fear, while conservative groups strongly defend them as essential to protecting Islam.High-profile cases, such as those of Asia Bibi and Salman Taseer, have highlighted the deep divisions in Pakistani society regarding these laws. Successive governments have been reluctant to amend or repeal the legislation due to the risk of backlash from religious hardliners. As a result, blasphemy remains a highly sensitive issue, with calls for legal reforms often met with strong resistance.","Pakistani court awards death penalty to four men for ""online blasphemy"" against the Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book Quran.

SINDH: A large protest march, organised by the Awami Tehreek (AT), took place from Gozo to KN Shah, with participants rallying against corporate farming and the construction of six new canals in Sindh, Dawn reported.The protesters demanded that Sindh's land be allocated to local, landless farmers rather than corporate entities.The march saw active participation from women and children, with villagers along the route warmly welcoming the demonstrators. Upon reaching KN Shah, the protest culminated in a massive public rally where leaders delivered passionate speeches, urging the government to halt land seizures.They called for the prioritisation of local farmers by providing modern agricultural tools and support to improve productivity, reported Dawn.Key speakers at the rally included AT leader Noor Ahmed Katiar , who condemned the planned network of new canals meant to supply water to corporate farming projects. Katiar warned, ""This will lead to a crisis in Sindh,"" and accused former President Asif Zardari of violating the Constitution by approving the construction of six new canals, as highlighted by Dawn.AT general secretary advocate Sajid Hussain Mahesar also addressed the crowd, criticising the coalition government for advancing the canal projects. He described them as an attack on the vision of Pakistan's founder, Quaid-i-Azam.Mahesar revealed that ""67,651 acres of land in Kachho had been handed over to foreign investors for corporate farming,"" jeopardising the livelihoods of local farmers and undermining Sindh's autonomy, Dawn reported.Advocate Raheel Bhutto strongly opposed the allocation of 10,000 acres in Gorakh Hill to a private firm, stating, ""This move is an assault not only on Sindh's lands but on its culture and heritage.""Bhutto warned, ""If the PPP government does not take action, the people of Sindh will hold them accountable, just as they have done with past dictatorial regimes.""The protest concluded with powerful slogans demanding the cancellation of the new canals, an end to corporate farming, and the protection of Sindh's lands, rivers, and cultural heritage.","A large protest march, organised by the Awami Tehreek (AT), took place from Gozo to KN Shah.

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka announced the lifting of a five-year ban on vehicle imports Tuesday as the country showed further signs of emerging from its worst economic meltdown.Information minister Nalinda Jayatissa said buses, trucks and utility vehicles will be allowed in from Saturday under a phased removal of restrictions in place since 2020.""We are moving very cautiously because we don't want a surge of imports that will deplete our foreign reserves,"" Jayatissa told reporters in Colombo.""Depending on the demand, we will open imports of other categories of vehicles such as cars, motorcycles and three-wheelers.""He said the imports were necessary to generate much-needed tax revenue, and the government hoped to cap imports at about $1.2 billion this year.Current tax rates on vehicles are over 300 per cent.Sri Lanka spent $1.4 billion on vehicle imports in 2019, the last full year before the import ban was imposed in March 2020.The island nation earlier attempted to end the ban on commercial vehicle imports in August 2023, but importers were unable to open letters of credit while the country was still in default on its foreign debt.Sri Lanka formally ended its status as a bankrupt nation in December after securing debt restructuring deals with both bilateral and private creditors.Sri Lanka defaulted on its $46 billion external debt in April 2022 as the country ran out of foreign exchange to finance imports, causing painful shortages of food, fuel and medicines.Months of street protests led to the toppling of then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was accused of corruption and mismanagement.His successor secured a bailout loan from the international monetary fund , which has said that the South Asian nation is making a recovery but is still not out of the woods.","Buses, trucks and utility vehicles will be allowed in from Saturday under a phased removal of restrictions in place since 2020.

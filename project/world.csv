Fresh tremors: Afghanistan struck by two more earthquakes; fifth in a week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/fresh-tremors-afghanistan-struck-by-two-more-earthquakes-fifth-in-a-week/articleshow/122775990.cms,"Representative image





Afghanistan was rocked by two more earthquakes early Saturday with a magnitude of around 4.0 on Richter scale, marking fifth such seismic event in the past week, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS).The first tremor, recorded at 1.26 am IST, measured 4.2 on the Richter scale with a depth of 190 km. The second quake struck just 45 minutes later at 2:11 am IST, registering a magnitude of 4.0 and a depth of 125 km. Both events were located in the northern region of Afghanistan, based on NCS data.On Friday night, another quake measuring 4.6 also shook the region. Earlier in the week, two more quakes of magnitudes 4.7 and 4.3 were reported, making this the fifth seismic jolt since July 17.Afghanistan’s vulnerability to frequent and often destructive earthquakes stems from its location at the convergence of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. The Hindu Kush mountain range, in particular, experiences frequent tremors and aftershocks.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) notes that Afghanistan remains highly prone to natural disasters including earthquakes, landslides, and seasonal floods. These events further strain communities already grappling with decades of conflict and limited infrastructure, making disaster response and recovery particularly challenging.","The first tremor measured 4.2 on the Richter scale with a depth of 190 km.

'Never seen him doodle': Ex-aide Michael Cohen questions authenticity of Trump’s Epstein letter; backs call to release files,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/never-seen-him-doodle-ex-aide-michael-cohen-questions-authenticity-of-trumps-epstein-letter-backs-call-to-release-files/articleshow/122775630.cms,"Michael Cohen makes big claim on Trump-WSJ row

MAGA voices join in







Former Trump attorney Michael Cohen has cast serious doubt on the Wall Street Journal’s claim that US President Donald Trump drew a suggestive picture for Jeffrey Epstein in 2003.Cohen said that during 13 years working closely with Trump, he “never once saw him doodle. I never saw him draw a picture. In fact, I would be very shocked if Donald Trump actually can doodle."" He further claimed that the words and language on the alleged letter were not Trump's.Cohen also said that he is in favour of releasing the Epstein files, like most of the GOP base.Cohen’s comments come after the Wall Street Journal reported that a birthday album for Epstein’s 50th included a note from Trump.The note allegedly had “lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, drawn in thick black marker.” The Journal says: “A pair of small arcs denotes the woman’s breasts, and the future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair.” It ended: “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.”Trump furiously denied the report during an interview with the Journal: “I never wrote a picture in my life.I don't draw pictures of women. It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”The MAGA chief launched a defamation suit against The Wall Street Journal, News Corp, and Rupert Murdoch. He also directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of 'any and all' Epstein files.High-profile MAGA figures swiftly backed Trump. vice-president JD Vance dismissed the story as “complete and utter bulls**t” while activist Laura Loomer called the letter “totally fake,” arguing, “Everyone who actually KNOWS President Trump knows he doesn’t type letters. He writes notes in big black Sharpie.”Charlie Kirk also expressed scepticism, stating, “This is not how Trump talks at all. I don’t believe it,” referring to the third-person style of the Journal’s quoted text.The alleged letter is part of justice department files on Epstein-related materials that have been at the centre of a political row. The DOJ closed its investigation in June, saying no new “client list” emerged, a decision that disappointed some Republican supporters and many Democrat adversaries who wanted greater transparency","WSJ reported that a birthday album for Epstein’s 50th included a note from Trump.

'Money isn't enough': 'America Party' crashes before takeoff; Americans want alternative but don't see Musk's party as option,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/money-isnt-enough-america-party-crashes-before-takeoff-americans-want-alternative-but-dont-see-musks-party-as-option/articleshow/122775476.cms,"Elon Musk launched the America Party on July 5

Polls deliver a Blow



Third parties, and their little to no chance of succeeding



The more they see Musk, the less they like him





Elon Musk’s plans to launch a new political party appear doomed before they’ve even begun, with multiple polls showing overwhelming public opposition and record-low favourability ratings for the billionaire entrepreneur.The so-called ""America Party,"" which Musk teased after a fallout with former buddy and US President Donald Trump, has been met with a major thumbs-down from the American public.According to a CNN poll, just 25% of all adults and 22% of registered voters support the idea of Musk forming a third party to rival Democrats and Republicans. A staggering 74% of adults and 77% of voters are opposed.These numbers suggest that Americans may be open to alternatives beyond the two major parties, but Musk is not the person they want leading that charge.The CNN poll is not alone in its findings.A separate poll by Quinnipiac University also showed that most people don’t support Musk’s idea of starting a new political party. It found only 17% of voters would consider supporting Musk’s new party. More than 77% rejected the idea entirely.Musk himself has become much less popular in the past few years. According to CNN’s data, just 23% of Americans view him favourably, while 60% view him unfavourably, giving him a net approval rating of -37 points.CNN put it: “That gives Musk a net favourable rating of -37 percentage points. Oof.”Although other polls have been slightly less harsh, the overall picture remains grim. “Musk is just the wrong guy to lead such a journey,” the report notes. “He is, as I said at the top, one of the most unpopular political figures in the country.”This marks a sharp decline from 2016, when Musk had a net favourable rating of +29 points, making him one of the most admired figures in the Bloomberg poll at the time.Historically, third-party efforts in the US have struggled to gain traction. No independent has ever won the presidency, except George Washington, but that was before the modern party system existed.In 1968, George Wallace was the last third-party candidate to win a single state in a presidential race. Since 1970, there have been over 13,000 congressional elections, and non-major party candidates have won just 24 of them. Most of those wins came from independents like Bernie Sanders and Angus King.Even Ross Perot, a billionaire like Musk, had a hard time. Despite gaining nearly 20% of the popular vote in the 1992 presidential election and forming the Reform Party, the movement soon lost steam. Perot’s party reached its peak in 1998 when Jesse Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota. Today, the party is all but forgotten.Back in 1993, a CNN poll found that 50% of Americans supported Perot’s third party, while 37% opposed. In stark contrast, Musk faces 77% of Americans opposing his party from the outset.Even with poor poll numbers, Musk’s political plans still grab attention because of his huge wealth and influence. Unlike most other third-party candidates, he has the money to run big campaigns and get media coverage.“Many third parties fail because they can’t get their message out. Musk’s party wouldn’t have that problem,” CNN noted. “But money isn’t enough.”Adding to his challenges is the fact that Musk is ineligible to run for president, having been born in South Africa.“The more Americans see of Musk in politics, the less they like him,” CNN said. “Musk’s unpopularity makes the normally very difficult efforts to start a third party become herculean.”","Elon Musk launched the America Party on July 5, after a fallout with US President Donald Trump.

Who is Rupert Murdoch? Media giant sued by Trump over WSJ's Epstein letter; MAGA chief calls paper ‘pile of garbage’ after row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-rupert-murdoch-media-giant-sued-by-trump-over-wsjs-epstein-letter-maga-chief-calls-paper-pile-of-garbage-after-row/articleshow/122774812.cms,"Who is Rupert Murdoch?



What did the WSJ report say?



Trump and MAGA allies hit back



The Epstein scandal







Media giant Rupert Murdoch, the man behind some of the world’s biggest news outlets, is back in the spotlight after US President Donald Trump filed a lawsuit against his company on Firday.The case stems from a recent Wall Street Journal report involving Jeffrey Epstein and a birthday letter allegedly written by Trump in 2003. Trump had reportedly asked Rupert Murdoch not to release or publish the article, calling it fake. However, the piece was published on Thursday, followed by a quick wave of attacks from the MAGA base.In a Truth Social post, Trump himself confirmed that he is suing Murdoch.""We have just filed a POWERHOUSE Lawsuit against everyone involved in publishing the false, malicious, defamatory, FAKE NEWS “article” in the useless “rag” that is, The Wall Street Journal. This historic legal action is being brought against the so-called authors of this defamation, the now fully disgraced WSJ, as well as its corporate owners and affiliates, with Rupert Murdoch and Robert Thomson (whatever his role is!) at the top of the list,"" The MAGA chief said.Rupert Murdoch is an Australian-born American business tycoon renowned for establishing one of the world's largest media empires. He owns Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post, and numerous media outlets in the UK and Australia.Though often associated with right-leaning coverage, Murdoch’s companies have occasionally drawn criticism from Trump and his supporters, especially when the coverage doesn’t align with their views. This isn’t the first time Trump has clashed with Murdoch’s empire, but the Epstein case has raised the stakes.Murdoch has had a complex relationship with Trump, promoting his rise in 2016, but later falling out over the 2020 election and its aftermath. Murdoch, 93, is one of the most powerful media barons in the world.The Wall Street Journal on Thursday published a detailed piece claiming it had reviewed a leather-bound birthday album created for Epstein’s 50th birthday in 2003. According to the report, the album was organised by Ghislaine Maxwell and included notes from Epstein’s high-profile friends. One of those notes was allegedly from Donald Trump.The WSJ said the page attributed to Trump featured “several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, drawn in thick black marker.” The report added, “A pair of small arcs denotes the woman’s breasts, and the future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair.” The note was said to be written in a third-person style, imagining a conversation between Trump and Epstein. It ends with the line: “A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret.”Trump and several of his close allies responded quickly to the report. The GOP leader has denied any wrongdoing and launched a lawsuit against The WSJ and its parent company, News Corp, which is run by Rupert Murdoch.The lawsuit accuses the WSJ of defamation and claims the letter has been taken out of context or is possibly fake. Trump’s legal team said the article was part of a politically motivated attack. “President Trump never wrote such a message,” said a statement from his spokesperson. “This is another disgusting smear from the corrupt media.”Supporters in the MAGA movement, including JD Vance, Karoline Leavitt, Laura Loomer, have also flooded social media, calling for an investigation into how the Journal got access to the letter and demanding that Murdoch be held accountable.Jeffrey Epstein was a financier and convicted sex offender who was arrested in 2019 on charges of running a sex-trafficking ring involving underage girls. He had close ties with many wealthy and powerful men, including Trump, former US prez Bill Clinton, and Britain’s Prince Andrew.Epstein died in a New York jail cell while awaiting trial. His death was officially ruled a suicide, but it has sparked years of conspiracy theories, particularly among both the left and right. Some Democrats believe he was murdered to prevent him from naming others. Trump’s base often claims Epstein was part of a larger elite pedophile network.The resurfacing of Epstein’s files, including flight logs, visitor lists, and personal messages, continues to keep the scandal in the news. The 2003 letter allegedly signed by Trump has now become another flashpoint.","Donald Trump has filed a lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch's media empire.

‘Little group fading fast’: Donald Trump mocks Brics; reiterates 10% tariff threat to protect US dollar dominance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/little-group-fading-fast-donald-trump-mocks-brics-reiterates-10-tariff-threat-to-protect-us-dollar-dominance/articleshow/122774270.cms,"'GENIUS Act, They named it after me!': Trump



Brics denies being anti-American







US President Donald Trump on Friday mocked the Brics group as a “little group” that is “fading out fast”.He also reiterated his warning from earlier this month of a 10 per cent tariff on any nation aligning with Brics, which he described as following “anti-American policies”.The MAGA chief also claimed credit for weakening the group’s efforts to rival the US dollar’s dominance.Speaking while signing the GENIUS Act into law, Trump said, “There is a little group called Brics, and it is fading out fast. But Brics tried and wanted to take over the Dollar and the dominance of the Dollar and the standard of the Dollar. I said that anybody in the Brics consortium of nations, we are going to tariff you 10 percent and they had a meeting the following day, and almost nobody showed up.”Trump, speaking firmly about his approach to global economic rivals, added, “When I heard about this group of six countries in Brics, I hit them very hard, and if they ever really form in a meaningful way, it will end very quickly.” Trump did not name the countries directly but said, “We can never let anyone play games with us.”Trump said protecting the global reserve status of the US dollar is of the highest priority. “We are not going to let the Dollar slide...If we lost the status of the Dollar as the world's reserve currency, it would be like losing a World War,” he said.Trump's comments came as he signed into law the S.1582 GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act), which sets up a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. Trump hailed the law as a major step in cementing American leadership in global finance and cryptocurrency.“This afternoon, we take a giant step to cement American dominance in global finance and Crypto technology, as we sign the landmark GENIUS Act into law,” Trump said. “They named it after me. This is hell of an act!”Addressing the crypto community, Trump said, “For years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out... this signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit and your ability to never give up... Congratulations on this incredible achievement!”He reiterated his commitment to prevent a US central bank digital currency. “I also remain fully committed to my pledge never to allow the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency in America. It won't happen,” he said.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent praised Trump’s move, saying it would help maintain the US dollar’s place as the global reserve currency.Trump has singled out Brazil for additional penalties, including a 50 per cent tariff on imports starting in August, citing “unfair” trade practices. He had earlier announced the 10 per cent tariff on July 6, targeting any country supporting Brics.The Brics group has recently expanded to include countries like Iran and Indonesia and has denied being anti-American. While Brazil has stepped back from pushing a common currency, the bloc continues to develop Brics Pay, a cross-border payment system aimed at promoting trade in local currencies.Despite Trump's repeated claims, no evidence has been presented to show Brics aims to undermine the dollar or harm the US.",US President Donald Trump on Friday mocked the Brics group as a “little group’ that is “fading out fast” He also reiterated his warning from earlier this month of a 10 per cent tariff on any nation aligning with Brics.

Trump’s Body Raising Red Flags? FIFA World Cup Photos Reveal POTUS’ ‘DISTURBING’ Condition





The White House Thursday announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with a chronic but benign vein condition amid ongoing speculations over his bruised hand . The White House said the president sought a medical examination for swollen legs which came up with the new finding.""I know that many in the media have been speculating about bruising on the president's hand and also swelling in the president's legs. In the effort of transparency, the president wanted me to share a note from his physician ... all results were within normal limits,"" White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.""Recent photos of the president have shown minor bruising on the back of his hand. This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent hand-shaking and the use of aspirin,"" Leavitt said. Leavitt said Trump decided to share the note on his new health diagnosis with everyone. The president underwent a thorough evaluation after noticing swelling in his lower leg. The condition is benign and common among individuals over the age of 70. Leavitt announced that there is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.Explaining the bruises on Trump's back of hand, Karoline explained that this is because of minor soft tissue irritation due to frequent hand shaking and the use of aspirin which Trump takes as part of standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.The clarification from the White House came as a close-up of Trump's hand became the center of online chatter as his hand looked evidently bruised. The theory of handshaking was floated earlier too but it was dismissed by many experts.Dr Neal H Patel, a doctor at Providence St Joseph Hospital, told the Daily Mail earlier this year that shaking hands is unlikely to have caused the damage. “I see a lot of patients who are businessmen, and I’ve never really seen them getting bruising from too much handshaking,” he said. “I guess it’s possible, but that would really not be on my list of ideas of what causes it.”",The White House said the president sought a medical examination for swollen legs which came up with the new finding.

Clashes In US Senate; 'Are You Afraid Of Trump?': Lawmakers Walk Out Of 'Kangaroo Court' Hearing





• Donald Trump’s name appears seven times in Jeffrey Epstein’s flight logs from the 1990s.• The flights involved his then-wife Marla Maples, their daughter Tiffany, and staff.• There is no evidence Trump flew to Epstein’s private island or was involved in criminal activity.• Trump and Epstein were socially close in the ‘90s but reportedly fell out in the early 2000s.It’s a question that has lingered in the public consciousness ever since Jeffrey Epstein’s sordid crimes exploded into global headlines: Did Donald Trump ever fly on Epstein’s infamous “Lolita Express”?Thanks to a tranche of declassified documents released earlier this year by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi—including the full flight logs from Epstein’s private jet—the answer is now clear. Yes, Trump was listed on at least seven flights aboard Epstein’s plane. But the logs also complicate some of the more salacious speculation that has dogged him for years.The logs tell a story—but not the whole oneAccording to flight manifests released in February 2025, Trump is recorded as a passenger on several domestic flights aboard Epstein’s plane in the early 1990s. Notably, these flights include family members: his then-wife Marla Maples, their young daughter Tiffany, and a nanny.There are no flights logged to Epstein’s notorious private island in the Virgin Islands (Little Saint James), nor are there entries connecting Trump to Epstein’s international sex trafficking operations.Still, these entries confirm what was long speculated: Trump and Epstein were socially close in the New York elite circles of the ‘90s, often appearing at the same parties and clubs. In a now-infamous 2002 quote to New York Magazine, Trump said: “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with... even said he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”By the mid-2000s, however, Trump reportedly severed ties with Epstein. Multiple reports, including investigative timelines from Time and The New York Times, note a falling out—reportedly over a Florida real estate dispute. Trump has since claimed he banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago, though the circumstances remain murky.During the 2016 and 2020 election cycles, Trump was repeatedly asked about Epstein. His campaign consistently maintained that he had no knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and was “one of the few” who had distanced himself from the financier early on. In 2019, after Epstein’s arrest, Trump told reporters, “I had a falling out with him a long time ago. I wasn’t a fan.”The declassified flight logs from 2025 have reignited public scrutiny, particularly on social media. But Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign—and now his second-term White House—have aggressively pushed back on suggestions of impropriety. His spokesperson Steven Cheung dismissed the log entries as “routine travel decades ago” and said Trump “never visited Epstein’s island, never engaged in any criminal behaviour, and never flew with Epstein after discovering what he was. ”However, critics say the presence of his name on the logs—even if innocent—adds to a pattern of proximity between Trump and men later convicted or accused of sex crimes, including Bill Cosby, R. Kelly, and Ghislaine Maxwell.To date, no criminal charges or credible allegations have tied Trump to Epstein’s sex trafficking operation. The released flight logs suggest a limited social association, concentrated in the early 1990s and mostly involving domestic flights with family. There is no indication of underage passengers accompanying Trump, no evidence of him visiting Little Saint James, and no direct link to the sexual abuse cases for which Epstein was convicted.Still, in a political environment dominated by conspiracy theories and mounting distrust in institutions, the optics are potent. Trump’s second term has already been marred by public anger over the abrupt firing of Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor who worked on Epstein-linked cases, and speculation that the Trump administration is trying to control the narrative around Epstein’s death and files.Much like his presidency, Donald Trump’s connection to Jeffrey Epstein is a story with loud headlines and fine print. The records confirm they moved in the same elite circles. But as of now, the flight logs suggest association, not implication.A: Seven times, mostly in the early 1990s, including flights with Marla Maples and Tiffany Trump.A: No. There is no record of Trump flying to Little Saint James.A: Yes, they were socially close in the 1990s but reportedly fell out by the mid-2000s.A: No. He has not been charged or formally implicated in Epstein’s sex trafficking network.A: In 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi released full Epstein flight logs as part of a broader declassification push, reigniting media interest.","Donald Trump was listed on at least seven flights aboard Jeffrey Epstein's plane.

Former Alaska Airlines pilot Joseph Emerson, recalls the most “consequential three seconds” of his life when he had pulled down levers that could cut off fuel to the engines in an Alaska Air Flight 2059, reports CBS News. He had reportedly been under the influence of “magic mushrooms” and lost sense of reality.Emerson boarded the flight bound for San Francisco as a passenger from Everett, Washington with 83 other passengers and crew on board. He was assigned the cockpit jump seat located behind the pilot and first officer.""I had no intention of crashing an actual airplane. I wanted to wake up. I was convinced I wasn't going home to my wife and kids,"" he said in an interview with CBS News on Thursday.At that time he was grieving the death of his best friend and reportedly experimented with the psychedelic drug.""You're not going home. You need to wake up. That's when I acted. I pulled the handles that were in front of my face,"" he said recalling the incident. ""I mean, in the dream, in that dissociative state, I thought they were going to wake me up. It didn't wake me up, right? I was in reality. I know that now. You know, it's the most consequential three seconds of my life.”""I know what those levers do in a real airplane and I need to wake up from this. You know, it's 30 seconds of my life that I wish I could change, and I can't,” he was quoted saying by ABC News.The flight was diverted and landed safely in Portland, Oregon, where Emerson was taken into custody. He is scheduled to face trial next month on a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew, and also faces numerous state charges, including 83 misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment and one felony count of first-degree endangering an aircraft, reported CBS News.Since then the National Transportation Safety Board has since hosted a first-of-its-kind forum focused on pilot mental health to examine current regulations.The FAA launched its own policy review, with both agencies advocating for reforms to remove barriers to mental health care.""Our pilots and air traffic controllers are not going to lose their job when they ask for help. We in this country must recognize that that's strength. And they're not to be punished. We're going to help them, process them, and get them back into cockpits,"" said Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber, reported CBS News.Illinois Rep. Sean Casten and Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber are spearheading a bipartisan push in Congress to implement reforms within two years through the Mental Health in Aviation Act. The legislation aims to improve access to mental health care for pilots and air traffic controllers and expand the number of medical examiners available.","Former Alaska Airlines pilot Joseph Emerson recalls the most “consequential three seconds” of his life when he had pulled down levers that could cut off fuel to the engines in an Alaska Air Flight 2059.

Who is Maurene Comey?





The US justice department has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of the former FBI director James Comey, on Wednesday. The reason for her firing was not immediately clear.Comey had worked on several high-profile cases, including the prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein as well as rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs.Reacting to the firing, Maurene Comey said there was no reason behind her dismissal. “Yesterday was unexpectedly my last day in the Office. I was summarily fired via memo from Main Justice that did not give a reason for my termination,” she wrote in an email to colleagues, reported the New York Post.This comes as the administration is embroiled in a controversy after closing the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.Maurene Comey was a seasoned attorney in the Southern District of New York, widely regarded as one of the Justice Department's most prestigious prosecutorial offices.She famously worked on the prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein, who died in custody in 2019, as he was awaiting trial.Comey achieved significant success in several high-profile prosecutions, most notably securing the conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell on sex trafficking charges for assisting financier Jeffrey Epstein in the abuse of underage girls.In a declaration submitted in January, Comey argued that releasing documents on the Epstein case could harm the government’s position on a potential retrial of Maxwell. She said that making the materials public might expose witnesses “to possible embarrassment and harassment” potentially discouraging them from testifying, as per the New York Times.Most recently, Comey led the prosecution of Sean “Diddy” Combs. The trial against Combs ended in a split verdict and he was convicted on prostitution related charges but acquitted of more serious charges.In recent months, Comey came under repeated attacks from Trump’s right-wing base, including Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist, who urged attorney general Pam Bondi to fire her in May.","Maurene Comey, the daughter of former FBI director James Comey, was fired on Wednesday.

New video shows Travis Decker 3 days before he allegedly killed his daughters





Newly acquired video footage from the Wenatchee police department shows Travis Decker, 32, the fugitive father, accused of killing his three young daughters, just days before their disappearance.The footage captures Decker speaking with a police officer and another individual on May 27. Decker rear-ended another vehicle at a red light, and the second person in the video was the driver of that car, reported CBS News.In the nearly 20-minute-long video, Decker and the other person were seen speaking to each other and the officer. Towards the end of the video, Decker and the other driver shook hands before returning to their respective vehicles. The audio could not be intercepted from the clip.The driver whose car Decker had hit said that he was “nervous and fidgety” and kept on asking him to “not call the police,” as per KING 5. “I could tell he was not in his full senses,” the driver added.Travis Decker has been the subject of an intense manhunt since June 2 after officials found the bodies of three of his daughters, Paityn (9), Evelyn (8), and Olivia (5), at a campground near Leavenworth, Washington State.The girls were on a “planned visitation” with Decker on May 30. Decker’s vehicle was found abandoned near the girls’ bodies and officials announced that the bloody handprints on the truck’s tailgate matched the DNA profile of Decker's.As per court records, Decker’s ex-wife raised concerns over his mental health, highlighting that he became increasingly unstable and was often living out of his truck. She also mentioned that he had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder but was not under any medication.Decker served in the US Army from 2013 to 2021, including a deployment to Afghanistan in 2014, and received training in navigation, survival, and wilderness skills. Police stated that he is currently wanted on three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of kidnapping.A probable cause affidavit revealed that Decker fled the scene of a different crash on May 4, although the other driver declined police follow-up since their vehicle was undamaged.","New video shows Travis Decker 3 days before he allegedly killed his daughters.

US President Donald Trump on Friday signed into law the ""Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act"" or the GENIUS Act, a sweeping legislation aimed at regulating payment stablecoins. The White House said the law would also serve broader purposes in shaping financial innovation.In his remarks at the signing ceremony, Trump joked, “The GENIUS Act — they named it after me. This is hell of an act!” He described the move as a major step in cementing American dominance in the global digital currency space.""This afternoon, we take a giant step to cement American dominance in global finance and crypto technology, as we sign the landmark GENIUS Act into law,"" Trump said. The President acknowledged the contributions of several industry leaders and applauded the resilience of the crypto community.“For years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out... this signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit and your ability to never give up... Congratulations on this incredible achievement!” he added.The legislation provides a regulatory framework for dollar-backed stablecoins, which Trump said could trigger the “greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the internet.”He also reaffirmed his opposition to the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency, declaring, “It won’t happen.”Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent praised the law on social media, crediting Trump's leadership and Senator Bill Hagerty’s work. “Blockchain technologies will power the next generation of payments, and the US dollar is coming onchain...

‘Prayed for this day’: 10 Americans freed from Venezuelan prison in prisoner exchange programme; El Salvador releases over 200 Venezuelans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/prayed-for-this-day-10-americans-freed-from-venezuelan-prison-in-prisoner-exchange-programme-el-salvador-releases-over-200-venezuelans/articleshow/122773368.cms,"Image: X/@usembassyve





Ten Americans are on their way back to the US following a prisoner exchange involving the United States, El Salvador, and Venezuela, US secretary of state Marco Rubio announced Friday.As part of the prisoner exchange, more than 200 Venezuelan migrants, who were deported to a mega-prison in El Salvador by the Trump administration have left the Central American country and are set to be sent to Venezuela, reported ABC News.""Until today, more Americans were wrongfully held in Venezuela than any other country in the world, "" Rubio stated. ""Every wrongfully detained American in Venezuela is now free and back in our homeland,"" he added.Wilbert Joseph Castaneda, a former Navy SEAL is among the Americans who were released, as per CBS News. He was detained in Venezuela last year while he was travelling in the country for personal reasons.""We have prayed for this day for almost a year. My brother is an innocent man who was used as a political pawn by the Maduro regime,"" Castaneda’s family stated.Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele posted on X, “Today, we have handed over all the Venezuelan nationals detained in our country, accused of being part of the criminal organization Tren de Aragua (TDA).Many of them face multiple charges of murder, robbery, rape, and other serious crimes.As was offered to the Venezuelan regime back in April, we carried out this exchange in return for a considerable number of Venezuelan political prisoners, people that regime had kept in its prisons for years, as well as all the American citizens it was holding as hostages.These individuals are now en route to El Salvador, where they will make a brief stop before continuing their journey home,” he said referring to the release of Venezuelan migrants being detained in the infamous CECOT prison in El Salvador.The Venezuelans were transferred to El Salvador after the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century wartime law allowing for the removal of noncitizens with minimal due process.Using the act, US authorities deported two planeloads of alleged migrant gang members by arguing that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua functions as a “hybrid criminal state” attempting to infiltrate the US, as per ABC News.Many of the deportees' families and attorneys have denied their alliance with the gang and an ICE official stated in a sworn federal court declaration that numerous deported individuals did not have any criminal records in the US.The migrants were transferred to CECOT earlier this year under a $6 million agreement between the Trump administration and Salvadoran President Bukele, aimed at housing migrant detainees as part of Trump's broader immigration crackdown.","Ten Americans are on their way back to the US following a prisoner exchange involving the United States, El Salvador, and Venezuela.

New York mayoral front-runner Zohran Mamdani previously questioned the “purpose” of jails and prisons, drawing sharp criticism from law enforcement officials on Friday, who condemned the remarks as “out of touch” and potentially dangerous.“I think that frankly, I mean, what purpose do they serve, right?” Mamdani said in August 2020 when a co-host of “The Far Left Show” asked him whether he believed prisons were obsolete, reported the New York Post.“I think we have to ask ourselves that … I think a lot of people who defend the carceral state, that defend the idea of it and the way it makes them feel, they’re not defending the reality of it and the practices that are part and parcel of it,” Mamdani added.“Because if you actually break it down … how many people come out the prison system better than they went into the prison system?”The clip, which resurfaced on social media this week after being posted by the “End Wokeness” account and widely circulated in conservative circles, sparked backlash within the law enforcement community.In the interview he asked “how much harm is actually being prevented versus created” while referring to incarceration of offenders.“I think when you ask these kinds of questions, people don’t always have clear answers, what they always want to pivot to is ‘What are you going to do about murderers?’ and ‘What are you going to do about rapists?’ and sometimes you have to ask them, ‘What are you doing about them right now?’” he added.“It’s scary that a mayoral candidate could be this out of touch with the realities of living in communities that have historically experienced violence and crime,” a source said, as per the New York Post. “Sounds like he will change his tune once he realizes how unhinged that sounds in the real world.”“It’s the poor neighborhoods that the stalker, domestic abuser, and shooting recidivist will return [to],” said another law enforcement source. “But the rules of civil society that make this city the luxury item most of Zohran’s constituency want to live in is a product of that, bad people in jail so they can pretend they live on a movie set.”“Letting criminals walk the streets without any repercussions is not repairing anything,” said a Manhattan cop.Mamdani has previously expressed his stance on prisons stating, “White supremacy has many faces, from the police & prison systems in America to occupation & apartheid in Palestine,” he posted on X in 2020.GOP candidate Curtis Sliwa, who is set to face Mamdani in the November general election, denounced the resurfaced clip, calling it “absolutely preposterous.”“Of course we need jails to keep dangerous individuals off our streets,” Sliwa stated. “But he is no different than Eric Adams who is shutting down Rikers or Andrew Cuomo who pushed to close it while celebrating the shutdown of over 18 state prisons and passing laws that coddle criminals and let them avoid the jail time they deserve.”Zohran Mamdani has defeated Dormer governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary in New York City.

The next registration will open in March 2026 for FY 2027.The H-1B visa program allows US companies to hire foreign workers in special occupations requiring specific knowledge like engineering or healthcare. But of late, the program has become highly controversial as American workers complained that they are losing their jobs to people from India and China who are getting paid less.Every year, Congress sets a cap for the H-1b and for FY 2026, the cap was 85,000, including 65,000 regular visas and 20,000 reserved for applicants with advanced degrees from US institutions.Extension of the amount of time a current H-1B worker may remain in the United States.Changing the terms of employment for current H-1B workersAllowing current H-1B workers to change employersAllowing current H-1B workers to work concurrently in additional H-1B positions.The registration began in March, followed by lottery selection.

Donald Trump aide Stephen Miller's wife Katie Miller has broken her silence on the ongoing speculations over her ever-evolving relationship with Elon Musk after Musk's fallout with Trump. Katie walked out of the White House with Elon Musk, triggering a rumor storm that they had an affair and she would be divorcing Stephen Miller, Trump's aide. All three of them were very close during the initial days of Musk's Washington phase as they used to spend time together even outside work.The Trump-Musk breakup did not do well for the married couple as they were torn between their loyalties -- Stephen toward Trump and Katie toward Musk.But more recently, Elon Musk unfollowed Katie Miller on X after Miller posted her July 4 holiday photo with Stephen. This led to speculations that the new suspected couple might have fallen apart and Stephen Miller's marriage is, after all, not breaking.Speaking to Reuters, Katie Miller said she still works for Elon Musk though she declined to describe her role. ""My paycheck still comes from him,"" she said.Katie and Stephen met each other as they both worked with the previous Trump administration.In this administration, while Stephen became the deputy chief of staff in his crucial White House role, Katie was appointed as an adviser to Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.After Elon Musk walked out of DOGE before his massive fallout with the president, which even led to him founding a new party America Party, Katie Miller left the government to work for Musk.Miller recently revamped her X profile, which once featured a banner photo of a SpaceX rocket, to highlight her life as a mother and wife. She posted photos of her workouts and beach excursions with her children, the Reuters report noted, adding that Katie did not reply to why Elon Musk unfollowed her.","Katie Miller said she still works for Elon Musk though she declined to describe her role.

In a startling revelation in the mysterious murder case of American Idol executive Robin Kaye, and her husband, Thomas Deluca, it has now been found that they lay dead for at least four days inside their Los Angeles home after suffering multiple gunshots when they probably stopped a burglar. The burglary was reported and police came to the house but never went inside the property.Authorities received a burglary complaint on July 10, but never actually went inside the property, as there were no noticeable signs of forced entry. The suspect, identified as Raymond Boodarian, 22, might have been inside the house when the police officers initially visited the property.“A confrontation ensued, which resulted in the suspect taking their lives,” the LAPD said, explaining the scenario that might have unfolded before the shooting, while it remains unclear when exactly the couple died or whether they were still alive when authorities first visited the home that day.Officers carried out a welfare check at the property on Monday, which is when they discovered the bodies. Kaye was found in the pantry, and Deluca was in the bathroom, both with multiple gunshot wounds to the head.Authorities discovered a trail of blood leading to the front of the property and entered the home through a shattered glass sliding door at the back, as the front door was locked.Boodarian was arrested without incident on July 15.He was formally charged with two counts of murder as well as one count of residential burglary involving a person on July 17. The murder charges carry special circumstance allegations, including multiple murders and committing murder during a burglary, along with firearm allegations.Boodarian was previously accused of threatening his family. “I know at one time he tried stabbing his mom, I believe, or got violent with a knife,” a neighbour of Booadarian was quoted as saying by Fox News. “I just know he was troubled. I know he was on medication, on and off medication… he needed help,” the neighbour added.Kaye previously expressed concerns about rising burglaries in the neighborhood and sought additional security measures, as per Kris Herzog, a former police officer.Kaye worked on around 300 episodes of “American Idol” between 2009 to 2023. Her other works also include The Singing Bee, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, as well as multiple Miss Universe Specials.","American Idol executive Robin Kaye and her husband, Thomas Deluca, were found dead in their Los Angeles home on Monday.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Asim Munir for President? Pakistan Defence Minister Denies Amid Buzz Of Asif Ali Zardari Quitting





A political and diplomatic dogfight is underway over a prospective visit to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump en route to the Quad summit in India in September amid a gradual recalibration of ties in the region.Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit after pulling off a coup by arranging a luncheon meeting last month for the country's army chief Asim Munir with the US President.Munir charmed Trump by endorsing him for a Nobel Peace Prize, playing up to his craving for one, and the Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits, despite having thrown itself at China's feet for survival.Although the White House has not confirmed Trump's Quad attendance given New Delhi is yet to nail the dates -- which also depends on the leaders of Japan and Australia -- Pakistan's excitable media broadcast that the US President would visit Pakistan on September 18, before retracting the report because Trump will be on a state visit to the UK from September 17-19.There are indications though that Trump may stopover in Pakistan whenever he heads out to the Quad summit.This could be as late as November given the MAGA supremo's obsession with trade deals over strategic alignments. He has just delivered a tariff shock to Japan and also riled up Australia, while India has proved to be a tough negotiator, frustrating his trade boffins attempts to strong-arm New Delhi into a quick deal.In fact, Trump's fetish for tariffs and his fixation on trade deals puts a question mark over the strategic salience of the Quad even as long-time allies and partners adjust to his mercurial approach.According to some diplomats, India itself may have to reassess its approach to Trump-era Washington after a rosy-eyed view of long-term strategic ties with the US. They acknowledge that Trump’s response during his second term to the Pakistani outreach – driven more by opportunism than any strategic vision – clearly caught India off guard. New Delhi resents the re-hyphenation that would be implicit in such a two-fer, but has no way of thwarting it.If Trump does visit Pakistan, it will be the first US Presidential trip to the country in nearly two decades after George W Bush layover in 2006. Bush stopped by in Islamabad for a few hours under a tight security blanket on his way back from a three-day visit to New Delhi, talking up counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan while rejecting its pleas for a nuclear deal similar to the one he forged with India.Presidents Obama and Biden both disdained even a stopover while Trump himself trashed Pakistan during his first term, accusing it of ""nothing but lies & deceit"" and providing ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.""Pakistan is now promising to turn itself into a safe haven for US businesses promoted by Trump associates -- including transforming Islamabad into the ""crypto capital of South Asia"" and a ""global leader in the digital finance revolution,’ -- to land a Presidential visit.During his first term, Trump is famously said to have complained about landing in Iraq and Afghanistan with the lights on Air Force One turned off (as a security measure), despite the US having spent billions on the countries. If the Pakistan stopover comes through, he may well insist on landing in full sight – to soak up the fanfare and flattery.","Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Monday it was creating a national paramilitary force, prompting concern among opposition parties and human rights groups that it could be used as a tool of political repression.The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force that will be called the Federal Constabulary, state minister for the interior Talal Chaudhry told a press conference in the eastern city of Faisalabad. Its new duties will include internal security, riot control and counter-terrorism, according to a copy of the amended law reported by the local Dunya News TV.The announcement came after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of former jailed PM Imran Khan said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of his arrest. Several such protests since his Aug 2023 arrest have turned violent, in some cases paralysing the capital Islamabad for days.“This will be a new force. This will be a stronger force. We need this force for internal security,” Chaudhry said, adding that President Asif Ali Zardari had already approved amendments in the law introducing changes in the paramilitary force.The new force replaces the Frontier Constabulary (FC), whose cadres were previously recruited only from tribes in the northwestern province, Chaudhry said.Training of the new force will bring it into line with other national law enforcement agencies, he added. Khan’s party spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari said the changes should be subject to parliamentary discussion.The new force “should not be used as a gimmick to silence political opponents, as has been previously witnessed when the government applied such laws against a large number of the PTI leadership and supporters,” he said. His concern was echoed by Haris Khalique, secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent body. “We are alarmed by the changes being made to the security and law enforcement structure of the country without any debate in parliament,” Khalique said.REUTERS","The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force.

Poliovirus found in 20 Pakistani districts amid rising vaccine refusals: New sewage data signals resurgence; 13th polio case confirmed in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/poliovirus-found-in-20-pakistani-districts-amid-rising-vaccine-refusals-new-sewage-data-signals-resurgence-13th-polio-case-confirmed-in-2025/articleshow/122421011.cms,"



Pakistan's battle against polio has hit a fresh setback, with the deadly virus detected in sewage samples across 20 districts, including the capital, just as the country grapples with rising vaccine refusal rates.According to ARY News, citing the National Reference Laboratory, 28 sewage samples collected between May 8 and June 17 tested positive for Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1). The presence of the virus was confirmed in major urban centres such as Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, as well as in districts across Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts. Lahore recorded three cases, while Islamabad and four districts in KP also registered positive samples. In Balochistan, the virus was found in Mastung, Khuzdar, and Sibi. Mirpur in PoJK also showed signs of the virus.This alarming development follows Pakistan’s second national polio vaccination drive earlier this year, which saw over 60,000 refusals, 39,000 of them in Karachi alone. These refusals, officials say, are now posing a major roadblock to the country’s eradication efforts.“We’re not just fighting a virus; we’re battling misinformation and mistrust,” a senior health official told ARY News.Pakistan remains one of only two countries where polio is still endemic, the other being Afghanistan. With the confirmation of another new case this week, the total number of polio cases in the country has reached 13 so far in 2025.Health experts warn that the virus spreads primarily through contaminated water or food and can cause paralysis or death. There is no cure for polio, making vaccination the only defense. The World Health Organisation emphasises that multiple oral doses are needed to protect children under five, the group most vulnerable to the disease.Despite ongoing national campaigns, large pockets in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain difficult to access for vaccination teams, leaving thousands of children at risk.As the virus resurfaces in urban and rural sewers alike, officials say the next phase in Pakistan’s anti-polio war must tackle both the virus, and vaccine hesitancy, with equal urgency.","Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts.

Pakistan’s economic performance under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) $7 billion loan programme has been “strong so far”, according to Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, reported PTI.Speaking at a lecture hosted by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Islamabad on Sunday, Binici said Pakistan’s first review under the three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF), approved in July 2024, was successfully completed by the IMF Executive Board in May.The EFF aims to cement macroeconomic stability and lay the groundwork for “stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth,” he said. So far, Pakistan has received two instalments under the programme, with the government implementing agreed policy measures aimed at fiscal discipline and investor confidence.“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici noted.He stressed the importance of structural reforms to ensure long-term economic sustainability, including strengthening tax equity, improving the business climate, and encouraging private-sector-led investment.Binici also welcomed Pakistan’s commitment to climate-related reforms under the $1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), approved in March.The RSF supports projects focused on disaster preparedness, efficient water use, green investments, and better climate data transparency.“Support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory,” he said.On regional prospects, Binici said economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including Pakistan, was expected to improve in 2025 and beyond. However, he warned that global economic uncertainty remains high due to trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation, and weakening cooperation.","Pakistan's economic performance under IMF's $7 billion loan programme has been'strong so far' Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, spoke at a lecture in Islamabad.

A protest over a prolonged power outage in Karachi’s Punjab Colony spiraled into city-wide traffic chaos on Saturday, underscoring what many see as chronic governance failure and energy mismanagement in Pakistan, Dawn reported.Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity. Power had reportedly been out since 11 am Friday, and despite repeated complaints, K-Electric, Karachi’s sole power distributor, allegedly failed to respond.The resulting sit-in crippled traffic on Defence Road and nearby areas. Long queues of trucks and tankers vital to Karachi Port were stalled from Qayyumabad to the KPT Flyover. Major intersections like Boat Basin, Gizri, and Hino Chowrangi were brought to a standstill, leaving thousands of commuters stranded, according to Dawn.The outage reportedly followed K-Electric’s anti-theft operation in the adjacent P&T Colony. Protesters claimed legal connections were also cut off in the sweep, with no clear procedure followed. KE, however, described the protestors as ""miscreants"" attempting to restore illegal connections and said their teams were attacked during the operation, allegedly linked to a cable TV network.No evidence was provided implicating all affected residents in theft.While KE later claimed to have restored power to parts of the area, the larger issue remains unresolved. The incident highlights Pakistan’s ongoing struggle to provide reliable electricity, exacerbated by outdated infrastructure and lack of accountability in power distribution.As Dawn noted, the crisis is less about one blackout and more a reflection of systemic dysfunction, where citizens bear the brunt of institutional failure.","Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity.

PESHAWAR: An under-construction government primary school for girls in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was damaged in an IED blast by unknown militants, police said on Friday.No casualties were reported as the building was unoccupied at the time of the explosion.Militants had planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School in Baka Khel police jurisdiction of Bannu district.The device was detonated with a powerful blast, causing substantial structural damage to the building.An FIR has been registered and forensic teams have been deployed to collect evidence from the blast site, police said.Authorities have condemned the attack as an attempt to derail educational development in the region.According to a report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, more than 1,100 girls' schools have been destroyed in the tribal areas between 2007 to 2017, with teachers and young students also targeted.Before an all-out military operation launched by Pakistan's security forces in 2014, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) carried out hundreds of attacks on girls' schools in the tribal areas and settled districts of the northwestern province from its stronghold in Swat district.After the crackdown, TTP militants fled to Afghanistan and began to orchestrate cross border attacks from their new sanctuaries.The Taliban takeover of Kabul has emboldened the TTP, which is fighting to regain control of its strongholds in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Since the takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has banned girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and banned women from universities.Pakistani Taliban, who are ideologically closer to Afghan Taliban, are trying to enforce a similar anti-education and theocratic agenda in Pakistan's tribal areas by force.The youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, who is from Swat district, was shot in the face when she was 14 by TTP gunmen in 2012 as she wanted to pursue her education.","Militants planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School.

Brown-coloured insects were reportedly present, especially in the hair, but no maggots were found.Because of the severe state of decay, experts were unable to determine the exact cause of death at this stage. However, DNA profiling and toxicology tests are underway and are expected to offer further insight.Initially, police said that her family refused to take the body. “Her family members have flatly refused to own her or take the body for burial,” DIG South Zone Asad Reza said, adding they claimed to have severed all ties with her two years ago. He said the case posed unusual challenges, especially since her death had gone unnoticed for such a long time and no neighbours appeared to have raised any concerns.Geo News later confirmed that her family received the remains on Thursday and transported them to Lahore by ambulance.","Pakistani actress and model Humaira Asghar Ali was found dead in her Karachi apartment.

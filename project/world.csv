"US to hike tariff on Colombia, calls Petro a ‘lunatic’ — will Trump’s aid freeze push relations to the brink?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-to-hike-tariff-on-colombia-calls-petro-a-lunatic-will-trumps-aid-freeze-push-relations-to-the-brink/articleshow/124697926.cms,"Will aid cuts and new tariffs affect US-Colombia relations?

How ties strained between US and Colombia?







US President Donald Trump said on Sunday night he would raise tariffs on Colombia and stop all payments to the South American nation.Calling Colombia's President Gustavo Petro a lunatic, Trump said that the country has become a drug manufacturing machine, and he is doing nothing to stop the production.While talking to reporters, Trump said, ""They are a drug manufacturing machine, Colombia, and we're not going to be part of it. So we're going to drop all money that we're giving to them. They have, it has nothing to do with them stopping drug production.""""And you look at the fields. The fields are loaded up with drugs, and they refine the drugs and they make tremendous amounts of cocaine, and they send it all over the world and they destroy families. No, Colombia is out of control. And now they have the worst president they've ever had. He's a lunatic who's got a lot of problems, mental problems,"" he added.When asked about the Lindsey Graham's claim that US will slap tariff on Colombia in coming days, Trump said that he read his statement and it is ""correct."" and added that he will announce on Monday.The move escalates tensions between Washington and one of its closest allies in Latin America.In a social media post, Trump described Petro as “an illegal drug leader” who is “low rated and very unpopular.” The Republican president warned that Petro “better close up” drug operations “or the United States will close them up for him, and it won’t be done nicely.”Petro, who is active on social media, rejected Trump’s accusations and defended his efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia, the world’s largest exporter of cocaine, AP news agency reported.“Trying to promote peace in Colombia is not being a drug trafficker,” Petro wrote. He suggested Trump was being deceived by his advisers, described himself as “the main enemy” of drugs in his country, and accused Trump of being “rude and ignorant toward Colombia.”The Colombian Foreign Ministry characterised Trump’s statement as a “direct threat to national sovereignty by proposing an illegal intervention in Colombian territory.”Trump’s latest remarks against Petro heighten the possibility of an expanding clash in Latin America, where the U.S. has already increased pressure on neighbouring Venezuela and its leader, Nicolás Maduro.American naval ships, fighter jets and drones are deployed in the region for what the administration has described as an “armed conflict” with drug cartels. Trump also authorised covert operations inside Venezuela.Unlike Venezuela, Colombia is a longtime U.S. ally and the top recipient of American assistance in the region. However, coca cultivation reached an all-time high last year, according to the United Nations, and there has been renewed violence in rural areas where the govt spent years battling insurgents before reaching a peace deal a decade ago.In September, the Trump administration accused Colombia of failing to cooperate in the drug war, although at the time Washington issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered aid cuts. Colombia received an estimated Rs 1,909 crore in the U.S. budget year that ended September 30, a drop from recent years that exceeded Rs 5,810 crore, according to U.S. figures.Petro, Colombia’s first leftist president, has repeatedly feuded with Trump this year. Petro initially rejected US military flights of deported migrants, leading Trump to threaten tariffs. The State Department stated it would revoke Petro’s visa when he attended the UN General Assembly in New York because he told American soldiers to disobey Trump’s orders.","US President Donald Trump said on Sunday night he would raise tariffs on Colombia and stop all payments to the South American nation.

Cairo hosts urgent talks to advance ceasefire





Gaza’s week-old ceasefire — brokered by the US to end two years of relentless war — came under its first major strain on Sunday. Israeli forces launched a series of deadly airstrikes across the enclave after accusing Hamas militants of ambushing troops in Rafah and killing two soldiers.The strikes, which Gaza officials said killed at least 36 Palestinians including children, briefly halted the transfer of humanitarian aid before both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the ceasefire.US President Donald Trump said the truce “remains in place” but acknowledged “some shooting” by Hamas, while Egypt and other mediators worked urgently to prevent the situation from spiralling back into war.Here are 10 things to know about the latest developments in Gaza amid the fragile truce with Israel:The Israeli military said it carried out widespread air and artillery strikes after Hamas fighters allegedly opened fire on its troops in Rafah, within areas under Israeli control as per the ceasefire map.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said fighter jets struck “dozens of terror targets” and used over 120 munitions to destroy a six-kilometre-long underground tunnel network belonging to Hamas.Footage released by the IDF showed troops striking multiple sites across the Gaza Strip, with plumes of fire and smoke rising from the targeted areas.In an official statement, the military said, ""The IDF attacked dozens of terror targets of the Hamas terror organization in the Gaza Strip.The IDF, led by the Southern Command, attacked in recent hours using fighter jets and aircraft of the Air Force and artillery, dozens of terror targets of the Hamas terror organization throughout the Gaza Strip, following the violation of a ceasefire agreement earlier today.""The IDF added that the underground route it struck was used by Hamas “to advance terror plans against the State of Israel.”The IDF also said its forces identified several armed militants moving toward troops in the Beit Lahiya area, beyond the designated “yellow line,” and struck them after they crossed it in violation of the ceasefire.Hamas rejected Israel’s claims, saying it had no active units in Rafah and that communication with its fighters there had been cut for months. The group accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government of “violating the ceasefire” to justify renewed attacks.Health officials in Gaza reported at least 36 deaths, including children and women, in strikes across central and southern areas.Al-Awda hospital said it received 24 bodies from Israeli attacks on the Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps. Another strike on a coffeehouse in Zawaida killed six people, while four, including two children, died in Khan Younis.According to Gaza’s Health Ministry, over 68,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began in October 2023. The toll includes both civilians and fighters. Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took 251 hostages in the initial assault. Thousands remain missing in Gaza, and famine and disease continue to stalk the battered enclave as fragile diplomacy hangs in the balance.An Israeli security official confirmed that aid shipments into Gaza were paused following the escalation. Deliveries will resume on Monday, he said, adding that the temporary halt was due to “security considerations.” The Rafah crossing with Egypt — the only one not controlled by Israel before the war — remains closed “until further notice.”US President Donald Trump, speaking aboard Air Force One, insisted that the ceasefire “remains in place” but admitted Hamas had been “quite rambunctious.” ""They (Hamas) have been doing some shooting, and we think maybe the leadership isn't involved in that — that it's some rebels within — but either way... it's going to be handle toughly, but properly.""Vice President JD Vance said on Sunday that he might travel to Israel soon to “check on how things are going.” He described the ceasefire as entering a stage of “fits and starts,” reflecting the administration’s cautious optimism about the truce’s endurance.Vance says that a member of the Trump administration was “certainly” going to visit Israel “in the next few days” to monitor the situation. He does not confirm who that would be, but says, “it might be me.”The Israeli government on Sunday overwhelmingly approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s proposal to rename the Gaza conflict “The War of Revival,” replacing the previous title, “Swords of Iron"", reported Times of Israel.The move, backed by Defense Minister Israel Katz, has stirred controversy, with critics accusing Netanyahu of trying to distance himself from responsibility for failing to prevent the October 7, 2023 Hamas assault that ignited the war.Although the official name has now changed, many Israelis continue to refer to the conflict simply as the “October 7 war.”Seven recently released hostages were discharged from Sheba Medical Center and greeted by crowds waving Israeli and American flags, as reported by Times of Israel.Among them were the Cunio brothers, the Berman twins, and survivors of the Nova music festival attack. Their joyful reunions — marked by dancing, singing, and emotional speeches — underscored the deep public relief after two years of anguish.Israel identified two more hostages — Ronen Engel from Kibbutz Nir Oz and Thai agricultural worker Sonthaya Oakkharasri — whose remains were handed over by Hamas.Both were believed killed during the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack that triggered the war. So far, Hamas has returned 12 of the 28 bodies agreed upon under the ceasefire deal.Egypt, which helped broker the truce, is leading “round-the-clock” talks with Hamas and other Palestinian factions in Cairo.Negotiators are working to stabilise the situation and move toward the next phase of the ceasefire — which includes Hamas’s disarmament, Israeli troop withdrawal from more areas, and the creation of an internationally backed governing authority for Gaza.","US President Donald Trump said the truce “remains in place” but acknowledged “some shooting” by Hamas.

US President Donald Trump has once again claimed credit for averting a potential war between India and Pakistan, saying he used the threat of steep trade tariffs to stop the two nuclear-armed neighbours from ""going at it. ""Speaking to Fox News on Sunday (local time), Trump said his administration leveraged economic pressure to defuse tensions following India’s Operation Sindoor in May, when forces carried out precision strikes on nine terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.""They were going at it — seven planes were shot down.

We're going to put on a 200 per cent tariff.It'll make it impossible for you to do business',"" Trump asserted.This isn't the first time Trump has boasted of ""ending"" conflicts through tariffs.

Dozens of journalists walked out of the Pentagon on Wednesday rather than agree to new MAGA rules limiting their reporting.This led to many condemnations, including that of Indian-origin Congressman Suhas Subramanyam, who called the restrictions an attack on press freedom and slammed US defence secretary Pete HegsethSubramanyam posted his official statement on X, “My statement on the Administration's attacks on the First Amendment and the Pentagon Press Corps.” He also said, “Make no mistake, Secretary Hegseth's attempts to restrict reporters are an attack on freedom of the press, the First Amendment, and our democracy. The American people deserve transparency through accurate and fair reporting. Rather than attacking the messengers of his failed policies, Secretary Hegseth should instead consider doing more to support servicemembers and their families and keep our country safe.”The walkout followed new rules imposed by Hegseth that would allow the Pentagon to expel journalists for reporting on information that had not been approved for release. News organisations rejected the rules, calling them a threat to independent reporting. They see the rules as a way to spoon-feed information and control the narrative.Reporters began leaving; they carried chairs, documents, copying machines, books, and old photos to the parking lot as they handed in their badges.Around 40 to 50 journalists left the Pentagon together, reports the Associated Press.Hegseth has previously limited access to many areas of the Pentagon, held only two formal press briefings, and launched investigations into leaks to the media. He described the new rules as “common sense.""US President Donald Trump backed the new policy, telling reporters at the White House on Tuesday, “I think he finds the press to be very disruptive in terms of world peace. The press is very dishonest.”Several reporters posted on social media when they turned in their badges. Heather Mongilio of USNINews wrote, “It’s such a tiny thing, but I was really proud to see my picture up on the wall of Pentagon correspondents. Today, I’ll hand in my badge. The reporting will continue.”NPR reporter Tom Bowman noted that sources will continue to provide crucial information. “With no reporters able to ask questions, it seems the Pentagon leadership will continue to rely on slick social media posts, carefully orchestrated short videos and interviews with partisan commentators and podcasters. No one should think that’s good enough,” he said.The Pentagon Press Association, representing 101 reporters from 56 news outlets, opposed the rules. Most organisations instructed their reporters to leave rather than submit.","Dozens of journalists walked out of the Pentagon on Wednesday rather than agree to new MAGA rules limiting their reporting.

US Vice President JD Vance has stepped in to defend US defence secretary Pete Hegseth after social media was grilling him over the colour of his tie during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.The row began when photos from the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting at the White House showed Hegseth wearing a tie in white, blue, and red — colours that some claimed resembled the Russian tricolour flag.The photos went viral, with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Special Envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, sharing Hegseth’s photo on social media alongside a Russian flag emoji, adding fuel to the fire.Vance responded to the continuous trolling on social media, slamming critics who were reading too much into the tie’s design. “Or maybe he was wearing the colors of America,” he said on X, reposting commentary from American YouTuber and former US Army officer Jake Broe, who was among the first ones to share the viral image and claiming that ""these people love Putin and Russia.""Despite Vance’s defence, most netizens remained unconvinced. Commenters argued that if the tie truly represented the American flag, it should have included stars or a different pattern.Some users even dug up an online listing for what appeared to be the same tie, described in the product details as a “Russian plain flag tie,” adding to the speculation.The photo was captured during Ukrainian President Zelenskyy’s visit to Washington on Thursday, when he met US President Donald Trump for talks that included a public briefing and a private lunch. Trump later said he intended to work with Ukraine to persuade Putin to end the war, but confirmed that Kyiv would not receive Tomahawk missiles.Meanwhile, in Ukraine, Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba said Russia had launched drone and missile attacks on energy and transport infrastructure ahead of winter, targeting power stations, substations, and railway lines.","US Vice President JD Vance responds to criticism of Pete Hegseth's tie.

Zero personal income tax: Poland introduces new law for parents with two children – What it means for families,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/zero-personal-income-tax-poland-introduces-new-law-for-parents-with-two-children-what-it-means-for-families/articleshow/124671648.cms,"(AI-generated image)

Details of the Bill



Economic goals



Who will benefit/suffer



Public reception







Poland’s president, Karol Nawrocki, has approved a new law that removes personal income tax for parents raising at least two children.The move is aimed at supporting families, boosting household income, and stimulating the economy.The bill was presented in August. It removes the income tax obligation for families earning up to 140,000 zloty (€32,973) per year. It applies to all parents with legal responsibility for children, including legal guardians and foster parents.According to calculations by the presidency, an average Polish family is expected to be around 1,000 zloty (€235) better off each month due to the new tax relief. However, the full impact of the law will only be visible in the 2026 tax return, which will be filed in 2027.The reform is part of a broader effort to reduce the tax burden on families, increase disposable income, encourage professional activity, and stimulate consumption. Nawrocki made zero personal income tax (PIT) a central promise during his presidential campaign. He first announced the measure in March as part of his ""Contract with the Poles,"" pledging to implement it from the first day of his presidency. After winning the June run-off, he signed the bill in August 8 before sending it to the Sejm, Poland’s parliament.Zero PIT is also part of a package known as the ""tax armour,"" which includes a reduction in VAT from 23 per cent to 22 per cent, the abolition of capital gains tax, and the introduction of a quota-based pension indexation.Experts note that the benefits of the new tax law are likely to be greater for wealthier families. Piotr Juszczyk, chief tax adviser at inFakt, said, “Low-income families, who pay little or no income tax, will gain a negligible amount while those with high incomes will benefit the most.”Families earning 7,000 zloty (€1,648) a month can expect a relief of around 395 zloty (€93) per month, while those earning 12,000 zloty (€2,826) per month could save 913 zloty (€215) monthly, or over 11,000 zloty (€2,590) annually. Families earning the lowest national income will see only minimal savings, and those already below the tax-free threshold will see no change.Public outlook was largely positive. During consultations on 11 September, 476 people participated, with 76% supporting the new law and 66% approving the economic and financial assessment presented by the president. Only a small minority, around 16%, expressed strong opposition.","Poland's president Karol Nawrocki has approved a new law that removes personal income tax for parents raising at least two children.

Behind closed-door meetings at White House, US President Donald Trump urged his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to accept Vladimir Putin’s terms to end the war, warning that Russia would “destroy” Ukraine if it refused.The meeting between the US and Ukrainian leaders on Friday descended several times into a “shouting match”, with Trump “cursing all the time”, according to Financial Times.In the meeting, US president discarded maps of the frontline in Ukraine, insisted Zelenskyy surrender the entire Donbas region to Putin, and repeatedly echoed talking points that the Russian leader had made during their call the day before.The meeting occurred amid a renewed push by Trump to end Russia’s war following the ceasefire secured between Israel and Hamas. Zelenskyy and his team visited the White House hoping to persuade Trump to supply them with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles. However, the US president ultimately declined to do so.During Friday’s meeting, Trump appeared to have adopted many of Putin’s talking points verbatim, even when they contradicted his own recent statements about Russia’s weaknesses, European officials briefed on the meeting said.According to a European official with knowledge of the meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy that Putin had told him the conflict was a “special operation, not even a war”, adding that the Ukrainian leader needed to cut a deal or face destruction.The official said that Trump told Zelenskyy he was losing the war, warning: “If [Putin] wants it, he will destroy you.”At one point in the meeting, the US president threw Ukraine’s maps of the battlefield aside, the official familiar with the encounter said.According to the official, Trump said he was “sick” of seeing the map of the frontline of Ukraine repeatedly. “This red line, I don’t even know where this is. I’ve never been there,” Trump said, according to the official.Trump also said that Russia’s economy is “doing great”, the official said, in a sharp contrast to his recent public remarks in which he urged Putin to negotiate because his “economy is going to collapse”.Trump appeared influenced by a Thursday call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which Putin proposed a territorial swap.According to The Washington Post, the plan would see Ukraine cede the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in exchange for small parts of the southern regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.US officials presented essentially the same swap to Zelenskyy during a Friday meeting. Ukrainians view the territories they still control in Donetsk and Luhansk as strategically critical, warning that surrendering them would leave the rest of Ukraine far more vulnerable to Russian offensives. One official described giving up western Donetsk and Luhansk as akin to “suicide.”Reuters reported that US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff was among the officials most forcefully pushing Ukraine to accept the proposal. Witkoff reportedly emphasized that Donetsk and Luhansk have large Russian-speaking populations, a point he has made publicly in previous statements.Zelenskyy on Sunday called on allies not to appease Russia, following a US trip in which he failed to secure long-range Tomahawk missile supplies.Zelenskyy had traveled to Washington hoping to leverage growing US frustration with Putin after a stalled summit in Alaska. However, he left empty-handed as President Donald Trump pursues a fresh diplomatic breakthrough following last week’s Gaza ceasefire.“Ukraine will never grant terrorists any bounty for their crimes, and we count on our partners to uphold this very position,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media upon returning home. He also called for “decisive steps” from European and American allies and urged another meeting of the European-led “coalition of the willing.”Recent data from Germany’s Kiel Institute shows foreign military support to Ukraine fell by 43% in July and August compared with the first half of the year. The decline is partly attributed to Nato's Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (PURL), which pools European contributions for US-made weapons but excludes direct American financing.","US President Donald Trump urged his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to accept Vladimir Putin’s terms to end the war.

The controversial report on Hindutva in America







The Hindu American Foundation expressed its objection to an upcoming conference sponsored by Rutgers University targeting the Hindu American community in the United States and asked the university to dissociate itself from the event. The event titled 'Hindutva in America: A threat to Equality and Religious Pluralism' will be held on October 27 to discuss a report that was released six months ago. The report called Hindutva in America an 'ethnonationalist threat' to equality and religious pluralism.The Hindu American Foundation issued an open letter addressing the university, asking it to distance from the event.

There are lessons from Nixon era in Trump's bid to freeze spending,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/there-are-lessons-from-nixon-era-in-trumps-bid-to-freeze-spending/articleshow/124692849.cms,"



WASHINGTON: Before President Donald Trump asserted that he had the constitutional power to refuse to release money that Congress had directed him to spend, another president made that same bold claim. It did not end well. ""The constitutional right for the president to impound funds,"" President Richard Nixon said at a 1973 news conference, was ""absolutely clear.""Nixon said he had the unilateral right to block - or impound - billions of dollars that Congress had appropriated for medical research, higher education, public housing, the environment and other projects.In that era, Congress, jealous of its place in the constitutional structure, pushed back, enacting the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to protect its power of the purse. Weakened by the Watergate scandal that would cause his resignation that year, Nixon signed the bill.In the second Trump administration, though, impoundments are back, in one of many signs that President Trump is trying to shift power over all facets of American life from Congress to the presidency.He is following through on a campaign promise to wage an assault on the Nixon-era law - one that can likely only be settled by the Supreme Court . ""This disaster of a law is clearly unconstitutional, a blatant violation of the separation of powers,"" Trump said in 2023.""Bringing back impoundment,"" he added, ""will give us a tool with which to obliterate the deep state, drain the swamp and starve the warmongers.""The Impoundment Control Act reinforced what its sponsors said the Constitution required: that the president must faithfully execute congressional commands, including those concerning spending. Among other things, the law required presidents to ask Congress for permission before refusing to spend, or ""rescinding,"" appropriated funds. The law gave Congress the choice of whether to grant those requests through new law. Later presidents followed the procedure, and Congress granted many, though not all, rescission requests.The Constitution gives Congress the primary role in govt spending, saying that ""no money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law."" It requires the president to execute the laws faithfully.In asking the Supreme Court last month to let the Trump administration cancel more than $4 billion in foreign aid, D John Sauer, the solicitor general, said he was not pressing a constitutional challenge to the law. Rather, he said the law placed limits on who can sue over it and for what. In an unsigned opinion over the dissents of the three liberal justices, the court sided with the administration.Aided by a pliant Congress, Trump has thus far made good on his campaign pledge to use impoundments aggressively. The breadth of Trump's claimed power is particularly salient given the shutdown, said Alan Morrison, a law professor at George Washington University who has filed briefs opposing the Trump administration's spending freezes. In ending earlier shutdowns, Morrison said, the two parties made a deal and enacted legislation reflecting it. But now, he said, expansive use of impoundments undercuts Democrats' motivation to compromise. ""This time,"" he added, ""if you have a deal, the Democrats know that Trump is going to impound all what they want and spend all the things they don't want.""","Nixon said he had the unilateral right to block - or impound - billions of dollars. Congress, jealous of its place in the constitutional structure, pushed back. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 was enacted to protect its power of the purse.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124692849,imgsize-1649194,width-400,resizemode-4/124692849.jpg"

In a series of fiery emails, Epstein piled on the pressure, demanding millions to keep his high-flying lifestyle intact and warning that Black’s kids and advisors were bungling the cash flow like a sitcom of the absurd.New York Times reported Epstein warned that Black’s financial advisors and “retarded” children had created a “really dangerous mess” by attempting to restrict the cash flow, according to the obtained emails.In a November 2-2015 email to the Apollo Global Management founder, Epstein said, “I never want to have any more uncomfortable money moments with you, I find it very distasteful.”Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were closely associated with Black, who employed Epstein as his wealth management advisor. Black paid Epstein over $150 million for services ranging from tax guidance to managing his art collection, even after Epstein was charged in 2004 for molesting a teenage girl, which resulted in his placement on the sex offender registry.By 2016, Black attempted to reduce the financial support to Epstein, leading to a barrage of demanding emails from Epstein. “So to be clear, my terms are as follows. I will only work for the usual 40 million per year.It needs to be paid, 25 million upon signing an agreement. 5 million every two months thereafter for six months, i.e., March, May, June.This can begin if I am able in January. I will immediately stop work if the payment is not received,” Epstein wrote. The emails illustrate the strong relationship between Epstein and Black, who were not only close friends but also business associates.Black, aged 74, continued to funnel millions in fees and loans to Epstein until Epstein's arrest in 2019 for his decades-long sex trafficking schemes. Leon Black, chairman and chief executive officer of Apollo Global Management LLC, was eventually ousted from the company in 2021 due to his ties with Epstein, which dated back to 1990.Black has denied any knowledge of Epstein’s illicit activities. Susan Estrich, Black’s lawyer, stated that all payments were solely for legitimate tax and estate planning services, as confirmed by an independent law firm hired by Apollo. “To imply that Epstein somehow had influence over Black is false and patently absurd,” Estrich said.Despite Black’s assertions, one woman accused him of raping her in Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse, although the case was later dropped. Another former girlfriend filed a lawsuit claiming sexual assault, which was dismissed after she received $9.5 million as part of a nondisclosure agreement following their six-year relationship. Additionally, Black allegedly wired hundreds of thousands of rupees to at least three women associated with Epstein for undisclosed reasons.Whit Clay, a spokesman for Black, emphasized that the billionaire “very much regrets” ever making payments to Epstein. The pressure campaign by Epstein appeared to have an effect, as Black continued the financial support until Epstein's legal troubles escalated in 2019.",Leon Black paid Epstein over $150 million for services ranging from tax guidance to managing his art collection.

A son’s certainty, a father’s hesitation





The shadow of Fred Trump

Too Much and Never Enough

Lessons of ambition, loss, and privilege











Embodying the father

The moral reckoning





If Donald Trump’s late-stage efforts to negotiate peace in Ukraine, mediate conflicts in the Middle East, and save lives are tied to a biblical reckoning, they would be framed by two stark verses: Romans 3:23,and James 2:17,In the twilight of his life, Trump confronts this moral ledger in ways few expected. While his son Eric insists that his father is heaven-bound, Trump himself harbors profound reservations, not only about his own eternal fate, but even about whether his father, Fred Trump, has earned a place among the saved. Forged under the relentless ambition, exacting expectations, and ruthless example of his father, these late acts of what could be called redemption are a conscious attempt to rewrite the moral account by which he fears he will ultimately be judged, a personal reckoning, a bid for grace, and a recognition that judgment, ultimately, belongs to God alone.“I don’t think there’s anything going to get me in heaven. I think I’m not maybe heaven bound. I may be in heaven right now as we fly in Air Force One, I’m not sure. I’m going to be able to make heaven. But I’ve made life a lot better for a lot of people,” Donald Trump admitted aboard Air Force One as he traveled to Egypt to attend a peace summit, revealing a level of doubt few would expect from a man so accustomed to certainty.This is not the first time he has questioned his eternal fate.Earlier in candid interviews with Fox News interviews, he said, “I want to try and get to heaven if possible… I’m hearing I’m not doing well. I hear I’m really at the bottom of the totem pole.”In parallel, his son Eric shows no such doubt. In a recent appearance on the Benny Show podcast, he confidently insisted his father is heaven-bound, saying, “Make no mistake, he is heaven-bound.” a certainty that seems almost naive compared with his father’s own wavering reflections.Trump’s efforts to end conflicts around the world, including mediating the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and engaging with Ukrainian and Russian leaders, reflect his attempt at moral accounting. While the Nobel Peace Prize has eluded him for these interventions, he now looks to spiritual redemption and eternity as a consolation, framing his global peace efforts as part of a larger, existential wager. As he told Fox News, “If I can get to heaven, this will be one of the reasons. ""Perhaps the more troubling idea is his view of his father’s fate. At a rally in Madison Square Garden in October, Trump reflected on his parents and his own fate, saying, “Now my beautiful parents are up in heaven, I think they are. They're up there, looking down. They say, 'How did this happen to my son?’ I know my mother's in heaven. I'm not 100% sure about my father, but it's close.” So why the shadow of doubt? Why does Donald Trump think his father may not be in heaven?Donald Trump’s relationship with his father, Fred Sr., was never ordinary. It was a crucible of power, control, and expectation—one that left lasting imprints on the younger Trump’s psyche. Fred Sr. ruled his household and business empire with meticulous rigor and a sharp moral code of winning at all costs. Mary Trump, a trained psychologist and Donald’s first niece, offers a piercing memoir in her book titled:, exposing the family’s inner workings and the psychological toll of living under Fred Sr.’s dominance. She characterizes Fred Sr. as a “high-functioning sociopath,” shaping his children through relentless discipline and a transactional lens on life. Donald, she writes, was effectively the “second choice,” following his older brother Fred Jr., whose charisma and position as the heir apparent initially drew his father’s focus.Watching Fred Jr. struggle and ultimately succumb to alcoholism at the age of 42, Donald internalized a brutal lesson: weakness invites ruin. The family saga made it clear that survival—professional, personal, and perhaps moral—required discipline, aggression, and an unflinching drive to win. Marc Fisher of The Washington Post observes that even in early childhood, Donald learned to see the world through the prism of his father’s business: collecting rents in Brooklyn and Queens, navigating political favors at local Democratic clubs, and prioritizing results above all else. In this world, relationships were secondary, compassion was optional, and victory was nonnegotiable.Yet wealth and privilege were never absent from this equation. From the start, Donald and his siblings were heirs to a vast fortune. Mary Trump’s research highlights that even as a toddler, Donald was already receiving substantial sums from his father’s various trusts, reaching millions annually well into adulthood. Money insulated him, but it did not soften the relentless moral calculus imposed by Fred Sr., a man whose life revolved around winning, influence, and the bottom line, often bending rules and skirting conventional ethics to achieve his aims.It is this very philosophy that Donald Trump internalized and embodied, both in action and worldview. As he expanded the family real estate empire and cultivated his persona as a mogul, he applied the same playbook: intimidation, coercion, and bending—or breaking—the rules were tools, not transgressions, all in service of the singular objective he had inherited from his father: winning.Compounding these lessons were the personal losses and traumas that punctuated his upbringing. Donald’s mother, Mary Anne Trump, was perfunctorily attentive before health crises rendered her largely absent, creating a profound emotional void. Observing his older brother Fred Jr.’s downward spiral and early death at 42, as well as his younger brother Robert Trump’s quieter struggles in life and business, and navigating the rigid household rules instilled by both parents, Donald was forced to confront the fragility of human life and character. Even in his youthful displays of aggression—pushing classmates around, wielding a broomstick against disobedient peers, and later thriving in the strict confines of the New York Military Academy—Trump’s behavior reflected both the internalization of his father’s philosophy and a defensive posture shaped by trauma, a biographer Stephen Mansfield notes. It was a life lived under constant calculation: assert dominance, secure loyalty, and never expose weakness. Mary Trump observes that these early experiences, emotional neglect, exposure to familial suffering, and the shadow of mortality, helped forge Donald’s sense of existential caution and a profound, if complicated, moral pragmatismIt is against this backdrop that Trump’s doubts about his father’s ultimate fate become comprehensible. He saw Fred Sr. as a man of extraordinary ambition and wealth, but also of ruthless pragmatism and transactional morality—a figure who broke rules to win, amassed vast riches, and wielded power with little concern for fairness or sentiment. The fortune he inherited, the lessons of relentless drive, and the vivid example of a brother destroyed by weakness left him with a lingering question: could a man so focused on victory and wealth ever be judged as just? And if his father might not be in heaven, could he himself escape the same fate? Having lost his mother early and never fully known her in life, Trump expresses certainty that she is in heaven, but remains unsure about his father. Donald’s candid doubts about his own eternal fate take on a chilling logic: having modeled himself so closely after Fred Sr., he fears inheriting not just his father’s wealth and influence, but also his spiritual liabilities.","In the twilight of his life, Donald Trump confronts this moral ledger in ways few expected.

Trump Losing Allies In U.S. Backyard After ‘Sub’ Attack? Petro Explodes | 'Troops Sedated Colombian'





US President Donald Trump lashed out at Colombia ’s leader, Gustavo Petro, calling him “an illegal drug leader” and announcing that the United States will cut all aid to the South American nation. Trump made the declaration on his Truth Social platform on Sunday, accusing Petro of encouraging “the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields, all over Columbia (sic). ”The 47th POTUS, wrote: “Petro does nothing to stop it, despite large scale payments and subsidies from the USA that are nothing more than a long term rip off of America. AS OF TODAY, THESE PAYMENTS, OR ANY OTHER FORM OF PAYMENT, OR SUBSIDIES, WILL NO LONGER BE MADE TO COLUMBIA.”He added that Petro, “a low rated and very unpopular leader, with a fresh mouth toward America, better close up these killing fields immediately, or the United States will close them up for him, and it won’t be done nicely. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”The move marks the latest sign of tension between Washington and one of its closest allies in Latin America. Colombia is the world’s largest exporter of cocaine, with coca cultivation hitting record levels last year, according to the United Nations.The Trump administration had previously accused Bogotá of failing to cooperate in the drug war, although a waiver issued in September temporarily avoided sanctions.The announcement comes amid controversy over a series of U.S. military strikes in Caribbean waters targeting suspected drug traffickers. Earlier this week, Trump claimed credit for destroying a “very large DRUG-CARRYING SUBMARINE” carrying fentanyl and other narcotics. “There were four known narcoterrorists on board the vessel. Two of the terrorists were killed,” he wrote, adding that the remaining two survivors, from Ecuador and Colombia, would be returned “for detention and prosecution. ” He estimated that the interdiction potentially saved “at least 25,000 Americans.”Petro has sharply criticised the strikes, accusing the United States of killing an innocent Colombian fisherman, Alejandro Carranza, in a September 16 attack.

China successfully launched a Pakistani remote sensing satellite into orbit on Sunday, accompanied by two of its own satellites, underscoring the deepening space collaboration between the two long-time allies.A Lijian-1 Y8 carrier rocket carrying three satellites—the Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite (PRSS-2) and China’s AIRSAT 03 and 04—was launched from a commercial aerospace innovation pilot zone in northwest China. The launch successfully placed all three satellites into their planned orbits, according to state-run Xinhua news agency.A remote sensing satellite is equipped with specialised sensors and cameras that observe and measure the physical characteristics of the Earth or other areas from space.It collects data on things like forest fires, temperature changes in oceans, cloud patterns, volcanic activity, urban growth, farmland changes, and the topography of the ocean floor. This helps scientists and researchers monitor large-scale environmental and geographic changes over time, according to USGS.This mission marks the third Pakistani satellite China has helped launch this year, following PRSS-1 in July and PRSC-EO1 in January.In recent years, China has played a key role in expanding Pakistan’s space capabilities, including the launch of a multi-mission communication satellite last year.Back in 2018, China also deployed two Pakistani satellites: PRSS-1, Pakistan’s first optical remote sensing satellite, and PakTES-1A, a smaller observation satellite.","China successfully launched a Pakistani remote sensing satellite into orbit on Sunday.

Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire after several days of deadly cross-border clashes, Qatar’s foreign ministry said on Sunday.

Pakistan's field marshal Asim Munir has yet again engaged in anti-India rhetoric issuing veiled nuclear and economic threats while claiming that the ""misconceived"" immunity of India's geographic vastness will be shattered by the reach and lethality of their weapon systems.Speaking at the Pakistan military academy in Abbotabad (where Osama Bin Laden lived and was killed by the US) on Saturday, the rabble-rouser army chief threatened that a response far beyond the expectations of the initiators (India/Afghanistan) can be expected, if a fresh wave of hostilities is triggered.""With diminishing distinction between combat and communication zones, the reach and lethality of our weapon systems will shatter the misconceived immunity of India's geographic vastness,"" he added.He cautioned and advised the India's military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment.

What's happening?

Operation Sindoor and the Muridke connection





A state at war with itself





An imploding picture









“You can’t keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbours.”External affairs minister S Jaishankar issued a stern warning to Pakistan at the United Nations in 2022. Three years later, Pakistan is yet to mend its ways, and the warning rings truer than ever. Then, both leaders accused Pakistan of nurturing terror groups for strategic leverage. Now, the country is confronting the full consequences of that strategy.Pakistan is in turmoil at all fronts, and at the centre of the latest crisis lies Muridke - the same city India struck during Operation Sindoor , a swift 22-minute campaign that targeted terror hubs including Markaz Taiba, the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba.This week, Muridke is again in the spotlight as it turned volatile after Pakistan’s law enforcement cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP). The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.In a move dripping with irony, the provincial chief minister chaired what her office called an ""extraordinary"" meeting, ordering arrests of ""extremist leaders"" and seizure of assets linked to the same group once courted by the establishment.Over 2,700 people have been detained, and Section 144 has been imposed across Punjab, banning gatherings and protests.Mosques associated with the TLP have been sealed, its social media accounts suspended, and its top brass is being added to Pakistan’s Fourth Schedule—a list of individuals suspected of terrorism or sectarianism.Officials have also announced plans to recommend a federal ban on the party, freeze its assets, and prosecute its leaders under anti-terror laws. AI tools are being deployed to track wanted individuals.Authorities say the TLP’s so-called ""Gaza solidarity"" march to Islamabad had turned, as one official put it, ""bloody as always.""The timing and geography of the crackdown are significant. Muridke was among the nine key sites targeted during Operation Sindoor in May following the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.During the four-day campaign, the Indian Air Force destroyed at least six Pakistani fighter jets, two high-value surveillance aircraft, a C-130 transport plane, over ten drones, several cruise missiles, and radar installations.One of its central objectives was Markaz Taiba, Lashkar-e-Taiba’s nerve centre in Muridke — just 25 km from the International Border. The facility, built with donations reportedly including Rs 10 lakh from Osama bin Laden, trained the 26/11 Mumbai attackers.For decades, Pakistan’s national security doctrine rested on militant proxies—to gain ""strategic depth"" against India and influence over Afghanistan. That policy has now imploded.Islamabad is fighting multiple insurgencies at once - from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) in Balochistan, and even rogue Taliban factions across the Durand Line.According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), more than 2,400 security personnel have been killed in 2025 so far—the bloodiest year since 2015. The violence is now driven by what analysts call a ""Quad of Terror"": the TTP, Baloch insurgents, Islamic State–Khorasan (IS-K), and Taliban breakaway groups.Since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul, Pakistan’s western frontier has unravelled. The TTP, long sheltered in Afghanistan, now launches near-daily attacks. The BLA targets Chinese projects in Gwadar and convoys in Balochistan. Despite repeated military operations, the insurgency only appears to be deepening.Drone strikes, air raids, and mass arrests have failed to stem the violence. Meanwhile, reports of enforced disappearances, civilian casualties, and militarisation have eroded public trust, especially in Balochistan.The TLP ban, border tensions with Afghanistan, and the fallout of Operation Sindoor together expose a grim truth that India has warned of several times: Pakistan’s long experiment with extremism has backfired catastrophically.When Hillary Clinton stood beside then-foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, in 2011 and delivered the ""snakes in your backyard"" warning, it was a diplomatic metaphor. Today, it's Pakistan's reality.What began as a policy of control has spiralled into a crisis of survival. Pakistan's greatest threat is no longer at its borders: it's the legacy of its own choices.","Pakistan cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif on Friday said that his country can no longer maintain its past relations with Afghanistan, alleging, without evidence, that the Taliban leadership is ""sitting in India’s lap"" and warning of a ""heavy price"" for cross-border terrorism, signalling a public hardening of Islamabad’s stance toward a regime it once helped install.His comments came after at least six people, including two children, were killed and seven others injured in airstrikes conducted by Pakistan in Afghanistan’s southeastern Paktika province. The strikes reportedly violated a recent ceasefire agreement between the two countries. Media reports said that representatives from both sides are expected to meet in Doha, Qatar, to address the situation.""Pakistan can no longer afford to maintain relations with Kabul as it did in the past,"" Asif said in a social media post.""All Afghans residing on Pakistani soil must return to their homeland; they now have their own government/caliphate in Kabul... Our land and resources belong to 250 million Pakistanis,"" he added.""Self-respecting nations do not thrive on foreign land and resources,"" Asif said.He stated that despite Pakistan’s efforts and sacrifices over the past five years, Kabul has not responded positively. ""Pakistan issued 836 protest notes to the Afghan side and another 13 demarches,"" he said.Asif warned that Pakistan will now respond more strongly to acts of terrorism. ""There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,"" he said.He also alleged that Afghanistan has become a ""proxy of India"" and is working with New Delhi and the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) against Islamabad.""The rulers of Kabul, who are now sitting in India’s lap and conspiring against Pakistan, were once under our protection, hiding on our land,"" Asif said, without providing any evidence for his claim.Earlier this week, MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, while addressing the weekly press briefing, said that Pakistan is habituated in blaming its neighbours for its internal problems. ""On the developments that are happening on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, we are closely monitoring the situation three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbors for its own internal failures. And three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories. India remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan,"" he had said.The Pakistan defense minister reiterated that Pakistan is prepared to defend itself against any aggression from Afghanistan.Earlier this week, Asif said that Pakistan is ready to respond if the Afghan Taliban ""wish for war."" Speaking to Samaa TV, he said, ""Pakistan remains ready for any aggression; no one should harbour doubt.""Islamabad has repeatedly called on the Taliban government to ensure that Afghan territory is not used for cross-border attacks. Kabul has denied these claims, saying that Afghan soil is not being used against any neighbouring country.Tensions between the two nations have grown following repeated attacks by the TTP, allegedly launched from Afghan soil. A recent attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Orakzai district killed 11 Pakistani soldiers, including a Lieutenant Colonel and a Major.","Khawaja Asif says Pakistan can no longer maintain its past relations with Afghanistan.

In the weeks leading up to the Pahalgam attack, Munir had stirred controversy by invoking the two-nation theory—the ideological foundation of Pakistan’s creation—urging citizens to inculcate in their children a sense of distinction from Hindus. He had further escalated tensions by describing Kashmir as Pakistan’s “jugular vein,” a phrase long associated with Islamabad’s territorial ambitions.Just days after the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed 26 lives, Munir reiterated his stance, declaring, ""The two-nation theory was based on the fundamental belief that Muslims and Hindus are two separate nations, not one.

Fierce Border Clash Between Pakistan, Afghanistan Intensifies With Tanks, Shelling, High Casualties





Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif said on Thursday that Islamabad was ready to hold talks with Afghanistan to resolve their conflict, as a temporary ceasefire that halted days of fierce fighting between the former allies largely held. The neighbouring nations engaged in ground fighting and Pakistan launched airstrikes across the contested frontier, killing dozens and wounding hundreds before agreeing to a 48-hour truce from 6.30pm on Wednesday.Sharif told his cabinet in Islamabad that Pakistan had “retaliated” as it ran out of patience with Afghanistan following a series of militant attacks. “If they want to talk on our valid conditions and want to resolve through dialogue we are ready for that,” Sharif said. “This message has been given to them yesterday. Now the ball is in their court. If this ceasefire is done just to buy time, we will not accept it.”There was no response to his remarks from Kabul.A statement from the Afghaninterior ministry said interior minister Khalifa Sirajuddin Haqqani met Iranian officials and told them that Afghanistan seeks good relations with all countries. “Just as we respect the sovereignty and dignity of others, we expect the same goodwill and respect toward us,” the statement quoted Haqqani as saying.At least 18 civilians were killed and more than 360 wounded in Afghanistan as a result of the fighting since Oct 10, the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan said.",Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif says Islamabad is ready to hold talks with Afghanistan to resolve their conflict.

A new kind of threat







An uneasy ceasefire may have paused six days of fierce fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan, but the name haunting Islamabad remains the same: Noor Wali Mehsud, the militant cleric Pakistan blames for bringing the country to the brink.As Reuters reported, Pakistani forces believed they had their moment last week when an airstrike in Kabul targeted an armoured Toyota Land Cruiser thought to be carrying Mehsud, leader of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). But the strike failed. Militants and Pakistani officials said he survived, and soon after, the group released an audio message purportedly from him, proof, perhaps, that the TTP chief had once again slipped through Pakistan’s grasp.The strike, Pakistan's first in Kabul since the 2022 US drone killing of Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, was followed by deadly clashes along the Afghan border. For nearly a week, both sides exchanged artillery and drone fire, killing dozens and injuring hundreds. As Associated Press reported, Taliban officials accused Islamabad of carrying out two drone strikes in Kabul just hours before the truce took effect, while the UN urged both sides to end hostilities.Behind Pakistan’s anger lies a deeper grievance: Mehsud’s continued sanctuary in Afghanistan. Islamabad has repeatedly accused Kabul’s Taliban rulers of harbouring him and his lieutenants, an allegation the Afghan Taliban deny.According to Reuters, Mehsud, a 47-year-old cleric trained in Pakistan’s seminaries, revived the TTP after years of disarray. When he took over in 2018, the group was fractured and on the run, its leaders killed in US drone strikes. But Mehsud, described by analysts as both “a strategist and an ideologue,” united splinter factions, reorganised command, and shifted tactics.Unlike his predecessors, Mehsud curtailed attacks on civilians, a deliberate move to regain sympathy in Pakistan’s tribal belt after the horror of the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, which killed over 130 children. He ordered fighters to focus instead on the army and police, portraying Pakistan’s military as “anti-Islam” and accusing its generals of “hijacking the people of Pakistan for 78 years.”Under his leadership, the TTP renewed its insurgency. The UN’s Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee lists him for “financing, planning, and perpetrating” terrorist acts, noting the group’s claims of deadly strikes on Pakistani security forces in North Waziristan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2019. As of late 2022, UN records placed Mehsud in Afghanistan’s Paktika province, near the border.Born in 1978 in South Waziristan’s Machikhel village, Mehsud studied at multiple Islamic seminaries across Pakistan before joining jihadist ranks. As detailed by the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), he fought alongside the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s, later joining the TTP in 2003. He rose quickly first as a judge in TTP’s shadow courts, then as its Karachi chief, and finally as deputy to Maulana Fazlullah before taking command in 2018.What distinguishes Mehsud from other militants is his intellectual bent. He is the author of several books, including Inqilab-e-Mehsud (The Mehsud Revolution), a 700-page account linking his movement to anti-colonial resistance. In it, he even claimed responsibility for orchestrating the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, saying she planned to ally with the U.S. against the mujahideen.Analysts describe him as both “a battlefield commander and a theorist.” He views Pakistan’s military operations against militants as a “defensive jihad” retaliation against what he portrays as the army’s betrayal of tribal traditions by handing over foreign fighters to the U.S. His stated goals: preserving Mehsud tribal autonomy, defeating America in Afghanistan, and establishing a Taliban-style Islamic system.Since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, Mehsud’s TTP has enjoyed renewed momentum. Pakistan claims the group has used Afghan soil to launch near-daily attacks, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Efforts at negotiation have failed. According to Reuters, the TTP’s demands implementing Islamic law in border regions and the army’s withdrawal were flatly rejected by Islamabad.The failed airstrike in Kabul has made Mehsud an even more defiant figure. His survival has not only embarrassed Pakistan’s military but also underscored the fragility of its ties with Kabul. For now, an uneasy truce holds, but the man once dismissed as a fugitive cleric has managed to force Pakistan into one of its deadliest border crises in decades, a testament to the enduring power of Noor Wali Mehsud, the scholar-commander who turned ideology into insurgency.","Noor Wali Mehsud is the leader of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) Pakistani forces believed they had their moment last week when an airstrike in Kabul targeted an armoured Toyota Land Cruiser.

Pakistan Seeks Trump’s Intervention After Afghan-Taliban Forces Humiliate Pak Army In Border Clash





Afghanistan’s Taliban government on Thursday claimed that Pakistan carried out two drone strikes on Kabul on Wednesday, even as the two neighbours declared a 48-hour ceasefire following days of deadly cross-border clashes that killed dozens and injured hundreds.The strikes, according to Taliban officials, targeted a civilian house and a market in Kabul, with hospital sources reporting at least five killed and dozens injured.Emergency, an Italian NGO running a surgical centre in the city, said patients suffered shrapnel wounds, burns, and blunt trauma.Khalid Zadran, spokesman for the Kabul police chief, confirmed the attacks but did not provide exact casualty figures, as per the news agency AP Earlier, Taliban chief spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid initially described the incident as an oil tanker explosion.Pakistani officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the strikes were aimed at militant hideouts, reported AP.Cross-border violence had escalated since October 10, with both Islamabad and Kabul accusing each other of harbouring militants.On Wednesday, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) reported at least 17 civilians killed and 346 injured in Spin Boldak on the Afghan side of the border, while noting further casualties in previous clashes.The UN urged both countries to “bring a lasting end to hostilities to protect civilians”.The temporary truce, which came into effect at 6 pm Islamabad time on Wednesday, was aimed at halting bloodshed and creating a window for dialogue.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said ‘the ball is in the Afghan Taliban's court"" and the extension of the ceasefire depends on Kabul’s response. “If in 48 hours they want to resolve the issues and address our genuine demands, then we are ready for them,” he said, reiterating that Afghan territory should not be used to plan attacks by Pakistani Taliban militants.According to the news agency AFP, Spin Boldak residents were observed returning home, and shops were reopening under the fragile truce, while municipal workers in Kabul were repairing roads and buildings damaged by the Wednesday blasts.Blasts had also caused overnight blackouts in parts of the city. Emergency’s country director, Dejan Panic, said, “We started receiving ambulances filled with wounded people… Ten are in critical condition.”The 2,611-kilometre-long Durand Line, which Afghanistan does not formally recognise, remains a flashpoint as Pakistan continues to combat attacks from the Tehreek-e-Taliban ( TTP ) and other armed groups operating along the border.Islamabad has repeatedly accused Kabul of providing safe havens to militants, a charge denied by the Taliban.","Taliban claims Pakistan carried out two drone strikes on Kabul on Wednesday.

PM Sushila Karki Vows Stability and Transparency While Briefing Diplomats on Nepal’s Polls





Nepal’s deposed Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli on Sunday accused the current government of trying to arrest him “without sufficient ground” and claimed it was not serious about conducting the general election scheduled for March 5, 2026.During his first interaction with editors and senior journalists in Kathmandu since his ouster, Oli said his party, the CPN-UML, would seek reinstatement of the dissolved House of Representatives. He alleged that the government was attempting to arrest him “by hook or crook,” despite lacking sufficient grounds.Oli resigned in early September after violent protests by the youth-led Gen Z group against his government over corruption and a ban on social media. Former top judge Sushila Karki was appointed interim prime minister on September 12, and President Ramchandra Paudel dissolved parliament on her recommendation. The next general election is scheduled for March 5, 2026.Referring to his removal from office, Oli said that after he was rescued by the Nepal Army from the Prime Minister’s residence at Baluwatar following the attack by protesters, his mobile phone was seized for a few days.He also criticised the government for withdrawing some of his security personnel, saying it had failed to ensure a secure atmosphere for free and fair elections.The former prime minister claimed that during his tenure, “the law and order situation was better and the press was more secure,” adding that now “the media has become insecure and they have started self-censorship.” He accused the media of ignoring “the vandalism and arson done in the name of the Gen Z group that destroyed many important government buildings, including the Prime Minister’s Office at Singhdurbar, the Supreme Court, Parliament Building and the anti-graft body,"" as quoted by PTI.Oli alleged that the violence during the Gen Z protests was caused by “infiltration of external elements,” though he did not specify who they were. The Gen Z protesters had demanded the arrest of then Prime Minister Oli and Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, holding them responsible for the excessive use of force during the agitation.Commenting on the “Nepo-kids” movement launched by Gen Z youths alongside their protests, Oli said, “I couldn’t accept the Nepo-babe campaign launched by the Gen Z youths, which created terror among the Nepalese people.” The campaign had targeted the children of influential leaders for their lavish lifestyles allegedly funded by corruption.Unlike other top leaders, including Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-Maoist Centre chair Pushpakamal Dahal “Prachanda,” who resigned from their party posts, Oli said he had no plans to step down as CPN-UML chair. “I may come back to power if people vote for me. The country and my party still need me, and I am still capable of contributing to the country and the society,” he said.After hiding in an army camp outside Kathmandu following his ouster, Oli stayed in Gundu, Bhaktapur district, for a few weeks before reappearing publicly during a central committee meeting of his party recently, reported PTI.",Nepal's deposed Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli accused the current government of trying to arrest him “without sufficient ground” Oli resigned in early September after violent protests by the youth-led Gen Z group against his government.

Pakistan Seeks Trump’s Intervention After Afghan-Taliban Forces Humiliate Pak Army In Border Clash





Afghan sources on Saturday accused the Pakistani military of repeatedly violating Afghanistan’s border, saying Islamabad breached Afghan territory over 1,200 times and its airspace on 710 occasions in the past four years.The allegations come amid a deadly escalation along the Durand Line following Pakistani airstrikes on Kabul and other provinces.The latest clashes intensified after at least three Afghan cricketers were reportedly killed in a Pakistani airstrike in Paktika province. In response, Afghanistan carried out limited retaliatory operations on October 11 against Pakistani positions, citing its right to self-defense under international law. “We do not seek to escalate the situation, but if the Pakistanis insist on violating Afghan air and ground space, or carry out bombings, we will be compelled to give a firm and befitting response, because defending our land and people is our inherent right and responsibility,” the sources said, as quoted by PTI.Afghan officials detailed the human and material toll of the violations. “Dozens of homes and shops were destroyed, and considerable financial losses were inflicted on civilians,” one source said.From the start of 2024 until now, 102 civilians and Afghan border guards have been killed, with 139 others wounded due to cross-border attacks.The sources said Pakistani forces carried out over 712 airspace violations in the past four years, including 16 bombings with jets and drones in the provinces of Nuristan, Kunar, Nangarhar, Khost, Paktia, and Paktika. These attacks reportedly killed 114 Pakistani tribal refugees, Afghan civilians, and Afghan border guards.Afghan sources also cited August of this year, when Pakistani airstrikes targeted Nuristan, Nangarhar, and Khost provinces. “There were no casualties in Nuristan and Nangarhar, and contrary to their claims there were no members of any anti-Pakistan group present there. But in Khost province they killed three children from an Afghan family (civilians) and wounded four women,” the sources said.Even before the latest retaliation, Afghanistan had largely limited its response to diplomatic protests. The sources highlighted an October 9 incident when Pakistani combat jets violated Kabul’s airspace on the eve of a scheduled meeting between Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar , producing loud aerial explosions over the capital.Afghan officials emphasised that recent retaliatory operations were mostly confined to areas repeatedly subjected to Pakistani artillery, mortar fire, drone incursions, and other violations. They insisted that the operations were defensive in nature and aimed at protecting Afghan territory and civilians, reported PTI.","Afghan sources accuse Pakistan of repeatedly violating Afghanistan’s border.

Pakistan’s Fresh Peace Push With India Over Kashmir: Diplomatic Shift Or Strategic Face-Saving Move?





Delegations from Afghanistan and Pakistan arrived in Doha, Qatar, on Saturday to hold high-level talks aimed at ending the intense cross-border hostilities that left dozens dead on both sides and significantly strained already fragile bilateral ties.Both countries have sent their defense ministers to lead the negotiations. According to Pakistan, the talks will focus on “immediate measures to end cross-border terrorism emanating from Afghanistan and restore peace and stability along the border.”The conflict intensified after a 48-hour ceasefire ended on Friday evening, with Pakistan launching strikes across the border shortly afterward. Both nations accuse each other of initiating aggression, while Afghanistan denies providing sanctuary to militants carrying out attacks in the border region.Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson for the Taliban government, condemned the “repeated crimes of Pakistani forces and the violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty,” describing these actions as provocative and deliberate attempts to prolong hostilities.The two countries share the 2,611-kilometer (1,622-mile) Durand Line, a border that Afghanistan has never formally recognised. Pakistan is struggling with rising militancy in its border areas and also claims India supports armed groups, though no evidence has been provided.Pakistan’s army chief, Asim Munir, appealed to Afghan authorities to prioritise security and stability over ongoing violence. Speaking at the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he said, “The Taliban must rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan” and urged for “mutual security over perpetual violence and progress over hardline obscurantism<’ as quoted by AP.Regional powers, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, have called for calm, warning that the clashes could destabilise a region already threatened by the resurgence of extremist groups such as the Islamic State and al-Qaida.","Delegations from Afghanistan and Pakistan arrived in Doha, Qatar, on Saturday to hold high-level talks aimed at ending the intense cross-border hostilities.

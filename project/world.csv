Four workers trapped in a collapsed copper mine in Central Chile, following a 4.3 magnitude earthquake in the area, were found dead, while one of the workers still remains missing, officials confirmed Sunday.The incident occurred on Thursday at El Teniente, one of the world’s largest copper mines, operated by Chile’s state-run mining company, Codelco. Operations at El Teniente have been suspended since the collapse.Codelco confirmed that the body of Gonzalo Nunez Caroca, one of the workers, was recovered on Saturday, while the three miners found on Sunday have not yet been identified.One worker was confirmed dead on the day of the incident, leaving five others trapped underground. Nine additional workers were injured.Codelco CEO Ruben Alvarado emphasised on Friday that the first 48 hours were crucial for rescue operations. He said that workers needed to clear 20 meters of debris to reach the area where the trapped miners were believed to be located.Chile President Gabriel Boric said Friday that his government would do “everything in (its) power” to find the missing workers. He also dispatched mining minister Aurora Williams to the site to coordinate rescue efforts, reported CNN.At a press conference on Saturday, Boric offered condolences to the family of Paulo Marín Tapia, another confirmed victim, and said he was in contact with the families of those still missing.Mine general manager Andres Music offered condolences in a Saturday statement. “We know that this news hits hard for the families of our colleagues and for our entire mining community,” he said.Both Codelco and the Chilean prosecutor’s office have opened investigations into the cause of the collapse. Music stressed that the incident was not caused by explosives. “We are making every effort to rescue these workers,” he said as quoted by CNN.","The incident occurred on Thursday at El Teniente, one of the world’s largest copper mines.

Israel's 'Secret' Syria Raid: IDF Paratroopers Storm 4 Sites In South Syria As Sweida Truce Frays





Federal officials have launched an investigation into former special counsel Jack Smith after US President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers accused him of engaging in illegal political activity during his investigations into Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign.The US office of special counsel (OSC), an independent federal agency, confirmed to NBC News on Saturday that it is looking into Smith for possible violations of the Hatch Act- a law that bars certain political activities by federal employees.The OSC is distinct from the justice department’s special counsel’s office, which Smith led during his investigation into Trump.While the OSC cannot bring criminal charges, it can recommend disciplinary action such as removal from the federal workforce. It may also refer findings to the Department of Justice, although that is uncommon.Senator Tom Cotton, R-Ark., formally requested the investigation on Wednesday, accusing Smith of “unprecedented interference in the 2024 election.”Smith was appointed special counsel by then-attorney general Merrick Garland in November 2022, just three days after Trump announced his presidential bid. He later brought two criminal indictments against Trump in 2023 but stepped down from the role slightly more than a week before Trump’s inauguration in January 2024.Neither case reached trial.“Jack Smith’s legal actions were nothing more than a tool for the Biden and Harris campaigns,” Cotton said in a post on X Wednesday. “This isn’t just unethical, it is very likely illegal campaign activity from a public office.”Cotton also claimed Smith pushed for a “rushed trial” of Trump, though he has not released specific evidence of illegal conduct.Hatch Act violations are rarely referred to the DOJ. In 2019, the OSC recommended then-President Trump remove White House counselor Kellyanne Conway for Hatch Act violations, but the issue did not lead to prosecution.Meanwhile, Trump’s nominee to lead the OSC, Paul Ingrassia, remains stalled in the senate. A White House official said that Ingrassia, a former podcast host with a history of controversial remarks, is currently holding one-on-one meetings with senators as part of the confirmation process.","Federal officials have launched an investigation into former special counsel Jack Smith.

Trump's Pakistan Oil Gambit Backfires On Day 1; 'U.S. Being Deceived, No Reserves In Pak' | Watch





Pakistan and Iran agreed on Sunday to increase bilateral trade to USD 8 billion annually, taking advantage of their geography and the ""discount of distance,"" as trade ministers from the two countries held discussions to deepen economic and political ties.The agreement was reached during a meeting between Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan and Iranian Minister for Industry, Mines and Trade Mohammad Atabak on the sidelines of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian's two-day state visit to Pakistan.Pezeshkian landed in Lahore on Saturday afternoon and then flew to the capital in the evening.A statement by the Commerce Ministry here said the high-level discussion between Khan and Atabak marked a renewed commitment from both sides to accelerate trade, remove border bottlenecks, and build trust-based partnerships across priority sectors.""[During the meeting], Kamal envisioned that, if fully leveraged, bilateral trade between Pakistan and Iran could easily exceed USD 5-8 billion annually in the coming years,"" the ministry said.Before departing from Tehran, Pezeshkian had said Iran and Pakistan have always maintained ""good, sincere, and deep relations"" and plan to increase bilateral trade volume to USD 10 billion annually.During Sunday's meeting, emphasis was placed on maximising the potential of neighbourhood trade, with Khan highlighting how ASEAN countries have benefited enormously by trading within their region.""Geography is an advantage. Pakistan and Iran must utilise this discount of distance. If we don't, we lose both time and cost benefits,"" he stated.The Pakistani minister suggested organising targeted trade delegations that include representatives from federal and provincial chambers of commerce, enabling focused discussions on market access and regulatory facilitation, according to the statement.""We've done this model successfully in Belarus and elsewhere,"" he was quoted in the statement as saying. ""Let's do the same for Iran, starting with sectors that show the greatest potential for mutual benefit.""The ministers also expressed a shared commitment to increasing the use of existing trade corridors and border facilities.Atabak also highlighted ongoing discussions about increasing Pakistani exports to Iran and encouraged swift follow-up on newly signed agreements.""Traders and industrialists in both countries are ready. They trust each other. What they need now is a clear and consistent facilitation mechanism from our side,"" he noted.Khan said that beyond bilateral gains, such connectivity could expand to Turkey, Central Asia, Russia, and even parts of West Asia, creating an economic bloc of substantial power and resilience.Atabak supported the idea of holding a dedicated B2B day during every high-level visit and offered to bring Iranian business groups to Pakistan for in-depth meetings, the statement said.Both ministers agreed on the importance of identifying specific sectors such as agriculture, livestock, services, energy, and cross-border logistics for future collaboration, the statement said.""With high-level political alignment and mutual trust, Pakistan and Iran appear poised to enter a new phase of strategic economic partnership that could reshape regional trade dynamics,"" it added.","Trade ministers from the two countries held discussions to deepen economic and political ties.

Trump Rages At Schumer As Senate Talks Collapse, Nominations And Budget Face Gridlock





US President Trump launched a scathing attack on senate minority leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday, telling him to “GO TO HELL” after the Senate left Washington for its August recess without confirming over 130 of his executive branch nominees.A deal between Republicans and Democrats collapsed, and many key appointments remain stalled. Trump had urged the Senate to stay in session, but negotiations failed— leaving dozens of political appointees in limbo and the president fuming.“Senator Cryin’ Chuck Schumer is demanding over One Billion Dollars in order to approve a small number of our highly qualified nominees, who should right now be helping to run our Country,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Trump was reacting to what he described as an unreasonable demand by Senate Democrats, accusing Schumer of tying nominee approvals to a $1 billion funding request, reported The New York Post.“This demand is egregious and unprecedented, and would be embarrassing to the Republican Party if it were accepted. It is political extortion, by any other name. Tell Schumer, who is under tremendous political pressure from within his own party, the Radical Left Lunatics, to GO TO HELL!” he addedTrump followed up with urging Republicans to hold firm and use the recess to rally public support, rather than accepting a compromise with Democrats.“Do not accept the offer, go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country. Have a great RECESS and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!”Senate majority leader John Thune acknowledged the failed negotiations and the multiple attempts to reach an agreement with Schumer before recess. “There were several different times where I think either or both sides maybe thought there was a deal in the end.”Thune had been working with Schumer on a proposal to bundle nominee votes into two rounds—one before the recess and another afterward. But Democrats were reportedly seeking guarantees from Trump to restore funding for foreign aid and the National Institutes of Health, which the administration had frozen.The breakdown led to frustration on both sides, and senators were eager to begin their August break.Schumer, under pressure from his party’s progressive base, later celebrated the failure of the confirmation deal.“Let me clear what happened: Donald Trump attempted to steamroll the Senate to put in place his historically unqualified nominees. But Senate Democrats wouldn’t let him,” he said in a post on X Sunday.“Donald Trump’s style: Posture[,] Cajole[,] Stamp your feet… and then give up,” he added in a follow up post.With the deal dead, some Republicans suggested changing Senate rules to prevent Democrats from blocking confirmations. However, moderate GOP senators were reluctant, fearing the same rules could be used against them in the future.Thune allowed the Senate to continue holding pro forma sessions, ceremonial meetings that block Trump from making recess appointments, ensuring his nominees cannot be confirmed without Senate votes. Although the Senate passed three of twelve required appropriations bills, several key funding bills remain stuck in committee.According to senate appropriations chair Susan Collins, it marks the first time since 2018 that any funding bills were passed before the August recess. If the remaining bills aren’t approved by October 1, the government faces a partial shutdown, The New York Post reported.","US President Donald Trump launched a scathing attack on senate minority leader Chuck Schumer.

South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol lay on the floor of his prison cell wearing only an undershirt and boxer shorts to resist questioning, prosecutors said Friday, after a fresh attempt to bring him in for interrogation over election tampering allegations failed.Although already in custody on charges related to his attempt to impose martial law in December, prosecutors were required to serve a new warrant to question him in a separate case involving his wife, Kim Keon-hee.Assistant special prosecutor Oh Jeong-hee said a team of special prosecutors attempted to execute the warrant but were forced to abandon the effort after Yoon refused to cooperate.“The special prosecutors urged him to voluntarily comply with the arrest warrant, taking into account his status as a former president,” Oh said as quoted by South China Morning Post. “But the suspect persistently refused, remaining on the floor and declining to put on his prison uniform.”Prosecutors repeated the request four times over 20- to 30-minute intervals before halting the operation after two hours, citing concerns that using physical force might lead to harm.“During the process, the suspect was informed that the next attempt to execute the warrant would proceed even with the use of physical force,” Oh added.She noted that Yoon had long championed “rule of law, fairness, and common sense,” adding, “The public is closely watching whether the law is applied equally to all. We hope the suspect, who once served as a prosecutor, prosecutor general and president, will respect and comply with legal procedures.”Jhee Byong-kuen, a political science professor at Chosun University, criticised Yoon’s actions. “No criminal defies the rule of law in such a disgraceful way,” he said, as cited by South China Morning Post. “The former leader is showing no remorse and portraying himself as a victim of political persecution.”Yoon was first arrested on January 15 by the corruption investigation office for high-ranking officials on charges of insurrection and abuse of power. He was released after 52 days due to procedural issues, but rearrested on July 10 on new charges, including obstruction of official duties. Since then, he has refused to leave his cell for questioning. Prosecutors later added charges, alleging he instructed his security team to interfere with his earlier arrest.He is also resisting a separate probe into alleged election meddling involving his wife. The couple is accused of influencing People Power Party nominations for local and National Assembly elections.In April, the Constitutional Court upheld Yoon’s impeachment, originally passed by the National Assembly in response to the martial law attempt.","South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol lay on the floor of his prison cell wearing only an undershirt and boxer shorts to resist questioning, prosecutors said.

Netizens reacted quickly as the video of Sydney Sweeney at a shooting range circulated online.One user reposted the video and wrote, ""Sydney Sweeney has insane handgun skills.""While another user reposted saying, ""She doesn’t just have great jeans; she's also a total pro at the firing range, unloading 17 rounds in just 9 seconds,"" referring to her recent American Eagle campaign.The video’s buzz comes in the midst of online backlash over Sweeney’s American Eagle ad, which has been criticised for its messaging and portrayal.The ad, which features Sweeney in a classic Americana setting fixing a car and wearing denim. Then, she uses red paint to change the word “genes” to “jeans” and says in a voiceover: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color.My jeans are blue.”The tagline read “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans” plays on the word “genes,” which many critics found problematic.Some accused the campaign of being overly sexualised and promoting outdated beauty standards, pointing to the focus on Sweeney’s blonde hair, blue eyes, and slim physique.Others went further, interpreting the wordplay as an unintended reference to eugenics, a theory historically used to promote racial superiority.Earlier on Friday, American Eagle in response issued a statement on Instagram saying the campaign “is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way.”The brand emphasised that their message celebrates confidence and individuality, saying, “Great jeans look good on everyone.”While critics debated the ad’s deeper implications, marketing experts noted that the attention, positive or negative has certainly kept both Sweeney and American Eagle in the spotlight.",A short video of Sydney Sweeney showing off her handgun skills has gone viral.

Trump-Harvard row







Harvard University is facing backlash after a congressional probe revealed years-long partnerships with organisations tied to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).The revelation sparked concerns over foreign influence and national security risks.According to documents obtained by the Washington Free Beacon, the Ivy League institution allegedly collaborated with CCP-controlled entities for over a decade.The foreign bodies included the Central Organisation Department, the powerful organ responsible for training and selecting China’s top officials.A general focus of the investigation is the Harvard Kennedy School’s partnership with the Chinese Executive Leadership Academy Pudong, a government-run training school.Whistleblowers have claimed that Chinese government and party officials were sent to Harvard as part of their official education, prompting bipartisan alarm.“Harvard’s formal partnership with a CCP-controlled school to train their future leaders raises serious concerns about the CCP’s influence in American institutions,” said representative John Moolenaar.“We are committed to uncovering the full extent of these relationships to ensure transparency and protect national interests,"" he added.Furthermore, representatives Tim Walberg and Elise Stefanik co-signed a letter accusing Harvard of working directly with groups formed by CCP ideology, particularly ""Xi Jinping Thought"".The scandal adds to mounting pressure on the university, which is reportedly considering $500 million payout to settle disputes with US President Donald Trump and his administration over alleged campus anti-Semitism and its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies.In April, the Free Beacon also reported that Harvard had trained members of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a paramilitary group sanctioned by the US for its involvement in the repression of Uyghur Muslims.Congress has given Harvard until August 7 to turn over all records tied to its dealings with CCP-linked bodies, including financial or material exchanges.Harvard University and the Trump administration have been at odds since the MAGA chief assumed office in January.In April 2025, the administration froze approximately $2.2–2.6 billion in federal research funding and revoked Harvard’s certification to host international students, citing alleged failures to tackle antisemitic harassment and ideological bias. In response, Harvard filed lawsuits claiming federal overreach and threats to academic freedom.Earlier this week, reports surfaced that the White House had proposed a settlement of up to $500 million, but Harvard President Alan Garber denied any imminent agreement, calling the figure false and leaked by administration sources. He emphasised that any deal must not compromise the university’s freedom to govern academic affairs independently.The battle has drawn intense scrutiny from faculty, students, alumni, and congressional Democrats.On Friday, fourteen Democratic legislators—many of them Harvard alumni—warned that any settlement under political pressure could prompt a congressional investigation, arguing that yielding to the White House risks setting a dangerous precedent for institutional autonomy across US higher education.Meanwhile, faculty groups have continued to mobilise, demanding red lines on issues such as external monitoring, data-sharing, and control over admissions and hiring.","Harvard University is facing backlash after a congressional probe revealed years-long partnerships with organisations tied to the Chinese Communist Party.

On Friday morning, Minneapolis recorded the second-worst air quality in the world, according to IQAir, ranking just below Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The city’s air quality index (AQI) reached 159, classified as unhealthy for all individuals, meaning even healthy people are at risk of irritation and respiratory issues. This situation was triggered by wildfire smoke drifting south from Canada, creating hazy skies and smoky odors across much of Minnesota. Officials issued air quality alerts statewide, urging residents to limit outdoor activity and take protective measures. The event highlights how wildfire activity thousands of miles away can significantly impact public health and daily life in urban US areas.Massive wildfires in Canada have released thick smoke plumes, carried southward by northerly winds, affecting multiple US states. Chicago’s air quality ranked worst in the world on Thursday before improving to 17th place on Friday. Minneapolis, however, worsened, securing the second spot globally for poor air quality. Some south Minneapolis neighborhoods recorded AQI levels of 170, while Hibbing in northern Minnesota saw the highest at 185, considered highly dangerous. These levels represent fine particulate pollution (PM2.5), which can penetrate deep into lungs and bloodstream.The Midwest experienced widespread impact, with poor air quality reported in Cedar Rapids, Duluth, Eau Claire, Fargo, Kansas City, St. Louis, Wichita, Ashland, Bismarck, Grand Forks, Marquette, Minot, Omaha, Pierre, Superior, Traverse City, and Wausau. States including Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin remained under air quality alerts through Saturday. Millions of residents were exposed to smoke-filled air, prompting health officials to issue emergency guidance and monitor conditions continuously.According to a University of Minnesota study, air pollution causes over 100,000 deaths annually in the United States. Unhealthy air can trigger asthma attacks, cardiovascular stress, eye irritation, and breathing difficulties, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children, seniors, and those with lung or heart disease. Poor air quality has also been linked to long-term chronic health issues when exposure is prolonged or repeated.The National Weather Service and health experts urged residents to:This air quality crisis underscores the cross-border impact of wildfires and the growing influence of climate change on extreme weather and environmental hazards. Canada’s 2025 wildfire season has already burned millions of acres, prompting multiple provincial air quality alerts in Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan. The US situation also comes after rollbacks of more than a dozen pollution regulations, sparking debates about environmental preparedness and public health policy.","Minneapolis recorded the second-worst air quality in the world, according to IQAir, ranking just below Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Trump REACTS To Republican Sydney Sweeney’s American Eagle Ad; Here What He Thinks | WATCH

Sydney Sweeney Ad Row: JD Vance Unbuckles On 'Nazi' Noise, American Eagle Keeps It Casual

The Republican Registration That Launched a Thousand Memes



Shooting Range Superstar: From HBO to the NRA



“Sydney Sweeney: America’s New Annie Oakley .”

.” “She can shoot AND act? Wife me.”

“Meanwhile your favourite liberal thinks Nerf is a hate crime.”

The Power of Saying Nothing



The Post-Woke Celebrity Archetype



Ambiguity over affirmation

Style over slogans

Presence over preaching

Why MAGA Can’t Stop Posting Her



She’s young. The GOP’s problem has always been youth appeal. Sydney solves that.

She’s beautiful. Liberal feminists would call that “problematic.” The Right calls it reality.

She’s talented. Awards, praise, and prestige roles, all without being preachy.

She’s silent. No need to cancel. No need to apologise. No moral panic. Just vibes.

The Mirror, Not the Mouthpiece







In the first of the Republican National Conservative debates, when Trump steadfastly refused to participate to show Fox who was the man, then-presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy summed up the inflection point that was about to overshadow America: “You want to be a rebel? You want to be a hippie? You want to ‘stick it to the man’? Show up on your college campus and try calling yourself a conservative. ”It’s true. Being liberal used to be an act of rebellion. But that rebellion became mainstream, corporatised, and institutionalised. It now lives on as HR slideshows, Twitter mobs, and avocado ad campaigns. Being young and Republican in 2025 is an act of defiance. And today’s protestants become tomorrow’s mainstream—evidenced by the fact that there are now more young people who identify as Republican than Democrat in America.It’s not clear when the Left lost the youth. Perhaps it was the cascade of madness: the woke craze of pushing trans behaviour in grammar schools. Demanding biological males be allowed to play in women’s sports. Saying illegal immigrants should have unfettered access to welfare. Shouting “Defund the Police” while shoplifting turned into organised retail looting. Declaring obesity a form of body positivity. Telling working-class white kids that their skin colour was an inherited sin.Declaring that whiteness ought to be apologised for.Slowly, the country shifted. Not by campaign ads or policy briefings—but by exhaustion. And as America began tuning out the moral lectures from elites, late-night comedians, and Hollywood, a new icon quietly emerged. Not a pundit. Not a senator. Not a firebrand. A muse.In an era where even a sneeze can be interpreted as a political statement, Sydney Sweeney has become the conservative darling of the year—without attending a single rally or issuing a single press release. The star of Euphoria and The White Lotus has, quite by accident, become a MAGA icon. All it took was a leaked Republican voter registration, a denim ad campaign misread as a white supremacist dog whistle, and a shooting range video that could’ve doubled as NRA propaganda. Welcome to 2025, where political identity is crafted less by what you say, and more by which side claims you.It recently emerged that Sydney Sweeney is registered as a Republican in Florida. That was it.She didn’t make a political speech. She didn’t wear a MAGA hat. She didn’t retweet Ben Shapiro. All she did was file the correct paperwork, and the internet found it. Her name. Her address. Her party.Suddenly, the Right had its new pin-up girl. The Left had a meltdown.For conservatives, this was a cultural coup. A beautiful, talented Hollywood starlet—young, blonde, wildly popular—was officially red. Not pink. Not centrist. Red. And best of all? She wasn’t saying sorry for it.The silence was glorious. No apology tour. No clarifying tweet. No “I was hacked” statement. Liberals demanded answers. Progressives called it a betrayal. But Sydney Sweeney didn’t flinch. And in an age where even Instagram captions are pored over for political subtext, saying nothing is a weapon.“Great Jeans” and the Eugenics Panic of Summer 2025Then came the American Eagle campaign.Sydney Sweeney, in tight denim and a tank top, staring into the camera under the caption: “Great Genes.”That’s it. That’s the ad.Within hours, the internet exploded. Not because of the fashion. Not because of the cut. But because of the word: “genes.” Not jeans. Genes.The Left read it as a eugenics dog whistle. A blonde-haired, blue-eyed woman fronting a brand with a tagline that sounded suspiciously like white supremacy.Satirical Twitter lit up: “This is Leni Riefenstahl for Gen Z.” “Are they selling pants or the master race?”But the Right? The Right cackled. This was proof. Proof that the outrage industry had gone too far. That even a pun could be labelled fascist. That Sydney Sweeney, just by existing in her natural body and not issuing trigger warnings, was now enemy number one.American Eagle didn’t back down. Sales spiked. The controversy became the campaign. Sydney didn’t write the tagline. She was just the face. But once again, the narrative moved around her. She became the accidental symbol of conservative resistance to liberal hysteria.And then the final seal was pressed: the shooting range video.Sydney, in casualwear and earmuffs, loading a Glock like she was born in Fort Benning. First-time shooter? Didn’t look like it. Her stance, her focus, her shot grouping—it was enough to make half of Republican Twitter swoon.Clips went viral:The symbolism was perfect. A young woman in Hollywood, not just pretending to shoot in a Netflix movie—but actually firing rounds at a paper target, calmly, confidently. No virtue signalling. No trembling hands. Just recoil and resolve.The Right didn't need words. The imagery was enough. Mainstream Republicans quickly rallied behind Sydney Sweeney. Vice President JD Vance criticised Democrats for “calling everyone who thinks Sydney Sweeney beautiful a Nazi,” saying it showed how out of touch the party had become with young voters. Senator Ted Cruz also weighed in, posting on X: “Wow. Now the crazy Left has come out against beautiful women. I’m sure that will poll well. ” Inside the White House, officials saw the controversy as a win, saying it helped highlight what they view as liberal overreach and cultural policing. For many Republicans, Sweeney’s party registration wasn’t just a detail—it was confirmation that the culture war was breaking their way.What makes Sydney Sweeney such a potent figure is precisely her ambiguity.She doesn’t tweet about taxes. She doesn’t complain about feminism. She doesn’t post “I Voted” stickers or abortion fundraisers. She doesn’t do red carpet activism. And in 2025, that absence speaks louder than any hashtag.Hollywood thrives on performative wokeness. Stars compete to signal their virtue—whether it's climate guilt on private jets or apologies for being cast as straight characters. Sydney Sweeney has opted out.That, to a large chunk of America, makes her radical. Because silence is now seen as alignment. Refusing to bend the knee is tantamount to opposition. And that’s why both sides are fighting to frame her.To liberals, she’s naive at best, complicit at worst. To conservatives, she’s a unicorn: the apolitical star who still represents everything they believe in—beauty, freedom, guns, and denim.What Sydney Sweeney represents is something new: the post-woke Hollywood icon. Not a right-wing activist. Not a left-wing darling. But someone who has managed to float above the trench warfare.This new archetype is defined by:She’s not talking about CRT, climate change, or colonialism. She’s talking about her dog. Or her workout. Or her skincare routine. And yet, her silence makes her subversive.She isn’t against the Left in any direct sense. She’s just not of it. And that distinction matters.There’s a reason conservative media can’t get enough of her:In other words, she’s the anti-Lena Dunham. The anti-Alyssa Milano. The anti-everything that drove red-state Americans away from Hollywood.The Culture War’s Most Valuable PawnSydney Sweeney didn’t ask to be drafted into the culture war. She just voted. Then modelled. Then fired a gun.But in the content economy, you don’t get to choose how you're used. She became a screen onto which America projected its anxieties and aspirations. And the fact that she never pushed back made her more powerful.The Right turned her into a meme. The Left turned her into a warning. And Sydney? Sydney went back to work. To movies. To photo shoots. To her life.That may be the most radical thing of all.Sydney Sweeney is not giving speeches. She’s not asking for your vote. She’s not applying to be the next Kayleigh McEnany.She is simply existing. But in 2025, that’s all it takes.She is a mirror—reflecting everything America wants to believe, or fears to acknowledge. To the Right, she’s the proof that Hollywood doesn’t own the narrative. To the Left, she’s a reminder that silence can be resistance too.And in a country where every movie, every tweet, every ad campaign becomes a battleground, Sydney Sweeney has done the unthinkable.She said nothing. And everyone heard it.","In an era where even a sneeze can be interpreted as a political statement, Sydney Sweeney has become the conservative darling of the year. All it took was a leaked Republican voter registration, a denim ad campaign misread as a white supremacist dog whistle, and a shooting range video.

Mark Zuckerberg’s offer and Tulloch’s viral rejection





Andrew Tulloch, an Australian computer scientist and machine learning expert, has made headlines after turning down a $1.5 billion offer from Mark Zuckerberg to rejoin Meta. A former OpenAI engineer, Tulloch is now the co-founder of Thinking Machines Lab alongside ex-OpenAI CTO Mira Murati. The AI startup, still in its early stages, is already valued at $12 billion. Tulloch’s decision to decline Zuckerberg’s aggressive recruitment attempt reflects a broader trend of top AI talent prioritizing independence, mission-driven work, and long-term impact over staggering financial packages.Tulloch’s journey began at the University of Sydney, where he graduated with first-class honours and a University Medal in mathematics. He later earned a Master’s in Mathematical Statistics from Cambridge and pursued a PhD at UC Berkeley. Tulloch worked at Meta (then Facebook) from 2012 to 2023, contributing to machine learning systems and the development of PyTorch. He played a pivotal role in making PyTorch one of the most widely adopted frameworks in AI. His impact was felt across Meta’s core AI infrastructure. He joined OpenAI in 2023, focusing on GPT-4 pretraining and reasoning models, before co-founding Thinking Machines Lab in early 2025.Unlike many AI engineers who stay within big tech, Tulloch has consistently sought out roles where he can shape core AI architecture rather than optimize existing systems.Co-founded with Mira Murati, Thinking Machines Lab is focused on building AI systems that are safer, interpretable, and customizable—going beyond traditional chatbot interfaces. The startup, though yet to release a product, has secured a $2 billion seed round with backing from Andreessen Horowitz, Nvidia, AMD, and Google Cloud. Its ambition and leadership have made it a top target for recruitment, especially from Zuckerberg's new ""superintelligence"" division at Meta. The company’s core mission—developing AI that reflects diverse global needs—has created a gravitational pull for talent across the AI world. Tulloch’s name now resonates not just as a coder, but as a leader defining the next chapter in responsible AI innovation. Industry insiders say the startup has quietly attracted talent from DeepMind, Anthropic, and OpenAI—further signaling that it may become a major challenger in the foundation model race.According to The Wall Street Journal, Zuckerberg personally tried to lure Tulloch back to Meta with a six-year offer worth up to $1.5 billion, contingent on bonuses and stock performance. Tulloch declined, joining other Thinking Machines Lab co-founders in resisting Meta’s poaching attempts. His decision has sparked widespread praise among AI researchers, many of whom see it as a stand for academic and scientific freedom. The bold rejection has gone viral, with Tulloch’s LinkedIn profile celebrated for charting a rare career driven by principles rather than payouts. Meta later disputed the exact terms of the offer but confirmed outreach efforts were made.","Andrew Tulloch, an Australian computer scientist and machine learning expert, has made headlines after turning down a $1.5 billion offer from Mark Zuckerberg to rejoin Meta.

Matt Deitke’s rise and how Mark Zuckerberg stepped in with a historic offer

Building Molmo and earning global recognition at the Allen Institute for AI



Vercept and Deitke’s vision for autonomous AI agents





In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, few names have made waves quite like Matt Deitke. At just 24, Deitke turned heads by rejecting a $125 million offer from Meta to join its elite AI division. What followed was even more astonishing: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally met with him and doubled the offer to an eye-popping $250 million. Deitke’s decision to finally accept showcases the extraordinary lengths Big Tech is now going to in order to secure top AI talent. But who is Matt Deitke, and why is he considered one of the brightest minds in artificial intelligence today?Matt Deitke began his academic career in a PhD programme in computer science at the University of Washington. Despite his early academic promise, he left the programme to pursue more hands-on work in artificial intelligence. This move surprised many but proved instrumental in shaping his career. Deitke joined the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) in Seattle, where he quickly made a name for himself.At AI2, Deitke led the development of Molmo, a state-of-the-art multimodal chatbot capable of understanding and reasoning through a combination of text, images, and audio.His groundbreaking work earned him an Outstanding Paper Award at NeurIPS 2022, one of the most prestigious AI conferences in the world. With his rising reputation, it was not long before top tech companies began to notice.In 2024, Meta approached Deitke with a $125 million compensation package spread over four years to join its Superintelligence Lab. Surprisingly, he declined the offer, choosing to stay focused on independent research and his entrepreneurial ventures. Deitke reportedly felt that joining too early would limit his freedom to experiment—a value he deeply prioritizes in his research philosophy. Refusing to give up, Mark Zuckerberg personally met with Deitke to discuss Meta’s vision for the future of AI. Following their conversation, the offer was doubled to approximately $250 million, with up to $100 million front-loaded in the first year. It was one of the most generous recruitment packages in AI history. This time, Deitke accepted. The story of Deitke’s recruitment has since become symbolic of the escalating talent wars within the AI sector. Zuckerberg’s direct involvement also underscores how central AI has become to Meta’s long-term strategy.Before joining Meta, Deitke had already made significant contributions to AI research. At the Allen Institute for AI, he helped pioneer work on Molmo (Multimodal Language Model), a system designed to move beyond traditional text-based interaction by integrating visual and auditory data. Unlike chatbots that rely solely on language models, Molmo could respond with images, reason through spatial information, and interpret sensory input in real time. His work on Molmo was widely praised across the AI community. It was seen as a major leap toward more human-like machine interaction.Deitke’s work positioned him at the forefront of the next generation of AI tools—intelligent systems that combine perception and reasoning. His NeurIPS 2022 paper, which won an Outstanding Paper Award, drew attention for its bold approach to human-like AI reasoning. Molmo was even cited by OpenAI researchers as a benchmark system for cross-modal alignment testing, a rare recognition from rivals in the space. His contributions helped advance embodied and multimodal AI platforms that continue to support reproducible research and shared benchmarks. The achievement made Deitke not just a standout engineer but a thought leader in the AI space, someone capable of redefining how humans and machines interact.In late 2023, while still outside the Big Tech ecosystem, Deitke co-founded Vercept, a startup aimed at building AI agents that can autonomously perform complex tasks on the internet. Unlike conventional AI tools that rely on human prompts, Vercept’s agents are designed to understand goals, search the web, execute sequences of tasks, and adapt to new contexts. They essentially act like intelligent assistants with real-world functionality.Vercept began with just 10 employees but quickly attracted the attention of major investors. The company secured $16.5 million in early-stage funding, with notable backing from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Its early prototypes demonstrated impressive capabilities in task automation, sparking interest from enterprise clients and researchers alike. The vision behind Vercept was simple but powerful: to create AI agents that don’t just talk, but act.Matt Deitke’s work at Vercept, combined with his academic and research accomplishments, painted a clear picture of his potential. As Big Tech continues its billion-dollar race to dominate AI, it is clear why Meta was willing to go to such extraordinary lengths to bring Deitke into the fold.","Matt Deitke is one of the brightest minds in artificial intelligence today.

The US Senate on Saturday confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a well-known Fox News personality and President Donald Trump loyalist, to a high-profile federal prosecutor role in Washington, DC.With a vote count of 50-45, Pirro secured confirmation as the US Attorney for the District of Columbia. Trump encouraged the Republican-controlled Senate to process his nominations during weekend sessions, following his return to the White House six months prior.Trump provisionally appointed Pirro to the role in May, continuing his pattern of selecting hosts from the conservative television network and steadfast supporters for influential governmental positions.Trump previously praised the outspoken 74-year-old former Westchester County district attorney when he nominated her, as being ""in a class by herself.""Jeanine Pirro is a former judge, prosecutor, and prominent conservative television personality, best known for her outspoken commentary on Fox News.Before rising to national media fame, Pirro built a lengthy legal career in New York.

Her on-air segments often included inflammatory rhetoric and conspiracy theories—particularly surrounding the 2020 election—which at times led to temporary removals from the network lineup.She joins a growing list of cable news figures with political roles, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, both of whom had careers at Fox.Pirro is also a published author. Her 2018 book, Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy, was described by The Washington Post as overly loyal to Donald Trump.Her personal life has not been without controversy. Her ex-husband, Albert Pirro, was convicted of tax evasion during her time as district attorney and later received a pardon from Trump during his presidency.Earlier, the Senate Judiciary Committee's leading Democrat, Dick Durbin, opposed Pirro's permanent appointment as US Attorney, describing her selection as a ""rubber stamp for Donald Trump.""Durbin referenced her role in spreading conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, which Trump lost to Biden, AP reported.Pirro was sued by Dominion Voting Systems after she promoted false claims of election fraud on Fox News. The company accused Fox of airing defamatory statements about its role in the vote count. Fox later settled the lawsuit for around $800 million.","The US Senate confirmed Jeanine Pirro, 74, to a high-profile federal prosecutor role in Washington, DC.

US Police continued scouring the rugged mountains of Montana on Saturday as the search for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran accused of fatally shooting four people at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, entered its second day.Brown fled the scene in a white pickup truck, which was later abandoned, according to Lee Johnson of the Montana Division of Criminal Investigation. Johnson urged residents Friday night to stay indoors and remain alert.Authorities also released a photo of Brown, reportedly taken as he fled. In the image, he appears gaunt, barefoot, and dressed only in black shorts while walking down a set of outdoor concrete steps.""While law enforcement has not received reports of Brown harming any other individuals, he is believed to be armed, and he is extremely dangerous,"" Johnson said, the Associated Press reported.Brown's military service included Army deployment to Iraq (2004-2005) and Montana National Guard service until March 2009, reaching sergeant rank.His niece, Clare Boyle, indicated Brown's ongoing mental health challenges: ""This isn't just a drunk/high man going wild,"" she said via Facebook.""It's a sick man who doesn't know who he is sometimes and frequently doesn't know where or when he is either,"" Boyle added.The search concentrated near Stumptown Road, west of Anaconda, involving multiple agencies at ground level and in the air. Local businesses were permitted to operate, though Chief Bill Sather advised vigilance.Victim identifications await family notifications.The bar owner, David Gwerder, confirmed Brown lived adjacent to the establishment. The victims included the bartender and three customers.""He knew everybody that was in that bar. I guarantee you that,"" Gwerder told AP. ""He didn't have any running dispute with any of them. I just think he snapped.""As authorities lifted the Stumptown Road lockdown, retired officer Randy Clark observed helicopter surveillance and ground operations.Local businesses had earlier implemented security measures, with owners and customers sheltering inside.Anaconda, situated 25 miles northwest of Butte with approximately 9,000 residents, was established by copper industry magnates in the late 1800s.

A 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck several parts of Pakistan early Saturday morning, causing panic among residents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and the capital Islamabad, as reported by ARY News.The National Seismic Monitoring Centre (NSMC) reported that the earthquake occurred at 2.04 am PST at a depth of 102 kilometers. Its epicentre was located in the Hindukush mountain region in Afghanistan.Tremors were also felt across various regions in Afghanistan and Tajikistan, the NSMC confirmed.In Pakistan, the tremors were reported in multiple districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including Peshawar, Swat, Malakand, Nowshera, Charsadda, Karak, Dir, Mardan, Mohmand, Shangla, Hangu, Swabi, Haripur, and Abbottabad.Tremors were also felt in several parts of Punjab province including cities such as Lahore, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Attock, Taxila, Murree, Sialkot, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sheikhupura, Ferozwala and Muridke.Although the earthquake caused no reported loss of life or property, it led to widespread panic. Many residents rushed out of their homes in fear and began reciting verses from the holy Quran, according to ARY News.Pakistan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world, as it lies at the intersection of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. This collision zone makes the region highly vulnerable to frequent seismic activities.High-risk areas include Balochistan , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, which are located near major fault lines like the Main Central Thrust. Punjab, situated on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate, also remains susceptible. Sindh, though relatively less prone to earthquakes is also not free from risk due to its tectonic positioning.One of the most powerful earthquakes in the country's history was the 1945 Balochistan earthquake that measured 8.1 in magnitude.","A 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck several parts of Pakistan early Saturday morning.

ISLAMABAD:

‘Trump Angry As India Denies Nobel Push, Rejects' Mediation In Operation Sindoor Ceasefire | WATCH





In a symbolic assertion of strategic alignment, Pakistan’s military hosted on Friday a grand ceremony at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi to mark the 98th anniversary of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), showcasing its deepening defence partnership with Beijing.The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump just days after Washington and Islamabad concluded new trade deals.While the tariff decision is believed to have been discussed between the two sides as part of broader trade negotiations, Trump’s typically blunt commentary on social media appeared aimed more at India than Pakistan. In recent days, Trump has taken jabs at New Delhi over its continued purchase of Russian oil and defence equipment, while casting Pakistan in a more favourable light.At GHQ, however, Pakistan’s military made its strategic loyalties unambiguous. Army Chief Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir hosted Chinese ambassador Jiang Zaidong and PLA defence attaché Maj Gen Wang Zhong at a ceremony that included military tributes, visuals of joint defence hardware, and strong political messaging. Munir described the Pakistan-China relationship as a “beacon of mutual trust and shared destiny” and referred to the PLA and Pakistan Army as “iron brothers”.The messaging was clear: Pakistan is reaffirming its long-standing alignment with China even as it navigates transactional ties with Washington and economic turbulence at home. With IMF conditionalities tightening and Western funding streams growing unpredictable, Islamabad continues to anchor itself in Beijing’s strategic orbit, particularly through projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).For China, the event was a diplomatic win. As Beijing faces intensifying rivalry with the US across the Indo-Pacific, its deepening influence over a nuclear-armed ally in South Asia reinforces its foothold in the region. The GHQ ceremony was a visual and political endorsement of China’s role as Islamabad’s primary defence and development partner.With Pakistan and China enhancing defence cooperation and projecting unity, New Delhi faces a more tightly aligned northern bloc just as it expands its own security ties with the US and with Indo-Pacific allies.Despite the potential economic fallout of the US tariffs, Rawalpindi appears undeterred. In an era of fluid alliances, Pakistan is betting on consistency with Beijing over the unpredictability of Western partners, a gamble that could reshape the regional balance in the years ahead.",Pakistan's military hosted a grand ceremony to mark the 98th anniversary of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump.

A Pakistani anti-terrorism court on Thursday sentenced more than 100 members of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan 's party to prison terms on charges related to riots that targeted military sites in 2023, a court order said.Fifty-eight of the defendants, who included parliamentarians and senior officials, were sentenced to 10 years in prison and the rest were given sentences ranging from one to three years, the court said.The accused include Omar Ayub Khan and Shibli Faraz, the leaders of Khan's opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) in the lower and upper houses of parliament respectively, the court order seen by Reuters read.""The prosecution has proved its case against the accused without a shadow of doubt,"" it said in announcing the sentences.Khan, who has been in prison since 2023 facing charges of corruption, land fraud and disclosure of official secrets, is being tried separately on similar charges related to the riot.The government accuses him and other leaders of inciting the May 9, 2023, protests, during which demonstrators attacked military and government buildings, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi.He denies wrongdoing and says all the cases are politically motivated as part of a military-backed crackdown to dismantle his party. The military denies it.Khan's arrest had prompted the countrywide violent protests.Thursday's ruling does not directly affect the incitement case against him in which prosecution is still presenting witnesses.The PTI party said it will challenge the verdict.The ruling is the third such mass conviction this month; Khan's party says they have included at least 14 of its parliamentarians.They will lose their seats in parliament under Pakistani laws, which will shred Khan's opposition party's strength.Another 77 were acquitted for lack of evidence in the latest verdict, which is linked to an attack on the office of an intelligence agency in eastern city of Faisalabad, the court said.The party plans new protests starting on August 5, the second anniversary of Khan's jailing, to demand his release.","Fifty-eight of the defendants, who included parliamentarians and senior officials, were sentenced to 10 years in prison.

They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care. We have done very little business with India — their tariffs are too high, among the highest in the world.

"Glacial bursts, cloudbursts kill 293 in Pakistan; another monsoon spell looms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/glacial-bursts-cloudbursts-kill-293-in-pakistan-another-monsoon-spell-looms/articleshow/122983132.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June as glacial lake outbursts, cloudbursts, and relentless monsoon rains triggered catastrophic floods across the country, from the Himalayas to the southern plains.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of another severe monsoon spell starting July 29, raising fears of fresh flash floods and landslides, especially in northern regions like Swat, Chitral, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Torrential rains have wreaked havoc across the country, sweeping away entire families, burying homes under landslides, and cutting off remote valleys. A sudden cloudburst near Babusar Top and Naran stranded scores of tourists, prompting military-led rescue operations by air and road. Washed-away bridges and blocked highways have hampered relief efforts.The NDMA, provincial agencies, and army teams are on the ground, but operations remain slow and patchy, especially in the hard-to-reach northern areas. Helicopter sorties continue, though poor weather and visibility are disrupting missions.Experts blame successive govts for ignoring climate adaptation and disaster preparedness, despite warnings. “The pattern is repeating itself — glacial melts, erratic monsoons, unprepared institutions. It’s a deadly mix,” said a disaster risk analyst in Islamabad.The crisis echoes the devastating 2022 monsoon floods, which killed over 1,700, submerged a third of the country, and displaced over 30 million people, causing $30 billion in economic losses. Yet, activists say climate resilience remains absent from Pakistan’s national priorities.With more glaciers than any non-polar country, Pakistan faces an increasing frequency of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) due to rising temperatures. Add to that deforestation, poor drainage, and unregulated construction, and experts say even routine monsoons now turn deadly.As another deluge looms, govt has advised evacuations from high-risk zones and warned tourists to stay away from northern areas. But for many already stranded, the warnings have come too late.","At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June.

Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi, officials confirmed on Monday.Among those killed was Zafran, who was identified as the mastermind of a November 2024 attack on two Chinese engineers in Pakistan's largest city. He carried a bounty of Rs 20 million.The operation was conducted late Sunday night in the Manghopir area by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and intelligence agencies, CTD official Raja Umer Khattab told. The TTP men opened fire when they saw security personnel approaching, triggering a firefight which lasted over an hour.Authorities recovered a suicide jacket, three grenades, a Kalashnikov rifle, two pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition from the site.On November 5 last year, a private security guard opened fire on two Chinese nationals at a textile mill in Karachi, injuring both before fleeing.Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in militant attacks—particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan—since the TTP ended its ceasefire with the federal government in late 2022.Founded in 2007, the TTP is an umbrella organisation of various extremist groups seeking to impose a strict version of Islamic law across Pakistan. It has claimed responsibility for numerous high-profile attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad, the 2009 assault on army headquarters, and multiple strikes on security installations.","Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi.

Pakistan tribal council threatens highway block over girl’s murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tribal-council-threatens-highway-block-over-girls-murder/articleshow/122939897.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: A tribal jirga (council of elders) in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway on July 29 after the killing of a nine-year-old girl sparked public outrage. Convened in Tank’s Gul Imam on Saturday, the jirga issued an 11-point charter of demands, warning of a full blockade if authorities fail to respond.Indus Highway (N-55) is a critical national artery that runs along the river, connecting Karachi in Pakistan’s south with Peshawar in the north and cutting through multiple provinces. The planned blockade at Pezu will impact trade routes, passenger transport, and military convoys.The protests gained momentum after a viral video showed residents confronting armed security personnel -- an extraordinary act in this militarised stretch of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The footage amplified long-standing anger over arbitrary detentions, raids without warrants, and what locals call collective punishment disguised as counterterrorism.“Our decision to block the highway remains. If our demands are accepted, we’ll reconsider.If not, Pezu will be shut down on July 29,” jirga leader Abdul Qayum Kundi said.Police have registered a case in the girl’s death, but authorities have yet to disclose any findings. Locals allege misconduct or negligence by security forces—claims that remain unverified but widely believed within the community.In a bid to defuse tensions, local officials delivered three sheep and (Pak) Rs 2.5 million (around $9,000) to the girl’s family -- an act rooted in tribal custom, meant to symbolise remorse and reconciliation. But jirga members view it as a token gesture. “This is hush money in ceremonial form,” said one elder.The jirga’s demands include the release of detainees not proven to have militant ties, an end to forced house searches, and a halt to arrests of suspects’ relatives. They also call for the return of confiscated weapons and an end to detentions based on vague accusations of mukhbiri (spying).The jirga’s demands echo those of the banned Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which for years challenged Pakistan’s security policies in its tribal belt.","A tribal jirga in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway.

The crisis of enforced disappearances in Pakistan's Balochistan region and beyond has deepened this week, as a disturbing string of abductions emerges from Karachi, Noshki, and Kech, according to The Balochistan Post (TBP).Among the most alarming cases is that of Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi.On Monday evening, he was reportedly abducted near the university's Maskan Gate. Eyewitnesses say he was taken by unidentified men in a vehicle while returning to his hostel with friends.Originally from Mashkay in Awaran district, Muslim Dad was a familiar face within the Baloch student community in Karachi. His sudden disappearance has sparked fear among his peers and left his family devastated.In Noshki, another troubling case unfolded earlier today when Hafeezullah, the son of Peer Mohammad and a resident of Qaziabad, was allegedly picked up from his home by Pakistani security forces. His family has raised alarm over his unknown whereabouts and is demanding his immediate release.TBP also reported two recent disappearances in Kech district.On July 23, 16-year-old shopkeeper Qambar Baloch was allegedly taken by men believed to belong to Military Intelligence and the ISI while he was in Jusak, Turbat. And on June 27, Imran Khan, a 26-year-old student of Balochi language and culture at the University of Turbat, was reportedly abducted by Frontier Corps and Military Intelligence personnel in Turbat city—in broad daylight.“These are not isolated cases. This is a pattern,” said a representative from Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), a group that has long campaigned for the safe recovery of abducted individuals. Despite repeated appeals and protests, most cases remain unresolved, with no accountability or formal investigations.","Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi, was reportedly abducted on Monday.

Pakistan Blames India For Tensions, Credits Trump For Ceasefire Between Nuclear Rivals





Beijing/Islamabad: Pakistan army chief Asim Munir, who is on his first visit to China after his elevation as the field marshal, on Friday held talks with top Chinese leaders and discussed ways to deepen cooperation across all sectors. Munir held separate meetings with V-P Han Zheng, top military official general Zhang Youxia and foreign minister Wang Yi, according to official media reports.This is Munir's first visit to China after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistam in response to the Pahalgam terror attack. During the conflict, Pakistan used extensive military equipment supplied by China. This is also Munir's first visit to China after his trip to Washington, where he met US President Trump and sought to establish close ties with America, Beijing's strategic rival.The visit coincides with Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar making a trip to Washington, where he is expected to meet US secretary of state Marco Rubio. Dar was in China July 14 to attend Shanghai Cooperation Organisation foreign ministers' meeting.A Pakistan military statement said that in their talks, the ""Chinese leadership lauded Pakistan armed forces as a cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor to peace in South Asia. Both sides expressed satisfaction over the depth of bilateral engagement and reiterated shared commitment to sovereign equality, multilateral cooperation and regional stability.""","Pakistan army chief Asim Munir is on his first visit to China after his elevation as the field marshal.

"Two years on, Imran Khan's sons step in as protest call rattles Islamabad",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/two-years-on-imran-khans-sons-step-in-as-protest-call-rattles-islamabad/articleshow/122911552.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: As jailed former PM Imran Khan completes two years in prison, his sons – Sulaiman and Qasim – have stepped into the political spotlight, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release just days before Khan’s call for a nationwide protest on Aug 5, which has put the state on edge.Khan, arrested on Aug 5, 2023, remains behind bars despite some convictions being overturned. He is currently serving time in three major cases that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claims are part of a broader effort to keep him out of politics.He was convicted in the Toshakhana case, involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during his premiership. He was sentenced in the cipher case, accused of leaking classified diplomatic correspondence for political gain. And in the Al-Qadir Trust case, Khan and his wife were held liable for controversial land deals linked to a charitable trust.PTI has consistently maintained that the charges are politically motivated, aimed at “eliminating the most popular leader” in the country.Now, with most of PTI’s senior leadership jailed, exiled, or forced to resign, Khan’s sons have taken the international route. Based in the UK, the brothers have held meetings in Washington DC with US lawmakers, policy groups and human rights organisations, and are reportedly preparing to testify before congressional panels.Their message: Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in inhumane conditions, denied light, medical access, and family contact.The campaign has triggered speculation about whether the two sons might return to Pakistan, possibly to appear at the planned protest. While PTI has not confirmed this, party insiders say their presence could act as a powerful morale boost for the party’s dispersed support base.Meanwhile, the state has moved swiftly to neutralise any protest momentum. On July 22, an anti-terror court in Lahore sentenced eight senior PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, to 10 years in prison for their alleged role in the May 9 riots, when military installations were targeted after Khan’s initial arrest. Observers see the convictions as a tactical strike to undercut mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 protest. The verdicts have raised concerns among legal experts about the selective use of terrorism laws against political opponents.From prison, Khan has issued a call for unity among PTI ranks, urging supporters to “shun differences” and prepare for what he called a decisive moment for Pakistan’s democracy. But the party remains fractured and leaderless, with ongoing rifts between loyalists and factions seen as open to negotiations with the establishment.At the heart of the political storm is the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was controversially elevated to five-star rank in May. PTI blames him, along with PML-N and PPP leaders, for orchestrating what it calls a civil-military clampdown to sideline Khan and crush dissent.In a recent prison note, Khan mocked Munir as the “King of the Jungle”, accusing him of ruling the country through “fear, not law”.","Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release.

Protests mark Hasina’s exit anniversary: Student-led party rallies in Dhaka; calls for new constitution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/protests-mark-hasinas-exit-anniversary-student-led-party-rallies-in-dhaka-calls-for-new-constitution/articleshow/123078902.cms,"Protesters on the streets of Dhaka (AP)





A newly formed political party led by students who played a key role in the anti-government protests that led to the ouster of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina held a rally in the country's capital Dhaka on Sunday, pledging to build a new Bangladesh amid ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the next national election, reported news agency AP.The National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters. Party leader Nahid Islam announced a 24-point agenda and called for the creation of a new constitution to replace the one adopted in 1972.“Exactly one year ago, at this Shaheed Minar (memorial), we vowed to free this country from the hands of dictatorship. By responding to that call, we together defeated the fascist rule and regained control of our country,” Islam said.“Let us all unite and transform this historic 24-point agenda into reality to build a new Bangladesh, a Bangladesh that fulfills the dreams of all citizens, as we move toward the formation of our second republic,” he added, as quoted by the agency.The party did not provide specific details on the proposed constitution but said its goal was to reflect the aspirations of a new generation of Bangladeshis.Separately, the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) also held a large rally in Dhaka.BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, who has been in exile in London since 2008, addressed the crowd virtually and urged supporters to mobilise young voters ahead of the upcoming polls, according to AP.Rahman said, “We must reclaim our democratic rights and engage the youth in shaping Bangladesh’s future.”The rallies took place two days before the interim government, led by Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is set to mark the first anniversary of Sheikh Hasina’s departure from power.Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, following weeks of mass protests and political unrest that resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. Yunus assumed office on August 8.The demonstrations come amid criticism of the interim government’s handling of law and order, with opposition parties accusing it of failing to contain mob violence and uphold human rights.With Hasina’s Awami League banned and the political future still unclear, the rallies highlighted the growing activity among both new and established political forces ahead of the next election.","National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Electric vehicles account for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal.

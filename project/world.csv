A Dhaka court on Tuesday ordered the seizure of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina 's residence, 'Sudhasadan,' along with other properties owned by her family members, who are in exile in India. 124 bank accounts linked to her family also have been frozen, according to an official.The ruling was issued by Dhaka metropolitan senior special judge Zakir Hossain Ghalib following an application by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC).The seized properties include assets owned by Hasina’s son, Sajib Wazed Joy , daughter Saima Wazed Putul , sister Sheikh Rehana, and her children, Tulip Siddique and Radwan Mujib Siddique. Hasina’s late husband, nuclear scientist MA Wazed Miah, was nicknamed Sudha Miah, after whom 'Sudhasadan' was named.Meanwhile, Bangladesh’s ministry of foreign affairs has lodged a protest with the Indian government over what it calls “false and fabricated” statements made by Hasina on social media and other platforms.In a diplomatic note to India’s acting High Commissioner in Dhaka, Bangladesh urged New Delhi to take steps to prevent her from making such remarks, which it claims are inciting instability.On August 5, a student-led movement ousted Hasina after weeks of protests and violent clashes that left over 600 people dead. The 77-year-old leader fled to India, and an interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus was installed.","Dhaka court orders seizure of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's residence, 'Sudhasadan,' along with other properties owned by her family members. 124 bank accounts linked to her family also have been frozen, according to an official.

Federal cuts hit schools and food banks: USDA pulls $1 billion in funding to local food programes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/federal-cuts-hit-schools-and-food-banks-usda-pulls-1-billion-in-funding-to-local-food-programes/articleshow/118912679.cms,"Representative image

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is discontinuing two federal programmes totalling $1 billion in funding that enabled schools and food banks to procure food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers, citing a need to ""return to long-term, fiscally responsible initiatives.""The cancellation affects approximately $660 million in funding this year for the Local Food for Schools programme , operational in 40 states, alongside $420 million for the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, which supported food banks and local organisations in community food distribution , as reported by CBS News.This action aligns with efforts by the Trump administration and Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to reduce government expenditure. These USDA programmes were supported through the Commodity Credit Corporation , established during the Depression era for direct farmer purchases.A representative from the USDA confirmed to Politico that after providing a 60-day notice, the selected programmes would be "" terminated following 60-day notification”.Additionally, justifying the decision, a USDA spokesperson stated via email to CBS MoneyWatch: ""Unlike the Biden Administration, which funneled billions in [Commodity Credit Corporation] funds into short-term programs with no plan for longevity, USDA is prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.""Schools recently learnt about the $660 million funding reduction for the current year, according to Diane Pratt-Heavner from the School Nutrition Association. This withdrawal impacts schools nationwide already dealing with elevated food costs.One affected school district reports losing $100,000 intended for local beef and produce purchases for student meals.""It's a pretty big hit, and that's mostly fresh fruits and vegetables,"" stated Patti Bilbrey, nutrition services director at Scottsdale Unified School District, Arizona. ""It wasn't just about keeping food costs low — it meant supporting your community and your local farmers in your state.""Though $100,000 comprises roughly 2% of the district's annual £6 million food budget, Bilbrey indicated it enabled purchases from small farmers and introduction of items like microgreens to students. ""The Local Food for Schools programme was a godsend to us,"" Bilbrey said. ""It keeps our meal costs down, and we're helping our community, which improves the perception of school meals.""","USDA discontinues two federal programmes totalling $1 billion in funding.

However, during the Europe Subcommittee hearing when Self introduced her as ""Mr. McBride,"", she responded by addressing him as “Madam Chair” before proceeding with her remarks.Rep.

When Self doubled down and again referred to her as “Mr. McBride,” Keating pushed back. ""Mr. Chairman, you are out of order,"" Keating said. ""Have you no decency?""Self dismissed the objection and attempted to move on, but Keating refused, saying, ""You will not continue it with me unless you introduce a duly elected representative the right way."" Following this, Self abruptly ended the session.Later, Self defended his actions on social media, claiming his refusal to recognise McBride as a woman aligned with a Trump administration policy that says the federal government would only recognise two biological sexes.This is not the first time McBride has faced similar treatment. In February, Rep. Mary Miller (R-Ill.) referred to her as “the gentleman from Delaware” during a House floor speech.

USAID employees told to burn, shred and destroy classified documents

A USAID contractors’ union on Tuesday urged a federal judge to stop the destruction of classified documents after an internal email instructed staff to shred and burn records as the Trump administration dismantles the agency.Judge Carl Nichols has given both sides until Wednesday morning to submit arguments. The union, Personal Services Contractor Association, represents thousands of USAID contractors who were recently fired or furloughed. The group is concerned that the destruction of documents could erase key evidence related to legal challenges against USAID’s shutdown.The email, bearing the name of acting executive secretary Erica Carr, was sent to key personnel. It thanked staff for helping “clear classified safes and personnel documents” at USAID’s Washington headquarters, reported Associated Press. Employees were told to prioritise shredding but use burn bags if shredders became overloaded. Staffers were also told to write ""secret"" on the bag with a marker.The Trump administration has been shutting down USAID, slashing 83% of its foreign aid programs, firing most staff, and closing the agency’s headquarters. The move has triggered lawsuits over the sudden loss of US foreign assistance.Democratic Representative Gregory Meeks criticised the administration, saying the rushed destruction of records could be an attempt to hide wrongdoing. The American Foreign Service Association, which represents USAID employees, has also raised concerns that the documents being destroyed might be linked to lawsuits over mass firings and program terminations.Classified document access has been a contentious issue at USAID. Last month, the Trump administration placed the agency’s top two security officials on leave after they refused to grant access to classified materials for Elon Musk’s government-cutting team.With most of USAID’s staff already dismissed, only a few employees have access to agency records.","USAID employees told to burn, shred and destroy classified documents.

ICC investigation and Duterte’s defence

A plane carrying former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte departed Manila on Tuesday night, bound for The Hague, where he is set to face charges at the International Criminal Court (ICC). Duterte was arrested, and accused of crimes against humanity over his deadly war on drugs .At 11.03 pm Tuesday, Duterte’s plane took off from Manila and exited Philippine airspace, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. confirmed. Flight tracking data showed the aircraft was scheduled to make a stop in Dubai before continuing to Rotterdam, the Netherlands.Duterte is now set to be turned over to ICC authorities in The Hague, where he will face trial for crimes against humanity. His legal team continues to challenge the move.The ICC confirmed it had issued an arrest warrant against Duterte over alleged crimes against humanity during his deadly war on drugs. ""Once a suspect is in ICC custody, an initial appearance hearing will be scheduled,"" said ICC spokesman Fadi Abdullah.Duterte was taken into custody at Manila’s international airport on Tuesday morning after returning from a brief trip to Hong Kong with his family. Authorities arrested him on an ICC warrant , which alleges that his anti-drug campaign—carried out both as mayor of Davao City and later as president—led to widespread extrajudicial killings . Estimates of the death toll range from the 6,000 reported by Philippine police to as many as 30,000, according to human rights groups.Duterte appeared visibly irritated as he questioned the legality of his detention. “Show to me now the legal basis for my being here,” he said in a video posted on social media by his daughter, Veronica Duterte. His legal team swiftly petitioned the Supreme Court to block any move to send him to The Hague, arguing that the Philippines is no longer a member of the ICC.The ICC’s warrant, issued on March 7, states that there are “reasonable grounds to believe” Duterte was responsible for crimes against humanity, with the killings described as “both widespread and systematic.” It argued that his arrest was necessary to ensure he appeared before the court, citing concerns that he might obstruct investigations or influence witnesses.Duterte pulled the Philippines out of the ICC in 2019 and has repeatedly dismissed the tribunal’s authority. Speaking in Hong Kong just days before his arrest, he called ICC investigators “sons of whores” but insisted he would “accept it” if detained.The Marcos administration , which has distanced itself from Duterte’s policies, previously stated it would not cooperate with the ICC’s investigation. However, Undersecretary of the Presidential Communications Office Claire Castro acknowledged that if Interpol requested assistance, the government would be “obliged to follow.”","Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested on Tuesday.

Southwest Airlines ending 'bags fly free' policy after 54 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/southwest-airlines-ending-bags-fly-free-policy-after-54-years/articleshow/118891435.cms,"Southwest Airlines is ending its free checked baggage policy.

'Bags fly free' no more

Dallas-based Southwest Airlines announced Tuesday that it would no longer allow free checked baggage beginning on May 28. Only the members of its A-list loyalty program or business passengers will be exempt from the fees. “We have tremendous opportunity to meet current and future customer needs, attract new customer segments we don’t compete for today, and return to the levels of profitability that both we and our shareholders expect,” said Bob Jordan, CEO of Southwest, in a press release.Since its founding in 1971, Southwest had two perks: open seating and bags fly free. But now both are gone, first, they did away with open seating and then free baggage. CNN called this move a ""seismic shift"" for the Southwest and the 'Bags fly free' policy which was also its tagline set Southwest apart from its competitors.Southwest didn’t immediately reveal how much the checked bags would cost. Regardless of the price, it will likely instantly boost its bottom line because Southwest has two to three times as many checked bags as other airlines, CNN reported adding that the shares of Southwest soared nearly 6 per cent in premarket trading after it announced its policy change.Southwest said these two changes were necessary as the customers have been pitching for allocated seats. When people switch to a competitor from Southwest, the company said the No. 1 reason passengers cite is open seating. But the change will also help the company charge some passengers more for their tickets.In another crucial change, Southwest announced that apart from Southwest.com, it would sell tickets on Expedia in an attempt to attract more customers. Southwest also announced Tuesday it will also start selling “basic economy” fares in May, which are low-priced tickets but with tons of restrictions.","Since its founding in 1971, Southwest had two perks: open seating and bags fly free.

How category-based draws work

Meet the baseline eligibility requirements of Express Entry (FSWP, FSTP, or CEC);

Have at least six months of full-time experience in the last three years in a listed occupation or demonstrate French language proficiency.

Canada has announced significant updates to its Express Entry system for 2025 – this mechanism issues permanent residency invites to successful candidates. The focus of the update is to address labour shortages and enhance economic growth. Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship (IRCC), recently revealed the latest changes, including the introduction of a new education category and an increased emphasis on inviting candidates with Canadian work experience.The Express Entry system, which manages applications for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP), and Canadian Experience Class (CEC), will prioritize candidates with work experience in Canada. The goal is to transition more temporary residents to permanent status while meeting labour demands in high-priority sectors.Category-based draws, first introduced in 2023, will continue in 2025 with an updated structure. The six original categories—French-language proficiency, healthcare, STEM, trades, transport, and agriculture and agri-food—are being revised. The transport category has been removed, while a new education category has been added to recognize the demand for teachers and early childhood educators.As covered by TOI earlier, Canada has significantly dropped its permanent residency targets as compared to earlier years. It has cut it down to 11.4 lakh permanent residents for the three year period 2025-2027. It is likely that the year 2025 will experience fewer general category draws and more category based draws and draws for CEC category.Each occupational category includes a list of professions eligible for targeted Express Entry draws. Notable changes include:The full list of eligible occupations for the 2025 Express Entry draws spans across healthcare, STEM, trades, agriculture, and education, ensuring that Canada’s evolving labour market is well supported.The introduction of the education category marks a major shift in Canada’s approach to immigration. The following five occupations are now included under this category:Category-based selection allows Canada to invite candidates who meet specific economic priorities. To qualify, candidates must:The highest-ranking candidates within each category are invited to apply for permanent residency, with the lowest ranking score required for selection published after each draw.The main advantage of the category-based draws is that the qualifying Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score tends to be lower than for the general draws.The 2025 Express Entry changes signal a major shift in Canada's immigration strategy, with a continued emphasis on healthcare, education, and Francophone immigration. The introduction of the education category, adjustments to occupation lists, and increased focus on candidates with Canadian work experience reflect Canada’s commitment to a well-managed and sustainable immigration system. Time will tell how these changes impact selection scores and overall immigration trends, but for skilled workers worldwide, the opportunity to build a future in Canada remains strong.","Canada has announced significant updates to its Express Entry system for 2025.

President Masoud Pezeshkian of Iran has refused to negotiate a nuclear deal with the United States, days after his US counterpart Donald Trump sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, expressing his willingness to negotiate a deal.In a strong remark, Pezeshkian said Iran would not negotiate while being 'threatened' by the US, and told Trump to 'do whatever the hell you want.'""It is unacceptable for us that they (the US) give orders and make threats. I won’t even negotiate with you (Trump). Do whatever the hell you want,"" Iran's state media quoted Pezeshkian as saying.The Iranian President's statement follows Supreme Leader Khamenei's declaration that they would not be 'bullied' into negotiations.Trump disclosed during a Fox Business interview last week that he had written to Khamenei, and said he hoped Iran would come to the negotiating table or 'it will be very ugly for them.'""The other alternative is we have to do something, because you can't let them have nuclear weapons,"" he added.However, the White House is yet to confirm the specifics of the letter, including whether it was directly addressed to Khamenei.While expressing openness to a deal with Tehran, Trump has reinstated the 'maximum pressure' campaign he applied in his first term to 'isolate' the Islamic Republic from the global economy, and drive its oil exports down towards zero.Iran has long denied wanting to develop a nuclear weapon. However, it has been 'dramatically' accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% weapons-grade level, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has warned.The Asian nation has accelerated its nuclear work since 2019, a year after then-President Trump ditched Tehran's 2015 nuclear pact with six world powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled the country's economy.(With Reuters inputs)","President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran would not negotiate while being 'threatened' by the US.

Also, over 300 staff members accepted voluntary separation incentives up to $25,000, whilst about 260 took deferred resignation packages.The department will also close several regional offices, including those in San Francisco and New York, eventually consolidating operations into a single Washington, DC location, where it currently maintains three offices.Additionally, agency representatives clarified that the previous notification to staff regarding temporary office closure, citing unspecified ""security reasons"", was actually related to these layoffs.

Ukraine targets Russia with massive drone strike, 3 die



The United States agreed on Tuesday to immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume military assistance to Ukraine after more than eight hours of meetings in Saudi Arabia where Kyiv said it would support the Trump administration’s proposal for a 30-day cease-fire with Russia.The talks in the coastal city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, brought fresh momentum to cease-fire negotiations that faltered following a public confrontation at the White House between the Ukrainian and US presidents.The Trump administration had paused all military assistance and intelligence sharing in the aftermath of the meeting. The announcement came hours after Russian officials said Ukrainian drones targeted Moscow in the largest bombardment of the war. There was no immediate comment from Russia, which did not have officials at the talks.In a joint statement, the US and Ukraine acknowledged that the terms of any cease-fire would be subject Russia’s approval. They also agreed to conclude “as soon as possible” a deal to develop Ukraine’s critical mineral resources — an agreement that was put on hold after the Oval Office dust-up. That joint venture is intended to “expand Ukraine’s economy and guarantee Ukraine’s long-term prosperity and security,” the statement said.It added that the US and Ukraine also discussed humanitarian relief efforts that would take place during a ceasefire and the exchange of prisoners of war. “Representatives of both nations praised the bravery of the Ukrainian people in defense of their nation and agreed that now is the time to begin a process toward lasting peace,” the US and Ukraine said in the statement.The US delegation in Jeddah was led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Michael Waltz, the national security adviser.

The Ukrainian military said it had targeted Moscow’s oil refinery, which provides more than a third of the fuel consumed in the capital region, along with an oil production station in the Orel region.Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, called the attack was the largest against the city since the start of the war. At least three people were killed and 18 others were injured in the broader Moscow region, the Russian authorities said, and four international airports temporarily suspended operations. Railway tracks near the Domodedovo airport south of Moscow were also damaged.","Ukraine targets Russia with massive drone strike, 3 die and 18 are injured.

"Trump retreats on doubling steel, aluminium tariffs after Canada backs down on electricity surcharge",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-retreats-on-doubling-steel-aluminium-tariffs-after-canada-backs-down-on-electricity-surcharge/articleshow/118910548.cms,"AP photo

President Trump set to reverse Canadian tariff increases

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday pulled back from his decision to raise tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium from 25% to 50%, said White House trade adviser Peter Navarro , reports Associated Press.The threat was a response to Ontario’s decision to impose surcharges on electricity exports to the US. However, Trump retreated after Ontario Premier Doug Ford agreed to drop the surcharge.""He has to bounce it off the president but I'm pretty confident he will pull back,"" Ford said on Trump's steel and aluminum tariff threat. ""By no means are we just going to roll over. What we are going to do is have a constructive conversation.""The US government, however, is still proceeding with the 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports, adding to economic uncertainty.In a social media post early Tuesday, Trump justified his threat to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium, saying it was a response to Ford’s actions. He also criticised Canada for depending on the US for military protection and repeated his call for the country to become the 51st US state. Trump added that if Canada joined the US, ""all tariffs, and everything else, would totally disappear.""The trade tensions have worsened relations between the US and Canada. Mark Carney , set to replace Justin Trudeau as Canada’s Prime Minister, has pledged to keep tariffs on US goods in place until the US government shows “respect” and commits to free trade. Canada had already imposed $30 billion in retaliatory tariffs on American products, including orange juice, peanut butter, coffee, and appliances.Trump has defended tariffs as a key tool for protecting American industries, but markets have reacted negatively. The stock market has been on a downturn, with the S&P 500 dropping 2.7% on Monday and continuing to slide on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 478 points, further erasing gains from Trump’s 2024 election victory.The tariff strategy has also raised concerns about a potential recession. Harvard economist Larry Summers estimates a 50% chance of an economic downturn, while Goldman Sachs has revised its US growth forecast downward. Trump has downplayed these fears, insisting that tariffs will eventually benefit the US economy by pushing companies to relocate factories to American soil.","President Trump set to reverse Canadian tariff increases.

After Trump threat, House passes bill to avoid government shutdown

The US House of Representatives approved a continuing resolution (CR), a temporary spending measure on Tuesday to prevent an imminent government shutdown . It funds the government through September 30, giving lawmakers more time to negotiate a long-term budget.The measure now moves to the Senate, where it faces a tough battle. The bill requires at least eight Democratic votes to pass, but many Democrats oppose it due to proposed budget cuts. These include reductions in funding for veterans’ health programs, medical research, nuclear non-proliferation, and rural broadband.Most Senate Democrats oppose the 99-page continuing resolution (CR), as it cuts domestic spending by approximately $13 billion while raising defense funding by around $6 billion.One controversial aspect of the bill is a provision that limits Congress ’s ability to challenge tariffs imposed under emergency economic powers. This has drawn criticism from both parties, as it gives the White House more control over trade policy.If the Senate rejects the bill, the government will shut down at midnight on Friday. A shutdown would result in the suspension of many federal services, furloughs for thousands of government workers, and economic uncertainty. The financial markets, already affected by trade tensions and inflation fears, could take another hit.Republicans argue that if Democrats block the bill, they will be responsible for a shutdown—just months after they blamed the Republican party for the same issue in December.Democratic leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Appropriations Chair Patty Murray, have blasted the bill, arguing it gives the Trump administration too much control over federal spending. Murray warned it would let Trump and Elon Musk, head of the Department of Government Efficiency, dictate budget priorities, potentially hurting both blue and red states, reported Associated Press.","The US House of Representatives approved a temporary spending measure on Tuesday to prevent an imminent government shutdown.

ISLAMABAD: Global rights organisation Amnesty International called on Pakistan Tuesday to free and drop all charges against minority Ahmadis jailed in recent weeks and ensure adequate protection of their places of worship.In the last two weeks alone, more than 60 Ahmadis, including children, have been detained and their places of worship vandalised in Punjab and Sindh provinces. Police have filed cases against them under section 298-C of Pakistan Penal Code, which bars the community from calling themselves Muslims or preaching their faith.“The disturbing pattern of arbitrary arrests , harassment and violence against Ahmadi community is in violation of their right to freedom of religion and belief. Local authorities in Pakistan must provide adequate protection to Ahmadi places of worship and officials engaged in harassment or destruction of Ahmadi property must be brought to justice,” Amnesty posted on X.In Pakistan, Ahmadis face significant and escalating threat from the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a far-right Islamist political party known for its hardline stance on blasphemy and its targeting of religious minorities.TLP members have been linked to physical attacks on Ahmadis, desecration of their graves, and demolition of their places of worship. Since the start of this month, TLP members have reportedly attacked 27 Ahmadis in Bahawalnagar, demolished a 120-year-old place of worship in Gujranwala and gathered outside worship sites in cities like Karachi, Sialkot and Jauharabad to prevent Ahmadis from praying, often with police either unable or unwilling to intervene effectively.On March 1, police arrested 22 Ahmadis in Daska region of Sialkot for offering prayers in their religious place. On March 7, over two dozen members of the Ahmadi community, including children, were taken into “protective custody” by law enforcement personnel as a mob gathered outside its place of worship in Surjani, Karachi.Later that day, police registered a criminal case against over two dozen Ahmadi members and arrested six of them on a TLP activist’s complaint in Surjani.The previous day, police booked nine people, two of them Ahmadis, on charges of torturing a TLP activist to death during a scuffle in Bahawalnagar. However, intelligence and police sources suggest the TLP activist’s death was not a result of a fight with Ahmadis. They said the seven people who faced charges of killing a TLP worker were members of Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ). There had been a confrontation between ASWJ activists and TLP members a couple of days back.","In the last two weeks, more than 60 Ahmadis, including children, have been detained and their places of worship vandalised in Punjab and Sindh provinces.

Pakistan has been ranked the third most polluted country in the world in 2024, as it battled unprecedented smog that severely impacted public health, according to a new report.The Swiss air technology company IQAir, in its 2024 World Air Quality Report, placed Pakistan behind Chad and Bangladesh in global pollution rankings. The Democratic Republic of Congo and India followed in fourth and fifth place, respectively, the Dawn reported.Pakistan experienced record levels of smog last year, particularly in Punjab, where authorities declared the situation a “calamity.” Nearly two million people required medical attention due to pollution-related health problems. The government imposed lockdowns and shut down schools in affected areas to curb the crisis.The report highlighted that Pakistan’s average concentration of PM2.5—fine particulate matter harmful to human health—was 73.7 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m³), nearly 15 times above the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) safe limit.Despite the extreme smog, Pakistan’s overall air pollution levels remained unchanged from 2023, the study noted.Within the Central and South Asia region, Pakistan ranked second behind Bangladesh, with several of its cities among the most polluted. Lahore, Multan, Peshawar, and Sialkot were among the 15 worst-hit cities.The report attributed Pakistan’s persistently high pollution levels to multiple sources, including biomass burning, industrial emissions, vehicular pollution, brick kilns, and construction dust.Compared to 2023, annual pollution levels worsened in cities like Peshawar, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Lahore. Faisalabad recorded a slight increase, while Karachi’s PM2.5 levels dropped from over 55 μg/m³ in 2023 to around 46 μg/m³ in 2024.The report further revealed that five Pakistani cities recorded PM2.5 levels exceeding 200 μg/m³ in November.A separate survey by international research firm Ipsos found that around 70% of Pakistan’s population suffered from health issues due to smog.","Pakistan has been ranked the third most polluted country in the world in 2024, as it battled unprecedented smog.

ISLAMABAD: Unidentified gunmen shot dead three migrant barbers inside their shop in Panjgur district of Pakistan’s volatile southwestern Baluchistan province, police said on Monday.Baluchistan has in recent years witnessed a sharp increase in targeted killings of non-Baluch inhabitants, including barbers, commuters, and workers from other provinces, particularly Punjab. Ethnic Baluch separatist militants accuse non-Baluch residents of spying for the Pakistani military, against which they have waged an insurgency.The victims of the latest incident hailed from Mirpurkhas and Jacobabad districts in southern Sindh province“Three Sindhi barbers lost their lives in a targeted attack in Gowargo area of Panjgur district,” Muhammad Zaid, a police officer in Panjgur district, said. The gunmen arrived on a motorbike, entered the barber shop late Sunday evening, opened fire and then fled, police said.The victims’ bodies were moved to a local hospital for post-mortem examinations before being sent to their hometowns.Shahid Rind, Baluchistan govt spokesperson, described the attack as barbaric and intended to sow discord among provinces.No group has claimed the attack. The separatist Baluchistan Liberation Army (BLA) had accepted responsibility for similar attacks in the past. BLA is the most active group in the region; it accuses outsiders of exploiting the rich resources of their province.Last month, militants had executed seven Punjabi labourers after stopping a bus on a highway in Baluchistan and identifying where the passengers were from.Eleven Punjabi labourers were killed after being abducted from a bus in the city of Naushki in April last year, while seven Punjabi barbers were killed a month later near Gwadar Port in the restive province.","Unidentified gunmen shot dead three migrant barbers inside their shop.

A man in Pakistan has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting the admin of a community WhatsApp group who removed him from the chat, police said on Saturday.The shooting took place on Thursday evening in Regi, a locality on the outskirts of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan and has a history of sectarian violence .According to police records and a local official, the suspect, identified as Ashfaq Khan, has been charged with the murder of Mushtaq Ahmed. The dispute began when Mushtaq removed Ashfaq from the WhatsApp group following an argument. Hoping to reconcile, both men agreed to meet, but Ashfaq allegedly arrived with a gun and opened fire, killing Mushtaq on the spot.The police report noted that both men were in the process of reconciliation when the suspect suddenly opened fire. The motive behind the attack was “in reaction to removal from WhatsApp group,” as stated in the report.Humayun Khan, the victim’s brother, told Arab News that he was present at the scene but was unaware of the nature of the dispute.“My slain brother Mushtaq and Ashfaq had developed some differences in a WhatsApp group, forcing my brother to remove the latter. Ashfaq got infuriated and shot my brother dead,” he said. “It was a non-issue or a very trivial matter. No one in our family even knew about the dispute at all.”Local police officer Abid Khan confirmed that Humayun had filed a complaint against Ashfaq, who fled the scene after the attack. Authorities are conducting raids to apprehend him.The incident has triggered widespread reactions on social media, with many expressing sorrow over such violence during the holy fasting month of Ramadan.Easy access to firearms, the influence of tribal customs, and weak law enforcement in the region often contribute to minor disputes spiralling into deadly confrontations.","A man in Pakistan has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting the admin of a community WhatsApp group who removed him from the chat.

KARACHI: Six members of the minority Ahmadi community were arrested by police on Saturday after it earlier provided protective custody to around two dozen of them following threats from a sectarian politico-religious party. The police registered cases against the Ahmadi community members after taking them into protective custody when Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) activists gathered outside their place of worship in Surjani town of Karachi to prevent them from offering ""Friday prayers"".""Today, we arrested six people on the complaint of a TLP activist in Surjani,"" a senior police official said.The approximately 500,000-member Ahmadi community in Pakistan is a religious minority which claims itself as Muslims but was officially declared ""non-Muslim"" in 1974 through an amendment in the constitution.They have faced prosecution from right-wing religious parties notably in the Punjab province in recent times.Amir Mahmood, a community spokesperson, said TLP activists had gathered outside their place of worship since Friday afternoon and threatened to tear it down.DIG West, Irfan Baloch, said the TLP activists demanded the arrest of Ahmadi community leaders and the sealing of their place of worship.Ahmadis have generally done their religious rites inside closed buildings to avoid trouble as their worship places have been destroyed and damaged by right-wing religious protesters in the past.Mahmood said detaining Ahmadis from their place of worship for performing their rituals ""was a grave violation of human rights and Pakistan's Constitution"".DIG Baloch said the police would get a ""legal opinion"" about the place of worship as it was a sensitive matter.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said on Tuesday it observed a growing trend of mob-led attacks on the homes of families belonging to religious minorities and their places of worship.The HRCP in a report also mentioned the ""arbitrary"" detention of Ahmadis, the alleged desecration of their graves, and the vulnerability of Hindu and Christian women to forced conversion.The HRCP in its report ""Under Siege: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2023-24"" said about 750 persons were in prison on charges of blasphemy as of October last year.It documented at least four faith-based killings, three of which targeted the Ahmadiyya community.","Ahmadis have generally done their religious rites inside closed buildings to avoid trouble.

Dozens of Tibetan protesters clashed with police outside the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi on Monday as Tibetans living in exile marked the 66th anniversary of their uprising against China that was crushed by Chinese forces.As in past years, police blocked the protesters from entering the embassy and briefly detained some of them after wrestling them to the ground.Hundreds also marched in the north Indian town of Dharamshala, the seat of the exiled Tibetan government and home of Dalai Lama , their 89-year-old spiritual leader. Separately, about a hundred Tibetan women gathered at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi, an area designated for protests close to Parliament.The protesters shouted anti-China slogans, carried Tibetan flags and played the national anthems of Tibet and India.India considers Tibet to be part of China, although it hosts the Tibetan exiles. The 1959 independence uprising was quelled by the Chinese army, forcing Dalai Lama and his followers into exile in India.Many had their faces painted in colors of the Tibetan national flag. The demonstrators observed a minute of silence to remember Tibetans who lost their lives in the struggle against China. Monks, activists, nuns and schoolchildren marched across the town with banners reading, ""Free Tibet"" and ""Remember, Resist, Return.""Penpa Tsering - the president of the Central Tibetan Administration, as the exiled Tibetan government calls itself - accused China's leadership of carrying out a ""deliberate and dangerous strategy to eliminate the very identity of the Tibetan people.""""This marks the darkest and most critical period in the history of Tibet,"" Tsering told the gathering. ""As we commemorate the Tibetan National Uprising Day, we honor our brave martyrs, and express solidarity with our brothers and sisters inside Tibet who continue to languish under the oppressive Chinese government.""The Tibetan government-in-exile in India accuses China of denying the most fundamental human rights to people in Tibet and trying to expunge the Tibetan identity .China claims Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, but the Tibetans say the Himalayan region was virtually independent until China occupied it in 1950.The Dalai Lama denies China's claim that he is a separatist and says he only advocates substantial autonomy and protection of Tibet's native Buddhist culture.","Tibetans living in exile mark the 66th anniversary of their uprising against China.

Nepal King Gyanendra: Thousands rally in Kathmandu to welcome former king amid calls for return of monarchy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/thousands-rally-in-kathmandu-to-welcome-former-king-amid-calls-for-return-of-monarchy/articleshow/118821430.cms,"Thousands rally in Kathmandu to welcome former king amid calls for return of monarchy (Picture credit: PTI)

Nepal’s former King Gyanendra Shah was greeted with the chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday, amid growing calls for the reinstatement of the monarchy and Nepal’s status as a Hindu state.According to the news agency AFP, Shah’s supporters waved Nepal’s flag and chanted slogans like ""Come king, save the nation!"" as the 77-year-old former monarch stepped out of Tribhuvan International Airport following a tour of western Nepal.The crowd, which included members of the pro-monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party , carried placards reading ""We want our King back"" and ""Abolish federal republican system and reinstate the monarchy.""AP reported that an estimated 10,000 supporters gathered outside the airport, blocking its main entrance. Passengers were forced to walk to and from the airport due to the heavy crowd. Riot police were deployed to prevent demonstrators from entering the premises, but no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 240-year-old monarchy in 2008 after a decade-long civil war that left over 16,000 dead. However, dissatisfaction with political instability, corruption and economic struggles has fuelled a resurgence of support for the former royal family.“The country faces instability, prices are high, people are jobless, and there is a lack of education and healthcare facilities,” said Rajindra Kunwar, a teacher who joined the rally who was quoted by AFP. “The poor are dying of hunger. The law applies to the public, but not to politicians. That’s why we need the king back”, Kunwar added.Nepal has had 13 different governments since 2008, with growing frustration over governance issues. Some protesters, including those who previously supported the abolition of the monarchy, have now changed their stance. “I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken,” said Kulraj Shrestha, a carpenter. “The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind”, Shrestha added.Gyanendra, who has generally remained silent on political matters, has made several public appearances recently. On the eve of Nepal’s Democracy Day last month, he issued a statement saying, ""It is now time. If we wish to save our nation and maintain national unity, I call on all countrymen to support us for Nepal's prosperity and progress.""Despite the rising pro-monarchy sentiment, political analyst Lok Raj Baral told AFP that the monarchy's return is unlikely, stating that it was ""a source of instability."" He added, ""For some disgruntled groups, it has become a retreat due to the incompetence of politicians.""As per PTI, security was heightened in Kathmandu, with dozens of riot policemen deployed around Narayanhiti Palace Museum, the former royal residence. There were rumours that Gyanendra might attempt to enter the palace with his supporters but the former king proceeded to his private residence, Nirmal Niwas, without any incident.The movement for the monarchy’s restoration has been gaining traction since February, when Gyanendra’s Democracy Day statement reignited debate on Nepal’s future political system.Bollywood actress Manisha Koirala, who is the granddaughter of Nepal’s first elected Prime Minister BP Koirala, urged Nepalis on social media to gather at the airport to welcome the former monarch.","Nepal's former King Gyanendra Shah greeted with chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday.

Can Gyanendra return to power?

Chants of ""Long live our beloved king"" and ""Vacate the royal palace for the king"" echoed through the streets of Kathmandu on Sunday as thousands of supporters of Nepal's former king, Gyanendra Shah , gathered to demand the restoration of the monarchy and Hinduism as the state religion.An estimated 10,000 royalists blocked the main entrance to Tribhuvan International Airport as Gyanendra returned from a tour of western Nepal. Protesters waved flags and carried banners calling for the former king’s reinstatement. The demonstration disrupted airport operations, forcing passengers to walk to and from the terminal, while hundreds of riot police prevented demonstrators from entering the airport. Despite the intensity of the protest, no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule. The country became a federal democratic republic, but since then, many Nepalis have grown frustrated with political instability and economic struggles.Since the abolition of the monarchy, Nepal has seen 13 different governments, leading many to believe the current system has failed. Corruption, economic hardship, and lack of political stability have left some citizens reconsidering their stance on monarchy.""We are here to give the king our full support and to rally behind him all the way to reinstating him in the royal throne,"" said Thir Bahadur Bhandari, a 72-year-old protester.Kulraj Shrestha, a 50-year-old carpenter, admitted he had initially opposed the monarchy but had since changed his mind. ""I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken. The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind,"" he said.Despite the growing support, Gyanendra has not commented on the renewed calls for his return. Political analysts believe his chances of regaining the throne remain slim in the near future. The republic is constitutionally enshrined, and mainstream political parties remain opposed to reinstating the monarchy.Gyanendra, who first became king in 2002 after the tragic massacre of his brother King Birendra and his family, initially ruled as a constitutional monarch. However, in 2005, he seized absolute power, dissolving the government and parliament, jailing politicians and journalists, and imposing emergency rule. His authoritarian rule led to the mass protests that ultimately resulted in the abolition of the monarchy.","Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule.

Ongoing global criticism



International pressure and Taliban's isolation



On International Women's Day, the Taliban issued a statement asserting their commitment to safeguarding the rights of Afghan women.Chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid posted on his official X account, stating that the ''Islamic Emirate assumes full responsibility for the provision and safeguarding of the rights of Afghan women.''Without directly referencing International Women's Day, Mujahid said that dignity, honor, and legal rights for women remain a priority for the Taliban government.He claimed that Afghan women ''live in security, both physically and psychologically''and that their ''fundamental rights'' — such as autonomy in marital decisions, dowry entitlements, and inheritance — are protected.The Taliban's statement comes as the United Nations continues to denounce the severe restrictions on Afghan women.Since seizing control in 2021, the Taliban have imposed sweeping bans on education and employment for women. Girls were barred from secondary education, and later, from attending and teaching at Kabul University.In August 2023, the Vice and Virtue Ministry expanded restrictions, prohibiting women's voices in public and mandating full face coverings outside the home.On Saturday, the UN renewed its call for these bans to be lifted. ''The erasure of women and girls from public life cannot be ignored,'' said Roza Otunbayeva, head of the UN mission in Afghanistan.Alison Davidian, special representative for UN Women Afghanistan, added, ""We must stand with Afghan women as if our own lives depend on it — because they do.""Mujahid emphasized distinctions in Afghan and Western notions of women's rights. He said ''Afghan women's rights are situated within the specific context of an Islamic and Afghan society, which exhibits distinct divergences from Western societies and their cultural paradigms.''The Taliban remain globally isolated, with no official recognition as running Afghanistan's government due to their policies on women. In January, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor requested arrest warrants for two senior Taliban officials for their role in repressing Afghan women.Last Friday, Unesco hosted a high-level conference on women and girls in Afghanistan, featuring activists, parliamentarians, and rights experts. They included Hamida Aman, founder of the women-only station Radio Begum, former Afghan lawmaker Fawzia Koofi and human rights expert Richard Bennett, who has been barred from entering Afghanistan.In response, Saif ul-Islam Khyber, a spokesman for the Vice and Virtue Ministry, dismissed such gatherings, calling them an ''exposure of the hypocrisy of certain organizations and European Union foundations.''","The Taliban issued a statement asserting their commitment to safeguarding the rights of Afghan women.

DHAKA: Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women, calling them ""deeply troubling"" and a clear deviation from the vision of a ""New Bangladesh"" that the nation's people strive for.His comment, made at an International Women's Day event, came in the aftermath of the harrowing plight of an eight-year-old girl who is fighting for her life after being allegedly raped. This case is not an isolated incident but part of a broader, grim trend of sexual violence that has plagued the country. Reports of rape, gang rape, sexual assault and harassment have become disturbingly frequent.Addressing the situation of violence against women in Bangladesh that remained troubling since last year, with shocking numbers reported in the first two months, Fauzia Moslem, president of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, said, ""Society is descending into chaos, where lawlessness and criminal impunity are growing. The failure of law enforcement, compromises, and lack of accountability are empowering criminals.""A report by the Manabadhikar Shongskriti Foundation (MSF) in Dhaka revealed that Feb 2025 documented 295 incidents of violence against women and children, 24 more than in Jan. It noted that Islamic fundamentalist groups, terrorists, and other extremist elements play a visible role in these incidents.A total of 21 women from various professions told local media that they experienced sexual harassment outside the home in past three months. The women, aged between 19 and 48 and residing in Dhaka, reported multiple instances.According to Dhaka-based human rights organisation Ain o Salish Kendra, in Feb, 46 women were victims of rape, 22 of whom were under 18. In Jan, this number was 39, including 15 minors.(With inputs from ANI)","Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women.

The organisation was termed as a ""terrorist organisation"" by India for trying to ""establish Islamic state and caliphate globally"".The ""March for Khilafat"" was joined by the thousands and the rally began from the north gate of Baitul Mukarram National Mosque in the capital city. The clashes erupted when the police intervened to stop the march, Dhaka Tribune reported.The procession initially proceeded without disruption, but tensions flared as demonstrators moved from Paltan towards Bijoynagar, where police set up a blockade. In response, Hizb ut-Tahrir members resisted, triggering a chase between both sides.To disperse the crowd, police fired tear gas shells and sound grenades, temporarily scattering the demonstrators. However, they later regrouped and attempted to resume their procession. As tensions escalated, law enforcement once again deployed tear gas, while protesters retaliated by hurling bricks and stones at officers. The confrontation intensified, resulting in the arrest of several Hizb ut-Tahrir members, Dhaka Tribune reported.The group remains a banned organization in Bangladesh, with all its activities and demonstrations declared illegal.The march comes amid rising concerns of violence against minorities and recent attacks on cultural, religious, and diplomatic properties in the south Asian nation, as raised by India at several occasions, especially after the ouster of former Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina last year.This was reiterated by a UN report released in January which revealed that members of Bangladesh's Hindu, Ahmadiyya Muslim, and indigenous communities faced human rights abuses during the anti-discrimination protests that led to the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government in 204 and its aftermath.It said that even though authorities had reportedly made 100 arrests in connection with the attacks, many perpetrators of revenge violence and targeted assaults continued to enjoy impunity.India declared Hizb ut-Tahrir a terrorist organisation last year and said that the group was ""involved in various acts of terror, including radicalising the gullible youths to join terrorist organisations and raise funds for terror activities, posing a serious threat to the national security and sovereignty of India. The Modi government is committed to securing Bharat by dealing the forces of terror with an iron fist.”“HuT is an organisation which aims to establish Islamic state and caliphate globally, including in India, by overthrowing democratically elected governments through jihad and terrorist activities by involving citizens of the country, which is a grave threat to the democratic setup and internal security of the country,” the ministry of home affairs had said.","Hizb ut-Tahrir held its first open rally in Dhaka on Friday against Bangladeshi administration's orders.

Tories table bill amendments to deport foreign criminals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/tories-table-bill-amendments-to-deport-foreign-criminals/articleshow/118903414.cms,"File photo

LONDON: The opposition Conservative party in Britain has announced plans for a tough new crackdown on illegal migration and on foreign nationals, including Indians, who commit crimes in the UK.The Tories on Monday revealed they have tabled amendments to Labour’s Borders Bill which will require the UK govt to stop issuing visas to nationals of countries who do not take back their own citizens – including criminals – that Britain wishes to deport.They have also tabled an amendment to require a foreign national convicted of any crime to be removed from the UK, as well as anyone who has been charged with, or convicted of, immigration offences.This replaces current provisions where a prison sentence of one year is required before removal is required, and even then removal can be frustrated by asylum and human rights claims.The amendment will end exceptions granted by modern slavery, human rights and asylum laws.This is on top of the proposal announced at the weekend to disapply the Human Rights Act for immigration matters so that UK courts can only follow UK law.Around 100,000 Indian citizens are estimated to be in Britain illegally.In 2021, the UK and India signed an MoU on a migration and mobility partnership that included provisions on returns. Of the roughly 22,800 people who left the UK via enforced or voluntary return in the year ending Sept 30, 2023, 15% (3,439) were Indian, according to the Migration Observatory. Two hundred and ninety-two Indians arrived in the UK illegally on small boats in 2024.As of Dec 31, 2024, there were 305 Indian citizens in prison in the UK, according to statistics from UK’s ministry of justice.Separate stats, obtained by the Daily Telegraph under freedom of information laws, show Indian nationals were convicted of 3,242 crimes between 2021 and 2023 – a crime rate of 93.4 per 10,000 residents. Of these 148 were sexual, accounting for the third highest number of sex offence convictions.The Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill is at committee stage and has two sittings this week.The proposed clauses by the Tories are already on the amendment paper and will be voted on by the bill committee.A Conservative party spokesman said: “Some countries refuse to take back their own citizens with no right to be in the UK – so it is reasonable that the UK does not issue visas to nationals of those countries. This will encourage countries to take their own citizens back.""It has been reported that Pakistan refused to take back Rochdale grooming gang ringleader Qari Abdul Rauf despite multiple attempts to deport him. He has been released from prison and remains in the UK.MP Chris Philp, shadow home secretary, said: “These tough new measures show the Conservatives are prepared to do whatever it takes to deport foreign criminals from the UK. If a foreign citizen commits a crime here, we should kick them out – it is as simple as that. And where another country won’t take back their own citizens – including criminals – then the govt must stop issuing new visas to people from those countries.”However, a UK govt spokesperson described the amendments as ""unworkable and unrealistic"" and signalled it would not support them.The govt spokesperson said: “To ensure people can be sent back to their home country we need steadfast, long-term agreements and close collaboration with key international partners. We are introducing tougher restrictions, including the use of electronic tags and curfews, on those whose removal we are pursuing but we are presently unable to deport.""","Opposition Conservative party in Britain has announced plans for a tough new crackdown on illegal migration and on foreign nationals, including Indians, who commit crimes in the UK.

Nature rich coastline

Economic impact

GRIMSBY: Locals in the faded fishing town of Grimsby voiced fears for their livelihoods and the rich seaside environment Tuesday, a day after a cargo ship struck a tanker off England's northeast coast.There was shock Tuesday in the port town of Grimsby a day after a cargo ship struck a tanker off England's northeast coast with fears the accident could impact livelihoods and the environment.Some 13 miles (20 kilometres) out to sea, AFP images showed the Solong cargo ship, which on Monday hit the jet fuel-laden Stena Immaculate tanker , triggering a huge blaze, was little more than a smoking wreck.The still-anchored Stena Immaculate tanker was seen still anchored in the North Sea with a gaping gash to its side.In Grimsby, once the home of the world's largest fishing fleet, the port area where rescued sailors from the two ships were taken remained cordoned off.Twenty-four hours earlier the sound of helicopters and ambulances had filled the air as all but one of the crew members made it ashore.Townspeople steeped in the area's fishing and seafaring history expressed astonishment that such an accident could happen in broad daylight despite modern navigation equipment.The Stena Immaculate tanker carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel had been at anchor when the container ship Solong hurtled into it Monday morning.""(I was) very surprised,"" Raymond Todd, 71, told AFP at a local cafe, because modern equipment meant such accidents ""should not happen"".The retired fisherman, who went to sea at the age of 15 and spent his working life fishing waters around Iceland, Norway and Greenland, speculated that a ""mechanical failure with the radar or something"" might have been the cause.Otherwise, he said, ""I would think that (they) never had anybody manning the radar.""""Obviously it's thick fog out there, so they should have had extra lookouts on the bridge and if it was doing 16 knots, which I imagine is full speed why did they go so fast? In a busy shipping lane,"" he said.Todd said he feared any oil spill or release of toxic products from the ships could ""wreck"" the livelihoods of those fishermen who still ""actually go out there to earn a living"".Humberside police said Tuesday that a 59-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter following the accident.In the mid-20th century, Grimsby was one of the world's leading fishing ports but the fleets of trawlers began to disappear in the 1970s.Fishermen blamed the "" cod war "" over fishing grounds with Iceland, then EU quotas carved up the seas around Europe, reducing the catch of British boats.Locals also expressed fears for the region's bird and nature-rich coastline.Transport minister Mike Kane told parliament there was currently ""no sign of pollution"".But Andrew Vear, 54, said his wife, who works for a bird conservation group, was ""really concerned"", as he cleaned windows at a local pub.Vear said he too was worried about puffins and seals which have well-established colonies around the Humber estuary.Helen Dawson, 84, was more optimistic about the impact on the coastline. ""They'll get it cleared up somehow,"" she said.But she cautioned that if the fish were affected it would have an impact not just on local fishermen, but also local restaurants and others involved in the town's economy.""This is a fishing town, we're known for that,"" added massage therapist Amy Wilson, 34.She said she was upset about the ""human losses"" -- one missing crew member is presumed dead -- as well as ""the lasting impact on the environment"".For her, the accident was ""definitely another kick in the teeth"" for the region which has seen a decline in its economic fortunes over recent decades.Nearly a decade ago, some 70 per cent of people in the town voted for Brexit, hoping the UK's departure from the European Union would boost its flagging fortunes.But Wilson said there was little sign of any economic boost.""We keep getting promised improvements... It just isn't happening,"" she said.","Locals in the faded fishing town of Grimsby voiced fears for their livelihoods and the rich seaside environment Tuesday.

NHS England announces large-scale cuts as part of government shake-up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/nhs-england-announces-large-scale-cuts-as-part-of-government-shake-up/articleshow/118880910.cms,"The UK government has announced major cuts to NHS England as part of a strategy to streamline operations and reduce duplication with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). Around 6,500 jobs, nearly half of NHS England's workforce, will be cut, aiming to save £175 million annually, BBC reported.This follows news that several senior board members, including chief executive Amanda Pritchard and medical director Sir Stephen Powis, will leave the organisation. NHS staff have expressed shock and concern at the scale of the cuts, which far exceed the 2,000 job losses initially proposed.The restructuring will also impact the DHSC, which will undergo downsizing while working more closely with NHS England. These changes are expected to give Health Secretary Wes Streeting greater control over the NHS's operations. The move marks a significant overhaul of the NHS's national framework, the largest in over a decade, according to Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation.NHS England stated that the workforce reductions are necessary to make better use of taxpayer money and improve the efficiency of frontline services. The reshaping process follows previous job cuts in recent years, including reductions of 4,000 to 6,000 employees at NHS England and 800 at the DHSC.The announcement of these cuts, which will take effect from April 2025, has left staff feeling unsettled, but the NHS is putting a transition team in place to guide the changes. Pritchard acknowledged the unsettling nature of the news but emphasised the need for radical reform. The focus will be on eliminating redundancies between the two organisations and ensuring a more integrated and efficient health system.","Around 6,500 jobs, nearly half of NHS England's workforce, will be cut.

In California, where the couple lives with their two children, state law mandates that all children under 13 must wear a life jacket while aboard a moving vessel of any size.""Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are so good at showing the world how much they suck at being parents,"" stated one viral post on X.""Prince Harry & Meghan Markle never have the basic necessities for child safety which makes me question if they are parents. Where are the car seats? Where are the life vests? Do any children even live with them?"" another posted on X.One response noted, ""They're not even wearing seatbelts and life vests. Reckless.""""I've had boats my entire life. My children grew up to have their own boats. ALWAYS have a life jacket on your children,"" read another comment.""How irresponsible,' criticised one individual. 'Even pet owners put life vests on their pets when riding in boats.""A separate post stated: ""Meghan also had Archie on her lap without a seatbelt on herself or him in his car seat as legally required. The vehicle was going quite fast too.""","Meghan, 43, shared a photo of her daughter, Lilibet, on a boat with Prince Harry. The photo was meant to celebrate International Women's Day.

'It’s time to make Putin pay': Rishi Sunak urges seizing $300 billion in Russian assets to rebuild Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/its-time-to-make-putin-pay-rishi-sunak-urges-seizing-300-billion-in-russian-assets-to-rebuild-ukraine/articleshow/118818058.cms,"Rishi Sunak

Former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called on Western nations to seize $300 billion in frozen Russian state assets , insisting that Moscow must be held accountable for the devastation caused by its invasion of Ukraine, saying, “It’s time to make Putin pay.”He argued that Western taxpayers should not bear the burden of rebuilding a country that Russia has destroyed.“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused $524 billion in destruction – devastating cities, industries, and lives,” Sunak said. “The world must ensure that Russia, not Western taxpayers, foots the bill for Ukraine’s recovery.”Seizing these assets, he said, would not only help rebuild Ukraine but also ease financial pressure on allied nations and send a clear message that aggression will not pay. While some claim confiscating Russian funds would violate international law, Sunak dismissed those concerns, citing legal pathways outlined by experts, including those at the Hoover Institution . He pointed out that the West already uses the interest from these assets to support Ukraine, arguing that if that is legal, so is using the capital itself. “The principle is clear: if you destroy another nation, you should pay for the damage,” he said.Addressing concerns that such a move could undermine trust in Western financial systems, Sunak argued that Russia had already attempted to move its reserves before invading Ukraine and that rogue states have few safe alternatives. He called on the European Union, which holds a significant portion of the frozen Russian assets, to take decisive action. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala have also voiced their support for seizing the funds according to Sunak. “Ukraine shouldn’t be left waiting while its cities remain in ruins,” Sunak said.Earlier this week, Sunak had also weighed in on the recent Oval Office meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which reportedly turned tense over a mineral deal seen as key to continued US support. Trump and his Vice President, JD Vance, accused Zelenskyy of not showing enough gratitude, leading to a heated exchange. According to BBC, Sunak condemned Trump’s treatment of the Ukrainian leader, saying, “It was very hard to watch. For him to have been treated that way was wrong.”Reinforcing the urgency of his call, Sunak stressed that Ukraine’s future depends on decisive action. Seizing Russian assets, he said, would not only fund reconstruction but also strengthen Ukraine’s military, deterring future Russian aggression. “If we let Russia off the hook, we set a dangerous precedent for other aggressors. That’s why we must act,” he said.","Former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called on Western nations to seize $300 billion in frozen Russian state assets.

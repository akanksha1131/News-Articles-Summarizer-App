Several officials from the US government have received messages from someone who is impersonatingSusie Wiles, President Donald Trump's chief of staff.Trump said that Wiles is an amazing woman and that she can handle this. The US authorities have started the investigation.“They breached the phone; they tried to impersonate her,” Trump told reporters on Friday. “Nobody can impersonate her. There's only one Susie.”Susie Wiles has previously served as the co-manager of Trump’s campaign before taking on the role of chief of staff in the new administration.As reported by the Wall Street Journal, governors, business officials, and senators began to receive text messages and phone calls as the impersonator had gained access to their contact details through Wiles’s phone.However, the texts and calls were not going through Wiles’s number. The voice sounded like Wiles’s and might have been generated by artificial Intelligence, suggest people who have received the phone calls.Some thought that the text messages were coming from White House officials. But it is still quite nebulous as to how someone got access to Wiles’s phone.Earlier this month, the FBI had warned in a public service announcement of a malicious campaign in which unidentified “malicious actors” have been calling and sending text messages impersonating senior government officials.This campaign mainly depends on Artificial Intelligence, aiming to dupe government officials, as per the FBI.FBI director Kash Patel commented, “Safeguarding our administration officials' ability to securely communicate to accomplish the president's mission is a top priority.”Last year, Iran had also gained access to Trump’s campaign, sensitive internal documents, including a dossier on vice president JD Vance.","Several officials from the US government have received messages from someone who is impersonatingSusie Wiles, President Donald Trump's chief of staff.

13-year-old brain cancer survivor DJ Daniel meets President Trump in the Oval Office





DJ Daniel, the Texas cancer-survivor teen who was sworn in as an honorary secret service agent by US president Donald Trump, is now facing three new tumours.DJ was first diagnosed in 2018 and given only five months to live. To honour his lifelong dream, he was sworn in as an honorary secret service member during Donald Trump’s address to Congress on March 4.Speaking to Fox 7 Austin, DJ’s father admitted the emotional toll has been heavy. “It’s rough, there isn’t a class that can teach you how to deal with it. You’re hearing that your child has a nasty disease,” he said. But he also said that DJ’s journey is about more than just illness — it’s about spreading kindness and unity.White House also posted on X, sharing the news. It wrote, ""We’re lifting up Agent DJ Daniel in prayer after his dad, Theodis, shared that DJ is now facing three new tumors. DJ is one of the strongest, bravest young men, and has now been sworn into 1,351 law enforcement agencies across the country. Agent Daniel, you're a true legend.""Daniel was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2018 and given just five months to live. He has spent the past six years visiting law enforcement agencies across the country, earning honorary recognition from multiple police departments that have embraced him as one of their own.DJ grew up watching his father, who served in the military, interact with people in uniform. Seeing those moments up close made a strong impression on him. By the time he was 9 years old, he had developed a deep respect for law enforcement and decided he wanted to follow a similar path, dreaming of one day wearing the uniform himself.Despite his condition, DJ remains upbeat. At recent swearing-in ceremonies in Texas and Florida, he said, “On my 11th brain surgery, God told me I was one of his angels... on my 12th, he gave me my wings.”",13-year-old brain cancer survivor DJ Daniel meets President Trump in the Oval Office.

Republican senator Joni Ernst faced boos and groans from constituents during a tense town hall in Parkersburg, Iowa, on Friday after defending a Republican-backed spending and tax cut package, dubbed as “the big, beautiful bill” by US President Trump, which includes $700 billion in cuts, including significant reductions to Medicaid.Speaking at a high school in north-central Iowa, Ernst was responding to a constituent who warned that people could die without health coverage.“People are not... well, we all are going to die,” Ernst replied, drawing audible groans from the crowd. She added, “For heaven’s sake, folks,” and stressed that the proposal would protect “those that are most vulnerable” and eligible for Medicaid.The controversial legislation narrowly passed the House last week by a single vote and now moves to the Senate. Ernst acknowledged that the Senate version will likely differ from the House bill.Republicans argue the bill’s new work requirements and stricter eligibility checks for able-bodied adults without dependents will preserve the program for those who need it most.Democrats, however, warn that millions could lose coverage. According to a preliminary estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional budget office, the plan could leave 8.6 million people without healthcare over the next decade.Video of Ernst’s comment quickly circulated on social media, with Democratic leaders using it to attack the GOP’s stance on healthcare.“This morning, Joni Ernst said the quiet part out loud: Republicans do not care about whether their own constituents live or die as long as the richest few get richer,” said Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic national committee.Ernst is up for re-election in 2026.","Republican senator Joni Ernst faced boos and groans from constituents during a tense town hall in Parkersburg, Iowa, on Friday.

Trump’s Savage Joke On Macron Wife Slap Controversy, White House Reporters Burst Into Laughter





US President Donald Trump offered marital advice to French President Emmanuel Macron after a video of him, apparently, being shoved by his wife Brigitte went viral earlier this week.""Make sure the door remains closed. That is not good,"" Trump said on Friday during a press conference in the Oval Office.Asked about the incident, Trump brushed it off, saying, “He's fine too. They’re fine,” adding, “They’re two really good people. I know them very well.”Responding to the media attention, President Macron said the incident was being overblown and described the moment as a joke between him and his wife. “We were squabbling and, rather, joking,” he explained, adding that it was being exaggerated into “a sort of geo-planetary catastrophe.”The incident took place Sunday evening as Macron arrived in Vietnam to begin his Southeast Asian tour. In a video shot by the Associated Press in Hanoi, Macron was seen emerging from his plane as he landed. His wife Birgitte's arm then emerged from the left of the door. She placed both her hands on her husband's face and gave it a shove.Macron and Brigitte, who met at the high school where she taught and he was a student, have been married since 2007.","US President Donald Trump offered marital advice to French President Emmanuel Macron.

LIVE: U.S. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth speaks at Shangri-La summit | Singapore





United States defence secretary Pete Hegseth warned on Saturday that China was preparing to use force to increase its dominance in the Indo-Pacific region.Speaking at the annual security forum, Shangri-La Dialogue, in Singapore, Hegseth said that Beijing was ""credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific"".""The threat China poses is real and it could be imminent,"" Hegseth said, adding that Beijing ""hopes to dominate and control"" Asia.Hegseth further warned about China's potential invasion of Taiwan, for which he said the Chinese forces were building capability, training every day, and ""rehearsing for the real deal"". China also has a stated goal of taking over Taiwan by force if necessary by 2027.He also raised concerns about China’s growing presence in Latin America, especially its efforts to expand influence over the Panama Canal.The Pentagon chief urged the US allies, particularly partners in Asia, to step up defence spending owing to the threat posed by Beijing.Citing pledges by Nato members including Germany to move toward US president Donald Trump's spending target of five percent of GDP, Hegseth said, "" ""It's hard to believe a little bit... that I'm saying this, but thanks to president Trump, Asian allies should look to countries in Europe for a newfound example.""""Deterrence doesn't come on the cheap,"" he added.The Pentagon chief said that the US stood by its allies and had stepped up cooperation with Japan and the Philippines, and a deep partnership with India.Hegseth also warned that countries trying to balance between US military support and Chinese economic investments are taking a significant gamble. “Beware of the leverage the Chinese Communist Party aims to gain through such entanglements,” he said.China typically sends its defence minister to this annual security conference.

SINGAPORE: US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth on Saturday reassured allies in the Indo-Pacific that they will not be left alone to face increasing military and economic pressures from China.He said Washington will bolster its defences overseas to counter what the Pentagon sees as rapidly developing threats by Beijing, particularly in its aggressive stance toward Taiwan.China has conducted numerous exercises to test what a blockade would look like of the self-governing island, which Beijing claims as its own and the US has pledged to defend.China's army ""is rehearsing for the real deal"", Hegseth said in a keynote speech at a security conference in Singapore.""We are not going to sugarcoat it the threat China poses is real. And it could be imminent.""China has a stated goal of having its military be able to take Taiwan by force if necessary by 2027, a deadline that is seen by experts as more of an aspirational goal than a hard war deadline.But China has also developed sophisticated man-made islands in the South China Sea to support new military outposts and built up highly advanced hypersonic and space capabilities, which are driving the US to create its own space-based ""Golden Dome"" missile defences.Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a global security conference hosted by the International Institute for Security Studies, Hegseth said China is no longer just building up its military forces to take Taiwan, it's ""actively training for it, every day"".Hegseth also called out China for its ambitions in Latin America, particularly its efforts to increase its influence over the Panama Canal.He repeated a pledge made by previous administrations to bolster US military capabilities in the region to provide a more robust deterrent.While both the Obama and Biden administrations had also committed to pivoting to the Pacific -- and even established new military agreements throughout the region -- a full shift has never been realised.Instead, US military resources from the Indo-Pacific have been regularly pulled to support military needs in the Middle East and Europe, especially since the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.In the first few months of President Donald Trump's second term, that's also been the case.The Indo-Pacific nations caught in between have tried to balance relations with both the US and China over the years.Beijing is the primary trading partner for many, but is also feared as a regional bully, in part due to its increasingly aggressive claims on natural resources such as critical fisheries.Hegseth cautioned that playing both sides, seeking U.S. military support and Chinese economic support, carries risk.""Beware the leverage the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) seeks with that entanglement,"" Hegseth said.China usually sends its own defence minister to this conference -- but in a snub this year to the US and the erratic tariff war Trump has ignited with Beijing, its minister Dong Jun did not attend, something the US delegation said it intended to capitalise on.""We are here this morning. And somebody else isn't,"" Hegseth said.He urged countries in the region to increase defence spending to levels similar to the 5 per cent of their gross domestic product European nations are now pressed to contribute.""We must all do our part,"" Hegseth said.It's not clear if the US can or wants to supplant China as the region's primary economic driver. But Hegseth's push follows Trump's visit to the Middle East, which resulted in billions of dollars in new defence agreements.Hegseth said committing US support for Indo-Pacific nations would not be based on any conditions on local governments aligning their cultural or climate issues with the West.",US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth reassured allies in the Indo-Pacific that they will not be left alone to face increasing military and economic pressures from China.

"Chinese paraglider reaches near-record heights, over 28,000 feet, by accident",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinese-paraglider-reaches-near-record-heights-over-28000-feet-by-accident/articleshow/121528304.cms,"Photo/NYT





A paraglider in China who had intended to simply test some equipment instead ended up unwittingly reaching barely survivable heights last week.Peng Yujiang, a 55-year-old paraglider in Gansu province, on Saturday morning flew nearly 8,600 meters above sea level -- more than 28,200 feet, or about 5.3 miles -- in the Qilian mountain range of northwest China's Qinghai and Gansu provinces, according to state media.The episode was captured on a camera attached to his equipment and showed the harrowing conditions he experienced. Peng rose to a level almost on par with Mount Everest's summit and aviation flight paths. His face and body are covered in frost and ice in the video, which was originally posted to social media and later shared by Chinese state media.""I felt the lack of oxygen. My hands were frozen outside. I kept trying to talk on the radio,"" Peng said in a video recorded after the incident, according to Sixth Tone, an English-language, Chinese state-owned outlet.According to local news media, Peng was testing equipment as part of ""ground handling training"" -- a step that paragliders say is critical to managing safe launches -- at an altitude of 3,000 meters above sea level, or about 10,000 feet. But a strong wind suddenly lifted him into the sky. He could not control the glider or land as the draft grew stronger and he was pulled up above the clouds.Peng was apparently the victim of a potentially dangerous phenomenon that paragliders call ""cloud suck,"" in which a pilot is rapidly drawn upward into a cloud.At extreme altitudes, people risk hypoxia, or oxygen deprivation, because of the thin air. Severe hypoxia can cause organ damage or death.Still, Peng managed to land about 20 miles away from where he took off. In stable health and recovering from his surprise flight, he has since said, ""Thinking about it still makes me quite scared,"" China Daily reported Thursday.The local sporting authority in Gansu province said Wednesday that Peng, who is a licensed paraglider, would be barred from the sport for six months; it also noted that flying activities at sites in the area would be suspended for an unspecified period, local news media reported. But the association deemed Peng's incident an accident, based on his statement that he did not have a flight planned and was doing ground handling training, which does not require participants to register plans in advance, the reports said.A second pilot was also banned from flying for six months, because he released footage of the incident without permission, the authority's report said, according to the South China Morning Post.Peng was not the first paraglider to accidentally reach such extreme heights.In 2007, Ewa Wisnierska, a champion Polish paraglider who competed on the German national team, reached around 10,000 meters, or over 32,000 feet, accidentally breaking the paragliding height record on a practice flight in Australia, just days before the World Paragliding Championships. Her 6-mile ascent was treacherous, and she passed out in the air, eventually landing more than 50 miles away from where she took off, on a farm.Another paraglider who was caught in cloud suck that day did not survive.""Today, I still fly -- but just for pleasure and to give courses to the people who come to my paragliding school. Competing no longer makes any sense to me,"" Wisnierska told People magazine last year. ""This definitely changed a lot of priorities and made me realize that there are much more important things in life than championship cups and medals. I often ask myself why was it that I survived and this other pilot did not?""","Peng Yujiang, a 55-year-old paraglider in Gansu province, flew nearly 8,600 meters above sea level.

Viral: MIT Grad Wears Arab Headscarf; Torches Alma Mater’s Israel Ties In Viral Speech |Megha Vemuri





At an already fractious time in US academia, an Indian-American undergrad at the famed Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) torched her own alma mater's ties to the Israeli military and spoke up for Palestine in the face of growing pressure from the Trump administration on US institutions to clamp down on criticism of Israel.Megha Vemuri, a senior class president at MIT, did not hold back during a graduation ceremony on Thursday, accusing Israel of trying to ""wipe Palestine off the face of the earth,"" and lamenting ""it is a shame that MIT is a part of it.""""Right now, while we prepare to graduate and move forward with our lives, there are no universities left in Gaza,"" Vemuri, who completed her undergraduate degree in computer science, neuroscience, and linguistics and served as president of the graduating class, said in remarks that was greeted with cheers from students at the convocation.Vemuri trained her guns on MIT itself and recalled that students scored a major victory earlier this year, forcing MIT to end its partnership with Elbit Systems, who are Israel’s largest weapons manufacturer, whose drones and surveillance systems are said to have been widely used in Israeli attacks on Gaza.""The Israeli occupation forces are the only foreign military that MIT has research ties with. As scientists, engineers, academics, and leaders, we have a commitment to support life.Support aid efforts, call for an arms embargo, and keep demanding that MIT cuts the ties,"" Vemuri said.MIT President Sally Kornbluth, who spoke immediately after Vemuri, ignored her criticism of MIT, and while acknowledging the institution valued freedom of expression, she said, ""Today is about the graduates,"" a sentiment shared by critics who accused her of political grandstanding instead of focusing on academics.""Graduation speeches are meant to inspire, not divide. Turning a shared moment into a personal political stage, especially with such a charged issue, is unfair to fellow students,"" one critic wrote on social media, where clips of her speech went viral.Others found her remarks courageous and inspirational. ""Her speech makes me proud as an Indian! Well done here, on the right side of history,"" read one of hundreds of reactions on X, even as more extreme critics doxxed her and warned that she would never be able to get a job.Vemuri's remarks came even as US secretary of state Marco Rubio had announced that the Trump administration would deny visas to foreign nationals who come to the United States to foment hatred against the Jewish community.While few details are available on the young undergrad, she appears to be a US-born daughter of immigrants from India. Her social media profile shows she went to school in Alpharetta, Georgia, home to many healthcare, insurance, and manufacturing companies.","Megha Vemuri, a senior class president at MIT, did not hold back during a graduation ceremony on Thursday.

We can do a lot of good.""Vance's comments came amid a fresh row over H-1B as the USCIS revealed that they have selected 120.141 H-1B visa applications for 2026. Several companies, including Walmart, announced job cuts, enraging US workers as they allege that the administration is not doing enough to put Americans first -- as companies are still relying on cheap labor from outside.Moving on to his second point, Vance defended the crackdown on universities and said, ""These institutions do an important job; but if you back up and look at American higher education over the past 20 or 30 years, there are a few incontrovertible facts.""""No. 1, the hard sciences, particularly biology, we have a terrible what is called a reproducibility crisis, meaning most of the papers that are published in biology don't replicate; they're not good science. So even our elite universities are not often doing good science.""Second important point, these institutions — sometimes by their own admission — are engaging in explicit racial discrimination, often against whites and Asians in explicit violation of the Civil Rights Act. If the people's government can't come in, given those problems, and say, 'Look, we've got to have some accountability here; you can't violate the Civil Rights Act,'"" he continued.""We've got to make sure that if we're funding science with federal money, you're actually doing good science. That's called accountability.""Vance said this is not 'fascism' and if the American taxpayer is frustrated with these universities, they have got to reform. ""What they're doing instead, what too many of them are doing and saying, 'Aw, the Trump administration, this is dictatorial, this is fascism.' No, this is democratic accountability, and I think universities ought to see it as an opportunity. If they do that, they're going to get better, and the American people will be better off because of it,"" he said.","Vice President JD Vance broke his silence amid the ongoing H-1B row and the controversy over the Donald Trump administration's crackdown on universities. Vance dismissed criticisms that the crackdown will lead to an academic brain drain in the US. Vance said this is not 'fascism' and if the American taxpayer is frustrated with these universities, they have got to reform.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121520284,imgsize-37282,width-400,resizemode-4/121520284.jpg"

The Bluesky post on Katie Miller, Stephen Miller and Elon Musk went viral.





Katie Miller was one of the advisors who decided to work for Elon Musk full time as Musk exited the White House wrapping his DOGE work up. Katie Miller was working as DOGE's spokesperson and as the bridge between DOGE and the administration. But her exit from the White House led to wild rumors though she was not alone in choosing Elon Musk over White House. Steve Davis, James Burnham too reportedly left their DOGE roles for Elon Musk.Katie Miller is the wife of Stephen Miller, the deputy chief of staff of the White House.

It claimed that Stephen even claimed to people that he runs Elon Musk.

A Ketamine Habit

Family Secrets

'No Sympathy for This Behavior'





As Elon Musk became one of Donald Trump's closest allies last year, leading raucous rallies and donating about $275 million to help him win the presidency, he was also using drugs far more intensely than previously known, according to people familiar with his activities.Musk's drug consumption went well beyond occasional use. He told people he was taking so much ketamine, a powerful anesthetic, that it was affecting his bladder, a known effect of chronic use. He took Ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms. And he traveled with a daily medication box that held about 20 pills, including ones with the markings of the stimulant Adderall, according to a photo of the box and people who have seen it.It is unclear whether Musk, 53, was taking drugs when he became a fixture at the White House this year and was handed the power to slash the federal bureaucracy. But he has exhibited erratic behavior, insulting Cabinet members, gesturing like a Nazi and garbling his answers in a staged interview.At the same time, Musk's family life has grown increasingly tumultuous as he has negotiated overlapping romantic relationships and private legal battles involving his growing brood of children, according to documents and interviews.On Wednesday evening, Musk announced that he was ending his stint with the government, after lamenting how much time he had spent on politics instead of his businesses.Musk and his lawyer did not respond to requests for comment this week about his drug use and personal life. He has previously said he was prescribed ketamine for depression, taking it about every two weeks. And he told his biographer, ""I really don't like doing illegal drugs.""The White House did not respond to questions about whether it had asked Musk to take drug tests. After this article was published on Friday morning, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, issued a statement to The New York Times crediting Musk with helping cut government waste. He declined to comment on Musk's drug use.As a large government contractor, Musk's aerospace firm, SpaceX, must maintain a drug-free workforce and administers random drug tests to its employees. But Musk has received advance warning of the tests, according to people close to the process. SpaceX did not respond to questions about those warnings.Musk, who joined the president's inner circle after making a vast fortune on cars, satellites and rocket ships, has long been known for grandiose statements and a mercurial personality. Supporters see him as an eccentric genius whose slash-and-burn management style is key to his success.But last year, as he jumped into the political arena, some people who knew him worried about his frequent drug use, mood swings and fixation on having more children. This account of his behavior is based on private messages obtained by The New York Times as well as interviews with more than a dozen people who have known or worked with him.This year, some of his longtime friends have renounced him, pointing to some of his public conduct.""Elon has pushed the boundaries of his bad behavior more and more,"" said Philip Low, a neuroscientist and onetime friend of Musk's who criticized him for his Nazi-like gesture at a rally.And some women are challenging Musk for control of their children.One of his former partners, Claire Boucher, the musician known as Grimes, has been fighting with Musk over their 5-year-old son, known as X. Musk is extremely attached to the boy, taking him to the Oval Office and high-profile gatherings that are broadcast around the world.Boucher has privately complained that the appearances violate a custody settlement in which she and Musk agreed to try to keep their children out of the public eye, according to people familiar with her concerns and the provision, which has not been previously reported. She has told people that she worries about the boy's safety, and that frequent travel and sleep deprivation are harming his health.Another mother, the right-leaning writer Ashley St. Clair, revealed in February that she had a secret relationship with Musk and had given birth to his 14th known child. Musk offered her a large settlement to keep his paternity concealed, but she refused. He sought a gag order in New York to force St. Clair to stop speaking publicly, she said in an interview.Musk has described some of his mental health issues in interviews and on social media, saying in one post that he has felt ""great highs, terrible lows and unrelenting stress."" He has denounced traditional therapy and antidepressants.He plays video games for hours on end. He struggles with binge eating, according to people familiar with his habits, and takes weight-loss medication. And he posts day and night on his social media platform, X.Musk has a history of recreational drug use, The Wall Street Journal reported last year. Some board members at Tesla, his electric vehicle company, have worried about his use of drugs, including Ambien, a sleep medication.In an interview in March 2024, journalist Don Lemon pressed him on his drug use. Musk said he took only ""a small amount"" of ketamine, about once every two weeks, as a prescribed treatment for negative moods.""If you've used too much ketamine, you can't really get work done, and I have a lot of work,"" he said.He had actually developed a far more serious habit, the Times found.Musk had been using ketamine often, sometimes daily, and mixing it with other drugs, according to people familiar with his consumption. The line between medical use and recreation was blurry, troubling some people close to him.He also took Ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms at private gatherings across the United States and in at least one other country, according to those who attended the events.The Food and Drug Administration has formally approved the use of ketamine only as an anesthetic in medical procedures. Doctors with a special license may prescribe it for psychiatric disorders like depression. But the agency has warned about its risks, which came into sharp relief after the death of actor Matthew Perry. The drug has psychedelic properties and can cause dissociation from reality. Chronic use can lead to addiction and problems with bladder pain and control.By the spring of last year, Musk was ramping up criticism of President Joe Biden, particularly his policies on illegal immigration and diversity initiatives.Musk was also facing federal investigations into his businesses. Regulators were looking into crashes of Tesla's self-driving cars and allegations of racism at its factories, among other complaints.""There are at least half a dozen initiatives of significance to take me down,"" he wrote in a text message to someone close to him last May. ""The Biden administration views me as the #2 threat after Trump.""""I can't be president, but I can help Trump defeat Biden and I will,"" he added.He publicly endorsed Trump in July.Around that time, Musk told people that his ketamine use was causing bladder issues, according to people familiar with the conversations.On Oct. 5, he appeared with Trump at a rally for the first time, bouncing up and down around the candidate. That evening, Musk shared his excitement with a person close to him. ""I'm feeling more optimistic after tonight,"" he wrote in a text message. ""Tomorrow we unleash the anomaly in the matrix.""""This is not something on the chessboard, so they will be quite surprised,"" Musk added about an hour later. ""'Lasers' from space.""After Trump won, Musk rented a cottage at Mar-a-Lago, the president-elect's Florida resort, to assist with the transition. Musk attended personnel meetings and sat in on phone calls with foreign leaders. And he crafted plans to overhaul the federal government under the new Department of Government Efficiency.Musk has also been juggling the messy consequences of his efforts to produce more babies.By 2022, Musk, who has married and divorced three times, had fathered six children in his first marriage (including one who died in infancy), as well as two with Boucher. She told people she believed they were in a monogamous relationship and building a family together.But while a surrogate was pregnant with their third child, Boucher was furious to discover that Musk had recently fathered twins with Shivon Zilis, an executive at his brain implant company, Neuralink, according to people familiar with the situation.Musk was by then sounding an alarm that the world's declining birthrates would lead to the end of civilization, publicly encouraging people to have children and donating $10 million to a research initiative on population growth.Privately, he was spending time with Simone and Malcolm Collins, prominent figures in the emerging pronatalist movement, and urging his wealthy friends to have as many children as possible. He believed the world needed more intelligent people, according to people aware of the conversations.Collins declined to comment on his relationship with Musk, but said, ""Elon is one of the people taking this cause seriously.""Even as Musk fathered more children, he favored his son X. By the fall of 2022, during a period when he and Boucher were broken up, he began traveling with the boy for days at a time, often without providing advance notice, according to people familiar with his actions.Boucher reconciled with Musk, only to get another unpleasant surprise. In August 2023, she learned that Zilis was expecting a third child with Musk via surrogacy and was pregnant with their fourth.Boucher and Musk began a contentious custody battle, during which Musk kept X for months. They eventually signed the joint custody agreement that specified keeping their children out of the spotlight.By mid-2023, unknown to either Boucher or Zilis, Musk had started a romantic relationship with St. Clair, the writer, who lives in New York City.St. Clair said in an interview that at first, Musk told her he wasn't dating anyone else. But when she was about six months pregnant, he acknowledged that he was romantically involved with Zilis, who went on to become a more visible fixture in Musk's life.St. Clair said that Musk told her he had fathered children around the world, including one with a Japanese pop star. He said he would be willing to give his sperm to anyone who wanted to have a child.""He made it seem like it was just his altruism and he generally believed these people should just have children,"" St. Clair said.St. Clair said that when she was in a delivery room giving birth in September, Musk told her over disappearing Signal messages that he wanted to keep his paternity and their relationship quiet.On election night, St. Clair and Musk both went to Mar-a-Lago to celebrate Trump's victory. But she had to pretend that she hardly knew him, she said.He offered her $15 million and $100,000 a month until their son turned 21, in exchange for her silence, according to documents reviewed by the Times and first reported by the Journal. But she did not want her son's paternity to be hidden.After she went public in February, ahead of a tabloid story, she sued Musk to acknowledge paternity and, later, to get emergency child support.Musk sought a gag order, claiming that any publicity involving the child, or comments by St. Clair on her experience, would be a security risk for the boy.Some of Musk's onetime friends have aired concerns about what they considered toxic public behavior.In a January newsletter explaining why their friendship had ended, Sam Harris, a public intellectual, wrote that Musk had used his social media platform to defame people and promote lies.""There is something seriously wrong with his moral compass, if not his perception of reality,"" Harris wrote.Later that month, at a Trump inauguration event, Musk thumped his chest and thrust his hand diagonally upward, resembling a fascist salute. ""My heart goes out to you,"" he told the crowd. ""It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured.""Musk dismissed the resulting public outcry, saying he had made a ""positive gesture.""Low, who is chief executive of NeuroVigil, a neurotechnology company, was outraged by the performance. He wrote Musk a sharp email, shared with the Times, cursing him ""for giving the Nazi salute.""When Musk didn't respond to the message, Low posted his concerns on social media. ""I have no sympathy for this behavior,"" he wrote on Facebook, referring to the gesture as well as other behaviors. ""At some point, after having repeatedly confronted it in private, I believe the ethical thing to do is to speak out, forcefully and unapologetically.""The next month, Musk once again found himself under scrutiny, this time for an appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington.As he walked onto the stage, he was handed a chain saw from one of his political allies, Javier Milei, the president of Argentina. ""This is the chain saw for bureaucracy!"" Musk shouted to the cheering crowd.Some conference organizers told the Times that they did not notice anything out of the ordinary about his behavior behind the scenes. But during an onstage interview, he spoke in disjointed bouts of stuttering and laughing, with sunglasses on. Clips of it went viral as many viewers speculated about possible drug use.","Elon Musk's drug consumption went well beyond occasional use.

US measles cases rise slightly as Colorado reports a new outbreak,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-measles-cases-rise-slightly-as-colorado-reports-a-new-outbreak/articleshow/121528176.cms,"AP file photo





Measles cases inched up slightly in the US this past week, with a new county impacted in Texas and Colorado reporting a new outbreak.There are 1,088 confirmed measles cases in the US, up 42 from last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. Texas, where the nation's biggest outbreak raged during the late winter and spring, reported 10 additional cases this week for a total of 738.There are three other major outbreaks in North America.One in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in 1,888 cases from mid-October through May 27. Another in Alberta, Canada, has sickened 628 as of Thursday. And the Mexican state of Chihuahua had 1,693 measles cases and three deaths as of Wednesday, according to data from the state health ministry.Since the outbreak in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma began, two elementary school-aged children in the epicenter in West Texas and an adult in New Mexico have died of measles. All were unvaccinated.Other states with active outbreaks, which the CDC defines as three or more related cases, include Colorado, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that's airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines, and has been considered eliminated from the US since 2000. Here's what else you need to know about measles in the USHow many measles cases are there in Texas? There are a total of 738 cases across 35 counties, most of them in West Texas, state health officials said Friday.Throughout the outbreak, 94 people have been hospitalized. McLennan County, which includes the city of Waco, was added to the state's list of counties with active cases.State health officials estimated less than 1% of cases - fewer than 10 - are actively infectious. Fifty-six percent of Texas' cases are in Gaines County, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has had 409 cases since late January - just over 1.7% of the county's residents.The April 3 death in Texas was an 8-year-old child, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Local health officials said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of ""what the child's doctor described as measles pulmonary failure."" A unvaccinated child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas in late February; Kennedy said the child was 6.How many measles cases are there in New Mexico? New Mexico added one new case on Friday for a total of 79.Seven people have been hospitalized since the outbreak started. Most of the state's cases are in Lea County. Sandoval County near Albuquerque has six cases, Eddy County has three, Doña Ana County has two and Chaves and Curry counties have one each.An unvaccinated adult died of measles-related illness March 6. The person did not seek medical care.How many cases are there in Oklahoma? Oklahoma held steady Friday with a total of 14 confirmed and three probable cases.The state health department is not releasing which counties have cases.How many cases are there in Colorado? Colorado has seen a total of seven measles cases in 2025 and one outbreak with three related cases, which the state health department announced Thursday.All three cases appear to stem from an international flight that landed at Denver International Airport in mid-May. Two people with confirmed cases live in Arapahoe County, near Denver - one unvaccinated child under the age of 5 and an unrelated vaccinated adult. The other person was an out-of-state traveler who was infectious on the flight and stayed at a hotel near the airport. State health officials said Thursday there is no evidence of further spread.The other counties with cases in 2025 are Pueblo, Jefferson and Archuleta counties with one each and Denver with two.How many cases are there in Kansas? Kansas has a total of 64 cases across 11 counties in the southwestern part of the state, with two hospitalizations. All but five of the cases are connected, and most of the cases are in Gray County.How many cases are there in Michigan? Michigan has a steady eight confirmed cases of measles, with an outbreak of four connected cases in Montcalm County in the western part of the state that health officials say is tied to the Ontario outbreak.How many cases are there in Montana? Montana has 13 measles cases as of Thursday. Ten are in Gallatin County, which is where the first cases showed up - Montana's first in 35 years.Flathead County has two cases and Hill County has one case.Health officials said there is potential for community transmission in Hill County. There are outbreaks in neighboring North Dakota and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.How many cases are there in North Dakota? North Dakota, which hadn't seen measles since 2011, is up to 29 cases as of Thursday. Two of the people have been hospitalized, and all of the people with confirmed cases were not vaccinated.There are 13 cases in Williams County in western North Dakota on the Montana border. On the eastern side of the state on the Minnesota border, there are eight cases in Grand Forks County and seven cases in Cass County. Burke County, in northwest North Dakota on the border of Saskatchewan, Canada, has one case.How many cases are there in Ohio? Ohio remained steady for a second week at 34 measles cases and one hospitalization, according to the Ohio Department of Health. That count includes only Ohio residents.The state has two outbreaks: Ashtabula County near Cleveland has 16 cases, and Knox County in east-central Ohio has 20 - 14 among Ohio residents and the rest among visitors.Allen, Cuyahoga, Holmes and Defiance counties have one case each.How many cases are there in Pennsylvania? Pennsylvania remains steady at 15 cases overall in 2025 as of Thursday, including international travel-related cases in Montgomery County and one in Philadelphia.An outbreak of eight measles cases in Erie County in far northwest Pennsylvania has remained steady since it began in mid-April.How many cases are there in Tennessee? Tennessee has had six measles cases since early May, but no change since. Health department spokesman Bill Christian said all cases are the middle part of the state, and that ""at least three of these cases are linked to each other"" but declined to specify further. The state also did not say whether the cases were linked to other outbreaks or when Tennessee's outbreak started.Where else is measles showing up in the US? Measles cases also have been reported in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.Cases and outbreaks in the US are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. The CDC says more than twice as many measles have come from outside of the US compared to May of last year, and most of those are in unvaccinated Americans returning home. In 2019, the US saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.What do you need to know about the MMR vaccine? The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don't need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from ""killed"" virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don't need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have ""presumptive immunity.""Measles has a harder time spreading through communities with high vaccination rates - above 95% - due to ""herd immunity."" But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.What are the symptoms of measles? Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.How can you treat measles? There's no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.","There are 1,088 confirmed measles cases in the US, up 42 from last week.

Trump administration targets Harvard with tougher visa screening measures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-targets-harvard-with-tougher-visa-screening-measures/articleshow/121528143.cms,"Harvard University





The US state department ordered all its consular offices around the world to carry out extra checks on visa applicants planning to travel to Harvard University for any reason, according to an internal cable reviewed by Reuters on Friday.The May 30 cable, signed by secretary of state Marco Rubio, calls for “additional vetting” of all non-immigrant visa applicants connected to Harvard. This includes students, faculty, staff, contractors, guest speakers, and even tourists. The cable emphasizes the word “any,” using bold and underlined text.The instruction claims Harvard failed to maintain “a campus environment free from violence and anti-Semitism,” and the enhanced vetting aims to help officers identify applicants “with histories of anti-Semitic harassment and violence.”While the US has previously applied tougher vetting for applicants from specific countries, targeting a university is considered unprecedented.The state department declined to comment on internal communications.This action is part of a wider effort by the Trump administration against Harvard. The administration has frozen billions in funding, pushed to end the university’s tax-exempt status, and launched a probe into alleged discrimination against white, Asian, male, or straight individuals.Trump has criticised leading universities for fostering anti-American views. Last week, his administration revoked Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign students—a move that was blocked by a federal judge. Harvard has accused the administration of retaliation for resisting interference in its internal governance, academic content, and campus ideology.Visa approval tied to online transparencyThe cable also directs consular officers to review applicants’ social media. If an applicant’s accounts are private, it may be seen as a sign of “evasiveness.” Officers are told to ask applicants to make their accounts public and may warn that hiding activity could be viewed as suspicious.Officers are also instructed to ensure the applicant’s intended activities in the US match the type of visa they are applying for. If the officer is not “personally and completely satisfied” that the applicant will comply with visa terms, the visa should be denied.The order follows previous steps by Rubio, including halting new visa appointments for student and exchange programs and beginning the revocation of visas for Chinese students linked to the Communist Party or studying sensitive subjects.The cable also states this effort will serve as a “pilot for expanded screening and vetting,” suggesting that similar procedures could be applied to other universities in the future.",The US state department ordered all its consular offices around the world to carry out extra checks on visa applicants planning to travel to Harvard University.

Over 5 lakh face deportation risk as Trump gets go-ahead to end legal status of migrants from US Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/over-5-lakh-face-deportation-risk-as-trump-gets-go-ahead-to-end-legal-status-from-us-supreme-court/articleshow/121527839.cms,"US Supreme Court (Image credits: AP)





The US Supreme Court on Friday allowed the Trump administration to move forward with ending temporary legal protections for more than 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The decision raises the number of migrants newly at risk of deportation to nearly 1 million.The justices lifted a lower-court order that had blocked the administration’s effort to terminate the humanitarian parole program. In a separate case earlier this month, the court allowed the removal of about 350,000 Venezuelan migrants, marking the second time the court has sided with the Trump administration in its push to roll back Biden-era immigration policies.The court issued its order without explanation, which is typical on the emergency docket. Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor dissented, warning of the serious consequences the decision could have on affected migrants.The administration filed an emergency appeal after a federal judge in Boston, Indira Talwani, had stopped the government from ending the program. Judge Talwani had ruled that revoking the protections early would force migrants to either flee the country or face possible deportation.While she allowed revocation on a case-by-case basis, the administration argued that the program was granted en masse and should be ended the same way.Solicitor general D John Sauer called individual review a “gargantuan task” that would slow the government's ability to remove migrants.Justice Jackson echoed concerns from Judge Talwani, writing in her dissent that the court’s order would cause “needless human suffering” before a final legal judgment is reached.The temporary parole program had allowed up to 30,000 people per month from the four countries to enter the US for two years, provided they had a financial sponsor and paid their own travel expenses. These migrants fled instability and dangers in their home countries.The decision also affects other groups covered under humanitarian parole, including Afghans, Ukrainians, and Central American children. The Biden administration had used this authority, in effect since 1952, more extensively than any previous president.Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem cancelled an 18-month extension of the parole protections, giving migrants 30 days to leave unless covered by other legal protections.This marks the first time such a large group has lost parole status at once, with advocates calling it “the largest mass illegalisation event in modern American history.”The Supreme Court's order is not a final decision, but it does mean that the protections will be lifted while the case moves forward. The case now goes back to the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston.","More than 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela are now at risk of deportation.

Elon Musk’s SECRET Drug Habit While Wooing Trump EXPOSED | WATCH





US President Donald Trump said goodbye to billionaire Elon Musk in the Oval Office on Friday, marking the end of Musk’s time leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk will now focus more on his companies, including Tesla, SpaceX , and X.As the richest person in the world stepped down from his position as the US government's lead cost-cutter, Trump praised Musk's ""incredible service"" and gave him a golden key to the White House.""Today it's about a man named Elon,"" Trump said during a joint press conference with Musk, marking his last day leading the DOGE.Also read: Musk 'not really leaving,' says Trump - Key updates from joint press conference Trump praised Musk for bringing about ""a colossal change in the old ways of doing business in Washington"" and said some of Musk’s team members would stay in the government. Musk, dressed in all black and wearing a T-shirt that said ""The Dogefather,"" listened as Trump listed the contracts that had been cut under Musk’s leadership.""I think the DOGE team is doing an incredible job,"" Musk said after receiving a ceremonial key from Trump. ""They're going to continue to be doing an incredible job.”Musk made major changes in the American government, including firing or pushing out thousands of employees.Some programs, like the US Agency for International Development (USAID), were greatly reduced.Despite these changes, Musk did not meet his original goals. He first promised to cut $1 trillion or $2 trillion in federal spending but later lowered that to $150 billion for the current year.It is not clear if that goal has been reached. The DOGE website claims $175 billion in savings, but the data has many mistakes and exaggerations, news agency Associated Press reported.Trump said Musk led the ""most sweeping and consequential government reform effort in generations."" He also said Musk is ""really not leaving"" and ""he's going to be back and forth"" to keep track of what is happening in the administration.Musk, the richest person in the world, recently said he would reduce his political donations. He was the top donor to Trump’s last presidential campaign.Trump seemed eager to end Musk’s service on a positive note.""This will be his last day, but not really, because he will, always, be with us, helping all the way,"" Trump wrote on social media on Thursday evening. ""Elon is terrific!""Musk’s job as a special government employee was meant to be temporary. However, Musk had said he might stay ""indefinitely,"" working part-time if Trump wanted his help.Musk has downplayed questions about how DOGE would continue without him, even saying it might “gain momentum” in the future.""DOGE is a way of life,"" he told reporters recently. ""Like Buddhism.""","Billionaire Elon Musk stepped down from his position as the US government's lead cost-cutter.

What Steve Bannon thinks about H-1B





Donald Trump's former aide Steve Bannon shot to the centerstage Friday as the Trump administration's recent visa decisions were seen as a victory of the Bannon camp. Bannon, an avid hater of the H-1B visa programs that allows US companies to hire foreign talent, quickly reacted to the accolades, as he wrote, ""Next Victory: H1B Visa Scam"".A POLITICO report gave the verdict that it was the Bannon camp's win over the tech camp as Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the administration would now revoke the visas of Chinese students. The Silicon Valley camp would definitely not like this decision as 70 per cent of Silicon Valley's highly educated tech employees are from overseas and China supplies more than any country except India, the report said noting how silent the tech industry is on this major policy change -- though very little has been shared by Rubio.Meta, Google, Microsoft and NVidia formally declined to comment to POLITICO and it said Tesla, Amazon and Apple did not respond to its emails.""The visa move looks like another win for the Bannon wing,"" the report gave its verdict.Steve Bannon has openly called the H-1B program a scam. Openly declaring a war against Elon Musk, he called for an end to the program. Bannon thinks H-1B is a scam of the highest order that deprives Americans of their jobs.Reacting to the USCIS's latest approval of over 120,000 H-1B applications for 2026, Steve Bannon said it's outrageous at a time when AI is posing a threat to US jobs. ""The number of H-1Bs we need this year is ZERO. Everyone issued one should go home, and every billet should be filled by an American,"" Bannon said. The recent layoffs announced by companies, including Walmart, have been linked to the H-1B and US tech workers are demanding H-1B ban.",Bannon is an avid hater of the H-1B visa programs that allows US companies to hire foreign talent.

Please respect them and allow me to continue.”Vemuri slammed MIT in her speech for its ties with Israel and accused MIT of being ""directly complicit in the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people"".""You have faced the obstacle of fear before and you turned it into fuel to stand up for what is right.

Shehbaz Sharif’s Tajikistan visit caps diplomatic tour amid India tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/did-india-hits-impede-pak-move-to-retaliate/articleshow/121499612.cms,"Photo/Agencies





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wrapped up a five-day, four-nation diplomatic tour in Tajikistan on Thursday, aiming to bolster regional ties and challenge India’s terrorism accusations.The tour, spanning Iran, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan, came after a tense military standoff with India earlier this month. Joined by Field Marshal Asim Munir and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, Sharif sought to project Pakistan as a peace-seeking nation amid rising regional friction.The tour’s backdrop was a May 9-10 clash. Media outlets posted on Thursday videos of Sharif, during his Azerbaijan visit, purportedly admitting to India’s preemptive BrahMos missile strikes on Pakistani military sites impeding Pakistan’s attempts to retaliate. However, neither Pakistani outlets nor Azerbaijan’s govt have confirmed Sharif’s statement about BrahMos. TOI was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the video.Sharif’s mission was clear: counter India’s global push — visiting over 30 countries to brand Pakistan a terror sponsor, a charge Islamabad rejects. In Azerbaijan, he stressed Pakistan’s willingness to discuss Kashmir and terrorism with India, saying, “If India engages sincerely, we’re ready.”This stance, reiterated in Tajikistan, framed Pakistan as a peace broker while painting India as belligerent. Talks with Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev aimed to lock in support against India’s rhetoric.In Tajikistan, Sharif shifted focus to economic and security ties with Central Asia, a region where India and Pakistan compete for sway. The tour, just two weeks after the standoff, reflects Pakistan’s haste to reshape its image. Yet, India’s narrative of counterterrorism retains global traction.With a fragile ceasefire extended to May 18 hanging in the balance, Sharif’s peace calls face an uphill battle against India’s military-first approach. Meetings in Türkiye and beyond highlighted Pakistan’s reliance on allies to offset India’s influence. Still, the tour’s success hinges on whether these overtures can pierce India’s diplomatic armor.The broader India-Pakistan rivalry played out vividly here — diplomacy and perception as fiercely contested as their borders. Sharif’s tour, while crisp in intent, navigates a murky web of unverified claims, strategic posturing, and regional ambitions, leaving the path to peace as elusive as ever.","Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wrapped up a five-day, four-nation diplomatic tour in Tajikistan on Thursday.

Pak SSG Loaned Commando To Lashkar? Probe Reveals ISI’s Hand in Pahalgam Attack | Watch





NEW DELHI: Top Lashkar-e-Taiba commander and one of the plotters of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack Saifullah Kasuri made inflammatory remarks against India at a rally in Lahore on Wednesday. Surrounded by Pakistani security forces, fellow terrorist commanders and officials of Pakistan's intelligence agency, ISI, Kasuri seemed to relish the infamy he had attracted for the massacre of innocent civilians marked out on the basis of their faith.""I have become more famous since being accused of the attack,"" he gloated, as per information reaching here.Kasuri, who had earlier disclaimed responsibility for the slaughter in Pahalgam, was sharing the stage with US-designated terrorist Talha Saeed, son of Lashkar chief Hafiz Saeed , along with Malik Ahmad Khan, speaker of the Punjab assembly - something that once again laid bare Pakistan's claim of having taken action against terrorists.Talha publicly lauded Pakistan's so called Bunyan al-Marsoos operation, in retaliation to India's Operation Sindoor. ""Allah loves those who engage in jihad,"" he said while Kasuri and others cheered.The speeches appeared to be meant to rally members of the jihadi outfit after India's successful precision strikes on the Lashkar headquarters in Muridke which killed several terrorists.In an apparent reference to PM Narendra Modi's remarks a few days ago, Kasuri said they were not afraid of bullets.""Narendra Modi samajhta hai hum goliyon se darne wale hain? Ye uski bhool hai (Modi is mistaken if he thinks we are scared of bullets),"" he said. Addressing at a rally at Bhuj earlier this week, the PM had said Pakistan should be ready to face India's bullets if it did not stop using terror as a weapon.Kasuri had earlier claimed that he had no role to play in the Pahalgam carnage. On Wednesday, he was all fire and brimstone.While claiming that Pakistan had avenged the 1971 war and the vivisection of Pakistan by the then PM Indira Gandhi, Kasuri went on to praise Pakistan's cyber team for 'targeting' India's critical infrastructure pertaining to communications and railways.During the rally, he also referenced the upcoming elections and asked the people of Kasur (his hometown) if they'd support him running against Modi in the next election. He styled himself as a thorn in India's side. ""Main rehta hun Hindustan ke dil me kaante ki tarah. Apne rab ka shukr karta hu. Agla election Modi ke muqable mai na lad lun,"" he said.He also said that India had tried a lot to isolate Pakistan and specific individuals, but now it was they who stood isolated. Kasuri was spotted in Kanganpur army base in Punjab in the run-up to the Pahalgam attack where he exhorted Pakistani soldiers and spewed venom against India.On Hafiz Saeed's instructions, Kasuri, Talha and Sheikh Sajjad Gul of The Resistance Front are learned to have sent in highly trained terrorists for a ""spectacular attack' in Pahalgam.Kasuri, who was earlier president of Milli Muslim League, was also part of Jamaat-ud-Dawa's coordination committee, the 'charity' wing of Lashkar. Since the Pahalgam attack, the outfits have intensified public rallies to gather funds in the name of supporting the jihad in Kashmir.",LeT commander Saifullah Kasuri made inflammatory remarks against India at a rally in Lahore on Wednesday.

Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has publicly admitted, once again that Indian missiles, including the supersonic BrahMos, struck multiple locations deep inside Pakistan, including an airport in Rawalpindi.Speaking at a trilateral summit in Lachin, Azerbaijan, Sharif described how Indian strikes hit multiple targets in Pakistan before it could mount its planned retaliation.Speaking at the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit in Lachin, Azerbaijan, Sharif described the sequence of events and Pakistan's intended response. ""We on 9th and 10th night we decided to respond in a measured fashion to Indian aggression,"" he said.""And we had decided that at 4:30 in the morning after Fajr prayers, Pakistan armed forces led very ably by our Field Marshal Chief Army Staff sitting here, Syed Asam Munir to teach a lesson to our enemy. But before that hour reached India again launched missile attacks, BrahMos and hit Pakistan's various provinces including airport in Rawalpindi and other places.""This is not the first time that Sharif has confirmed that Operation Sindoor caused severe damage in Pakistan, earlier speaking at a ceremony the Pakistani PM had acknowledged that Indian missiles struck Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi and other locations.Earlier, speaking at a ceremony, he said, “At around 2.30am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles have hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas.”Operation Sindoor, launched by India on May following the Pahalgam terror attack, targeted terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK, killing over 100 militants. The strikes targeted nine terror launchpads in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, and was followed by the destruction of 11 Pakistani airbases after failed attempts by Pakistan to target Indian military positions.The situation de-escalated only after both sides agreed to a halt in military actions during a meeting between the Directors General of Military Operations on May 10.In the aftermath, Sharif had also made repeated appeals for dialogue, calling for talks on peace, terrorism, water, and Kashmir. Speaking in Tehran earlier this week, Sharif had said, “We want to resolve all disputes, including the Kashmir issue and the water issue, through negotiations and are also ready to talk to our neighbour on trade and counter-terrorism.” However, he warned, “But if they choose to remain aggressors, then we shall defend our territory… like we have done a few days ago. ”India has firmly rejected these overtures. At a press briefing, mministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal reaffirmed New Delhi’s position, stating, “Terrorism and talks cannot go together… Talks on J&K will be held only on the vacating of PoK and when Pakistan hands over the territory to us.”He also confirmed that the Indus Waters Treaty will remain suspended until Pakistan “credibly and irrevocably abjures its support to cross-border terrorism”, adding, “Water and blood cannot flow together.”","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif has publicly admitted, once again that Indian missiles, including the supersonic BrahMos, struck multiple locations deep inside Pakistan.

'Talks Only On Return Of PoK': India Rejects Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif's Call For Dialogue | Kashmir





Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday repeated his call to hold talks with India, urging both nations to sit down ""for peace"" and resolve long-standing issues, including Kashmir, water sharing, and terrorism. The change of tone in Pakistan's language can be noticed after India's punitive diplomatic steps and strong military counterterror action under Operation Sindoor against Pakistan, in retaliation of Pahalgam terror attack.His remarks came during the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit in Lachin, Azerbaijan, where he was joined by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev.This was Sharif’s second call for dialogue in a week. On Monday, while in Tehran, he expressed a similar willingness to engage with India “to resolve all disputes.”“We must sit together and talk for the sake of peace… There are issues that demand immediate attention and must be addressed through dialogue,” Sharif said, according to Dawn.He added, “I have said in all humility that we want peace in the region[…] and that requires talks on the table on issues which need urgent attention and amicable resolution, that is the issue of Kashmir according to the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council and as per the aspirations of the people of Kashmir.”Sharif also expressed openness to discussing counterterrorism with India, saying, “I have said in all earnest that if India wants to talk on countering terrorism in sincerity of purpose, Pakistan would be willing to talk to India on this issue as well.” He further stated his desire to resume trade ties, and criticised India’s decision to suspend the Indus Water Treaty , calling it a vital resource for Pakistan's drinking and agricultural needs.However, India has made its stance unequivocally clear: talks with Pakistan will only focus on two issues, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and terrorism.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his first statement following Operation Sindoor, said: “Today, I would also like to tell the global community that our stated policy has been: if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on terrorism; and if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).”Tensions between the two countries have intensified since the April 22 terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, which left 26 dead.In retaliation, India launched Operation Sindoor, a coordinated military campaign that began on May 7, targeting nine terror launchpads in Pakistan and PoK.The Indian Air Force also destroyed 11 Pakistani airbases in response to Pakistan's failed attempts to strike Indian military positions on May 8, 9, and 10.The conflict de-escalated after both sides agreed to halt military actions following a meeting between their directors general of military operations on May 10.","Pakistan's PM Shehbaz Sharif calls for talks with India to resolve long-standing issues, including Kashmir, water sharing, and terrorism.

Families allege ‘fake encounter’ after three missing men found dead in Balochistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/families-allege-fake-encounter-after-three-missing-men-found-dead-in-balochistan/articleshow/121437104.cms,"



A fresh wave of suspected fake encounters in Balochistan has led to public anger, as rights activists accuse security forces of killing people in custody and staging the events to look like clashes.Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) on Monday claimed it had killed three militants in an operation in the Tang Kiryar area of Barkhan district. The bodies of Abdul Rehman Buzdar, Fareed Buzdar, and Sultan Marri were later shifted to the Basic Health Unit hospital in Rakni.However, the families of the deceased and Baloch rights groups strongly disputed the official account. They said all three had been missing for months, victims of enforced disappearance, and insisted the encounter was fake.The activists alleged that ""the men were executed after being kept in illegal detention.”A CTD spokesperson said that the men died during an exchange of fire and that weapons were recovered from the scene. But this version of events has been widely rejected.In a separate incident, another youth, Ghaus Bakhsh, was found dead in Awaran district’s Kolwah tehsil. He had reportedly been summoned to a nearby military camp, and his body was discovered just hours later, bearing visible signs of torture.This added to growing suspicions of custodial killings.The Balochistan Post reported both incidents, saying the deaths follow a pattern seen in other districts such as Dukki, Ziarat and Quetta. In those cases too, individuals who had previously gone missing later turned up dead in what were officially described as security operations.Human rights groups and Baloch activists say these cases point to a disturbing trend of state-led violence. They are calling for independent investigations and international attention to ensure accountability. “This is part of a systematic campaign,” said one rights campaigner. “There needs to be an end to the impunity,"" they added.",Rights activists accuse security forces of killing people in custody and staging the events to look like clashes.

Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on Monday called for strong unity among Muslim countries and urged Pakistan to work together to stop what he called the “Zionist regime’s crimes” in Gaza.In a post on X, Khamenei said that “At a time when the warmongers in the world have numerous motives for creating conflicts and wars, the only way to ensure the security of the Islamic Ummah is the unity of Muslim nations”“Pakistan’s stance on the Palestinian issue has been very commendable. While there have always been inducements for Islamic countries to establish ties with the Zionist regime, Pakistan has never been influenced by those inducements,” he added.This comes after Pakistan’s prime minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Tehran, the second stop of his four-country trip.

Poll Do you believe that climate change is contributing to extreme weather events in Pakistan? Yes No





At least 14 people were killed and more than 100 injured after powerful windstorms swept across central and northern Pakistan following a days-long heatwave, officials confirmed on Sunday.The storms, described as “particularly destructive” by authorities, battered the provinces of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa as well as Islamabad on Saturday afternoon and evening.Mazhar Hussain, spokesperson for the Punjab disaster management authority, was quoted by news agency AFP as saying, “This windstorm was particularly destructive. The wind speed was very high. There was so much dust in it that visibility was greatly reduced.”According to him, the extreme weather followed several days of intense heat, with temperatures exceeding 45°C. “There were three to four days in the recent heatwave where temperatures went up quite a lot,” he added, attributing the sudden storm to the intense build-up of heat.The majority of casualties were caused by collapsing roofs and walls, while at least two people died after being struck by solar panels dislodged by high-speed winds.In one tragic incident, lightning claimed the life of one man and injured three others.The storms uprooted trees, knocked over electric poles, and caused significant damage to vehicles and infrastructure. Social media was flooded with dramatic videos showing the aftermath, including a viral clip filmed inside a passenger plane struggling to land in Lahore before being diverted to Karachi amid severe turbulence.Islamabad and surrounding areas have also seen multiple unusual hailstorms over April and May, damaging vehicles and solar panels—marking a growing trend of erratic and extreme weather events in the country.Pakistan is widely recognised as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, with early summers and intense heatwaves becoming increasingly common.India is also battling extreme temperatures. According to news agency ANI, Rajasthan's Jaisalmer hit 48°C, forcing locals indoors. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) warned that severe heatwave conditions will continue in Rajasthan until May 27 and in Punjab, Haryana, and Jammu and Kashmir until May 26.Meanwhile, heavy monsoon rainfall has already arrived on India’s west coast, with IMD forecasting intense downpours over Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Goa in the coming week.Back in Pakistan, the Meteorological Department has predicted more storms on Sunday, raising concerns about further damage and casualties.","Powerful windstorms swept across central and northern Pakistan following a days- long heatwave.

COLOMBO: A Sri Lankan court sentenced on Thursday two former ministers from the government of deposed president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to decades in prison in a landmark corruption case.Ex-sports minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage and former trade minister Anil Fernando were found guilty by the Colombo High Court of misappropriating 53 million rupees ($177,000) of state funds.The pair were also fined $2,000 for using government money to donate board games, including 14,000 carrom boards and 11,000 draughts sets, in an attempt to boost the failed 2015 re-election bid of Gotabaya's elder brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa.Aluthgamage was sentenced to 20 years in jail. Fernando was sentenced to 25 years.Aluthgamage is now the most senior member of a Rajapaksa-led cabinet to be successfully prosecuted for corruption.The cases against both men were initiated six years ago, when the Rajapaksa brothers were out of power, but the case had been making slow headway until a new government took office last year.Aluthgamage also faces a separate investigation into allegations that he authorised in 2022 a payment of $6.09 million to a Chinese supplier for a fertilizer shipment that was never delivered.He caused a stir in 2020 when he accused Sri Lanka's national cricket team of rigging the 2011 World Cup final in favour of India, triggering an investigation that ultimately failed to substantiate his claims.Aluthgamage, who served as sports minister from 2010 to 2015, said in June 2020 that he had ""not wanted to disclose"" the alleged match-fixing plot at the time.""In 2011, we were supposed to win, but we sold the match.

The climbers hire thousands of people in Nepal to assist their climbs by carrying gear, cooking food and generally taking care of them as they spend weeks in the mountains.Nepal's government collects money from the climbers through permit fees.The end of May also marks the end of the popular spring mountaineering season, when climbers finish their adventures and retreat from the peaks before the monsoon season brings foul weather.""This day is celebrated also to mark the end of the climbing season where we gather climbers and the community,"" Jiban Ghimire of Shangri-La Nepal Trek said.According to Nepal's Department of Mountaineering, 468 foreign climbers from 57 countries received permits to climb Everest by the end of May, along with a roughly equal number of Nepalese mountain guides.Many were able to scale the peak, but officials were still working to verify how many reached the 8,849-metre (29,032-foot) summit. Climbers must report to the department with proof they reached the summit and cleared their garbage before they are issued the official certificate.Famed Sherpa guide Kami Rita reached the Everest summit for the 31st time Tuesday, breaking his own record for the most climbs to the top of the famed mountain.","Nepal's mountaineering community celebrated the conquest of the world's highest mountain with a rally.

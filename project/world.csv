America's affordability woes: Trump claims prices came down 'tremendously'; hits back at Democrat's 'con job',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/americas-affordability-woes-trump-claims-prices-came-down-tremendously-hits-back-at-democrats-con-job/articleshow/125880351.cms,"Low confidence in Trump



'A plus plus plus' economy ?



US President Donald Trump addressed America's affordability concerns at a campaign rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday, saying that the prices have come down ""tremendously. "" He moved to reassure Americans frustrated by high living costs and dismissed Democrat's criticism over inflation as a “hoax”. The event was a shift from his usual arguments about affordability, away from White House briefings and social media posts, into a more energetic campaign setting.Trump asserted that consumer prices are falling sharply. “Prices are coming down tremendously from the highest prices in the history of our country.” His remarks followed earlier claims made at the White House a day earlier, when he insisted, “We’re bringing prices way down,” and argued that Democrats had created the affordability crisis while he was “fixing it”.The push comes at a difficult moment for Trump. Surveys in recent weeks show a drop in public confidence in his handling of the economy, even as the White House says it expects inflation to ease next year.And although he has promised to bring prices down quickly, only 33% of American adults approve of his economic management, according to a November survey by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Following lacklustre Republican performances in last month’s off-cycle elections, administration officials have been trying to convince voters that the current cost pressures are unrelated to Trump’s policies.But price levels have remained stubborn, rising again after Trump introduced his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. Businesses had warned that the sweeping import taxes could lead to higher consumer prices and reduced hiring, even as inflation had begun calming after hitting a 40-year peak in 2022. Trump has instead repeatedly blamed his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, for the problem.His appearance in Monroe County, a region that backed Biden in 2020 but swung to Trump in 2024, was closely watched for signs of how voters view his claims. The county, anchored by the tourism-driven Pocono Mountains and increasingly attractive to people priced out of New York City, is set to play a key role in next year’s fight for control of the US House.The rally was held indoors, a change from the larger venues Trump used last year. It also placed him squarely inside the district represented by Republican Rob Bresnahan, who won his 2024 House race by only about 1.5 percentage points and is now a key Democratic target. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti is among those vying to challenge him.Trump has continued to boast about economic performance even as many Americans struggle with rising costs. On a Politico podcast, he rated the economy “A-plus”, later amplifying that to “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus”. He has pointed to relaxed auto fuel efficiency standards and agreements aimed at lowering list prices for prescription drugs as evidence that he is easing pressures on consumers. He has also argued that significant cuts to the Federal Reserve’s benchmark interest rate would lower mortgage and auto-loan costs, despite concerns from critics that such moves could worsen inflation.National indicators show a mixed picture: the stock market has climbed this year, and economic growth appeared solid in the third quarter. Yet many households say the cost of housing, groceries, electricity, education and other essentials continues to erode their incomes. The administration maintains that inflation will subside next year, partly due to investment in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.Trump has repeatedly argued that concerns about affordability are being exaggerated for political effect. Speaking in the Oval Office earlier, he said “affordability is the greatest con job” by Democrats, insisting that his own past actions show he is the one genuinely addressing the issue.","US President Donald Trump addressed America's affordability concerns at a campaign rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania.

Miami Mayoral Elections: Eileen Higgins becomes city’s first-ever female mayor - who is she?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/miami-elections-eileen-higgins-becomes-citys-first-ever-female-mayor-who-is-she/articleshow/125881328.cms,"AP file photo

Who is Eileen Higgins ?



Miami voters have elected Democrat Eileen Higgins as the city’s first female mayor and the first Democrat to hold the office in nearly three decades.In Tuesday’s runoff, Higgins, a former county commissioner, defeated Republican Emilio González, a former city manager backed by former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.“Together, we turned the page on years of chaos and corruption and opened the door to a new era for our city, one defined by ethical, accountable leadership that delivers real results for the people,"" Higgins said in a statement after the voivtory, promising to lead a government “that finally earns the public’s trust,” as cited by NYT.Although Miami’s elections are officially nonpartisan, both major parties played an active role in the campaign. US President Donald Trump endorsed González, while the Democratic National Committee backed Higgins. In the days leading up to the vote, several prominent national Democrats traveled to Miami to campaign alongside her, an unusual show of support for a low-turnout, off-year local election.Higgins secured victory the victory after topping the first round of voting on November 4, where she received 35 per cent of the vote compared to González’s 19 per cent.Higgins will make history as Miami’s first female mayor and its first non-Hispanic mayor since the 1990s, breaking a three-decade dominance of Cuban American Republicans in city politics.Higgins, a trained mechanical engineer and former Peace Corps director in Belize, previously represented what she described as a Republican-leaning district on the county commission.She also holds a Master of Business Administration from Cornell University’s Johnson Graduate School of Management.On the campaign trail, she pledged to focus on addressing residents’ everyday concerns if elected, as cited by Politico.Higgins had served as a well-known county commissioner for eight years, representing a district that included Miami’s downtown. In the November 4 election, she also secured the top spot across all five of the city’s commission districts.She received a social media endorsement from former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, who is a former mayor and was a 2020 presidential candidate.She also led in all five of the city’s commission districts and will succeed outgoing Mayor Francis Suarez, who had briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination, as cited by the NYT.Miami, home to roughly half a million residents, is Florida’s second-largest city after Jacksonville. While the city, like the state, has trended Republican in recent election cycles, Higgins’ Democratic victory stands out as particularly notable.","Eileen Higgins, a former county commissioner, defeated Republican Emilio González in Tuesday’s runoff.

How a meme artist ended up and sinking a $25,000 statue

I wanted something that could outlast us all without hurting the ocean.”

What future archaeologists would make of this

“Putting Handsome Squidward’s face from SpongeBob on an ancient Greek statue then sinking it to the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea to confuse future archaeologists.”

“Nothing will confuse archaeologists of the future. We are literally in the most well-documented era of humankind.”

“Even if the internet vanished, people know what kind of stupid things other people could do.”

SpongeBob mythology

“Future archaeologists will write entire dissertations on Squidward culture.”

“A very expensive use of free will.”

Hiding handsome Squidward under the sea

If you’ve ever looked at a museum label and wondered how much of archaeology is science and how much is educated guesswork, a Seattle meme artist has now turned that thought experiment into an actual underwater prank. Sunday Nobody, the internet’s reigning king of high-effort absurdity, has sunk a three-metre bronze mash-up of Handsome Squidward and the ancient Greek Discobolus into the Mediterranean, purely to mess with whoever dredges up human history a thousand years from now.And yes, it’s real bronze. And real money. And very much the kind of chaos only the internet could produce.Sunday Nobody, 29, has built a whole career on elaborate internet-culture stunts that make absolutely no practical sense, which is precisely why millions love him. He’s the same artist who buried a 3,000-pound Flamin’ Hot Cheetos sarcophagus, created a Bob Ross portrait from 7,104 paint samples, programmed a CNC machine to hand-write the entire Shrek script, built a giant Bee Movie maze, and even set up a (legal) fake-ID vending machine in Brooklyn, among others. His guiding philosophy is simple: when viewers ask why, he asks why not.For this project, he went full academic-chaos mode. He forged a student ID, then consulted a university archaeologist about which materials could survive a millennium underwater. Bronze won. As he explains in his 14-minute YouTube documentary, “Next came the commission: two full-size, three-metre bronzes cast by China’s Cinuo Sculpture Company for about $4,000 each, plus minis. The design merged two worlds, Myron’s 5th-century BC Discobolus, one of antiquity’s most copied sculptures, and Handsome Squidward, the hyper-chiseled version of the SpongeBob character from the episode “The Two Faces of Squidward,” a meme shorthand for exaggerated self-confidence and dramatic glow-ups.Once the crates arrived, Nobody and a small crew, including his studio hand Nattie and local helpers in Greece, hauled the 500-pound statue to the Halkidiki Peninsula. Floating it offshore on inflatable rafts and even a literal air mattress, they cut the lines and watched it drop 25–30 feet, landing upright by sheer luck. A 25-second GoPro edit later, it went viral, boosted heavily by a December 8, 2025 X repost from @nexta_tv.His rollout also sent ripples beyond the art world. A Solana memecoin inspired by the stunt, $DISCOBOLUS, briefly spiked to a multimillion-dollar market cap after the footage spread, a reminder of how quickly internet spectacle bleeds into crypto hype. Meanwhile, the second bronze statue is up for auction on his site, (last seen at $4,001), and the limited-run mini versions, priced at $500, sold out almost instantly.He’s upfront about the motive, too. As he put it, the project was simply:but the internet immediately pointed out the flaw: we now document everything. As one commenter put it,Another added,Still, the joke landed. Users imagined scholars in 3025 trying to decode. One wrote,Another:The @nexta_tv repost pushed #SquidwardStatue into trending territory, stacking millions of views.The prank also triggered a more serious debate inside archaeology circles: planting fabricated artifacts, even as jokes, can complicate real underwater heritage work. UNESCO guidelines warn against introducing artificial objects that could confuse future surveys or degrade sites. Nobody himself skirts that line; he admits he had no permits, calling it a legal grey area.But for many viewers, the piece hits a different nerve: how modern culture blends ancient forms with meme logic. It’s a reminder that, in an age where everything is archived, the mystery once baked into archaeology is becoming harder to recreate, even when someone literally sinks a three-metre bronze Squidward in the Mediterranean.","Sunday Nobody, the internet’s reigning king of high-effort absurdity, has sunk a three-metre bronze mash-up of Handsome Squidward and the ancient Greek Discobolus into the Mediterranean.

Body camera video shows police confront Luigi Mangione at PA McDonald’s

Evidence fight intensifies in Manhattan Court



High-stakes hearings ahead of trial







Newly released body cam footage has revealed the moment Pennsylvania police confronted murder suspect Luigi Mangione at a McDonald’s, a year to the day after his dramatic arrest. The video, submitted in a Manhattan court on Tuesday, shows Altoona Police Officer Joseph Detwiler approaching Mangione, who was sitting alone at a corner table with a medical mask covering most of his face. Detwiler asks him to lower the mask, prompting Mangione to comply before giving the false name “Mark Rosario.”The officers had been alerted by customers who believed the man’s distinctive eyebrows resembled images circulated by New York authorities days earlier. Mangione, 27, was wanted for the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a Manhattan street on 4 December 2024, a killing that triggered a five-day manhunt across several states.As Detwiler asked for identification, Mangione produced a New Jersey ID bearing his photograph but the alias he had provided. A second officer, Tyler Frye, can be heard relaying the document details over the radio, as the situation rapidly escalated into the arrest that has since become central to pretrial hearings in New York.The release of the video comes as Mangione’s legal team seeks to suppress the evidence gathered during the Altoona arrest, including a handgun, silencer, loaded magazine, passport, notes, and what prosecutors describe as a manifesto. Officers have testified that the search of Mangione’s backpack was conducted partly out of concern for public safety, though defence lawyers argue that police lacked a warrant and exceeded their authority.Testimony this week described the moment a loaded magazine was discovered wrapped in underwear, prompting one officer to say on camera, “It’s him, 100%.” Additional footage shows officers finding a notebook, travel plans, and to-do lists referencing eyebrow plucking, new shoes, and methods for avoiding surveillance.Prosecutors contend that the firearm matches the one used in Thompson’s killing and that Mangione’s writings point to a motive linked to hostility towards health insurers. Witnesses also described evidence of his movements after the shooting, including travel through Newark, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh under various aliases.Mangione, an Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland family, has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal charges. The hearings — now in their fifth day — will determine whether key items seized in Altoona can be shown to a future jury. A ruling to exclude the material could narrow the case significantly as prosecutors prepare for what is expected to be a major trial.","Body camera video shows police confront Luigi Mangione at PA McDonald’s.

"3I/ATLAS is carrying ‘key’ ingredients for life, NASA scientist finds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/3i/atlas-is-carrying-key-ingredients-for-life-nasa-scientist-finds/articleshow/125874065.cms,"NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope reobserved interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS Nov. 30, with its Wide Field Camera 3 instrument

An “alien comet” loaded with methanol and hydrogen cyanide



“Molecules like hydrogen cyanide and methanol are at trace abundances and not the dominant constituents of our own comets. Here we see that, actually, in this

alien comet

they’re very abundant.”

Why methanol here matters for the chemistry of life





“It seems really chemically implausible that you could go on a path to very high chemical complexity without producing methanol,

How Avi Loeb is reading the new data

“Is 3I/ATLAS a Friendly Interstellar Gardener or a Deadly Threat?”

“The anomalously large ratio of methanol to hydrogen-cyanide production by 3I/ATLAS suggests a friendly nature for this interstellar visitor.”

“If the solar system didn’t have the building blocks, it could have gotten them from the visits of objects like 3I/ATLAS in the early solar system,”

The Post

“pollinated”

“interstellar gardeners”

Ever since 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July, it’s been the space object everyone argues about. It’s only the third interstellar visitor ever found passing through our Solar System, and it has refused to sit neatly in the “just another comet” box. Its strange colour shifts, abrupt changes in speed, and the appearance of both a tail and an anti-tail have kept astronomers on alert for months. And, more recently, the comet has added yet another oddity to the list: a now-famous 16.16-hour “ heartbeat ,” a rhythmic brightening and dimming that scientists are still trying to explain. NASA ’s line has stayed consistent: 3I/ATLAS is a comet, it poses no threat to Earth, and it will stay far away. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, meanwhile, has spent months saying we shouldn’t rush to that conclusion. He’s suggested there is a 30–40% chance the object is not naturally formed, has talked about features that “could be related to a power supply that is not natural, that is technological in origin, some kind of an engine, and has even floated the idea it could be “potentially hostile”. He put it at four on his own “Loeb scale”, where zero is a normal space rock and ten is confirmed artificial origin.Now there’s a new development that doesn’t settle the alien argument but does raise the scientific stakes: 3I/ATLAS is venting unusually large amounts of methanol and hydrogen cyanide, two key ingredients associated with the chemistry of life.The latest findings come from NASA astrochemist Dr Martin Cordiner and his team at the Goddard Space Flight Center, who used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, one of the most sensitive radio telescopes on Earth, to analyse the chemistry of 3I/ATLAS in extraordinary detail. Their observations, outlined in a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed paper , revealed not faint traces but substantial quantities of gaseous methanol and hydrogen cyanide streaming from the interstellar object.The sheer concentration surprised the researchers. 3I/ATLAS is widely believed to be comet-like, but the chemical ratios it produces do not resemble anything normally seen in our own Solar System. As Cordiner put it in New Scientist According to the measurements, hydrogen cyanide is emerging close to the rocky nucleus at around 250 to 500 grams per second, while methanol is being released at roughly 40 kilograms per second, a level that amounts to about eight percent of all vapour escaping from 3I/ATLAS, compared to the two percent typically seen in Solar System comets. Methanol was also detected throughout the coma, the diffuse halo of gas and dust around the nucleus, suggesting that multiple processes are feeding its production.Methanol might sound like just another simple alcohol, but in astrochemistry it has a specific weight: it’s a basic building block in prebiotic chemistry. In the cold environments where comets form, methanol is a precursor on the pathway toward complex organic molecules, the kinds that can eventually lead to amino acids, proteins and nucleic acids like DNA and RNA.Its abundance immediately raised eyebrows. Cordiner noted that the comet’s chemistry appears unusually active.” he said.In other words, if ice and rock are reacting their way toward more complicated organics, methanol almost inevitably shows up somewhere along the route. Seeing it in such high abundance in an interstellar comet is a strong hint that life-friendly chemistry is not confined to the dust cloud that formed our own Solar System.Hydrogen cyanide, despite its toxicity, is also a familiar ingredient in laboratory experiments that simulate early-Earth chemistry. In certain conditions, it can help build up some of the molecular scaffolding that life later uses.There’s a structural clue buried in the numbers too. Researchers including Josep Trigo-Rodríguez at the Institute of Space Sciences in Spain have previously argued that a metal-rich comet, with plenty of iron, could produce a lot of methanol. In that scenario, heat from the Sun melts subsurface water, which then reacts with iron-bearing minerals in the nucleus to form methanol.Detecting methanol not just at the core but throughout the coma fits neatly with the idea that 3I/ATLAS is both rich in metals and chemically uneven inside, giving scientists a rare glimpse of how a comet from another star system might have been assembled.Also read: Harvard professor claims 3I/ATLAS emits a ‘heartbeat’-like pulse that could signal alien technology Add that to earlier observations, a cloud of water vapour and gas unusually heavy in carbon dioxide, a distinctly redder light, and gas production starting while it was still far from the Sun, and the picture is of a very old, chemically loaded object that may not have passed close to any star for hundreds of millions of years.Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has already pulled Cordiner’s chemical detections into his own evolving interpretation of 3I/ATLAS. In a new Medium post titledLoeb frames the chemistry almost like sizing up a blind date with an interstellar visitor: is this something that could seed life, or something that spreads poison? Besides the unusually high methanol levels, he points out that Cordiner’s team also detected hydrogen sulfide, a compound once used as a chemical weapon in World War I, which complicates the picture.Even so, in his Medium post he leans toward a gentler interpretation:In his telling, a comet venting such life-linked organics looks more like a “friendly interstellar gardener” than a threat.Loeb has long entertained the idea that objects like 3I/ATLAS could have delivered life’s building blocks to young planets.he told. He has even speculated that Earth may have beenby multipleover billions of years.For Loeb, the next datasets will be decisive. He expects more clarity from upcoming telescope releases, including a batch from ESA’s JUICE mission in February 2026, while the James Webb Space Telescope is set to image the comet around its close approach on 19 December.","Astronomers say 3I/ATLAS is venting unusually large amounts of methanol and hydrogen cyanide, two key ingredients associated with the chemistry of life.

Planning your year around UAE holidays





Local authorities may add extra holidays

Public holidays are not carried forward if they fall on weekends or overlap with another holiday

Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, so slight adjustments are possible





Residents of the UAE have much to look forward to in 2026, with several public holidays promising opportunities for long weekends and family time. From Eid celebrations to the National Day, a mix of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar holidays will shape the holiday calendar. Here is a detailed guide to all predicted public holidays, how they are determined, and tips to plan your time off.UAE public holidays are a combination of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar calendar dates. Gregorian holidays, such as New Year’s Day and National Day, occur on the same date each year. Islamic holidays, including Eid Al Fitr, Eid Al Adha, Islamic New Year, and Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday (PBUH), shift each year based on moon sightings.The UAE Public Holiday Law, established in April 2024 and implemented from January 2025, allows certain holidays to be shifted to the start or end of the week to create long weekends, except for Eid holidays. Cabinet Resolution No. 27 of 2024 also permits local governments to declare additional holidays for special occasions.Holidays that fall on weekends or coincide with another public holiday are not carried forward, but 2026 predictions indicate no overlap between Islamic holidays and Gregorian holidays.Residents in the UAE can expect at least 12 public holidays in 2026. While final dates depend on moon sightings and government announcements, current predictions give a clear picture of the likely schedule:Transferable holidays: Islamic holidays such as Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al Adha are not transferable. Other holidays, including the Islamic New Year, Prophet’s Birthday, and National Day, may be moved to create long weekends based on Cabinet resolutions.2026 promises several opportunities for extended breaks:Residents are advised to plan ahead, as Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, which may adjust official dates.Public and private schools in the UAE align their breaks with national holidays, though exact dates differ by curriculum and school authority:This schedule helps families coordinate holidays and make the most of predicted long weekends.Understanding the mix of fixed and lunar-based holidays allows UAE residents to strategically plan their annual leave. For example, taking just a few days off around Eid or National Day can significantly maximize time away from work. While the UAE government confirms official dates closer to each holiday, these early predictions serve as a reliable guide for 2026.Residents should note:With this guide, UAE residents can look forward to a year of well timed breaks, long weekends, and ample family and leisure time.","UAE residents in 2026 can enjoy 12 public holidays, including Eid, National Day, and school breaks.

An illegal immigrant, who is identified as Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia, was taken into custody in connection with a stabbing on a light rail in Charlotte, North Carolina.While investigating the case, the police discovered that the 33-year-old suspect was actually deported twice back to his country.Solorzano-Garcia was issued a final deportation order in 2018 and was removed from the United States on March 9 of that year, DHS said. He was arrested crossing the border illegally again in 2021 and removed a second time. DHS said he apparently re-entered the US a third time at an unknown date and location.DHS Secretary Kristi Noem condemned the alleged stabbing, saying the incident “should have never happened.“This heinous stabbing by this twice removed illegal alien should have NEVER happened. ICE lodged an arrest detainer to ensure Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia is not released back into North Carolina neighborhoods. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the county will honor the detainer since they have a history of not cooperating with ICE,” said Secretary Noem in a press statement released by DHS.“Under President Trump, ICE is being unleashed to ensure public safety for all Americans.

‘Whole thing just disgusts...’: CEO Brian Thompson’s colleague slams fans of his killer Luigi Mangione,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/whole-thing-just-disgusts-ceo-brian-thompsons-colleague-slams-fans-of-his-killer-luigi-mangione/articleshow/125809962.cms,"Luigi Mangione Gets 200+ Letters A Day; Some Too Explicit To Read Out Loud





A former colleague of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson , who was killed by Luigi Mangione , is not happy with the fans who give attention to the shooter.It has been one year since the executive was shot dead in Manhattan, but the case of Mangione is still ongoing.“It was the Luigi show,” said Terrie Martin, an independent Medicare broker from Texas who met Thompson at a conference months before his death, reports the New York Post.She described how Brian was an innocent family guy: “The whole thing just disgusts me — the way it was handled, the way it was portrayed, the way everybody jumped to celebrate when they weren’t even thinking this guy was a father, a husband, a boss or anything. That was just appalling.”50-year-old Thompson was fatally shot outside the Hilton Hotel in New York on December 4, 2024. The assassination was caught on camera.26-year-old Mangione managed to flee New York but was arrested after a five-day manhunt at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania. Federal prosecutors ruled that Mangione was hostile towards the healthcare industry.Thompson's accomplice said he bore no resemblance to the “caricature” painted by Mangione’s supporters.“He really and truly wanted to know how to make it better, nuts and bolts from people who are working on the ground in the trenches. What’s beneficial, what’s lacking, how can we make it better? He was really, really set on that very sincerely. He was actually trying to make a difference. That’s what made me so sad.”She recalled Thompson’s humility: “The one thing that I noticed from the very beginning was that everyone called him BT.

Biggest ever US travel ban in the works? More than 30 countries could be under review,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biggest-ever-us-travel-ban-in-the-works-more-than-30-countries-could-be-under-review/articleshow/125778767.cms,"Kristi Noem Goes Nuclear, Seeks 'Travel Ban' On All Killer Migrants Coming From 'Every Damn Country'





The United States is planning to expand the number of countries that were covered by its travel ban - and the new list may include over 30 countries.US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, on Thursday, during an interview on Fox News’ The Ingraham Angle, when asked whether President Donald Trump’s administration would increase the number to 32, she said “I won’t be specific on the number, but it’s over 30, and the president is continuing to evaluate countries. ""In June, Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats, Reuters reported.The bans applied to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travellers.Noem did not specify which countries would be added to the list. “If they don’t have a stable government there, if they don’t have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” she said.Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was considering banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable.An expansion of the list would mark a further escalation of migration measures the administration had taken since the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week.Investigators said the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement programme under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting. Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” although he did not identify any by name or define “third-world countries.”Prior to that, officials from the Department of Homeland Security said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the administration of his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, and Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries. Since returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border. His administration has frequently highlighted the deportation push, but until now it has put less emphasis on efforts to reshape legal immigration.","US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the president is 'continuing to evaluate countries' In June, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States.

"Caribbean boat strikes: Survivors were 'waving in clear distress' after first missile hit them, say sources",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/caribbean-boat-strikes-survivors-were-waving-in-clear-distress-after-first-missile-hit-them-say-sources/articleshow/125809877.cms,"Protests In DC Against Venezuela Boat Strikes; Dozens Rally Outside White House

Survivors were in 'clear distress'

Survivors were trying to 'stay in the fight'

Trump says Pete 'didn't know what people were talking about'





Two people who survived the September 2nd US strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean were seen waving before they were killed in a second follow-up strike, sources familiar with a video shown to lawmakers revealed.One source said the gestures could be interpreted as the survivors either calling for help or surrendering to avoid another strike.The operation was the first of more than 20 US attacks on suspected drug-carrying vessels under the Trump administration. The GOP leader has defended the campaign as a necessary way to curb narcotics trafficking. However, the premise remains legally questionable. The Pentagon has reported that more than 80 people have died in these strikes, including 11 in the initial September 2 attack.Members of Congress were shown video of the strikes, including the follow-up attack that killed the two survivors, during a closed-door briefing with the operation's commander, Adm. Mitch Bradley, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, according to CBS News.Democratic Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut described the scene as one of the most difficult things hes ever seen in his life. He said the survivors appeared “in clear distress without any means of locomotion.”Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas defended the strikes. He said the survivors were “trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight” and clarified that the strikes were “entirely lawful and needful.”US President Donald Trump hinted he would support releasing the video to the public, but denied knowledge of any order given to target survivors. “I don't know that that happened. And Pete said he did not want that — he didn't even know what people were talking about. We'll look into it. But no, I wouldn't have wanted that. Not a second strike,” he said.Trump has also said that Venezuela’s airspace should now be considered “closed” amid rising tensions.Defensed department officials have defended the operations as legal and necessary. Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told The Washington Post that “ongoing operations to dismantle narcoterrorism and to protect the Homeland from deadly drugs have been a resounding success.”Defense secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes were “lethal, kinetic strikes” aimed at stopping drug trafficking and destroying vessels affiliated with “Designated Terrorist Organisations.”Legal experts and lawmakers have expressed concern that targeting survivors could constitute a war crime.","Survivors seen waving before they were killed in a second follow-up strike.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday evening hosted the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees in the Oval Office for a medal-presentation ceremony.“This is a great evening, it’s a great honour,” Trump said. “And I’m delighted to welcome to the Oval Office – the world-famous, most famous office in the world, most powerful office in the world – our truly exceptional 2025 Kennedy Center honorees. ”Trump said the honorees “inspired, uplifted and unified millions and millions of Americans”, calling them “the most accomplished and renowned class of Kennedy Center honorees ever assembled”.Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell stood behind Trump as the President presented the medals. Grenell, who was appointed by Trump in February this year to head the centre, is also a special envoy to Latin America for the administration.This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone , singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford , Guardian reported.The medallions to the honorees were “re-designed” by Tiffany and Co, Trump said. “They have done a fantastic job, they’re wonderful people – I know them very well because they’re right next to Trump Tower, I’ve lived with them many years,” he said.Trump never visited the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in his first term, and did not take part in its annual awards programme.But he has taken a keen interest in his second. Since taking office, he has ousted the Kennedy Center’s board of trustees and replaced them with supporters. He has promised to “fully renovate” the Kennedy Center’s infrastructure, and make it a “crown jewel” of arts and culture in the US.It was unclear how this year’s honorees were chosen, but Trump said in August when presenting the list that he had been “about 98% involved”.The Kennedy Center Honors programme and its series of tribute performances for each recipient is set to be taped on Sunday, and will be broadcast later in December.The President said in August that he would host the show, and Trump on Saturday set expectations high: “I believe – and I’m going to make a prediction: this will be the highest-rated show that they’ve ever done,” Trump said about Sunday’s event during the medal ceremony. “And they’ve gotten some pretty good ratings. But there’s nothing like what’s going to happen tomorrow night.”Presidents traditionally attend the programme, but none has ever presented the show, a fact Trump appeared aware of as well. “We never had a president hosting the awards before, this is a first. I’m sure they’ll give me great reviews, right?” Trump quipped. “No, we’ll do fine. I’ve watched some of the people that host. Jimmy Kimmel was horrible.”“If I can’t beat out Jimmy Kimmel in terms of talent, then I don’t think I should be President,” Trump added.","US President Donald Trump hosted the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees in the Oval Office for a medal-presentation ceremony.

MAGA chief Donald Trump doubled down on his attack on Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar, alleging she entered the United States by marrying her brother and saying she should be sent back to Somalia.In an interview with Politico, Trump said, “I wanna see people that contribute. I don’t wanna see Somalia. I don’t wanna see a woman that marries her brother to get in and then becomes a Congressman and does nothing but complain…Let her go back, fix her own country.”He described Somalia as “one of the worst countries in the world” and called recent events in Minnesota “horrible.”The row follows a week of Trump targeting Omar and wanting to deport her. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, he said, “Somalia, where you have a Congressman goes around telling everybody about our Constitution, yet she supposedly came into our country by marrying her brother. Well, if that’s true, she shouldn’t be a Congressman, and we should throw her the hell out of our country.”Trump has also announced the end of Temporary Protected Status for Somalis in Minnesota, accusing the Democratic-controlled state of massive fraud.Omar and other Democrats have defended the Somali community, while rumours of her deportation have circulated online.Omar reportedly came to the United States in 1995 and became a naturalised citizen. Some reports allege she entered as a member of the ‘Omar’ family, which was not her biological family. It is claimed that she later married her genetic brother, Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, in 2009, divorcing in 2017. Omar has dismissed these allegations as false.As a naturalised US citizen, Omar cannot be deported unless the government proves in court that she deliberately lied or hid essential facts during her naturalisation process. She has not responded to the speculation much and says it would not be a major concern as she could live anywhere in the world.Similarly, ex-DOGE lead Elon Musk also targeted Ilhan of ""importing"" Somalis to enhance her voter base in Minnesota.

Was the Cinnabon worker harassed first?





An ex-Cinnabon employee in Wisconsin who was filmed hurling the N-word at a Somali Muslim couple has attempted to defend herself by insisting she cannot be racist because she once had a “coloured” son.Crystal Wilsey went viral this week for harassing a Somali couple before being fired by the franchise. However, she has raised over $120,000 in fundraiser money through the help of social media.Crystal Wilsey defended herself in a TikTok video posted after she was dismissed.“P.S., to the racism, if you look at my Facebook from 2010, you’ll see on there that I have a blended family, and my son was colored,” she said.However, netizens were not happy with this explanation since this does not give any person, especially of white race, to hurl N-word at a black person.Moreover, Wilsey also said the boy’s darker skin was not due to ethnicity but to a medical condition, according to EURweb. She told viewers her son had Addison’s disease, adding: “Addison’s disease, and he was discriminated called chocolate because he had brown skin – explanation of racism.” This explanation also didn't undo the damage of the original slur.The confrontation that led to her firing took place at a Cinnabon outlet in Wisconsin and was recorded by the woman involved.The video shows Wilsey mocking the woman’s hijab, using the N-word repeatedly and raising both middle fingers: “I am racist, and I’ll say it to the whole entire world.""The couple said they had simply asked for more caramel on their cinnamon roll. Cinnabon later described the footage as “deeply troubling” and confirmed that Wilsey had been dismissed by the owner.Wilsey’s has had a troubling personal history as well. Court records show a long list of offences spanning more than twenty years, including drug charges, domestic abuse cases and child-endangerment allegations across several states.Supporters claim Crystal was “harassed” and unfairly sacked. Some social media users claimed the Somali couple had mocked the employee first for not wearing a hijab, which in turn provoked her.Her donation page states: “No White person should lose their job for refusing to be harassed by Somalians.”Wilsey has insisted her comments were meant as sarcasm, comparing her language to “edgy comedy” and saying her diverse friendship circle proves she is not prejudiced. The woman who filmed the encounter dismissed that explanation. “Sarcasm? You smiled while saying it and flipped us off. That’s not a joke – that’s hate,” she wrote online.Furthermore, US President Donald Trump recently called Somali communities ""garbage."" This hostility only worsened the situation as federal authorities prepare an immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota targeting Somali nationals who are living unlawfully in the country.","Crystal Wilsey was filmed hurling the N-word at a Somali Muslim couple.

'Compromise With Russia Or...': U.S. Gives 2 Options To Zelensky; Trump For Ceding Land To Putin





LONDON: US President Donald Trump said in an interview published Tuesday that Europe was weak and its nations were ""decaying,"" days after the Trump administration issued a strategy paper that indicated that the US should no longer guarantee the continent's security.The president's comments, made in a wide-ranging interview with Politico, widened a dispute between Trump and his European counterparts over Europe's future and how to end Russia's war in Ukraine.Trump said that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, who has rejected parts of a US proposal for a ceasefire, would have to ""get on the ball"" and start ""accepting things."" Zelenskyy's army is losing the war, Trump said, suggesting that it was time for him to compromise in the ceasefire talks.Trump's interview was published a day after the leaders of Britain, France and Germany met with Zelenskyy in London to show their support for Ukraine and discuss alternative ceasefire plans. Zelenskyy reiterated after that meeting that Ukraine would not budge from its long-standing opposition to handing over land to Russia, a requirement of Trump's proposed peace plan. Trump also accused Zelenskyy of not having read a new draft of the US peace plan.""It would be nice if he would read it,"" Trump said. ""You know, a lot of people are dying. So it would be really good if he'd read it.""Several elements of the US peace plan - which was published last month, prompting alarm across Europe - echoed demands made by the Kremlin.Trump suggested that a Russian victory would be inevitable, in part because the country is much larger than Ukraine.

Elon Musk once again weighed in on US immigration policy, accusing Democratic leaders, including Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, of using migrant communities from overseas to build their vote banks.The billionaire made the remarks on X after responding to a user who complained that Western governments were prioritising “millions of unvetted third-world immigrants.”The user wrote: “It is deeply weird that the absolute top priority for a lot of American and European politicians is bringing in millions of unvetted third-world immigrants. They could have shut down right wing populism entirely by compromising on this issue, but they refuse.”Musk attacked Ilhan Omar in the reply, accusing her of catering to Somalis in Minnesota to build her voter base: “Once you understand the incentive, the reason for the behavior becomes obvious: they are importing a left-voting bloc that depends on government handouts.” He went on to claim that “a prominent example of this in America is Ilhan Omar and her Somali voting bloc in Minnesota, an area which used to be primarily Nordic-German.Musk said that bringing in new voters is a path to a ""single-party supermajority” and claimed the same thing had happened at the state level in Blue democratic strongholds like California and New York. Musk concluded: “We stand on the precipice of disaster, an end to America.”The Tesla CEO's comments come as he has shared far-right talking points about Somali immigrants, white population decline and Democratic motives.

AI videos are fooling millions on social media. No one is ready,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ai-videos-are-fooling-millions-on-social-media-no-one-is-ready/articleshow/125876523.cms,"



Videos created with OpenAI's new app Sora show how easily public perceptions can be manipulated by tools that can produce an alternate reality with a series of simple prompts. In the two months since Sora arrived, deceptive videos have surged on X, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, according to experts who track them. The deluge has raised alarm over a new generation of disinformation and fakes.Most of the major social media companies have policies that require disclosure of AI use and broadly prohibit content intended to deceive. But those guardrails have proved woefully inadequate for the kind of technological leaps OpenAI's tools represent.While many videos are silly memes or fake images of babies and pets, others are meant to stoke the kind of vitriol that often characterises political debate. They have already figured in foreign influence operations. Researchers who have tracked deceptive uses said the onus was now on companies to do more to ensure people know what is real and what isn't.""Could they do better in content moderation for mis- and disinformation? Yes, they're clearly not doing that,"" said Sam Gregory, executive director of Witness, a human rights organisation focused on the threats of technology.""Could they do better in proactively looking for AI-generated information and labelling it? The answer is yes, as well.""The companies behind the AI tools say they are trying to make clear to users what content is generated by computers. Sora and the rival tool offered by Google, called Veo, both embed a visible watermark onto the videos they produce. Sora, for example, puts a ""Sora"" label on each video. Both companies also include invisible metadata, which can be read by a computer, that establishes the origin of each fake. The idea is to inform people that what they are seeing is not real and to give the platforms that feature them the digital signals to automatically detect them.Some platforms are using that technology. YouTube uses Sora's invisible watermark to append a small label indicating that the AI videos were ""altered or synthetic."" ""Viewers increasingly want more transparency about whether the content they're seeing is altered or synthetic,"" said Jack Malon, a YouTube spokesman.People with malicious intent have discovered that it is easy to get around the disclosure rules. Some manipulate the videos to remove the watermarks. Several firms have sprung up offering to remove logos and watermarks.OpenAI said it prohibits deceptive or misleading uses of Sora and takes action against violators of its policies. The company said its app was just one among dozens of similar tools capable of making increasingly lifelike videos - many of which do not employ any safeguards on use. A spokesman for Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said it was not always possible to label every video generated by AI.","Deceptive videos have surged on X, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.

Vice President JD Vance reacted to the viral photo that claimed to be from a restaurant where JD was publicly fighting with his wife Usha Vance. Though the claim came with an 'allegedly', the vice president did not waste any time to have some fun at the cost of the fake news peddlers and said: ""I always wear an undershirt when I go out in public to have a fight loudly with my wife. """"Looks like things are not so good in Republicanistan. Usha is a liberal. Always has been. Apparently they were having argument loud enough to quiet the restaurant. Why is he wearing a tee shirt?"" the photo came with this caption from one Thomas Clay Jr.Turns out that this was an old and regurgitated rumor on social media. But it resurfaced at a time when there's a lot of speculations about the relationship between JD Vance and Usha Vance despite JD putting all the rumors to rest.In an interview with NBC News, JD Vance recently reacted to the rumor mills and said he kind of gets a kick out of it. “With anything in life, you take the good with the bad. You accept that there are some sacrifices and there are some very good things that come along with it, too. But our marriage is as strong as it’s ever been, and I think Usha’s really taken to it, and it’s been kind of cool to see how she’s developed and evolved in this new role,"" Vance said.The speculations intensified after JD Vance said he would like his Hindu wife to embrace Christianity. The comment was seen as an insult to Usha Vance's identity, though Vance clarified later that every true Christian desires the same and he was aware that Usha did not have any intention to convert.Two public appearances of Usha Vance without her wedding ring made the rumor mills work overtime but JD, in the NBC interview, clarified that both of them saw it coming after the first one happened. JD said they were rushing to the White House for an event and after getting into the car, Usha relaized that she had left her rings behind again after having taken a shower.“She was like, ‘Oh, if I don’t go back and get them, there’s going to be some ridiculous psycho who talks about it on social media,’” Vance recalled. “And I was like, let them. It’s not even worth the trip to run back upstairs. So we actually have a little bit of fun with it. And we thought that whole viral social media cycle was kind of funny.”“There are certainly ways in which it’s difficult on the family,” Vance said. “I’m not going to pretend that it isn’t. But it’s the sacrifice that we signed up for,"" he said.","JD Vance responded to a viral photo that claimed to be from a restaurant where JD was publicly fighting with his wife Usha Vance.

What should people receiving these notices do?

Can a prudential visa revocation be contested?





Amid a major immigration shake-up by the US administration, many H-1B visa holders alleged that they received emails from the consulate informing them that their H-1B visa had been prudentially revoked. The revocation notice says it's effective immediately unless the individual is present in the US, in which case the revocation will become effective immediately upon their departure from the US.US immigration attorney Emily Neumann said such visa revocation notices are being sent to people who had a past interaction with law enforcement even with no conviction. ""Many of these incidents were already disclosed and cleared in earlier visa stamps. A revocation does not affect lawful stay in the United States, but it means the issue will be reexamined at the next visa appointment. Hard to see how this is an efficient use of government resources when the incident was already previously vetted,"" Neumann said.Many Redditors shared screenshots of such notices they received, asking whether their status in the US becomes illegal now and whether they are now vulnerable to ICE arrest.A prudential visa revocation is not permanent; it is a temporary and precautionary cancellation done out of prudence or caution. If a person is present in the US when the visa is prudentially revoked, they remain in the US until the normal expiration of the visa. The visa revocation does not nullify one's permission to stay in the US as the visa revocation means the visa stamp in the passport is canceled but not the status. In such cases, they don't have to leave the US but if they leave, they can't come back even if their visa is not expired, as the stamp is now invalid.There is no appeal usually against visa revocation and the individuals have to reapply for their visa. There is no ban on reapplying but there will be scrutiny on why the visa was previously revoked. For individuals with DUI cases, they will have to make sure that they have proof that the case was disposed.","Many H-1B visa holders alleged that they received emails from the consulate informing them that their visa had been prudentially revoked.

“We’ll Strike Again If Needed”: Navy Chief Issues Stern Warning To Pakistan





Pakistan’s military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has come under widespread criticism after he appeared to wink at a journalist following her question about imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan In the video, the reporter questions Chaudhry about the allegations against Khan, referring to him as a “national security threat” and “anti-state.”""How is it different from the past, or should we expect any development in the future?"" the journalist added.To this, the Chaudhary replied, ""and add a fourth point that you are missing: he is also a 'zehni mareez' (mental patient)."" Chaudhary then proceeded to smile and wink at the journalist.The video, now circulating widely on social media, has sparked widespread criticism, with users calling the gesture “shameless.”""This is how corrupt Pakistani military officers treats women... shameless!!"" a user on X said.Last week, Chaudhry criticised the imprisoned former prime minister, calling him “a mentally ill person,” “a narcissist,” and “a security risk,” while noting that it was for the government to determine how to deal with him, as cited by Dawn.During an hour-long media briefing, Chaudhry acknowledged that the military had never before taken such a clear public stance on a political leader, calling the move “unprecedented.”Chaudhry’s strongly worded press briefing came in response to Khan’s latest remarks against the military leadership, conveyed earlier this week through his sister, Uzma Khan, during a jail visit after weeks of limited access. The comments were later shared on Khan’s X account. Uzma told reporters that her brother was in good health but “very angry.”Imran Khan is currently lodged in Adiala Jail, where he was first sentenced to three years in prison in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Subsequent corruption convictions have extended his total jail term to 14 years, the longest imposed on him to date.Meanwhile, Pakistani government officials have dismissed rumours of Khan’s death in custody or a secret transfer from Adiala Jail, maintaining that he remains in the Rawalpindi facility and is in stable condition.","Pakistan’s military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has come under widespread criticism.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





Pakistan’s defence ministry on Friday officially notified the appointment of Field Marshal Asim Munir as the country’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).The ""president, on the advice of the prime minister, is pleased to appoint Field Marshal Asim Munir (NI) M as the chief of army staff, concurrently the chief of defence forces for a tenure of five years,” the notification read, news agency PTI reported citing Dawn.This comes a day after President Asif Ali Zardari approved his appointment on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.According to the notification issued under Article 243 of Pakistan’s Constitution and the amended Pakistan Army Act, Munir will serve concurrently as Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces for a tenure of five years. The notification marks the most significant restructuring of Pakistan’s military command since the 1970s.The appointment follows the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment last month, which created the new CDF post to establish a unified command structure and enable faster decision-making in critical situations.The amendment also abolished the office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which had coordinated the tri-services since 1976. The CJCSC post formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.With the restructuring, operational, administrative and strategic authority of the armed forces has been consolidated into a single office headed by the CDF. The revised Article 243 provides that the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, will appoint the army chief, who will concurrently serve as the CDF.Munir was first appointed Army Chief in November 2022 for three years. His tenure was extended to five years in 2024 after amendments to the Pakistan Army Act.He was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal days after the four-day conflict with India in May, becoming only the second officer in Pakistan’s history to hold the rank after Field Marshal Ayub Khan.Alongside Munir’s notification, the defence ministry also confirmed a two-year extension for Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu. His extended tenure as Chief of the Air Staff will begin in March 2026 and continue till March 2028.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Munir on his “historic” appointment, saying his leadership had been pivotal in guiding Pakistan’s armed forces. He also praised the air chief for his command during recent operations. defence minister Khawaja Asif and other senior leaders also extended their congratulations, according to Dawn.Information minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan’s defence had strengthened with the establishment of a unified command. Dismissing speculation over the delay in the notification, he said rumours circulating on social and electronic media had proven baseless.Earlier uncertainty had followed the abolition of the CJCSC post and the end of Munir’s original three-year term in late November, leading to political speculation over upcoming four-star appointments. Government officials maintained that the delay was procedural and linked to the prime minister’s travel schedule.Explaining the significance of the new post, army spokesman Lt General Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry said the CDF headquarters would improve coordination across modern, multi-domain warfare involving land, sea, air, cyber, space and intelligence operations. He added that many countries already operate under similar unified command structures.Under the amended military laws, the five-year tenure of the first COAS-plus-CDF is deemed to begin from the date of notification, effectively resetting Munir’s term. The law also allows future reappointments or extensions of up to five years, creating the legal framework for continuity in leadership.The next major step under the new structure will be the appointment of the Commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), a four-star position responsible for strategic assets. The NSC commander will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the CDF.Meanwhile, law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the defence ministry is finalising a new organogram for the CDF to clearly define command flows between the CDF, the service chiefs and the newly created strategic command.Politically, the 27th Constitutional Amendment has drawn mixed reactions. While the ruling coalition hailed it as a step towards efficiency and national security, opposition leaders warned that it concentrates excessive power in the military and could weaken democratic and provincial autonomy.",Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions

Why Imran Khan still remains a threat to Asim Munir





PTI without Imran: Still a major force





PTI was barred from contesting the 2024 general elections.

Dozens of PTI leaders were detained.

PTI-backed independents still won more seats than any other group.

Popularity that has not faded





A 2023 Gallup Pakistan survey showed 61% of Pakistanis had a “good opinion” of him -- the highest rating among all national leaders as reported by Dawn.

Arab News quoted analysts saying Khan remains ""too politically relevant to sideline.""

Televised appearances that trigger unrest





Nationwide protests

Arson and clashes

Attacks on military installations, including the Corps Commander’s residence in Lahore

Nationwide mobile shutdowns and troop deployment

Why Pak army cannot 'eliminate' Imran Khan





Key factors keeping Khan politically alive:





Victimhood narrative: Solitary confinement and restricted access cast him as a political prisoner, a powerful image in Pakistan’s grievance-driven politics.

Mobilisation without presence: PTI’s digital machinery enables mass mobilisation even without Khan physically present.

Diaspora and social media influence: Global PTI networks amplify every statement, intensifying scrutiny on Pakistan’s military.

High-risk optics: Every court appearance or televised moment risks sparking unrest.

The state vs sentiment





The jail sentence - not the silence





Constitutional shift and expanding military power





Munir's foreign outreach and US engagement





Imran's strength: Mobilisation without access





Why the military needs more than power









Is Imran Khan still a threat to Asim Munir ? The question looms over Pakistan ’s power structure. Former Prime Minister and cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, now over two years into imprisonment, remains a potent challenge to army chief Asim Munir — whose rapid ascent and consolidation of authority have made him Pakistan’s de facto ruler.With Munir now elevated as the Pakistan's first chief of defence forces, commanding the army, navy and air force, his institutional power is at its strongest — yet the confrontation with Khan, even from behind bars, continues to shadow that authority. The two have been locked in a prolonged, deeply personal confrontation.Despite being confined, Khan has transformed from a jailed political leader into a symbolic and political counterweight to Munir’s expanding military-political dominance.Far from fading, the rivalry between the two men has only sharpened. Munir commands the state; Khan commands sentiment. And as the events of the last two years show, sentiment can be far harder to control.Imran Khan's incarceration has fuelled a narrative of persecution and martyrdom among supporters. Long spells of isolation, restrictions on visits, and recurring allegations of mistreatment have strengthened this perception, with some analysts warning that these measures risk backfiring.Imtiaz Gul, executive director of the Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), told Al Jazeera: ""The primary objective of blocking access and keeping Khan in solitary confinement is apparently meant to break him into (agreeing to) a compromise and neutralise the groundswell of anti-government sentiment.”Increasingly, barring visits to Khan is viewed not merely as a security decision, but as a political strategy that may harm the governing PML-N and reinforce Khan’s narrative of institutional overreach.Even without its leader on the ballot, PTI remains one of Pakistan's strongest political forces.PTI claims widespread rigging, accusing the government and military of manipulating the results, allegations echoed by several independent observers. The establishment denies all wrongdoing, but the perception of electoral injustice has only strengthened PTI’s street momentum.For perspective, Imran Khan’s PTI had won 151 seats in the 2018 elections, defeating Nawaz Sharif’s PML-N (81 seats) and PPP (54). That victory was hailed by PTI as ""the end of an era,"" breaking the decades-long political monopoly of the PML-N, PPP and the military establishment.Despite his imprisonment, Khan remains Pakistan’s most popular political figure.This enduring popularity, even at a time of complete political inability, poses a direct challenge to Munir's authority.Even brief, controlled public appearances continue to spark major political reactions.During the May 2023 unrest, Imran Khan's court appearance -- after his dramatic arrest by paramilitary forces -- showed him flashing a victory sign. The televised images spread instantly and triggered:These scenes were unprecedented not only for their scale but because the anger erupted in Punjab, the heart of Pakistan's military recruitment and administrative base.More recently, when false rumours about Khan’s death spread, PTI supporters mobilised across Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, again forcing an immediate government response.A leader who provokes unrest without speaking remains difficult to contain.An analysis in The Diplomat warns that the army ""cannot afford to eliminate"" a leader with deep political roots in Punjab.Such an act, the report cautions, could ""unleash one that the state may not survive.""Khan is ethnically Pashtun but politically anchored in Punjab, with support stretching across Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the diaspora. His arrest in 2023 showed that anger against the military establishment now emerges in Punjab.Eliminating him would not neutralise his influence; it would likely create a ""martyr"" of unprecedented scale.Munir commands the state apparatus. Khan commands sentiment.And in Pakistan, sentiment has repeatedly proved more enduring than power.No prime minister has survived a confrontation with the military, but no army chief has faced a jailed leader with such widespread support and political resilience.Since August 2023, Khan has faced a series of corruption and security-related cases. In January 2025, he received a 14-year sentence in a land-graft case, a verdict his supporters claim was engineered to keep him out of politics.Khan’s public statements from jail fuel the perception of political persecution. He has directly accused Munir of ""moral bankruptcy,"" and called him ""mentally unstable man"" claiming Pakistan's constitution and rule of law have collapsed under him: ""I have been kept in complete solitary confinement, locked inside a cell with no contact with a single human being for four weeks… even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been taken away from us. ""His family members have echoed concerns about his treatment. His sister, after visiting him, said he told her they were subjecting him to ""mental torture"" and held Asim Munir responsible.The recent 27th amendment -- widely called a ""constitutional coup"" -- has entrenched military dominance further. Munir's elevation as chief of defence forces gives him command over all three services.Mahmood Khan Achakzai, head of Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan, warned: ""There is no constitution in Pakistan now. No judiciary. No social contract. They have made one man into a king above all.""Months ago, Munir's increasing visibility included multiple meetings with Donald Trump. Munir even nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, crediting him with easing India–Pakistan high military tensions, a move driven by a desire for US recognition. Trump later referred to him as his ""favourite field marshal.""It is often assumed that political power requires physical presence. Imran's continuing influence disproves that assumption.His followers still speak of him not as a convicted convict, but as a leader wronged. The slogans, the sense of injustice, the personal stories -- all add up to mobilisation potential. And that potential doesn’t require Khan’s freedom; it only requires people’s belief.Statements from his family amplify this -- for instance, the anguish voiced by his son over not knowing whether his father is safe in jail. Such public airing of fear and trauma becomes a magnet for sympathy and solidarity.""Not knowing whether your father is safe, injured or even alive is a form of psychological torture,"" he had said in written remarks.However, Imran Khan's sister was eventually allowed to meet the former prime minister. After the visit, she said, ""Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he told me they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this.""For the military leadership under Asim Munir, the calculus is not just about brute strength, it is about legitimacy. Pakistan’s power dynamics have long relied on a veneer of neutrality: the idea that the army guards the system while politics handles politics. Overplaying that role risks shattering the illusion.From Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan to Zia-ul-Haq and Pervez Musharraf , every era of military rule reinforced the pattern: the army positioned itself not merely as a defender of borders, but as the ultimate arbiter of Pakistan's politics and identity.Each takeover was justified through narratives of chaos, corruption, or national security, allowing the establishment to retain dominance even during civilian periods. Today, under Asim Munir, this pattern continues in a more sophisticated form: instead of overt coups, power is exercised through constitutional engineering, judicial pressure, and political sidelining, most visibly in the dismantling of Imran Khan’s political career. The military’s quest is not only to command the state but to remain indispensable to its very definition.As long as Imran Khan remains a contested figure, not just legally, but symbolically, the army's claim to neutrality becomes harder to maintain.International pressure, media scrutiny, and internal dissent all rise with every heavy-handed move.Hence, the challenge for Munir may be deeper than suppressing one man, it is about managing optics, institutional trust and political fallout.",Is Imran Khan still a threat to Asim Munir?

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday formally appointed Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir as Pakistan’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) for a period of five years.The move follows the recent passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment on November 12, which created the post of CDF to unify command across the armed forces and streamline decision-making during critical situations.The newly created CDF replaces the abolished office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.President Zardari approved the recommendation submitted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for Munir’s appointment. A press release from the President’s office extended best wishes to Munir in his new role.The same release also announced a two-year extension in the service of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu, Chief of Air Staff, effective from the completion of his current tenure in March 2026.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the reforms “bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while maintaining military honour and tradition” and confirmed there were no legal or political obstacles to Munir’s appointment. He also stated that the Defence Ministry was preparing a new organogram for the CDF to reflect the changes.Field Marshal Munir, who was initially appointed as COAS in November 2022 for three years, had his tenure extended to five years in 2024.With this appointment, he assumes a historic dual role, serving simultaneously as Chief of Army Staff and the first Chief of Defence Forces, marking a significant shift in Pakistan’s military hierarchy and institutional structure.The 27th Constitutional Amendment elevates the army chief to the role of CDF with constitutional authority over all three branches of the military: army, navy and air force.It also introduces judicial reforms, including the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) to handle constitutional matters, allowing the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the amendment as a demonstration of national unity, highlighting the role of law enforcement in recent counterterrorism efforts.While the ruling coalition including PPP, PML-N, and MQM-P, supported the amendment, opposition parties criticized it as unconstitutional, warning it could concentrate excessive power in the military.PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan described it as the “Baku Amendments,” accusing the government of undermining democracy.

Parallel governance, ‘parchi’ systems and water mafias





Several informal systems operated during this period:

The ‘Parchi’ System: Residents, businesses and even small schools were required to obtain a stamped permission slip or parchi from PAC offices to build, renovate, operate stalls or open new ventures. What looked like a routine approval process effectively served as taxation, a tool of surveillance and a means to regulate economic activity.

Water and Tanker Control: Amid persistent water shortages across Karachi, PAC factions captured key pipeline points and operated illegal hydrants. Water was sold through tankers at inflated rates, turning a basic utility into one of the most profitable sources of revenue for the gangs. Control over water distribution also gave PAC leverage over entire neighbourhoods.

Welfare Patronage and ‘Robin Hood’ Politics: A share of illicit earnings was used to sponsor madrassas, support religious events, organise football tournaments, fund community funerals and assist poor families. This welfare strategy deepened PAC’s influence and aligned it with PPP’s political base, reinforcing the perception of gang leaders as protectors rather than mere criminals.

PPP, the Bhuttos and the contested 'protector' narrative





A factual account of the events surrounding Benazir’s return and death underscores this point:

Karsaz bombing (18 October 2007): Benazir was in an open truck surrounded by PPP volunteers, not in a car. Her protection was largely handled by party workers and an informal crowd, not gang networks.

Assassination in Rawalpindi December, 27, 2007: At the time she was targeted, she was travelling in a white Toyota Land Cruiser driven by Javed Rehman, a trained PPP driver, not Rehman Dakait. No credible evidence links the gangster to her security detail.

NEW DELHI: Karachi’s Lyari has long been associated with a dual identity. To its residents, it is the “mother of Karachi” – one of the city’s oldest settlements powered by dockworkers, truck drivers, boxers and footballers. To the rest of Pakistan, especially through the 1990s and 2000s, it came to signify something very different: a “mini Brazil” of football-obsessed alleys, heavily armed gangs, and extortion rackets, long branded as Karachi’s “wild west.”It is this layered, contradictory Lyari that Aditya Dhar’s recent 'Dhurandhar' turns into cinema. The film revolves around characters that seem to be inspired by gangster Rehman Dakait, police officer Chaudhry Aslam and a shadowy military-intelligence player resembling Ilyas Kashmiri (fictionalised as Major Iqbal). Alongside Pakistani security figures, the narrative hints at a foreign intelligence angle featuring an unnamed “Indian spy chief” — a character with echoes of a former top security official who, in real life, has been involved in covert roles in regional conflicts in Pakistan. These references remain ambiguous on screen, but they mirror real allegations that have circulated for years through local press conferences, dossiers and counterclaims on both sides of the border.Reacting to the controversy around Dhurandhar and the a case file in Delhi high court, Major Mohit Sharma’s brother, Madhur Sharma, said the petition was filed due to ongoing speculation that the film was inspired by the Ashok Chakra awardee’s life without any transparency from the makers. Madhur clarified that the family is not opposed to a film based on Major Sharma, but objected to the possibility of using his story without consent. “We would be proud if a film is made on him. Even in 2021, a film was announced and we supported the producers. He has left a legacy, and it should live on,” he said. The family maintains that they are only seeking clarity and dignity for the officer: “There is no benefit the parents are looking for… If the film is based on him, just say, ‘Sorry ma’am, we didn’t inform you.’ If not, say the hype is untrue.”The Delhi high court heard the plea filed by Major Sharma’s parents seeking a review before the film’s release. While the court did not stay the December 5 release of Dhurandhar, it acknowledged the legitimacy of the family’s concerns regarding similarities to a real-life officer without consent. The court referred the matter to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) for examination, noting the need for regulatory scrutiny before the film proceeds.Following the controversy, director Aditya Dhar issued a clarification on X addressed to the family. He wrote: “Hi, sir - our film Dhurandhar is not based on the life of braveheart Major Mohit Sharma AC(P) SM. This is an official clarification. I assure you, if we do make a biopic on Mohit sir in the future, we will do it with full consent and in complete consultation with the family, and in a way that truly honors his sacrifice for the nation and the legacy it has left for all of us. Jai Hind.”This blurred mix of fact, rumour and state narrative reflects Lyari’s history itself. For more than six decades, the neighbourhood has moved on two parallel tracks. One is a working-class community that powered Karachi’s docks, produced champion boxers and footballers, and remained a loyal base of the Pakistan People's Party ( PPP ). The other is a network of gangs and protection rackets that emerged from the hashish trade of the 1960s and later expanded into narcotics trafficking, extortion, land capture and control of water tankers.Successive governments, including PPP administrations, did not simply fight these groups; at various points they bargained with them, funded them or turned a blind eye. Leaders like Rehman Dakait, and later Uzair Baloch, acted not only as crime bosses but as political intermediaries who ran parallel governance under the banner of the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC), often brandishing PPP flags at their offices. As Taliban networks poured into Karachi in the 2000s and regional intelligence rivalries spilled into the city, Lyari’s gangs were no longer seen merely as enforcers protecting a vote bank — they were gradually treated as potential pieces in a wider security chessboard.With Dhurandhar reigniting attention, this story revisits how Lyari transformed from a labour colony to PPP stronghold to a battleground shaped by gang wars, state patronage, counter-terror operations and allegations of espionage. What emerges is not simply the tale of feared men, but the story of a neighbourhood where poverty, politics and competing security agendas turned everyday life into a prolonged and violent conflict.a long, violent war.Lyari is among the oldest continuously inhabited parts of Karachi and holds a foundational place in the city’s history. Long before Karachi became Pakistan’s financial hub, Lyari evolved as a working-class settlement dominated by Baloch communities who migrated from coastal and interior regions in search of livelihoods. During the 18th and 19th centuries, as the port emerged as the centre of colonial trade, Baloch labourers became indispensable to loading cargo, building roads and supporting maritime activities. This early dependence on manual workers gradually transformed Lyari into a labour colony closely interlinked with Karachi’s industrial and infrastructural growth.Despite its importance in sustaining the city’s economy, the locality remained neglected in terms of urban development. Narrow lanes, dense housing clusters, unreliable utilities and limited state services came to define its daily reality. Yet, Lyari’s social fabric remained strong: sports, community centres and local cultural traditions created a sense of belonging that distinguished it from other Karachi neighbourhoods.In politics, Lyari’s identity further crystallised with the rise of the Pakistan People's Party. Since the 1970s, the PPP’s populist messaging—centred on economic justice and empowerment of marginalised groups—found deep resonance in Lyari. During decades of shifting political power in Karachi, the locality consistently returned PPP candidates to provincial and national assemblies. This loyalty turned Lyari into the party’s most dependable urban stronghold, a constituency where electoral victories were seldom in doubt.Over time, however, this relationship between Lyari and the PPP took a complex turn. As Karachi’s security landscape deteriorated in the 1980s and 1990s, the party increasingly relied on local strongmen, community leaders and later armed groups to maintain influence and protect its vote bank. Patronage networks developed, blurring the lines between politics, street authority and organised crime. What began as a working-class community with a vibrant political identity would eventually become the focal point of Karachi’s most violent gang conflict—one in which loyalty, power and criminality became deeply entangled.The roots of the Lyari gang war go back to the 1960s, when the area emerged as a key node in the local hashish trade. According to both journalistic and academic accounts, early figures like Dad Muhammad (“Dadal”) and his brother Sheru moved into the hashish business in the mid-1960s, challenging the dominance of an older drug boss known as “Kala Nag”.Kala Nag was eventually killed in what was officially described as a police encounter, and the hashish economy fragmented into rival factions. Violence at this stage largely revolved around knives and small arms, with public killings used to send messages and enforce territorial control.In the 1990s, a more educated generation of criminals appeared. One of the most prominent was Iqbal, known locally as “Babu Dacoit”, who reportedly held a Master’s degree in physics. Operating across a wider network, he ran drugs and other rackets while remaining largely beyond the reach of the police. His later arrest, when he was already paralysed, symbolised a shift from small-scale street crime to more organised, networked operations.A major shift in Lyari’s politics and crime landscape came with the ascent of Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch, widely known as Rehman Dakait. Born into a family already linked to smuggling networks, Rehman entered the criminal world at a young age. By the mid-1990s, he had developed a reputation for extreme violence, with local accounts even alleging that he murdered his own mother during a domestic dispute—an unverified but persistent story that reinforced his notoriety.By the early 2000s, Rehman had consolidated control over large parts of Lyari’s illicit economy, including drug trafficking, extortion and gambling rackets. Yet, he also cultivated an image as a benefactor. Oral histories, media reporting and academic studies describe how he funded small clinics, madrassas, football tournaments, neighbourhood parks and schools, using criminal proceeds to build patronage. This dual identity—provider and predator—helped him secure legitimacy among segments of the local population who felt abandoned by the state.Rehman’s rise coincided with Lyari’s continued loyalty to the PPP. As political competition intensified in Karachi, PPP leaders increasingly saw strategic value in a local armed actor who could protect the party’s dominance and mobilise votes. Political alignment, according to multiple accounts, allowed Rehman to operate with greater impunity and helped formalise gang influence under a new name: the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC).Formed around 2008, the PAC presented itself as a community “peace” organisation but functioned as an institutionalised version of Rehman’s operations. It opened offices, appointed local commanders, mediated disputes, collected protection money and distributed welfare. In a context of chronic state neglect, many residents began to rely on the PAC as a parallel administration, making it one of the most powerful non-state authorities Karachi had ever seen.The roots of Lyari’s modern gang war lie in an older conflict shaped by ransom kidnappings, shifting alliances and internal betrayals. In the 1980s and 1990s, parts of Lyari’s criminal economy were dominated by a figure known as Haji Lalu, with another notorious operator, Dadal, working as one of his trusted aides. Disputes over ransom money extorted from wealthy businessmen gradually fractured this relationship. The split laid the foundation for two rival blocs: one centred on Lalu and his son, Arshad Pappu, and the other aligned with Dadal’s family, including his son, Rehman Dakait.The rivalry intensified through the 1990s. Dadal’s murder—widely believed to have been carried out by a competing gang—created a vacuum that Rehman moved to fill, initially with Lalu’s support. But a later dispute over a substantial ransom sum allegedly taken behind Rehman’s back marked the end of that partnership. The fallout turned the former allies into adversaries, cementing a bitter feud between Rehman’s camp and that of Haji Lalu and Arshad Pappu.A separate event subsequently brought an important new actor onto the scene: Uzair Jan Baloch, the son of a transport businessman, Faiz Muhammad, known locally as Mama Faizu. According to both police records and local accounts, Faizu was kidnapped and killed in 2003 by men linked to Arshad Pappu. Uzair initially attempted to seek justice through legal channels but reportedly faced threats and obstruction. Sharing a common enemy in Pappu, he turned instead toward his cousin, Rehman Dakait, joining his organisation.Over the following years, the Rehman–Uzair alliance fought a sustained war against the Pappu–Lalu network. What began as a dispute over illicit profits evolved into a violent cycle of killings, reprisals and territorial battles. By the mid-2000s, the feud had escalated into one of the deadliest urban conflicts in Karachi, with casualties running into the hundreds and paving the way for a new era of militarised gang politics.With the rise of Rehman Dakait and, later, Uzair Baloch, the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC) grew beyond a criminal network and evolved into a parallel governance structure in Lyari. Between roughly 2008 and 2013, researchers describe Lyari as effectively under PAC’s informal administration, with neighbourhood “commanders’’ exercising authority over small jurisdictions. These commanders managed disputes, issued permissions and collected funds in a manner that closely resembled state functions.These overlapping spheres blurred boundaries between state actors and non-state power. PAC offices routinely displayed both their own banners and PPP flags, while police operations in Lyari were often delayed, curtailed or influenced by political pressure. For a period, the PAC did not simply challenge state authority—it partially replaced it.Within Lyari, Rehman Dakait was widely viewed as being closely aligned with senior leaders of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP). Journalistic reporting and local accounts repeatedly describe him as someone who maintained proximity to the Bhutto leadership and attended major PPP political events.A popular narrative in Lyari claims that Rehman “saved” former prime minister Benazir Bhutto during the 18 October 2007 Karsaz attack in Karachi, when two explosions targeted her homecoming procession. In these accounts, Rehman is portrayed as part of an informal security circle that helped her escape following the blast. The story has fuelled his “protector” image and contributed to his Robin Hood-style mystique.However, despite the narrative’s frequency in oral history, there is no independent, verifiable evidence confirming that Rehman personally rescued Benazir or served as her driver or official security guard at any point. What is more clearly documented is the broader political relationship: Lyari’s gangs and the PPP operated in a framework of mutual benefit for years, with the party relying on armed control of the constituency and the gangs receiving political space to operate.After the PPP returned to power in 2008, Rehman publicly rebranded himself as Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch, presenting the Peoples’ Aman Committee as a community organisation rather than a gang body. His growing political visibility, and reported sympathies with certain Baloch nationalist circles, are believed by some analysts and residents to have contributed to his killing in a controversial police “encounter” in 2009.As media scrutiny of Lyari intensified and gang violence spread to other parts of Karachi, state pressure began to mount. At the centre of this response was SSP Chaudhry Aslam Khan, an officer in the Crime Investigation Department (CID) known for aggressive policing tactics. Aslam cultivated a reputation as an “encounter specialist,” targeting both militant groups and organised crime. His public stance against Lyari gangs put him in direct confrontation with Rehman Dakait, who by the mid-2000s had become one of the most influential figures in Karachi’s underworld.Law enforcement records and press reports from the period describe a tense cat-and-mouse dynamic between the two men. Rehman repeatedly evaded capture; in at least two documented incidents, he escaped custody after allegedly bribing police officers. According to local media accounts and later investigations, Rehman paid select CID and jail officials to secure temporary releases or avoid charges, a practice facilitated by weak internal oversight and political protection. These incidents contributed to Aslam’s personal resolve. Journalists covering Karachi’s crime beat recall that Aslam increasingly framed the pursuit of Rehman as a matter of professional and personal credibility for the police force.On 9 August 2009, police announced that Rehman had been killed in a shootout near Steel Town, on Karachi’s outskirts. Officials claimed that Rehman and three accomplices opened fire on police and were killed in retaliatory fire. However, from the outset, rights groups and local residents questioned the official account. Activists, lawyers and researchers later described the killing as a likely extrajudicial execution, consistent with a broader pattern of “encounters” used in Karachi to bypass a slow judicial system and fragile witness protections.With Rehman removed, the gang landscape did not stabilise. Instead, the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC), which he had informally led, underwent a leadership transition. Within weeks, Uzair Jan Baloch was positioned as Rehman’s successor, assuming both the criminal networks and the political connections tied to PPP support. Unlike Rehman, whose authority rested heavily on personality and charisma, Uzair’s tenure was marked by greater bureaucratisation—defined commanders, more formalised extortion systems and deeper conflict with the state. This period would set the stage for some of the bloodiest episodes of the Lyari gang war.After Rehman Dakait’s killing in 2009, leadership of the Lyari network did not pass smoothly to a single successor. Uzair Jan Baloch projected himself as the political head of the organisation: educated, relatively well-spoken, and comfortable appearing alongside PPP leaders. His image contrasted sharply with the operational commander Noor Muhammad, better known as “Baba Ladla”, who had a reputation for ruthlessness built over years as an enforcer in neighbourhood turf battles.Initially, the two worked side by side under the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC) banner. But disagreements over extortion routes, neighbourhood control and access to political patrons gradually turned into open rivalry. Within Lyari, some commanders gravitated toward Uzair’s political authority and alleged links to provincial leadership; others aligned with Baba Ladla’s street power. This divide transformed PAC from a single entity into competing armed factions.The conflict reached its most infamous moment in March 2013, with the killing of rival gangster Arshad Pappu. According to court filings and media reporting, Pappu and his brother Yasir Arafat were abducted from Karachi’s Defence neighbourhood and taken to Lyari. Both were tortured, killed and later mutilated. Their remains were reportedly burned and dumped—widely interpreted as Uzair’s retaliation for the killing of his father, Faiz Muhammad. Some later accounts, including police dossiers and local testimonies, alleged that gang members kicked or played football with severed heads, turning the murders into a grim public spectacle that circulated in local narratives.By this stage, the greatest toll fell on ordinary residents. Prolonged firefights between splinter factions left neighbourhoods barricaded for days. Homes and small businesses were commandeered as torture rooms or lookout posts. Young men were coerced into gang recruitment, teachers and shopkeepers were forced to pay “taxes,” and ambulance workers trying to retrieve bodies were threatened by both sides. In response, the state increasingly turned to large-scale fires, sieges and heavy weaponry, culminating in the militarised crackdowns that would soon follow.In April–May 2012, the Sindh government initiated one of Karachi’s largest security actions against gang networks, later known as Operation Lyari. The police deployed thousands of personnel, armoured carriers and specialised units with the stated goal of clearing the area and arresting key commanders linked to the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC). For the first time, a formal state crackdown directly targeted the network that had operated for years through political patronage and parallel governance.The operation, however, quickly encountered intense resistance. Armed groups used heavy weaponry, including rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), to attack the advancing police. Several armoured personnel carriers were damaged or destroyed, and police units struggled to push through Lyari’s dense alleyways, where snipers and lookout positions gave gang members a tactical advantage. After several days of fighting, rising casualties, and growing criticism from political circles, the operation stalled. It ended without major arrests and was widely perceived as a failure that exposed both the state’s limitations and PAC’s entrenched power.For residents, the consequences were immediate and severe. Lyari was effectively sealed off for about a week, with restricted movement in and out of the neighbourhood. Power and water supplies were disrupted, markets were shut, and families already living under economic strain faced shortages of food and basic essentials. Humanitarian groups and ambulance services reported being blocked or delayed from providing aid, amid police suspicions that relief efforts could serve as a cover to transport weapons or militants.The failed siege deepened mistrust between civilians, gangs and the state. Many residents had already endured years of coercive “taxes” and violence under PAC rule; the security operation then subjected them to collective punishment, indiscriminate fire and deprivation. Instead of restoring confidence, the crackdown reinforced the perception that both the state and the gangs were willing to sacrifice ordinary people to protect their own interests.Even as Lyari’s gang networks fought prolonged turf wars, Karachi was simultaneously becoming a logistical base for militant organisations, particularly factions of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). As security operations intensified in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt, militants sought anonymity in large urban centres. Pashtun-majority neighbourhoods such as Sohrab Goth, Manghopir and SITE became key sanctuaries and transit corridors where fighters, explosives and finances could be moved with relative ease.The turning point came on 8 June 2014, when ten militants launched an armed assault on Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, using automatic weapons, grenades and a rocket launcher. The attack triggered an overnight battle that left at least 36 people dead, including all ten assailants. The incident severely embarrassed federal authorities and exposed vulnerabilities in Karachi’s security infrastructure. The scale of the attack underscored that the city’s violence was no longer just about gangs—it was also linked to national insurgency networks.In the aftermath, the state expanded its response. The federal and provincial governments granted Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) extensive policing and detention powers to target both militants and criminal networks. These operations aligned with ongoing national counterinsurgency campaigns, including Operation Zarb-e-Azb and later Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad, which aimed to dismantle militant networks and disrupt their finances and recruitment pipelines.In Karachi, this translated into a sustained, multi-year crackdown led by the Rangers. Tactical raids, mass arrests, prolonged detentions under special legal provisions and high-profile encounters became common features of urban policing. In Lyari, the result was a shrinking space for gangs to openly control territory. The Peoples’ Aman Committee and splinter factions still operated, but their public influence diminished as armed checkpoints, displays of heavy weaponry and enforced taxation became more difficult to sustain. Although pockets of violence persisted, the crackdown marked the beginning of the end of large, overt gang administrations in the city.One of the most high-profile casualties in the post-2014 security phase was SSP Chaudhry Aslam Khan, the police officer who had led major operations against both Lyari gangs and militant networks. On 9 January 2014, a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into Aslam’s convoy in Karachi, killing him and at least three others. The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility, calling the attack revenge for police operations against its fighters and financiers. Aslam’s death was widely perceived as a serious setback to the city’s counter-terror and anti-gang efforts, though operations continued under other police officers and with greater reliance on Pakistan Rangers (Sindh).For Lyari’s armed groups, the most decisive blow came three years later. Acting on intelligence reports, Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) launched a pre-dawn raid on 2 February 2017 in Phool Patti Lane, Lyari, targeting Noor Muhammad, better known as “Baba Ladla.” According to Rangers’ statements, a gun battle lasting over 30 minutes ensued, during which gang members used automatic weapons and grenades. By the end of the raid, Rangers announced that Baba Ladla and two close associates had been killed.Listed for years among Pakistan’s “most wanted” criminals, Baba Ladla faced cases ranging from murder and extortion to armed attacks on police and suspected collaborations with extremist groups. His death effectively dismantled a key pillar of the Uzair-era structure, removing the most prominent operational commander who had challenged both rivals inside Lyari and the security forces sent to eliminate them.By the mid-2010s, as state pressure intensified and gang structures were fractured by successive operations, Uzair Jan Baloch left Pakistan. In December 2015, Interpol arrested him at Dubai International Airport, reportedly while he was travelling from Muscat. He was subsequently handed over to Pakistani authorities and brought back to Karachi.From 2016 onward, Uzair was charged in dozens of criminal cases, ranging from murder and attempted murder to extortion, kidnapping and terrorism. Many of these cases have since resulted in acquittals due to lack of evidence, hostile witnesses or procedural weaknesses—a pattern that has long characterised Karachi’s organised crime trials, where intimidation makes witness testimony difficult.In April 2017, a new dimension emerged when the Pakistan Army took custody of Uzair to try him under military law. He was accused of espionage and leaking sensitive information to a foreign intelligence agency, reportedly linked to Iran. In April 2020, a military court sentenced him to 12 years in prison on espionage charges, marking a significant shift in how the state officially characterized him—not merely as a gang leader, but as a potential national security threat.Pakistani officials and segments of local media have occasionally linked Uzair’s alleged intelligence connections to the controversial case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Indian national sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court in 2017. One strand of narrative suggests that Uzair’s alleged contacts in Iran overlapped with networks also linked to Jadhav. However, India has rejected Pakistan’s claims in the Jadhav case as coerced and unsubstantiated, and publicly verifiable evidence connecting Uzair directly to operational support for Jadhav remains limited.What is clearer is that, from the perspective of the Pakistani state, Uzair Baloch’s profile evolved from that of a gang leader embedded in local politics to an alleged cross-border security risk—reshaping the narrative around Lyari’s gangs and their significance.As violence worsened and Lyari began drawing national and even international scrutiny, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) gradually shifted its stance on the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC). Between 2012 and 2013, amid pressure from rival parties, security agencies and media coverage, the PPP formally disowned the PAC, despite years of visible proximity.Senior party leaders later framed PAC figures as rogue actors or products of state neglect, arguing that they were not part of a deliberate political strategy. Critics, however—including journalists, residents and some researchers—contend that the PPP benefitted for years from PAC’s armed control of Lyari, only distancing itself once the political and reputational costs became unsustainable.This distancing reflected a broader shift: as the state redefined Lyari’s gangs from political intermediaries to security liabilities, political actors recalibrated their alliances. What had once been an informal partnership built on patronage and vote control became a liability in the age of counterterrorism and international scrutiny.Security indicators suggest that overt gang violence in Lyari has dropped sharply since the mid-2010s. Rangers-led operations, the removal or incarceration of key gang leaders such as Rehman, Uzair and Baba Ladla, and broader counter-terror campaigns have reduced the frequency of armed clashes and targeted killings in the area.The legacy of the Lyari gang war remains unfinished. For many families, the years of kidnappings, torture, blockades and forced recruitment left deep social and economic scars. Questions continue to surround extrajudicial killings, disappearances and the conduct of both the gangs and state agencies tasked with fighting them. Although large armed networks have been dismantled, traces of informal control and low-level criminality persist in new forms.At the same time, Lyari’s cultural and political identity is evolving again. The football grounds, community schools and cultural centres that once defined the neighbourhood are re-emerging, even as residents remain wary of new power brokers. In popular culture, recent portrayals such as Dhurandhar and other planned projects reflect an enduring public fascination with Lyari—its blurred boundaries between criminal groups, political actors and state security agencies, and the unanswered questions they leave behind.Seen in retrospect, the gang war was not merely the story of violent figures in a marginalised settlement. It grew out of structural inequality, weak state institutions and a political party’s reliance on armed intermediaries to protect its vote bank. As militancy and regional intelligence rivalries later intersected with local crime networks, a neighbourhood built from labour and sport became entangled in national security narratives.Lyari today is quieter, but its past continues to shape how residents understand politics, policing and protection. The names of Rehman Dakait, Uzair Baloch, Baba Ladla and Arshad Pappu remain part of local memory—sometimes condemned as criminals, sometimes recalled as flawed protectors, always as evidence of how quickly a working-class community can become a battleground when crime, politics and security policy converge.","Karachi’s Lyari has long been associated with a dual identity. To its residents, it is the ‘mother of Karachi’ – powered by dockworkers, truck drivers, boxers and footballers. To the rest of Pakistan, especially through the 1990s and 2000s, it came to signify something very different: a “mini Brazil” of football- obsessed alleys, heavily armed gangs, and extortion rackets.

He also claimed that field marshal Munir’s policies were ""disastrous"" for Pakistan and accused him of intentionally ""igniting tensions"" with Afghanistan.The 73-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician shared these remarks on social media a day after his sister, Dr Uzma Khan, met him in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail. The meeting took place after more than a month, following “special permission” from Shehbaz Sharif ’s government, amid widespread rumours on social media about Imran’s health and safety after he was placed in solitary confinement.In a post on X written in Urdu, Khan said, “Asim Munir’s policies are disastrous for Pakistan. Because of his policies, terrorism has spiralled out of control that grieves me deeply.”He further alleged, “Asim Munir has no concern for Pakistan’s national interests. He is doing all this merely to please Western powers. He deliberately ignited tensions with Afghanistan so that he could be seen internationally as a so-called 'mujahid'.”The PTI founder said he had always opposed “drone attacks and military operations against own people in the country which he said would only fuel more terrorism.”He claimed, “Munir first threatened Afghans, then expelled refugees from Pakistan and carried out drone strikes whose consequences we now face in the form of rising terrorism.”Calling Munir a “mentally unstable man,” Khan alleged that the army chief’s “moral bankruptcy has led to the complete collapse of the Constitution and rule of law in Pakistan.”He also accused Munir of being behind the cases against him and his wife, saying they had been “imprisoned in fabricated cases and subjected to the worst form of psychological torture.”Khan described his prison conditions, saying, “I have been kept in complete solitary confinement, locked inside a cell with no contact with a single human being for four weeks. I was kept entirely cut off from the outside world, and even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been taken away from us.”He added that despite court orders, his meetings with political colleagues were stopped, and now even his access to lawyers and family had been cut off. “Pick up any human rights charter, psychological torture is considered 'torture' and is deemed even more severe than physical torture. My sister Noreen Niazi was dragged on the road simply for demanding her legitimate right to meet me,” he said.Khan praised Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi for showing courage during what he called an “environment of repression.” He wrote, “I ask him to continue to play on the front foot. There is no law or Constitution in this country. The law is enforced only against PTI as everyone else is exempt. Those threatening governor’s rule in KP should impose it today rather than tomorrow and then watch what happens to them. ”Speculation about Khan’s health had grown after an undeclared ban was imposed on meeting him. Uzma, after seeing her brother, said his health was “perfectly fine” but he was being subjected to “mental torture in solitary confinement.”“Praise be to Allah! His health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture,” she said.","Imran Khan says Asim Munir's policies are ""disastrous"" for Pakistan.

Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), state media reported on Wednesday.The loss-making airline is being privatised as part of a $7 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) program , which requires the federal government to reform or divest struggling state enterprises. A previous attempt to offload PIA last year was scrapped after the government failed to receive a sufficiently attractive offer.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with corporate entities and company representatives involved in the process, according to a press release shared by state broadcaster PTV News. “PIA’s bidding will take place on December 23, which will be broadcast live on all media. We are ensuring transparency and merit in the privatisation process,” the statement quoted him as saying.Sharif said the process was proceeding “smoothly” and argued that privatisation would help restore the airline’s “lost prestige,” align it with modern aviation requirements and facilitate the restoration of PIA’s global flight operations — a step he said was crucial for overseas Pakistanis.If completed, the transaction would mark Pakistan’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.Founded in October 1946, PIA is based at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, the country’s second-busiest airport and its largest city’s main aviation hub.","Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines.

NEW DELHI: Imran Khan’s sister on Tuesday said the former Pakistan prime minister is “completely fine” and in good health, after she was finally allowed to meet him inside Adiala Jail following weeks of restricted access that had fuelled protests and rumours about his condition.Authorities at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail permitted Imran’s sister Uzma Khanum to meet him on Tuesday, breaking a prolonged period during which family members and PTI leaders were repeatedly denied access. According to Pakistan news outlet Dawn, Uzma entered the prison as several PTI supporters gathered outside demanding transparency on Imran’s health.Following the meeting, PTI USA shared her remarks, quoting her as saying, “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he said that they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this.”AccordingUzma said that Imran Khan was kept in his room throughout the day, allowed only limited time outside, and had no communication with anyone.

There has been absolutely no contact with Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan , which has intensified speculation about his possible death. Demanding access to the PTI founder, party members have decided to stage a protest despite the restrictions imposed by the Pakistan government.Following the PTI workers' announcement of protests outside the Islamabad High Court and Adiala Jail, Section 144 was enforced in both cities. However, the order has not deterred Imran Khan’s supporters. They declared their protest plans even as restrictions have been in place since November 18 for two months.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday declared that the party would stage a major protest outside the Islamabad High Court on Monday, followed by another demonstration outside Adiala Jail on Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference at the CM House, Afridi claimed that Imran Khan, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, has been held in “complete isolation” since November 4, with no one granted access to him.He said that Khan’s sisters, senior party leaders, lawyers, and even doctors have all been barred from meeting him, effectively placing him in total solitary confinement—a situation he described as “extremely alarming.”PTI leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan. After KP CM Afridi ordered the party members to immediately move to Islamabad, the party has also asked the supporters to gather outside the Adiala Jail later.Talking to reporters, Afridi said that on Tuesday, all parliamentarians would first gather at the IHC to stage a strong protest before the court’s chief justice, noting that despite judicial orders, he himself was not allowed to meet Khan.“This is blatant contempt of court. We will hold a protest at the IHC,” Afridi asserted.He said the parliamentarians would then move to Adiala Jail to attempt to meet Khan and to express solidarity with his sisters.Following the announcement of protests, the Rawalpindi deputy commissioner's office issued the notice on Monday that Section 144 shall be imposed in the city from December 1 to December 3. According to the notice, the order has been enforced on the basis of “imminent threats” identified by the district intelligence committee (DIC), particularly in and around sensitive installations, major roads and other critical infrastructure. The committee’s assessment underpinned the local government’s decision to restrict public gatherings during this period.The Rawalpindi notification prohibits all kinds of gatherings of more than five people. As per the statement, ""All kinds of Assemblies, Gatherings, Sits-in, Rallies, Processions, Demonstrations, Jalsas, Dharnas, Protests and such like other activities, i.e gathering of 05 or more persons.""""Carrying of weapons, spikes, laden batons, gaulails, ball bearings, petrol bombs, improvised explosives or any other instrument that could potentially be used for violence,"" is also listed as one of the restrictions in the notice.Along with these, pillion riding and the use of loudspeakers or display of ""arms and hatred speeches"" are also prohibited.The Islamabad district magistrate’s office issued the order after what it described as “certain segments of society … planning to organise unlawful assemblies … within the jurisdiction of Islamabad Capital Territory,” according to a report in Dawn. The announcement in Rawalpindi came through a notification from the deputy commissioner’s office, which cited security concerns due to potential large gatherings.In Islamabad, the order did not define what would constitute an “unlawful assembly” but noted that authorities deemed it “necessary to control such types of illegal activities which present a threat to public peace, tranquillity and maintenance of law & order.”Pakistan’s former Prime Minister has remained completely out of sight for more than six weeks, with neither his party members nor his family able to establish any direct contact during this period. His prolonged absence from public view has intensified anxiety across the country, fuelling widespread speculation and deepening fears about his safety.The lack of verified updates or appearances has further heightened concerns, with many questioning whether the politician-turned-cricketer may have become the target of a possible assassination attempt or is otherwise being kept in undisclosed conditions.Khan’s sons fear authorities may be hiding “something irreversible” about his condition. His son, Kasim Khan, told Reuters that the family has had no direct or verifiable contact with the jailed former Prime Minister, despite a court order allowing weekly meetings.“Not knowing whether your father is safe, harmed, or even alive is psychological torture,” he said, noting that there has been no independently confirmed communication for months.“We have no reliable information about his condition,” he added. “Our deepest fear is that something irreversible is being kept from us.”Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, filed a contempt of court petition in the IHC on November 28 against the Adiala Jail superintendent and other officials, alleging they prevented her from meeting her brother.Submitting the petition in the presence of Chief Minister Afridi, she cited the IHC’s March 24 order, which had restored a twice-weekly visitation schedule for the 73-year-old former prime minister.Pakistan government officials have rejected rumours that Imran Khan has died in custody or been quietly moved out of Adiala Jail, insisting he remains inside the Rawalpindi facility and is in stable condition.“There is no truth to claims of his transfer from Adiala Jail. He is in good health and receiving full medical care,” Geo News quoted Rawalpindi prison officials as saying.Imran Khan is currently being held in Adiala Jail, where a court first handed him a three-year prison term in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Since then, successive corruption convictions have pushed his total sentence to 14 years, the longest jail term imposed on him so far.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan.

In a first, the Baloch Liberation Front (BLF) used a woman fidayeen operative to storm a heavily-guarded complex belonging to the Frontier Corps and housing a Chinese copper and gold mining project center located in Chagai, Balochistan. Six Pak personnel were reportedly killed in Sunday evening’s attack but there was no official word from the Pak authorities.The BLF also released the photo of the bomber, Zareena Rafiq aka Trang Mahoo, who detonated herself at the barrier to allow the rebel fighters to breach the main compound. The attack is significant because it is the first time the BLF has used a suicide bomber, a tactic exclusive to Majeed Brigade of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) which has carried out a series of attacks including the Jaffar Express hijack in the region.The fact that the complex was linked to the Saindak and Reko Diq projects, managed by Chinese companies and a Canadian firm, indicates the change in rebels’ strategy to strike high-value assets with geopolitical significance, sources said. In a statement released on Telegram, the BLF spokesperson Gwahram Baloch said that the Fidayeen operation was carried out by its ‘selfsacrifice’ unit, Saddo Operational Battalion (SOB), named after Martyred Commander Waja Sado aka Sadath Marri.Meanwhile the BLA released a statement on the wave of coordinated attacks carried out at multiple locations between Nov 28-29, claiming 27 Pak army personnel were killed in 29 attacks. The BLA also said it had taken control of motorways and seized weapons.BLA fighters struck the Pakistani army’s Coast Guard camp in the Pasni area of Gwadar with multiple grenade launchers. They targeted military intelligence personnel in the Jiwani area of Gwadar with a remote-controlled IED attack while they were returning after extorting money from vehicles, the BLA said. Another attack was on the residence of a Pakistani army major in Mastung city.Six blasts were reported at defence installations in Quetta as well.

Pakistan Rages At UN After Criticism Of Munir’s Immunity Amendment Amid Fears Of Deeper Militarism

Also Read |





Author and National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) member Tilak Devasher claimed that Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is “intentionally” staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).Created through the 27th amendment to Pakistan’s constitution, the post is set to be assumed by Field Marshal Asim Munir, potentially making him the most powerful army chief in the country’s history.Speaking to ANI, Devasher highlighted that Sharif left for Bahrain and then London, leading to speculation that he's ""deliberately"" staying away to avoid issuing the notification.“Very smartly, the Pakistan PM went to Bahrain and then to London. He clearly does not want to issue the notification giving Asim Munir five years as army chief and as Chief of Defence Forces. He seems to believe that by staying away and avoiding signing the notification, he can escape the consequences,” said Devasher, author of four books on Pakistan.The comment comes after Sharif’s government failed to issue the required notification appointing Munir as the first-ever CDF by the November 29 deadline—the day his original three-year term as army chief ended.With the creation of the CDF post, the office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee has formally been abolished.Devasher added that Pakistan is currently navigating a “very messy” situation.“If it turns out that he (Asim Munir) is no longer the army chief, then Pakistan finds itself without an army chief, and even the nuclear command authority—meant to fall under the new Strategic Forces Command—is effectively leaderless. It’s an extremely strange situation,” he remarked.Legal experts remain divided over whether the notification is necessary. Under the amended Constitution, the Chief of Army Staff’s term is meant to run concurrently with the CDF, lasting five years.Some analysts, however, argue that the issue may already be addressed by the Pakistan Army Act’s 2024 amendment, which extended the tenure of service chiefs to five years, according to Dawn. The amendment includes a “deeming” clause stating it “shall always be deemed to have been part of the Pakistan Army Act,” implying that Munir’s current term could automatically extend from three to five years without any additional notification.Devasher, however, called this interpretation “controversial,” questioning the view that a notification may not be required.“Some people argue that the Army Act was amended in 2004, setting the army chief’s tenure at five years. Since he has already served three, he supposedly has another two years remaining. From this perspective, no new notification would be required. This is controversial, and it’s unclear how the judiciary or the government will view it. But the fact remains that it makes his position very tenuous,” Devasher said.He also pointed to what he described as political manoeuvring within the military. “There are reports that other generals are now jostling for the position of army chief or for the two newly created four-star posts,” he stated.Devasher added that Prime Minister Sharif’s absence is only deepening the uncertainty. “But this situation cannot continue,” he warned. “A nuclear-armed country cannot function without a Chief of the Army Staff or someone in charge of the nuclear command authority.”","Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is ""intentionally"" staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces.

Pakistan Army General Warns Of Hybrid-To-Full War As Pakistan Reshapes Military Power Under Munir





Fresh violence broke out in Pakistan after a suicide bomber detonated himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan, sparking an intense exchange of fire and a major security response, Dawn reported.The attack, claimed to be the work of militants described by officials as Fitna-al-Khawarij — the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — triggered a swift retaliatory operation in which three attackers were killed.According to FC Balochistan South, the assault began when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance, allowing several armed militants to force their way into the compound. Security personnel from the quick response force immediately engaged the attackers, with heavy gunfire reported from the area. Officials said at least six gunmen were believed to have entered the headquarters, prompting a full-scale clearance operation that continued through the day.In a statement, the FC spokesperson said troops were determined to neutralise the remaining threat, adding that the “last of the terrorists will also be” dealt with.Local reports described sustained firing inside the headquarters as forces worked room-to-room to secure the facility.The incident comes just days after a similar assault on an FC compound in the northwestern city of Peshawar, where gunmen and two suicide bombers stormed a paramilitary headquarters, killing three people. Police had said the first bomber detonated at the main entrance while the second entered the compound, forcing law enforcement to cordon off the busy FC Chowk area amid multiple explosions.These attacks form part of a broader escalation in militant violence this year. Earlier attacks in Quetta — including a deadly car bomb outside a paramilitary base and a suicide blast at a political rally — have added to growing instability in Balochistan. The province has endured a long-running insurgency, with hundreds of security personnel killed in 2024 alone, alongside attacks claimed by separatist groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army.","Suicide bomber detonates himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan.

Myanmar: Drug production booming amid civil war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/myanmar-drug-production-booming-amid-civil-war/articleshow/125832333.cms,"Representative image (AI-generated)

Meth production spurred by civil war

Drug-related crisis 'rapidly expanding'

Farmers and fighters dependent on drug sales

Myanmar heroin found in Africa, Europe





New data on opium and methamphetamine production in Myanmar from the United Nations puts the war-torn country at the epicenter of Asia's multi-billion-dollar illicit drug trade.Opium poppy cultivation rose 17% to over 53,000 hectares (131,000 acres) over the past year, the most in a decade, according to the latest opium survey of Myanmar by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC), published this week.Most notably, Myanmar is still the world's top opium producer. The country claimed that spot from Afghanistan in 2023, two years after the Taliban seized control of the country and eradicated the vast majority of its poppy fields.Data published by the UNODC earlier this year also show methamphetamine seizures across East and Southeast Asia in 2024 hitting a record 236 tons.Most of the drug is believed to be produced in Myanmar. According to the UN, the combination of rising seizures and falling street prices suggest that production inside Myanmar continues to grow.""I wouldn't really say Myanmar as a country is a supplier, but there [are] criminal groups that are engaging in producing and trafficking this meth and heroin,"" Inshik Sim, the UNODC's illicit drugs research officer for the Asia Pacific region, told DW.Myanmar has been a major drug producer for decades, partly due to its geography. The nation, once known as Burma, incorporates one corner of the infamous Golden Triangle, where its rugged, crime-infested borderlands in the east meet Laos and Thailand.In Myanmar's Shan state, criminal cartels have set up under the protection of warlords who rule over enclaves where the government has little to no sway. Most of the drug cartels now based there have moved in from China.The chaotic civil war triggered by a 2021 military coup has created favorable conditions for the growth of Myanmar's drug trade, according to the UN. The country's official economy has collapsed, law enforcement has deteriorated, and warlords needed more money to fund their private armies.""Because of the conflict, there is some need for people to raise money, whether it's armed groups or farmers, because the conflict disrupts the economy…. And I think opium poppy cultivation is one area that we can see,"" said Sim.Methamphetamine production was on the rise well before the coup, but, according to Sim, the civil war has likely boosted this trend as well.Thailand has borne the brunt of drug boom happening across its border with Myanmar. Last year, Thai officials seized massive amounts of Myanmar methamphetamine, including a record 1 billion meth tablets.""These numbers are a clear warning that the drug problem is not only ongoing but expanding now rapidly,"" said Thanapon Thanikkun, head of intelligence at Thailand's Office of the Narcotics Control Board.He warned that the traffickers are exploiting Thailand's well-developed transport network to ship their product on land, air and sea, while also leaving a growing drug use problem in their wake.The UNODC confirms meth use in on the rise in Thailand and much of Southeast Asia.For the armed groups supplying this regional demand from Myanmar, selling drugs is a quick way of arming up, said Khun Oo, vice chair of the Pa-O Youth Organization, a non-government group tackling social issues across the Shan state. The Pa-O are one of the state's main ethnic groups.""They [armed groups] need guns, they need … human resources and money, so this is the way that they can get it, from the drug trafficking,"" he said.Unlike methamphetamine, which can be churned out of small labs in huge volumes by a few people, opium production also puts many farmers to work.Poppy has long been a go-to cash crop in Myanmar during hard times. Khun Oo says the civil war has made it much harder for farmers to get their usual crops to market, whereas the drug traffickers who buy opium come to them.""In the past, they still could do farming [of] other crops,"" he said, but now, ""they have no options"" except growing opium.Khun Oo said the traffickers are also paying farmers up to $500 (€429) for about a kilogram of raw opium in some areas, at least twice what they paid before the coup, making poppy all the more attractive.Products from Myanmar's poppy fields and meth labs travel far and wide across the region and the world.After pouring out of Myanmar into Laos and Thailand, they cascade across the rest of Southeast Asia, and from there may be sold at premium prices in countries like Japan and Australia.Last year, the Australian Federal Police estimated that as much as 70% of the crystal methamphetamine consumed the country came from Myanmar.Sim said China is probably still the main market for Myanmar's heroin. The latest drug seizures, however, suggest the traffickers are now looking westward as well.The UNODC notes a spate of recent meth and heroin seizures over in northeastern India, which also shares a border with Myanmar.Additionally, a string of relatively small but unusual seizures of Myanmar heroin in Nigeria and parts of Europe, by way of Thailand, may indicate that Myanmar cartels are seeking to expand their markets onto new continents.""We didn't really see this kind of heroin trafficking flow from this region to others, because the traditional markets of heroin coming out of the Golden Triangle is basically East and Southeast Asia and parts of Oceania. However, we see that more westward flow happens as well,"" said Sim.","Opium poppy cultivation rose 17% to over 53,000 hectares (131,000 acres) over the past year, according to the latest opium survey of Myanmar. Data published by the UNODC earlier this year also show methamphetamine seizures across East and Southeast Asia in 2024 hitting a record 236 tons. Myanmar has been a major drug producer for decades, partly due to its geography.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125832366,imgsize-105598,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Australia Enforces World’s First Under-16 Social Media Ban, Sparks Global Debate| Global Pulse





LONDON: A frustrated father in Spain, whose teenage daughter regularly sidesteps parental controls that block social media, wants the government to ban apps like TikTok and Instagram for children. In France, a mother of three worries about social media's effect on young people and will not give her children smartphones until they are 15. But she is sceptical a government prohibition is the answer. A mother in Chile says it is a parent's job, not government's, to teach children how to use social media responsibly.Since Australia this month barred children under 16 from using social media, parents around the world have been debating whether similarly tough action is needed in their own countries. In Australia, surveys show most parents support the new rules, while young teenagers have talked about using VPNs and other workarounds. Several countries are weighing whether to adopt similar laws.Malaysia has announced plans to bar children under 16 from using social media starting 2026. Denmark could impose Europe's toughest restrictions, though the measures would not go as far as Australia's. In the US, several states have passed laws to restrict children's social media use.Many parents said they were aware of the impact of smartphones on their own lives, and wanted to protect their children from the most harmful effects. But many also said they felt as if they were fighting a losing battle and were worn down by the time, arguments and technological know-how needed to keep their digitally savvy kids off social media. Parents who feel that way welcomed government action.Israel Perez, a designer in Barcelona, said his 14-year-old daughter was constantly pestering him to lift the restrictions he has imposed on her social media use. He said an Australia-like law would give parents more support in pushing back against such an online culture. ""I really see it as necessary, not as a drastic or excessive measure,"" he said.In Denmark, Anne Kroijer, a mother of four persuaded about three-quarters of the parents in her daughter's class not to buy smartphones for their children. They got older flip phones instead that do not have many apps or a large touch screen. ""It's so incredibly uninteresting that she forgets it half the time,"" said Kroijer. Justine Roberts, founder of Mumsnet, an online community for parents in Britain, said screen time was one of the most common topics on the site's message boards. In a poll, Mumsnet found 83% said they would back an Australia-like ban in Britain.Not all parents believe new laws are needed, and some worry about government overreach. Others see new technologies and social media as an inevitable part of children's daily lives. Charlotte Valette, a mother of three in Paris, said: ""I am not so enthusiastic about the idea of a state taking such a drastic measure."" In Kenya, a country betting on technology to bolster its economy, it will be hard to persuade parents to take away their children's smartphones, said Calvin Odera, a social worker in Nairobi, the capital.In Germany, a yearlong review of a petition brought by parents to parliament calling for an age limit on social media use showed opinion was split. One respondent wrote: ""So, you're supposed to register on social media with a digital ID card now, or some other method to verify your actual age?... The clock can't be turned back."" Verena Holler was one of the parents supporting the petition. ""It's a global crisis.""","Australia this month barred children under 16 from using social media.

‘Hindu Lives Matter’: Protest Outside Bangladesh High Commission In London Over Minority Killings





DHAKA: Days after New Delhi slammed Dhaka for “unremitting hostility” against minorities, Bangladesh on Sunday said there are “systematic attempts” to portray isolated incidents of criminal acts as systemic persecution of Hindus and “maliciously” used to propagate anti-Bangladesh sentiments in different parts of India.In a briefing on Dec 26, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal also said over 2,900 incidents of violence against minorities, have been documented by independent sources and these incidents cannot be brushed aside as mere media exaggeration or dismissed as political violence.“Our attention has been drawn to the recent comments regarding the situation of minority communities in Bangladesh.

"Brigitte Bardot, an icon of French cinema who renounced stardom, dies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/brigitte-bardot-an-icon-of-french-cinema-who-renounced-stardom-dies/articleshow/126222817.cms,"File photo: Brigitte Bardot





PARIS: Brigitte Bardot , the French 1960s sex symbol who became one of the greatest screen sirens of the 20th century and later a militant animal rights activist and far-right supporter, has died. She was 91.Bardot died Sunday at her home in southern France, according to Bruno Jacquelin, of the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals. He gave no cause of death.Bardot became an international celebrity as a sexualised teen bride in the 1956 movie “And God Created Woman.” Directed by her then-husband, Roger Vadim, it triggered a scandal with scenes of the long-legged beauty dancing on tables naked. At the height of a cinema career that spanned some 28 films and three marriages, Bardot came to symbolise a nation bursting out of bourgeois respectability. Her tousled, blond hair, voluptuous figure and pouty irreverence made her one of France’s best-known stars. Such was her widespread appeal that in 1969 her features were chosen to be the model for “Marianne,” the national emblem of France and the official Gallic seal.“We are mourning a legend,” French President Emmanuel Macron wrote Sunday on X.Bardot’s second career as an animal rights activist was equally sensational. She travelled to the Arctic to blow the whistle on the slaughter of baby seals; she condemned the use of animals in laboratory experiments; and she opposed Muslim slaughter rituals.Later, however, she fell from public grace as her animal protection diatribes took on a decidedly extremist tone. She frequently decried the influx of immigrants into France, especially Muslims. She was convicted and fined five times in French courts of inciting racial hatred, in incidents inspired by her opposition to the Muslim practice of slaughtering sheep during annual religious holidays. Bardot’s 1992 marriage to fourth husband Bernard d’Ormale, a onetime adviser to National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, contributed to her political shift.Bardot was born Sept 28, 1934, to a wealthy industrialist. A shy, secretive child, she studied classical ballet and was discovered by a family friend who put her on the cover of Elle magazine at age 14.But it was French movie producer Vadim, whom she married in 1952, who saw her potential and wrote “And God Created Woman” to showcase her provocative sensuality, an explosive cocktail of childlike innocence and raw sexuality. The film, which portrayed Bardot as a bored newlywed who beds her brother-in-law, had a decisive influence on New Wave directors Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut, and came to embody the hedonism and sexual freedom of the 1960s. The film was a box-office hit, and it made Bardot a superstar. Her girlish pout, tiny waist and generous bust were often more appreciated than her talent.Bardot never adjusted to the limelight. She blamed the constant press attention for the suicide attempt that followed 10 months after the birth of her only child, Nicolas.Among her films were “A Parisian” (1957); “In Case of Misfortune,” (1958); “The Truth” (1960); “Private Life” (1962); “A Ravishing Idiot” (1964); “Shalako” (1968); “Women” (1969); “The Bear And The Doll” (1970); “Rum Boulevard” (1971); and “Don Juan” (1973). With the exception of 1963’s critically acclaimed “Contempt,” directed by Godard, Bardot’s films were rarely complicated by plots. Often they were vehicles to display Bardot in scanty dresses or frolicking nude in the sun.“It was never a great passion of mine,” she said of filmmaking. “And it can be deadly sometimes. Marilyn (Monroe) perished because of it.” Bardot retired to her Riviera villa in St Tropez at the age of 39 in 1973 after “The Woman Grabber.”","Bardot became an international celebrity as a sexualised teen bride in the 1956 movie “And God Created Woman” Directed by her then-husband, Roger Vadim, it triggered a scandal with scenes of the long-legged beauty dancing on tables naked.

Red Line From New Delhi: India Calls Out Yunus Govt As Minority Attacks In Bangladesh Escalate





DHAKA: National Citizen Party (NCP) - founded by leaders, mostly students, of the '2024 July Uprising' that led to the Sheikh Hasina govt's collapse - is in the grip of an internal turmoil with 30 members formally opposing its move to ally with Bangladesh's largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) for the Feb 12 national polls, citing its controversial historical role and ""recent divisive activities"".The Islamist party had collaborated with the Pakistan army to commit genocide during the 1971 war and was opposed to Bangladesh's independence. The ban, put on it during Hasina's tenure, was lifted last year after Muhammad Yunus took charge of the interim govt.The members wrote to NCP convener Nahid Islam after joint convener Tajnuva Jabeen announced her resignation and senior joint member secretary Tasnim Jara stepped down from her post. Sources said many NCP members may move to rival BNP or contest the polls as independent candidates.In a Facebook post, Tajnuva said she would not contest the upcoming elections as she is objected to NCP's decision to ally with JeI. Tasnim said she will contest as an independent candidate from Dhaka-9.JeI chief Shafiqur Rahman has announced at a press conference Liberal Democratic Party - headed by former BNP-era minister Col (retd) Oli Ahmed - and Nahid-led NCP had joined the JeI-headed eight-party coalition.Shafiqur said the alliance has nearly finalised its nomination list for all 300 constituencies through talks with the partners. On NCP's absence from the briefing, he said, ""The party's leaders were unable to attend due to time constraints. But they have clearly informed us of their decision to join the alliance. They will announce it to the media through a separate press conference,"" he said.Tajnuva said many had assumed her objection stemmed from ideological concerns, but she was troubled by the process through which the alliance was formed. She said after inviting nationwide nominations and selecting 125 aspirants, NCP was now finalising a seat-sharing arrangement for about 30 constituencies. Tajnuva added, ""I have left NCP, not politics.""",National Citizen Party (NCP) is in the grip of an internal turmoil. 30 members formally opposing its move to ally with Bangladesh's largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami for the Feb 12 national polls.

PORT SUDAN: For eight days, Sudanese farmer Ibrahim Hussein led his family through treacherous terrain to flee the fighting in southern Kordofan -- the latest and most volatile front in the country's 31-month-old conflict.""We left everything behind,"" said the 47-year-old, who escaped with his family of seven from Keiklek, near the South Sudanese border.""Our animals and our unharvested crops -- all of it.""Hussein spoke to AFP from Kosti, an army-controlled city in White Nile state, around 300 kilometres (186 miles) south of Khartoum.The city has become a refuge for hundreds of families fleeing violence in oil-rich Kordofan, where the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) -- locked in a brutal war since April 2023 -- are vying for control.Emboldened by their October capture of the army's last stronghold in Darfur, the RSF and their allies have in recent weeks descended in full force on Kordofan, forcing nearly 53,000 people to flee, according to the United Nations.""For most of the war, we lived in peace and looked after our animals,"" Hussein said.""But when the RSF came close, we were afraid fighting would break out. So we left, most of the way on foot.""He took his family through the rocky spine of the Nuba Mountains and the surrounding valley, passing through both paramilitary and army checkpoints.This month, the RSF consolidated its grip on West Kordofan -- one of three regional states -- and seized Heglig, which lies on Sudan's largest oil field.With their local allies, they have also tightened their siege on the army-held cities of Kadugli and Dilling, where hundreds of thousands face mass starvation.- Running for their lives -In just two days this week, nearly 4,000 people arrived in Kosti, hungry and terrified, said Mohamed Refaat, Sudan chief of mission for the UN's International Organisation for Migration.""Most of those arriving are women and children. Very few adult men are with them,"" he told AFP, adding that many men stay behind ""out of fear of being killed or abducted.""The main roads are unsafe, so families are taking ""long and uncertain journeys and sleeping wherever they can,"" according to Mercy Corps, one of the few aid agencies operating in Kordofan.""Journeys that once took four hours now force people to walk for 15 to 30 days through isolated areas and mine-littered terrain,"" said Miji Park, interim country director for Sudan.This month, drones hit a kindergarten and a hospital in Kalogi in South Kordofan, killing 114 people, including 63 children, according to the World Health Organisation.Adam Eissa, a 53-year-old farmer, knew it was time to run. He took his wife, four daughters and elderly mother -- all crammed into a pickup truck with 30 others -- and drove for three days through ""backroads to avoid RSF checkpoints"", he told AFP from Kosti.They are now sheltering in a school-turned-shelter housing around 500 displaced people.""We receive some help, but it is not enough,"" said Eissa, who is trying to find work in the market.According to the IOM's Refaat, Kosti -- a relatively small city -- is already under strain. It hosts thousands of South Sudanese refugees, themselves fleeing violence across the border.It cost Eissa $400 to get his family to safety. Anyone who does not have that kind of money -- most Sudanese, after close to three years of war -- has to walk, or stay behind.- Those left behind -According to Refaat, transport prices from El-Obeid in North Kordofan have increased more than tenfold in two months, severely ""limiting who can flee"".In besieged Kadugli, 56-year-old market trader Hamdan is desperate for a way out, ""terrified"" that the RSF will seize the city.""I sent my family away a while ago with my eldest son,"" he told AFP via satellite internet connection, asking to be identified only by his first name. ""Now I am looking for a way to leave.""Every day brings ""the sound of shelling and sometimes gunfire"", said Kassem Eissa, a civil servant and head of a family of eight.""I have three daughters, the youngest is 14,"" he told AFP, laying out an impossible choice: ""Getting out is expensive and the road is unsafe"" but ""we're struggling to get enough food and medicine"".The UN has issued repeated warnings of the violence in Kordofan, raising fears of atrocities similar to those reported in the last captured city in Darfur, including summary executions, abductions and rape.""If a ceasefire is not reached around Kadugli,"" Refaat said, ""the scale of violence we saw in El-Fasher could be repeated.""","Sudanese army and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) fighting for control of oil-rich Kordofan.

What workers typically earn: A benchmark view

de facto minimums

Domestic workers:

Construction and skilled trades:

Retail and service staff:

Office and administrative roles:

University graduates and skilled technicians:

Visa rules and wage enforcement

Family visa sponsorship: The UAE mandates a minimum salary of AED 4,000 (or AED 3,000 plus accommodation) for an expatriate to sponsor dependents.

Golden Visa applicants in employment-based categories must earn at least AED 30,000/month (₹701,100), particularly in scientific or technical fields.

Employment contracts must specify wages in UAE dirhams and be registered with MoHRE to be legally recognised.

Rising costs and reform pressures

The road ahead: Formal minimum wage in sight?

Free zones may begin enforcing internal wage floors for certain industries to standardise competition.

Sector-specific minimum wages could emerge in healthcare, hospitality, and logistics where migrant workers dominate and wage disparity is high.

Public-private harmonisation efforts may also push for parity, as Emirati workers often earn significantly more than expatriate counterparts in similar roles.

Verdict





As of 2025, the UAE has not enacted a formal nationwide minimum wage for all private-sector workers. The current labor framework, outlined in Federal Decree-Law No. 33 of 2021, provides the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) with the legal authority to establish a national wage floor but no binding law has yet been implemented.Instead, salaries are regulated through employment contracts and visa-related requirements. Employers must pay wages via the Wage Protection System (WPS); a government-monitored payroll platform. Failure to comply can result in suspension of new work permits, fines, and company blacklisting.Recent reforms have expanded WPS coverage to include domestic and semi-professional workers like private teachers, caregivers, nannies, and farm technicians. This shift reflects a broader move toward labor standardization and income protection across job categories.Although no legally enforced floor exists, salary benchmarks function asin many professions. These reflect industry standards, cost of living, and immigration thresholds.Housemaids, nannies, and drivers employed in homes now fall under stricter payment rules, with most salaries ranging from AED 1,200 to AED 1,800/month (₹28,044–₹42,066), depending on experience and nationality.WPS compliance is mandatory for these roles, ensuring regular wage transfers and legal accountability for employers.Labourers and tradesmen form the backbone of the UAE’s infrastructure sector. While base pay for unskilled labourers often starts at AED 1,200–1,500/month (₹28,044–₹35,055), skilled tradespeople such as electricians, plumbers, and masons can earn between AED 2,000 and AED 4,500/month(₹46,740–₹105,165). Many of these roles are protected under labour laws that mandate written contracts, paid leave, and access to dispute resolution.Workers in retail outlets, supermarkets, cafes, and delivery platforms typically earn AED 2,500 to AED 4,000/month (₹58,425–₹93,480). In these sectors, wage variability is influenced by location (Dubai salaries often exceed those in Sharjah or Ajman), nationality, and employer size.Clerical staff, receptionists, and data entry assistants generally receive AED 3,000 to AED 5,000/month (₹70,110–₹116,850), with larger companies or public sector institutions offering higher packages. For visa eligibility especially family sponsorship—employees must earn a minimum of AED 4,000/month (₹93,480), or AED 3,000 (₹70,110) plus housing.For professionals with technical or university qualifications, MoHRE guidelines recommend salaries of at least AED 5,000 to AED 12,000/month (₹116,850–₹280,440), depending on the nature of the role. Engineers, IT professionals, and finance specialists typically command salaries within or well above this range.Though no national wage law exists, immigration requirements act as an indirect filter. For example:The Wage Protection System ensures salaries are paid into local bank accounts within 10 days of the due date. Any delay beyond 15 days triggers automatic alerts, and repeated violations can lead to bans on new hiring.Over the past few years, Dubai and Abu Dhabi have seen substantial increases in rent, school fees, and healthcare costs. As a result, there is growing pressure on authorities to formalise wage protections and align pay standards with inflation.While some companies voluntarily adjust salaries to retain talent, many low-income workers remain vulnerable to economic shocks today. Calls for an indexed minimum wage system adjusted annually to match living costs are growing increasingly louder, particularly from labour advocates, unions in labour-sending countries, and international policy observers worldwide.Although the UAE has avoided a one-size-fits-all national wage model, change is on the horizon:MoHRE has already hinted at “exploring mechanisms” to address income disparities. If implemented, a flexible minimum wage varying by sector or emirate which could strike a balance between labour protection and economic competitiveness.While there is no official minimum wage in the UAE today, the country is moving toward greater wage transparency, stronger payment enforcement, and benchmark-based income protection. Domestic workers, skilled labourers, and administrative staff now operate under more structured payment conditions—backed by technology and labour law.As the UAE positions itself as a global employment hub, expectations for formal wage regulation will continue to rise. A future where salaries are legally anchored to fair benchmarks seems not only possible but likely.","As of 2025, the UAE has not enacted a formal nationwide minimum wage for all private-sector workers.

Saudi Arabia is taking a firmer stance against banned and counterfeit pesticides, with a draft regulation proposing jail terms, hefty fines, and strict enforcement measures. The new rules aim to protect public health, the environment, and agriculture, while giving authorities clear powers to penalize repeat offenders.The proposed regulation introduces strict consequences for anyone involved in manufacturing or importing banned or counterfeit pesticides. Under the draft, violators may face up to five years in prison, fines reaching SR10 million, or one of these two penalties. The Public Prosecution will investigate all violations and bring the cases before the competent court to enforce the penalties outlined in the regulation. In situations where the offender repeats the violation, the prosecution is authorized to double the penalties to ensure stronger compliance and deterrence.Not all violations will lead to immediate jail time or fines. The draft clarifies that if a violation is minor and does not cause significant harm to humans, animals, plants, the environment, or public health, the violator will first receive a warning. Authorities may then provide a grace period for the issue to be corrected before applying penalties.The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) will play a central role in reviewing violations related to public health pesticides. Responsibilities of the SFDA under the draft include:Additionally, the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture can require violators to remove the cause of the violation. Repeating the offense within three years of a previous violation is considered a repeat offense, which can lead to doubling of fines.The draft also outlines strict measures for dealing with the materials involved in violations. These include:Beyond fines, the draft also allows authorities to temporarily close the facility for up to six months or even permanently shut it down in severe cases. Those penalized have the right to appeal the decision in the Administrative Court in accordance with its regulations.","Saudi Arabia proposes up to five years jail and SR10 million fine for banned pesticides.

Safety warning

Winter hits hard





The UAE is trading its sunny blue skies for a more atmospheric winter vibe this week.According to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), a weak extension of a low-pressure system is sweeping across the country from December 25 to December 29.This shift means residents can look forward to generally pleasant and moderate daytime temperatures, while the nights will take on a noticeably crisper, cooler edge.The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) forecasts generally pleasant and moderate weather across the UAE from Thursday, Dec 25 through Monday, Dec 29. Temperatures will remain mild during the day and dip slightly at night, typical for the start of winter, as a weak low-pressure extension moves over the region.Expect scattered precipitation throughout the weekend. The NCM predicts that rainfall will be intermittent and vary in intensity, mostly appearing as light to moderate showers.Authorities are urging extra caution for commuters and mariners due to two major environmental hazards. High humidity levels will peak during the late night and early morning hours. This will likely result in thick mist and fog over inland and western areas.Drivers are advised to reduce speeds and closely follow police instructions on major highways.Sea conditions in the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman will remain manageable until Saturday. However, by Sunday, fresh northwesterly winds will cause the sea to become rough. Mariners and beachgoers should avoid deep-sea activities as the wind speeds increase.The UAE is currently experiencing its coldest week of the season. A weather station at Jebel Jais in Ras Al Khaimah recorded a bone-chilling 3.5°C at midnight recently, the lowest temperature of the year.As the rain clouds move in, daytime temperatures across the country will remain moderate, but nighttime temperatures will continue to dip significantly, especially in the desert and mountainous regions.

H-1B delay leads to chaos, uncertainty in India





Nikki Haley's son Nalin Haley joined the social media mocking of the situation of the H-1B visa holders in India who went back home for visa stamping but are now stuck in India as the consulates deferred all appointments by at least six months. Nalin Haley said what the average H-1B haters are saying: Indians can't be 'standed' in India. Nalin Haley also said that the Indian government took up the issue with the US government because 'they want their remittance money'.""Delaying visas is good but not good enough. We need a complete H-1B visa ban,"" Nalin Haley said.Haley is known for his anti-H-1B stance as he said his college friends are not getting jobs in this economy and hence America should stop giving jobs to foreigners.Hundreds of H-1B visa holders flew to India to get their visa stamping done as the administration made it mandatory to get the stamping now in the country of origin. After they reached India for their scheduled visa appointments in January, they were told that their appointment dates had been rescheduled to 2026, starting from March-April. This leaves a chunk of H-1B workers at a lurch, as now they can't enter the US without a new stamping and are also uncertain as to whether they would be allowed to work from India.Many Indians with valid H-1B visa traveled to India for holidays only to find out that their visas had been revoked. They have been told that they won't be able to enter the US without a new stamp. Given the present situation, it may take at least six months in India. From December 15, H-1B and H-4 (H-1B dependent) applicants have been subject to social media vetting.Despite many MAGA activists calling for H-1B ban, the administration is overhauling the system and proposed a wage-based selection instead of random H-1B lottery. In the proposed wage-based selection, higher wage will get higher priorities.","Hundreds of H-1B visa holders flew to India to get their visa stamping done as the administration made it mandatory to get the stamping now in the country of origin.

First election since 2021 coup: Myanmar is voting after 5 years amid civil war — why stakes are high,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/first-election-since-2021-coup-myanmar-is-voting-after-5-years-amid-civil-war-why-stakes-are-high/articleshow/126212479.cms,"Myanmar Heads to Polls After Five Years as Rights Groups Slam Military-Run Process

A vote held amid war and fragmentation



Who is running — and who is missing



How the system favours the military



Repression, restrictions and a climate of fear



Why the election still matters







Myanmar has begun voting in its first general election since the military seized power in a coup in February 2021, an event the ruling junta presents as a return to democratic order after years of turmoil. Polling started on December 28 in the first of three phases and will run through January, even as a brutal civil war continues across large parts of the country.For the generals, the election is meant to signal stability and provide a pathway out of diplomatic isolation. For critics, including Western governments, the United Nations and rights groups, it is something else entirely: a tightly controlled exercise designed to entrench military power behind a civilian façade. With major parties banned, opposition leaders jailed, and millions unable to vote, the ballot has become one of the most contentious political moments in Myanmar’s modern history.The election is taking place nearly five years after the army, known as the Tatmadaw, overturned the landslide 2020 victory of Aung San Suu Kyi ’s National League for Democracy (NLD), alleging fraud without credible evidence. The coup triggered mass protests, a violent military crackdown, and the emergence of armed resistance groups aligned with ethnic minority militias.The conflict has since displaced more than 3.6 million people and left over 11 million facing food insecurity, according to UN agencies.Against this backdrop, voting is being held only in areas under junta control. The military has acknowledged that elections cannot take place in at least 56 of Myanmar’s 330 townships, many of them in rebel-held regions. Even within townships that are voting, entire constituencies have been cancelled on security grounds, leaving nearly one in five seats in the lower house uncontested.The poll itself is staggered across three dates — 28 December, 11 January and 25 January — a structure critics say allows the authorities to adjust tactics as results come in.On paper, 57 political parties and more than 4,800 candidates are contesting the elections. In reality, the field is heavily skewed. Only six parties have been allowed to compete nationwide under tightened registration rules. The largest and most dominant is the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), which is effectively running unchallenged in dozens of constituencies.The absence of Aung San Suu Kyi and her party looms over the process. The NLD, which won around 90 per cent of parliamentary seats in 2020, was dissolved after refusing to re-register under rules imposed by a junta-appointed election commission. Suu Kyi herself remains in military detention, serving a 27-year sentence on charges widely described by rights groups as politically motivated.According to the Asian Network for Free Elections (ANFREL), parties that collectively won more than 70 per cent of votes and 90 per cent of seats in the last election will not appear on the ballot this time. More than 22,000 political prisoners remain behind bars, further hollowing out any sense of political competition.Even if the election were competitive, Myanmar’s political system is designed to preserve military dominance. Under the army-drafted 2008 constitution, 25 per cent of parliamentary seats are reserved for serving officers, giving the military an effective veto over constitutional change.Seats are allocated using a mix of first-past-the-post and proportional representation, a system election monitors say favours large, well-resourced parties like the USDP. New electronic voting machines, introduced for the first time, do not allow write-in candidates or spoiled ballots, limiting voter choice further.Once parliament is formed, the president is chosen indirectly. Lawmakers from the lower house, upper house and the military bloc each nominate a vice-president, with the full assembly then selecting the president from among the three. The structure all but guarantees that the armed forces will retain decisive influence regardless of the outcome.The run-up to the vote has been marked by widespread repression. The Union Election Commission overseeing the polls is staffed by junta appointees, including its chairman Than Soe, who is under EU sanctions for undermining democracy. Independent election observation is minimal, with most Western governments refusing to send monitors.A new Election Protection Law has criminalised protest, criticism or alleged “disruption” of the poll, carrying penalties of up to ten years in prison, and in some cases the death penalty. More than 200 people have been charged under the law, including artists, filmmakers and social media users accused of opposing the elections. Even private online messages have been used as evidence.Social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram have remained blocked since the coup, sharply curtailing political debate. Campaigning has been muted, with none of the mass rallies that once defined Myanmar’s elections.Despite the restrictions, the election carries real consequences. For the junta, it is a bid to rebrand military rule as a quasi-civilian government and persuade regional neighbours to re-engage. China, Myanmar’s most powerful ally, has backed the vote, viewing it as a potential route to stability and protection for its strategic infrastructure projects. Russia and, more cautiously, India have also signalled acceptance.Western governments have taken a different view. The UK, the European Parliament and the UN have dismissed the poll as lacking legitimacy. UN human rights chief Volker Türk has warned that the elections are taking place in an environment of “violence and repression”, with no conditions for free expression or assembly.Inside Myanmar, reactions are mixed. Some voters, exhausted by years of war and economic collapse, see the election as offering at least the promise of order. Others reject it outright as a dangerous illusion. As one resistance fighter put it, holding elections now is like “injecting steroids into a patient” — easing pain briefly while worsening the disease.","Myanmar has begun voting in its first general election since the military seized power in a coup in February 2021.

"Saudi Arabia leads GCC in Indian deportations: Over 13,000 workers sent home in 2025",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-leads-gcc-in-indian-deportations-over-13000-workers-sent-home-in-2025/articleshow/126202625.cms,"Saudi Arabia deported about 11,000 Indian workers in one year, mostly low-skilled labourers employed in construction, domestic work, and caregiving.

Why Saudi Arabia dominates the numbers

The compliance challenge

Recruitment practices and India’s response





Saudi Arabia emerged as the single largest source of Indian deportations in the Gulf in 2025, overtaking even the United States, according to the figures tabled by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in the Rajya Sabha. The data shows that more than 24,600 Indians were deported globally in 2025, spanning 81 countries, with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations accounting for a substantial share of removals.Among GCC countries, Saudi Arabia alone accounted for 10,884 deportations in 2025, out of a regional total of 13,133, followed by the UAE (1,469), Bahrain (764), and Oman (16). Figures for Kuwait and Qatar were not listed in the MEA’s Annexure-I for the year. The same annexure shows that between 2021 and 2025, total Indian deportations from GCC countries reached 56,460, with Saudi Arabia accounting for 49,084 across its Riyadh and Jeddah missions, again far outstripping the UAE (3,979), Bahrain (3,202) and Oman (195).Saudi Arabia hosts one of the largest concentrations of Indian blue-collar workers in the Gulf, particularly in construction, domestic work, caregiving and other labour-intensive sectors.This is closely linked to the Kingdom’s aggressive build-out under Vision 2030, with mega-projects such as NEOM, Qiddiya, the Red Sea Project and Diriyah Gate driving sustained demand for foreign labour across infrastructure, housing and services.MEA data shows that Indian blue-collar workers are present across 14 countries, accounting for about 1.6 million people between January 2020 and June 2025, with the Gulf as the core destination. Among these, Saudi Arabia has the highest number of Indian workers, estimated at 695,269, followed by the UAE (341,365), Kuwait (201,959), Qatar (153,501) and Oman (116,840).Employers and officials say recruitment accelerated sharply after the pandemic, particularly in 2022 and 2023, when labour demand rebounded alongside stalled projects restarting. In 2023 alone, 398,000 workers were sent abroad, with Saudi Arabia employing 200,713 labourers that year and a further 167,598 in 2024. The scale of this intake, experts note, also increases exposure to regulatory enforcement, especially as the Kingdom tightens compliance checks around visas, permits and residency status.That pace continued into 2025. Between January and June, Saudi Arabia recruited 71,175 Indian workers, while the UAE hired 96,401, the highest among Gulf states in that period. Experts note that at such volumes, even limited instances of visa or permit non-compliance can translate into large absolute numbers of deportations once enforcement tightens.As recruitment volumes expanded across the Gulf, enforcement followed. Authorities across the region tightened scrutiny of migrant workers, with overstays, visa violations and work-permit issues emerging as the primary triggers for deportation. Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain together accounted for thousands of removals as monitoring increased in step with large-scale labour intake and more systematic compliance checks.Bheema Reddy, vice-chairman of Telangana’s NRI advisory committee, said the scale of migration itself often increases exposure to enforcement action. Speaking to TOI, he said: “Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia attract a huge influx of Indian workers, many of whom are low-skilled and come through agents. In the pursuit of better earnings, minor violations of local laws can quickly escalate into deportation cases. ”After Saudi Arabia, the UAE recorded the second-highest number of Indian deportations in the GCC in 2025, with 1,469 nationals sent home, followed by 764 from Bahrain. As in Saudi Arabia, common causes included overstaying visas, working without valid permits, absconding from employers, or breaching labour regulations.Officials say enforcement has become increasingly systematic, with closer monitoring of visa timelines, employer records and residency compliance. “Indian workers must track their visa timelines carefully and understand local laws,” Naga Bharani of the Telangana Overseas Manpower Company told TOI, adding that “simple awareness and timely extensions can prevent deportation.”A recurring theme across GCC deportations is the role of recruitment agents in India. Misrepresentation of job roles, salaries or visa categories often leaves workers exposed abroad, sometimes without a clear understanding of host-country labour laws.Reddy told TOI that misleading recruitment practices remain a recurring problem. “Many cases arise from workers being lured by promises of better pay or conditions, only to face legal consequences when regulations are breached,” he said, adding that “education before departure is crucial.”The Government of India has repeatedly stressed that only legal migration routes should be used. Overseas recruitment is regulated under the Emigration Act, 1983, and since 2015, emigration to Emigration Check Required (ECR) countries has been processed through the eMigrate portal, a digital system for registering recruitment agencies and issuing emigration clearance.The MEA has also rolled out schemes such as the Pravasi Bharatiya Bima Yojana (PBBY), Pre-Departure Orientation and Training (PDOT), and the ‘Surakshit Jayen, Prashikshit Jayen’ campaign to improve awareness and reduce vulnerability among migrant workers. India has additionally signed Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreements with six countries, including the UK, France and Germany, and Labour Mobility Agreements with 12 countries, including several GCC states.Despite these recent measures, the latest figures underline the persistent scale of the challenge. With Saudi Arabia continuing to dominate both Indian labour inflows and deportations overall, experts say stricter robust compliance, better recruitment oversight and stronger pre-departure awareness will be critical to safely reversing the trend.","Saudi Arabia deported about 11,000 Indian workers in one year, mostly low- skilled labourers employed in construction, domestic work, and caregiving.

Optimism tempered by war on the ground





US President Donald Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, even as Russia intensified its attacks on Kyiv. Both leaders struck an optimistic tone, repeatedly suggesting that a peace deal was closer than at any previous point, yet they also acknowledged that several issues particularly territory, security guarantees and the future of occupied infrastructure remain unresolved.“I think we’re getting a lot closer, maybe very close,” Trump said after the meeting. Zelenskyy, thanking Trump for a “great meeting”, said Ukraine was “ready for peace” and that talks had yielded “significant results”, even if final decisions were still pending.The talks came just hours after the 47th POTUS held a lengthy phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin , and against the backdrop of fresh Russian missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities.Zelenskyy’s visit followed what Trump described as an “excellent” phone call with Putin earlier the same day. The Kremlin later said the call was “friendly, benevolent and businesslike”, adding that Trump and Putin agreed to speak again promptly after Trump’s talks with the Ukrainian leader.Trump insisted Putin still wants peace, despite Russia launching new attacks on Ukraine as Zelenskyy travelled to the US.“Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,” Trump said, adding that Putin had been “very generous in his feelings toward Ukraine succeeding”.That framing has alarmed some of Ukraine’s supporters, who note a pattern in which Trump speaks to Putin before meeting Zelenskyy. However, unlike previous encounters, this sequence did not lead to an openly tense exchange between the US and Ukrainian presidents.At the centre of the talks was a revised 20-point peace framework that US and Ukrainian teams have been refining for weeks. Zelenskyy said the plan was “90% agreed”, while Trump said he did not like using percentages but suggested the deal was nearly complete.“We discussed all aspects of the peace framework,” Zelenskyy later wrote. “We agreed that security guarantees are a key milestone in achieving lasting peace.”The two sides also agreed that their teams would meet again as early as next week to finalise remaining details, and that Trump would host Ukrainian and European leaders in Washington in January.Both leaders acknowledged that the fate of the eastern Donbas region remains unresolved. Trump described it as “a very tough issue”, though he said it was getting closer to resolution. Zelenskyy was blunt about the divide. “Our attitude is very clear,” he said, adding that Ukraine and Russia hold fundamentally different positions.Trump suggested that making territorial concessions sooner rather than later could be pragmatic. “Some of that land has been taken,” he said. “And are you better off making a deal now?”Zelenskyy has shown new flexibility, saying any territorial settlement would require either a referendum or parliamentary approval, but only after a ceasefire, something Moscow has so far rejected.Security guarantees emerged as the clearest area of convergence. Zelenskyy said US-Ukraine security guarantees were “100% agreed”, calling them essential to preventing future Russian aggression. Trump was more cautious, saying the talks were about “95% done” and stressing that European countries would need to shoulder much of the responsibility with US backing.During recent negotiations, Washington has floated Nato-like guarantees for Ukraine, even as Zelenskyy signalled he could drop Kyiv’s bid to formally join the alliance if equivalent protections were provided. Russia, however, has repeatedly rejected any Nato role and warned it would view allied troops as legitimate targets.Another unresolved issue is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, which has been under Russian control since early in the war. Trump said the plant was discussed “at length” and suggested Putin was open to cooperation. “President Putin is actually working with Ukraine on getting it open,” he said.Under US proposals, the plant could be jointly run by the US, Russia and Ukraine, with shared profits. Zelenskyy is known to oppose any Russian commercial role, making this a potential flashpoint as talks continue.After their meeting, Trump and Zelenskyy spoke jointly by phone with a broad group of European leaders, including European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Poland and Finland.Von der Leyen later said progress was “good” but stressed that “ironclad security guarantees from day one” would be essential. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office said leaders underlined the urgency of ending the war and commended Trump for driving talks forward.Trump repeatedly warned that negotiations could still collapse. “In a few weeks, we will know one way or the other,” he said. “It’s possible it doesn’t happen.”The US president, who once claimed he could end the war in a day, now openly acknowledges its complexity. “This is not a one-day process deal,” he said. “This is very complicated stuff.”Even as diplomacy intensifies, fighting continues. Russia launched major attacks on Kyiv and other regions ahead of the talks, knocking out power and heating for hundreds of thousands. Ukrainian officials described the strikes as evidence of Moscow’s true intentions.Still, both Trump and Zelenskyy emerged keen to project momentum. “I do think we’re getting a lot closer,” Trump said. Zelenskyy echoed that sentiment, thanking Trump and his team and reiterating: “Ukraine is ready for peace.”","US President Donald Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

Why Karoline Leavitt’s pregnancy is so rare in American – and world politics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-karoline-leavitts-pregnancy-is-so-rare-in-american-and-world-politics/articleshow/126221992.cms,"Trump’s Off-Script Remark About Karoline Leavitt's 'Lips That Don't Stop' Ignites Backlash, Internet Reacts





Karoline Leavitt announced on Friday that she was expecting a baby girl in May. She did so quietly, with an Instagram post showing her standing beside a Christmas tree, writing that she and her husband were excited to grow their family and to see their son become a big brother. She is 28, already the youngest White House press secretary in history, and already the mother of a one-year-old boy born last July while she was working on Donald Trump’s campaign.There was nothing dramatic about the announcement. And that is precisely why it stood out.The reaction that followed revealed how unusual it still is to see pregnancy openly intersect with political power. Meghan McCain captured that tension when she wrote that she had spent much of her twenties and thirties being warned that having children would damage her career. To see America’s first pregnant White House press secretary, she said, was “very, very, very cool”. The praise carried an implicit confession. That ambition and motherhood are still widely understood as trade-offs in public life.Pregnancy is one of the most common experiences in human history. Political pregnancy is not. When a senior political figure announces she is expecting, the news still registers as an anomaly.Not because pregnancy itself is rare, but because politics has long been structured around the assumption that such realities belong outside the corridors of power.The White House has said Leavitt will remain press secretary after the birth of her second child, though it has not clarified whether she will take leave. She has spoken about relying on her husband’s support and about how motherhood has given her perspective inside a relentlessly demanding profession. These are not unusual sentiments. They sound unusual only because they are rarely heard from someone standing behind a White House podium.The broader context explains why this moment feels exceptional. The United States has never had a female president. It has never had a president who was pregnant in office or raising very young children while holding the job. Even as women have entered Congress in greater numbers, many have done so later in life, often after their childbearing years. This is not a coincidence of timing. It is the result of political systems that reward uninterrupted availability and penalise bodies that require pause, recovery, or flexibility.Globally, the pattern has been remarkably consistent. Margaret Thatcher governed Britain during war and economic upheaval, but she did so long after her children were grown. Angela Merkel led Germany for sixteen years without motherhood ever intersecting with her time in office. Indira Gandhi and Golda Meir exercised immense authority at stages of life when pregnancy was no longer part of the public conversation. Their power was unquestioned, but it was exercised in bodies that fit comfortably within institutions designed around male life cycles.When pregnancy has appeared in high office, it has tended to do so as an exception that proves the rule. Benazir Bhutto governed Pakistan while pregnant in the late 1980s, becoming the first elected head of government in modern history known to do so. Her pregnancy drew scrutiny not because it impeded governance, but because it disrupted expectations.More recently, Jacinda Ardern gave birth while serving as Prime Minister of New Zealand in 2018. She took maternity leave, returned to office, and continued governing without drama. The significance of the moment lay not in what changed, but in what did not. The state did not wobble. Authority did not diminish.In legislatures, similar moments have been rare and revealing. In the United States, Tammy Duckworth became the first sitting senator to give birth in 2018, forcing rule changes so she could bring her infant onto the Senate floor. In the UK, MPs such as Stella Creasy pushed Parliament to introduce proxy voting after becoming pregnant in office. In Australia, Larissa Waters made history by breastfeeding her infant in the Senate chamber, exposing how slowly institutions adapt to realities millions of citizens navigate daily.These episodes are remembered precisely because they are so few.The question has never been whether women can govern while pregnant or raising young children. The historical record answers that clearly. The issue is that political systems still assume a version of leadership built around uninterrupted presence and physical neutrality, as though authority depends on pretending the body does not exist.Leavitt’s pregnancy does not dismantle that architecture, and it does not pretend to. What it does is insert an ordinary human fact into a role that has long been insulated from it. She is a senior White House official. She is raising a toddler. She is expecting another child. None of this is radical. It only feels that way because politics has been slow to reflect the lives it claims to represent.That is where the poignancy lies. Giving birth is universal. Being visibly pregnant in positions of power remains rare. Each time it happens, it exposes how narrow the path into leadership has been, and how often adaptation is treated as an exception rather than a baseline.Leavitt’s announcement does not resolve that tension. It simply makes it visible again, without spectacle, without apology, and without pretending that motherhood and political ambition belong to different worlds.",Karoline Leavitt announced on Friday that she was expecting a baby girl in May. The reaction that followed revealed how unusual it still is to see pregnancy openly intersect with political power.

It wasn’t the policy that needed cooling off—it was the post.

Sheriff Gordon Smith of Florida, who lobbied for the reclassification and attended the meeting, recalled that after Trump abruptly sided with the pro-cannabis group he “started preparing a Truth Social post on his decision.”“They had to stop him from posting,” Smith said. “I was in awe of the whole thing.” One attendee was “in awe of the president’s eagerness to post about a decision he’d made only seconds earlier.”The effort to downgrade cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III was spearheaded by Trump ally Howard Kessler and Kim Rivers, chief executive of Trulieve. Rivers made sizable donations last year to groups backing Trump’s campaign, hoping to persuade him of the benefits of rescheduling marijuana, particularly for medical research.Lawyers and staff then pointed out that a 30-day review period was required before any formal announcement. Trump subsequently asked aides to draft an executive order, which he signed on Dec. 18.","Top MAGA officials stopped President Donald Trump from immediately broadcasting his marijuana reclassification decision on Truth Social.

After a tense first meeting in the Oval Office, the atmosphere was noticeably lighter during Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s latest meeting with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, where the US President shared a humorous exchange with reporters as dignitaries gathered for lunch.In a moment captured on video, Trump jokingly ordered the Mar-a-Lago kitchen to serve lunch to members of the press, referring to them as “fake news.”""Would you like food? Or do you consider that a BRIBE? And therefore you can't write honestly? Or write a bad story?"" Trump said.He then asked them to speak up whether they wanted the food or not, upon which one of them said ""Yes.""""Margot, take them outside. Tell the chef serve them a little lunch. Okay?

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz faced growing criticism recently after a viral online video raised questions about taxpayer dollars flowing to a Minneapolis daycare centre that appeared inactive despite receiving about $4 million in state funding.The footage, released by independent journalist Nick Shirley, shows him visiting the Quality Learning Center in south Minneapolis. Shirley notes that the facility, which is licensed for 99 children and has received roughly $4 million in state funding, displayed a sign that misspelled “learning” as “learing.”When he approached the building on a weekday, no children were visible, the office appeared closed, and a woman at the site loudly protested, incorrectly accusing him of being with immigration enforcement.The video quickly spread across social media and drew national attention amid a wider scandal involving alleged fraud in Minnesota’s social service programmes, which federal officials say may have cost taxpayers billions of dollars. Critics argue that problems ranging from daycare funding to other public assistance programmes have gone unchecked by state leadership.Republican lawmakers and conservative commentators have seized on the video to call for accountability from Walz.Minnesota Representative Tom Emmer shared the footage on social media, questioning how millions in taxpayer funds could go to a centre that appears empty and misspells its own name.Other critics, including Representative Mike Lawler and political figures such as Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance, have used the controversy to press for investigations and even hearings in Congress.Musk said, ""Why did they still receive funding and keep their license after so many violations and Zoolander-level-obvious fraud? Prosecute @GovTimWalz. He knew""Vance said, ""What's happening in Minnesota is a microcosm of the immigriation fraud in our system. Politicans like it because they get power. Welfare cheats like it because they get rich. But it's a zero sum game, and they're stealing both money and political power from Minnesotans.""Some analysts and officials have also linked the daycare funding concerns to broader debates over immigration and fraud, noting that many of the entities involved are connected to immigrant communities. However, there is no indication that the Quality Learning Center itself has been charged with wrongdoing, KOMO news reported.","Minnesota Governor Tim Walz faced growing criticism after a viral online video raised questions about taxpayer dollars flowing to a Minneapolis daycare centre.

Is moving to Germany safer than US?

Amid the ongoing uncertainty over the H-1B visa situation, a Redditor sought advice on whether moving to Germany would be a better option than the US as the person has the option of moving to Germany from the current company. The Redditor shared that they were selected in the H-1B 2025 lottery and the petition was filed under regular processing on June 20. Since then, the status has remained ""being processed"" with no updates.""In previous years, I’ve seen colleagues complete their H-1B stamping and travel by December or January, so this already feels like a significant delay. On top of that, I’m now seeing reports that many people who had H-1B interview appointments scheduled for January 2026 are being automatically rescheduled to April 2027, which is an extremely long wait,"" the Redditor said.The Redditor expressed concern that even if the petition gets approved early January 2026, getting an interview slot in the consular offices seems to be a long wait. Scheduled appointments of December have been pushed to the middle of next year as the State Department started social media vetting of all H-1B requests.""Given this situation, even if my petition is approved by December 2025 or January 2026, how soon can I realistically expect to get an interview slot? Is it likely that interview availability will really be pushed out to 2027, or are there chances of earlier slots opening up? In other words, do I truly need to wait that long just for visa stamping?"" the Redditor asked.""Separately, I also have a job offer in Germany from my current company. Considering the growing uncertainty, processing delays, and visa interview backlogs associated with the H-1B process, would it be advisable to pursue the Germany option instead?"" the Redditor added.The post garnered several replies with many people pointing out that Germany will have its own money problem, as taxes are higher and salaries are lower. Some advised the Redditor to stay in their own country.Since December 8, US consulates, especially those in India, have begun mass rescheduling of H-1B and H-4 visa appointments. New dates are in 2026 forcing the applicants to wait in India for six to nine months as many H-1B visa holders came to India to attend those stamping interviews only to be informed that now their interviews will be held in March-April.India has taken up the visa delay issue with the US, India's external affairs ministry said. ""There are several people who have been stranded for extended periods of time because of scheduling or rescheduling of consular appointments, and these have also caused a lot of hardships to their families,"" Randhir Jaiswal, the MEA spokesperson, said.","A Redditor sought advice on whether moving to Germany would be a better option than the US.

'Truly repulsive': Tucker Carlson's son Buckley hits back at Ben Shapiro for moving abroad comment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/truly-repulsive-tucker-carlsons-son-buckley-hits-back-at-ben-shapiro-for-moving-abroad-comment/articleshow/126218452.cms,"Ben Shapiro and Tucker Carlson's feud







American commentator and host Tucker Carlson's son is standing firmly behind his father in support as the war between him and Ben Shapiro fires up. Buckley Carlson, 28, who has worked as Deputy Press Secretary in J.D. Vance's office since January 2025 took to X, to respond to political commentator Ben Shapiro's comment.""Hard to fathom this is the ""man"" that presumes to lecture - endlessly, angrily - the ""acceptable"" parameters of the ""conservative movement"". AND, specifically to young Americans unable to survive the economy he and his friends designed and still advocate. Truly repulsive,"" wrote Carlson in the post, referencing Shapiro's recent controversial podcast clip.In the clip, taken from the 41-year-old's appearance on the Triggernometry podcast, Shapiro suggested that Americans who cannot afford to live in the US should consider moving to another country. “If you’re a young person and you can’t afford to live here, then maybe you should not live here,” he said in the podcast, adding that people should move elsewhere for better opportunities.Shapiro and Carlson have been at loggerheads since the former Fox News host invited white nationalist Nick Fuentes for a softball interview on his podcast, The Tucker Carlson Show.Following the interview, Shapiro dedicated an entire episode of his show The Ben Shapiro Show to criticising Carlson, dubbing him an “intellectual coward,” a “dishonest interlocutor,” and a “terrible friend.”“Since his exit from Fox News in 2023, when, of course, he was a very, very popular host, Tucker Carlson has turned himself into a conspiracist and a crank and a pathological liar,” he said about Carlson.The two took their feud to the stage at Turning Point USA's first AmericaFest conference following the death of Charlie Kirk. Shapiro attacked Carlson, noting that Kirk ""despised"" the ""evil troll"" Fuentes whom the host interviewed.In response, Carlson opened his speech by joking that he “missed the first part of the program” when Shapiro was speaking and adding that he hopes he “didn’t miss anything meaningful.”As for Buckley Carlson, he has been working in Vance's office since January 2025. Previously, the 2019 University of Virginia graduate was the communications director for then Rep. Jim Banks who described him as ""one of the smartest, most trustworthy and loyal staffers I’ve ever had,"" in an X post. Before joining Vance's team, he served as the Indiana Republicans' deputy chief of staff.","Buckley Carlson, 28, has worked as Deputy Press Secretary in J.D. Vance's office since January 2025.

It comes against the backdrop of renewed Russian attacks on Ukraine, including heavy damage in Kyiv from large-scale missile and drone strikes.Ukrainian president's spokesperson confirmed that Trump and Zelenskyy will call European leaders after meeting in Florida.On Saturday, Zelenskyy said on X that Russia used ""almost 500 drones and 40 missiles"" in its latest assault. He also wrote on Telegram, ""Russia continues to mock our cities and people.Moscow has rejected even the proposals for a Christmas ceasefire and is increasing the ferocity of its missile and drone strikes.

Barron Trump’s Secret Passion EXPOSED: Eric Reveals What REALLY Stopped Him | WATCH





Barron Trump has been spotted in public weeks after renewed scrutiny over his reported associations with figures linked to the online manosphere. The 19-year-old appeared at a Christmas Day gathering at Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach resort owned by his father, Donald Trump , marking a rare public sighting following a period of relative absence.Barron was seen in the background of videos shared by guests attending the festive dinner, seated with family members and interacting casually with attendees. In one clip, he appeared alongside his father as they entered a courtyard area of the resort, where guests stood and applauded. Other footage showed him laughing and talking at the table, including moments with relatives.The appearance follows a New York Times report earlier this month that detailed Barron’s friendship with James Waller, an influencer who has publicly aligned himself with Andrew Tate and Tristan Tate. Waller has described himself as a frequent visitor to Mar-a-Lago and claimed he advises Barron on personal matters, including dating. He also said the two had spoken with Andrew Tate during a video call.The Tate brothers are facing multiple investigations in Romania, the UK and the US, including allegations of human trafficking and sexual assault, which they deny. Andrew Tate, in particular, has become a prominent and polarising figure online, associated with misogynistic messaging that has drawn widespread criticism.Videos from the Mar-a-Lago event were reportedly shared by social media influencers in attendance, including models who posted clips of the celebration on Instagram. Captions focused on the holiday atmosphere, with no direct reference to the recent controversy surrounding Barron.The article also situates Barron’s appearance within a broader web of connections between the Trump orbit and figures linked to the Tate brothers. Former advisers and lawyers associated with the Tates have held or been nominated for roles connected to Trump’s administration, though Trump himself has denied knowledge of or involvement in efforts to assist the influencers with their legal or travel issues.Barron, who is currently in his second year at New York University, has largely stayed out of the public eye since beginning his university studies. He reportedly completed his first year while commuting from Trump Tower in Manhattan and is now said to be studying at NYU’s Washington DC campus. His mother, Melania Trump, is reported to be closely protective of his privacy.","The 19-year-old appeared at a Christmas Day gathering at Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach resort owned by his father, Donald Trump.

The Indian-American community raised the issue of growing online hatred against India and Indians and sought answers from Elon Musk's X as to why such hate comments are being allowed on the platform. American journalist Matt Forney recently called for violence against Indians and Indian places of worship -- veiled as a prediction-- and deleted the post. Now, social media commentators, apparently from the US, are attacking Vivek Ramaswamy 's children because of the GOP leader's Indian origin as a massive movement against Ramaswamy is taking place inside MAGA.A post with photos of Vivek Ramaswamy's children went viral with the Indian-hating commentator saying that Ramaswamy who bashes American children is miserable in raising his own children who have 'awful facial expressions'. ""They are feral,"" the disrespectful post said.Matt Forney chimed in with his filthy post, where he said Vivek Ramaswamy probably threatens his children that he would smack them like a ""brown parent"".While Ramaswamy is facing strong resistance from inside the MAGA for his upcoming Governor election, many commentators called out the targeting of his children. But haters, provoked by Nick Fuentes, are crossing all limits now.Indian-origin techie Jitin Pillai reacted to the attack on Ramaswamy's children and said there is no coming back from this level of low. He said the Indian community does not even have as much presence or influence in the US as it is made out to be. But this level of hatred was unthinkable a year ago, he said.""I know the natural instinct of many Indian Americans is to dismiss this outright, and at times even refuse to acknowledge this rising hatred under the garb of some freedom of expression. I hope this cohort is able to see the slope vs intercept. If there is a time for course correction, it’s now. Democrats will not always be your friends,"" Pillai said.Neither Ramaswamy nor his campaign commented on the targeting of his children yet.","Indian-American community raised the issue of growing online hatred against India and Indians.

'Not Aware Of Acts': Thailand Slams Trump Claim Cambodia Conflict As Bangkok Vows Retaliation





US President Donald Trump on Sunday took a pointed jibe at the United Nations , saying the global organisation “must start getting active and involved in world peace,” implicitly criticizing it for being largely ineffective, including in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.Trump made the remarks while highlighting the United States’ role in facilitating a ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia, claiming that the US has effectively acted as the “REAL United Nations.” In a Truth Social post, he congratulated both nations’ leaders for reaching a “rapid and very fair conclusion,” describing the resolution as “FAST & DECISIVE, as all of these situations should be.”In his Truth Social post , Trump wrote, ""I am pleased to announce that the breakout fighting between Thailand and Cambodia will stop momentarily, and they will go back to living in PEACE, as per our recently agreed to original Treaty. I want to congratulate both great leaders on their brilliance in coming to this rapid and very fair conclusion. It was FAST & DECISIVE, as all of these situations should be! The United States of America, as always, was proud to help! With all of the wars and conflicts I have settled and stopped over the last eleven months, EIGHT, perhaps the United States has become the REAL United Nations, which has been of very little assistance or help in any of them, including the disaster currently going on between Russia and Ukraine.The United Nations must start getting active and involved in WORLD PEACE!""Trump’s remarks come after top diplomats from Thailand and Cambodia began two days of talks in China on Sunday, following a ceasefire signed on Saturday to halt weeks of fighting along the contested border that killed more than 100 people and displaced nearly one million.According to the news agency AP, Thai foreign minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow and Cambodian foreign minister Prak Sokhonn met in China’s Yunnan province, with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi mediating. The talks aim to ensure a sustained ceasefire and promote lasting peace. The agreement freezes front lines and allows displaced civilians to return home. A 72-hour observation period follows, after which Thailand will repatriate 18 Cambodian soldiers it has held since July—a key demand of Cambodia.An earlier July ceasefire brokered by Malaysia, under pressure from Trump, had temporarily eased tensions, but Thailand and Cambodia continued a bitter propaganda war, with minor cross-border clashes escalating into heavy fighting earlier this month.","US President Donald Trump on Sunday took a pointed jibe at the United Nations.

Operation Sindoor

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May, a remark that underscored India’s prowess to strike deep into mainland Pakistan.According to Zardari, the advice came from his military secretary, though he claimed he refused to take shelter.“I had actually told him (secretary) four days earlier that a war was going to happen. But he came to me and said, ‘Sir, let’s go to the bunkers.’ I replied, ‘If martyrdom is to come, it will come here. Leaders don’t die in bunkers; they die on the battlefield. They don’t die sitting in bunkers,’” Zardari said on Saturday at a rally marking the death anniversary of his wife and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in 2007.He added that every worker of his Pakistan Peoples Party was ready to sacrifice his life for the nation.Zardari also responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “roti khao, varna meri goli toh hai hi” (eat your food peacefully, or else my bullet is waiting for you) warning to Pakistan, saying that it would be Pakistan that would fire the bullets.He further remarked that India may have an economy 10 times larger than Pakistan’s, but questioned where it would find the “courage” to fight a war.Indian armed forces launched Operation Sindoor on the intervening night of May 6–7 in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians. The strikes targeted nine terror facilities in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Pakistan responded to the operation, triggering further retaliation by Indian forces, which subsequently struck around a dozen Pakistani air force bases.On May 10, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart seeking a ceasefire, which was accepted.India has consistently maintained that Operation Sindoor has only been “halted” and would be resumed in the future if required.","Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

Former Imran Khan aide Shahzad Akbar attacked in UK





Pakistan on Friday summoned Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell after a video circulated online showing a woman at a rally in the UK referring to a possible attack on Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir The ministry of foreign affairs called in Cannell to lodge a formal protest and demanded an investigation after the woman, speaking at a rally in Bradford in northern England, mentioned the possibility of the army chief being killed in a car bombing. Pakistani officials said the remarks went beyond political expression and raised serious security concerns.The rally was held in support of Pakistan’s jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan and was attended by his supporters living in the UK. Khan was removed from office through a no-confidence vote in April 2022 and has been in prison for nearly two years.The Bradford protest came days after a special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency sentenced Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to 17 years in prison each in the Toshakhana-II corruption case.According to Dawn, the court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million on each of them, with additional jail time possible in case of non-payment. The case relates to the alleged illegal retention and sale of state gifts received while Khan was in office.The video from the Bradford rally was initially shared on X by the UK chapter of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party before being deleted.Explaining the decision, PTI UK said in a post on X: “We have removed a video from the recent Bradford protest featuring a citizen’s metaphorical remarks regarding General Asim Munir. Although we do not believe the individual incited violence, the post was deleted in an abundance of caution to prevent potential misunderstanding and legal safeguarding of the individual and her rights.”Pakistan’s deputy interior minister Talal Chaudhry said the remarks crossed a red line. Speaking to Geo Television, he said: “While Imran Khan’s party has been inciting supporters against the military, the car bomb threat at the Bradford rally crossed all limits. It does not fall into the category of freedom of speech.”He urged the UK government to investigate the incident and take legal action if laws were violated.Responding to Pakistan’s concerns, the UK High Commission in Islamabad said in a brief statement: “Where a foreign Government believes a crime has been committed, they should provide all relevant material to their UK police liaison. Any material that appears to break UK law will be reviewed by the police and may lead to a criminal investigation.”The diplomatic move comes amid escalating tensions between Khan’s supporters and Pakistan’s powerful military. Earlier this month, army spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry described Khan as “mentally ill” during a press conference, after posts on Khan’s official X account referred to General Munir as “mentally unstable,” according to the Associated Press.Separately, tensions escalated further after PTI said Shahzad Akbar, a former adviser to Imran Khan was attacked in the United Kingdom on Thursday.In a post on X, Akbar said he was assaulted outside his home in Cambridge by an unidentified man.“Yesterday at approximately 8:08 a.m., I was attacked at my home by an unknown assailant dressed in what appeared to be construction or waste-collection attire,” Akbar wrote. “The individual asked, ‘Are you Shahzad Akbar?’ and immediately began assaulting me. The incident occurred in the presence of my family.”Akbar said he sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose, and was taken to a local hospital before being discharged.“The police have taken cognizance of the matter and have assured me and my family that they are actively investigating this targeted attack and will work to apprehend both the perpetrator and those behind it,” he said.He added that he could not share further details at this stage, including CCTV footage, on the advice of authorities.“I have full faith in the rule of law and in British law enforcement to carry out their duties,” Akbar said, urging the UK government to ensure the safety of dissidents.In a follow-up statement, Akbar said the attack would not silence him.“I want to make one thing absolutely clear: If my views, political comments, or even my ‘face’ is not liked by anyone, such cowardly acts will only strengthen my resolve rather than silence me,” he wrote. “Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out.”The Pakistan government has previously submitted extradition documents to British authorities seeking Akbar’s return. Akbar, a PTI member, has been accused by the state of anti-government activities.",Pakistan summons Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell.

'Just a junta with nuclear weapons': When Bush and Putin discussed Pakistan in 2005; what declassified NSA documents show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/just-a-junta-with-nuclear-weapons-when-bush-and-putin-discussed-pakistan-in-2005-what-declassified-nsa-documents-show/articleshow/126187276.cms,"Putin Called Pakistan A Junta With Nukes As Bush Feared Nuclear Leaks To Iran, Reveal Transcripts





NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s nuclear proliferation programme triggered deep concern at the highest levels of the United States and Russia, with both countries expressing that Islamabad’s nuclear activities made them “nervous”, according to newly declassified documents released by the US National Security Archive.The documents, made public this week following a Freedom of Information lawsuit, include verbatim transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin between 2001 and 2008. They reveal repeated discussions on Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal, links to Iran’s nuclear programme, and the role of the AQ Khan proliferation network.In a key Oval Office meeting in 2005, Putin raised concerns over evidence suggesting Pakistani-origin uranium had been found in Iranian centrifuges, questioning Western tolerance of Islamabad despite its proliferation record.“But it's not clear what the labs (Iran) have, where they are. Cooperation with Pakistan still exists,” Putin said during the meeting.Bush responded by referring to his discussions with then Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf, saying, “I talked to Musharraf about that. I told him we're worried about transfers to Iran and North Korea. They put AQ Khan in jail, and some of his buddies under house arrest. We want to know what they said.I keep reminding Musharraf of that. Either he's getting nothing, or he's not being forthcoming.”Putin reiterated his concerns, stating, “As far as I understand, they found uranium of Pakistani origin in the centrifuges.”Bush acknowledged the issue, saying, “Yes, the stuff the Iranians forgot to tell the IAEA about. That's a violation.”“It was of Pakistani origin. That makes me nervous,” Putin said, to which Bush replied, “It makes us nervous, too.”Also read: 'I want Pak': Rajnath recalls Vajpayee's unmatched wit; all about iconic moment The documents also highlight Putin’s blunt assessment of Pakistan during an earlier meeting with Bush in Slovenia in 2001. “I am concerned about Pakistan. It is just a junta with nuclear weapons. It is no democracy, yet the West makes no criticism of it. Should talk about it,” Putin said.According to the transcripts, both leaders expressed anxiety about Pakistan’s internal political instability, its military-led governance under Musharraf, and the risk that sensitive nuclear technology could fall into the wrong hands. The discussions repeatedly returned to the AQ Khan network, which was later confirmed to have supplied nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea, and Libya.The declassified records underscore longstanding international concerns about Pakistan’s nuclear command and control systems and the broader implications of its proliferation activities.The revelations come amid renewed scrutiny of Pakistan’s nuclear conduct. Last month, India criticised Islamabad following remarks by US President Donald Trump alleging that Pakistan had been secretly testing nuclear weapons.Reacting to Trump’s comments, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said such actions were consistent with Pakistan’s history. “Clandestine and illegal nuclear activities are in keeping with Pakistan's history, which is centred around decades of smuggling, export control violations, secret partnerships, AQ Khan network and further proliferation,” he said.“India has always drawn the attention of the international community to these aspects of Pakistan's record,” Jaiswal added."," transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin released by US National Security Archive.

Pak PM Sharif's Party Leader Threatens India, Warns Missiles Will Respond If Bangladesh Is Targeted





In a sharp attack on Pakistan’s security establishment, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations. Speaking at a recent gathering in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the influential Deobandi cleric questioned the logical consistency of Pakistan’s defence policy, specifically contrasting Islamabad’s recent strikes in Afghanistan with its diplomatic outrage over Indian activities within Pakistani borders.He asked Pakistan’s military brass why India’s actions inside Pakistan should be condemned when Islamabad justifies strikes in Afghanistan by calling them attacks on its enemies. Rehman argued that if Pakistan claimed a sovereign right to launch pre-emptive or retaliatory strikes against perceived enemies on Afghan soil, it weakened its moral and legal standing when protesting similar actions by India. “We sent militants to Afghanistan for 20 years. .. from giving them Kalashnikovs to Cruise missiles... we empowered them in every way. When you bombed Kabul, it was as if someone had bombed your Islamabad.This is the limit, isn’t it? If you had bombed the remote areas, you might have been able to tolerate it. So, you took some action there as well...”“...If you say, and I have questions, that we have attacked the enemy’s headquarters and you call this a legitimate statement, India says to you that it has attacked Bahawalpur, it has attacked Muridke, it has attacked the headquarters of those who are operating against us in Kashmir. Why are you objecting to this? And if you object to this, and if you have the same claims against Afghanistan, how will you justify it..?”Rehman’s criticism comes at a time when Pakistan’s Field Marshal Asim Munir continues his anti-India rhetoric and claims that Pakistan received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May which was felt during the days of intense fighting that followed Indian strikes on terror targets.Rehman’s comments touch upon a sensitive nerve in geopolitics, specifically referring to locations like Bahawalpur and Muridke — areas long identified as hubs for terrorist groups like JeM and LeT — which were decimated during Operation Sindoor. By asking, “Why different rules for India?” Rehman highlighted the strategic hypocrisy: justification of “counterterrorism strikes” in the west, while demanding absolute territorial sanctity in the east.",Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations.

The strikes led to intense clashes between the two countries for four days and ended with an understanding to halt military actions on May 10.Meanwhile, Munir warned the Afghan Taliban to choose between Pakistan and the TTP, saying Afghan nationals form the majority of militants infiltrating across the border. “In the TTP formations coming [into Pakistan], 70 per cent are Afghans,” he said. “Is Afghanistan not spilling the blood of our Pakistani children?” He reiterated that Kabul must decide between Pakistan and the TTP.The Field Marshal also said that no one could declare jihad in an Islamic state except the state itself. “No one can issue a fatwa for jihad without the order and permission and will of those vested with the authority,” he said.Munir also drew parallels between Pakistan and the state established by the Prophet 1,400 years ago in the Arab region, now Saudi Arabia.He said that among the world’s 57 Islamic countries, “God gave us the honour of being the protectors of Haramain Sharifain,” referring to Makkah and Madina.Official details of the December 10 address were limited, with selected clips aired later by Pakistani media.","Pakistan’s chief of defence forces field marshal Asim Munir has claimed that Islamabad received ‘divine help’ during the military confrontation with India in May.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently incarcerated for now over two years, on Saturday called on his supporters to prepare for nationwide protests and announced his intention to challenge the recent Toshakhana-II verdict, which he alleged was delivered in “haste” by the Islamabad high court. Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.He also alleged that Pakistan is being governed by solely under ""Asim law.""With no access to his social media accounts, Khan conveyed his message through his legal team. According to a post on X summarising a conversation between the PTI founder and his lawyer, Khan instructed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi to begin preparations for a mass street movement.In the detailed message shared by his team, Khan said: “To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. At this moment, Pakistan is being governed solely under ‘Asim Law’. Here, verdicts are pre-written and merely announced aloud. Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the past three years, the Toshakhana 2 verdict is nothing new for me. This ruling, too, was delivered in haste, without any evidence and without fulfilling legal requirements.Neither we nor our lawyers were even given opportunity to present our case.”He alleged that both he and Bushra Bibi were being subjected to harsh solitary confinement. “The sustained solitary confinement imposed on me and my wife constitutes severe mental torture. We are barred from books, television, and meetings… The books sent by my family are confiscated by jail authorities, and we are kept in solitary confinement for weeks at a time. This treatment is inhumane, yet all this oppression and brutality cannot weaken my resolve. ”Khan also accused the authorities of persecuting women linked to PTI. “It is not our tradition to target women and children… I am deeply saddened and distressed by the mistreatment and brutality faced by my sisters and other women outside Adiala Jail. The treatment meted out to Bushra Bibi, Dr. Yasmin, Mahrang Baloch, and other women stands in clear violation of Islamic traditions and moral values.”The former prime minister again directed his criticism at army chief Asim Munir . “The army is mine and belongs to the people of Pakistan. When I criticise Asim Munir, it is criticism of an individual… Whatever is happening to me in jail is being carried out on the instructions of a colonel acting under Asim Munir’s orders.”Urging the legal fraternity to mobilise, Khan said: “For the struggle to restore the rule of law and uphold the Constitution, it is essential for the Insaf Lawyers Forum and legal fraternity to step forward decisively.”He added that he had instructed his legal team to appeal the verdict: “I have full confidence in Salman Safdar and his team and have instructed them to file an appeal against these bogus decisions in the Islamabad high court.” Concluding his message, he said: “My message for Sohail Afridi is to prepare for a street movement. The entire nation must rise for their rights!! To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. ”The message was signed off as: “Illegally Incarcerated Former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, speaking to his lawyers after the verdict of a military-style trial in Adiala Jail.”In an official statement, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) described the verdict as “blatantly unconstitutional, illegal, malicious and the worst form of political revenge and a textbook case of victimisation.”The party-led by Imran Khan alleged that the conviction aimed to prolong Khan’s imprisonment and ease pressure on what it called a “petrified ruling clique,” claiming political vendetta was being executed through a “subservient” judiciary.Addressing a press conference alongside senior party leader Asad Qaiser, PTI secretary general Salman Akram Raja said Khan had met his lead counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, in the courtroom and shared a message for the nation. He quoted Khan as saying, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.”Raja added that the case lacked substantive evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said.Heavy police deployment was enforced across Rawalpindi, with more than 1,300 police officers and security personnel stationed at key locations to maintain law and order, after former Imran Khan called for the nationwide protests.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.

Water crisis deepens public health risks





At least two women were killed and several others injured in Balochistan’s Noshki district after a passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck, Dawn reported. The vehicle was travelling from Quetta to Chagai when the crash occurred near the Sher Jan Agha area.Five passengers sustained injuries, with two shifted to Quetta for critical care. Hospital officials said at least eight people hurt in rain-related incidents were brought to the Civil Hospital.The rainfall, which began on Saturday, ended a prolonged dry spell in the Quetta valley, offering brief relief to drought-hit farmers. However, it also caused widespread disruption. Despite forecasts ruling out significant rainfall, showers intensified by noon, flooding roads, halting traffic and plunging large parts of Quetta into darkness after electricity supplies were suspended. Mobile networks were also disrupted, leaving residents without communication for hours.Low-lying neighbourhoods, particularly areas with mud houses and weak construction, were badly affected as rainwater entered homes.Heavy rainfall was reported across several districts, including Ziarat, Pishin, Kalat, Zhob, Mastung and Sibi, with power outages lasting for hours in many areas.Meanwhile, experts warned that Pakistan’s water-quality crisis is worsening. Speaking at a seminar organised by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) in Islamabad, specialists said only 47 per cent of the population has access to safe drinking water, according to The Express Tribune.Dr Hifza Rasheed of the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources said per capita freshwater availability has dropped from 5,260 cubic metres in 1951 to below 1,000 cubic metres in 2024, placing Pakistan among water-scarce nations. Unsafe water, experts said, accounts for nearly 40 per cent of illnesses nationwide and contributes to tens of thousands of child deaths each year.","A passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck in Balochistan.

Ex-PM Imran Khan And Bushra Bibi Jailed For 17 Years In Toshakhana Gift Jewellery Case





Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan has asked his supporters to prepare for nationwide protests and said he will challenge his conviction in the Islamabad High Court after he and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the Toshakhana-II corruption case on Saturday.Khan, who does not currently have access to his social media accounts, conveyed his message through his legal team.According to a post on X cited by Dawn, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder said he had instructed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi to begin preparations for a mass street movement. “I have sent a message to [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM] Sohail Afridi to prepare for the street movement. The entire nation will have to rise for its rights,” Khan said.Reacting to the verdict, Khan said the decision did not come as a surprise and accused the court of acting in haste. “Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the last three years, the Toshakhana-II decision is also nothing new to me,” he said, adding that the ruling was delivered “without any evidence” and that his legal team was “not even heard”, as reported by ANI.He confirmed that his lawyers had already been directed to move the high court against the sentence.PTI, in an official statement, described the verdict as “blatantly unconstitutional, illegal” and an act of political victimisation, alleging that the conviction was meant to prolong Khan’s imprisonment.Addressing a press conference, PTI secretary general Salman Akram Raja quoted Khan as saying, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.”The case relates to allegations that a Bulgari jewellery set, worth over PKR 71 million and received from the Saudi Crown Prince, was undervalued.Khan and Bushra Bibi were convicted under sections linked to criminal breach of trust and corruption, as per ANI.The sentencing has sparked public debate across Pakistan. Quoted by ANI, residents and journalists in Lahore and Peshawar questioned the credibility of the ruling, with some alleging political motives and a lack of evidence, saying the verdict had further weakened public trust in the justice system and democratic institutions.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the Toshakhana-II corruption case on Saturday.

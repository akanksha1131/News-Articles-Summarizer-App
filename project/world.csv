US Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick, in a 24-page opinion, said the record showed a “disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps” and raised the prospect of government misconduct that warranted an “extraordinary remedy,” according to CBS news.Fitzpatrick said prosecutors and at least one FBI agent displayed a “cavalier” attitude toward the legal rights of Comey and others and criticised Trump-appointed prosecutor Lindsey Halligan for what he called “fundamental misstatements of the law” to the grand jury, The Washington Post reported.Fitzpatrick ordered disclosure of the full grand jury transcripts and audio recordings to Comey’s defence team, saying that, while grand jury material is normally secret, the exceptional concerns in this case justified disclosure.Late on Monday, however, the federal district judge overseeing the prosecution temporarily stayed Fitzpatrick’s order at the Justice Department’s request. US District Judge Michael Nachmanoff said he would review the magistrate’s decision and rule in the coming days, according to CBS news.The magistrate warned that procedural and substantive flaws in pre-grand jury conduct and in how evidence was collected and presented “may rise to the level of government misconduct resulting in prejudice to Mr.Comey.""Comey is charged on two counts alleging that he made false statements in testimony to Congress. He has pleaded not guilty and has sought dismissal on multiple grounds, including the grand jury irregularities Fitzpatrick described, arguments over the legality of Halligan’s appointment and alleges that the prosecution amounts to an improper extension of US President Donald Trump’s personal animus, The Washington Post reported.","US Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick, in a 24-page opinion, said the record showed a “disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps” and raised the prospect of government misconduct.

‘Desperate’ For Saudi-Israel Ties, Trump 'IGNORES' Pentagon's China Threat; Okays 48 F-35 Jets Deal





US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration would move ahead with the long-anticipated sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, despite internal concerns that the deal could expose sensitive American technology to China.When asked whether he would approve the sale, Trump said, “I will say that we will be doing that. We’ll be selling F-35s.”The announcement came a day before Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s expected arrival in Washington, his first US visit in over seven years. The F-35 deal is among several major agreements the two countries are likely to unveil during the visit, according to AP.The crown prince is expected to seek formal US assurances on military protection for the kingdom and the purchase of the F-35, one of the world’s most advanced fighter jets.The timing of the announcement also reflects Trump’s push to secure a normalisation deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel. He has promoted an expansion of the Abraham Accords as key to long-term regional stability while the fragile Gaza ceasefire holds. “I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords very shortly,” he told reporters on Air Force One on Friday.However, Saudi Arabia has maintained that any deal must include a guaranteed pathway to a Palestinian state, a position Israel firmly rejects.Officials say Riyadh is unlikely to join the accords immediately, though there is guarded optimism about a possible agreement by the end of Trump’s second term.The New York Times reported that a Pentagon intelligence assessment raised fresh concerns that China could gain access to sensitive F-35 technology if the sale proceeds. Sources familiar with the Defence Intelligence Agency’s findings said US officials fear potential Chinese espionage and Beijing’s growing security cooperation with Riyadh. Washington has also been evaluating whether the sale would affect Israel’s qualitative military edge, given Israel is the only Middle Eastern country operating F-35s and has used them in strikes in Iran in October 2024 and June 2025.Bradley Bowman of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said Congress may now seek clarity on what assurances Riyadh has offered regarding its ties with China. He added that lawmakers are likely to press the administration on how it plans to maintain Israel’s military advantage in the region.",US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration would move ahead with the long-anticipated sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.

Trump’s Gaza peace plan: UNSC approves US-drafted resolution; Hamas rejects proposal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-gaza-peace-plan-unsc-approves-us-drafted-resolution-hamas-rejects-proposal/articleshow/125398562.cms,"US President Donald Trump (Photo credit: AP)

'Plan To Rule...': Trump’s Gaza Plan Stuns Netanyahu; U.S.-Led Force To ‘Seize Strip’?





The United Nations Security Council on Monday approved a US-drafted resolution endorsing President Donald Trump ’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza, giving the proposal a binding international mandate after two years of conflict.The resolution received 13 votes in favour with zero vetoes, while Russia and China abstained. It authorises the creation of an International Stabilisation Force, or ISF, which the US said that several unnamed countries have expressed willingness to join.The force would be tasked with entering Gaza, overseeing demilitarisation, securing key areas and supporting the delivery of humanitarian assistance. It would also coordinate its operations with Israel and Egypt, Gaza’s southern neighbour.However, Hamas has rejected the resolution, arguing that it does not address Palestinian rights and imposes an unwanted external authority on the territory. In a statement on Telegram, the group said the plan “imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip, which our people and their factions reject,” and added that giving the stabilisation force a mandate to disarm resistance groups “strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation”, news agency Reuters reported.The draft resolution states that the ISF would work on the “permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups,” including Hamas, which would be required to surrender its weapons under Trump’s proposal.The draft also calls for the creation of a newly trained Palestinian police force to eventually take over policing responsibilities in Gaza, replacing the Hamas-run force currently in place.US ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz told the council that the stabilisation force would be “tasked with securing the area, supporting the demilitarization of Gaza, dismantling the terrorist infrastructure, removing weapons, and ensuring the safety of Palestinian civilians.” He described the initial ceasefire phase, which began on 10 October with the exchange of hostages and detainees, as a “fragile, fragile first step. ”The plan also proposes the establishment of a Board of Peace, which Trump is expected to head, and a World Bank-supported trust fund to support Gaza’s reconstruction.The vote took place as global actors sought to maintain the fragile ceasefire following the war that began with Hamas’ 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which killed about 1,200 people. Israel’s subsequent offensive has killed more than 69,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.","US-drafted resolution endorsed President Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza.

Qatar’s best view yet: The fastest annual meteor shower arrives Nov 17,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/qatars-best-view-yet-the-fastest-annual-meteor-shower-arrives-nov-17/articleshow/125377745.cms,"Leonid meteors streak across Qatar’s night sky tonight / AI-Generated Image

What are the Leonids?

When to watch?

Where to look for Meteors?

Maximizing your meteor hunt

Moon-Free Skies: The shower peaks when the Moon is in its waning crescent phase, meaning it will be only about 9 percent illuminated. This minimal moonlight translates to significantly darker skies, preventing light pollution from the Moon itself from washing out the fainter meteors.

Find the Dark: The most crucial tip for any meteor shower is to escape city lights. Find a secluded spot far away from all sources of light pollution (such as streetlights and residential areas). Your eyes need complete darkness to adjust fully.

Go Naked-Eye: You do not need any special equipment like telescopes or binoculars; these tools are too zoomed-in to capture the sweeping path of a meteor. All you need are your naked eyes and patience.

Allow Adjustment Time: Once you arrive at your dark location, allow your eyes a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes to fully adjust to the darkness. Any bright phone screen light will immediately reset this process.

Get Comfortable: Bring a comfortable chair or blanket. Meteor viewing is a waiting game, so lie back with your feet pointing generally toward the east/northeast and scan the entire expanse of the sky.





Get ready to ditch the city lights and look up! The celestial event of the month, the Leonid meteor shower, is about to light up the sky, peaking on the night of November 16-17, 2025. These dazzling ""shooting stars"" are renowned as some of the fastest in the cosmos, created as Earth streaks through the dusty trail left by Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle.Because this year features excellent, moon-free conditions and the potential for up to 40 meteors per hour, now is your chance to witness the natural fireworks. Read on for your simple, step-by-step guide on the best time to look up, where to point your gaze, and how to maximize your viewing success.The origin of these meteors is the tiny, dusty trail left behind by Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle. As Earth orbits the Sun each November, it passes directly through this debris field. The specks of dust, most smaller than a grain of sand, vaporize upon atmospheric entry, creating the flash we observe from the ground. While typically producing a modest display, the Leonids are famously known for their meteor storms—intense periods where thousands of meteors can fall per hour, a spectacular event that occurs roughly every 33 years, coinciding with the comet’s orbital period. While 2025 is not a storm year, conditions promise excellent visibility.Astro-observers predict the shower’s peak around 18:00 UTC on 17 November 2025, that converts to 21:00 (9:00 pm) on 17 November in Qatar (UTC+3). Even so, the best practical viewing is after midnight and into the pre-dawn hours, when the Leo radiant climbs higher and more of the sky is favourable. Expect about 10–15 meteors per hour under good, dark skies (some sources give up to ~15–20/hour as a generous peak estimate).The Leonid meteor shower is active annually from around November 6 until November 30, but the best viewing opportunity, the peak, occurs on the night between November 16 and 17, 2025. The absolute ideal time to watch is after midnight until the pre-dawn hours on the morning of November 17, when the meteor shower's radiant point is highest in the sky.The meteors appear to originate from the constellation Leo the Lion (hence the name Leonids), which rises in the east/northeast after midnight. While they seem to stream from Leo, viewers are advised to look 30 to 40 degrees away from the radiant. Looking away from Leo allows you to catch the meteors streaking across a wider section of the sky, maximizing the chance of seeing longer, more dramatic trails.Globally, rates are expected to be around 10 to 15 meteors per hour (ZHR). However, local astronomical experts have suggested the rate could reach up to 40 meteors per hour in exceptionally dark viewing locations, providing the potential for a significantly better display.This year presents a particularly favorable chance to view the Leonids, primarily due to the state of the Moon.As the Leonids sweep across Qatar’s sky on November 17, this is your once-a-year chance to slow down, look up, and enjoy a natural light show that needs nothing more than clear skies and a little patience. Whether you're watching from the desert, the coastline, or your rooftop, the night promises a mix of calm, wonder, and those brief streaks of magic that remind us how alive the sky really is. Enjoy the moment, the Leonids are here, and they’re worth staying up for.","The Leonid meteor shower is active annually from around November 6 until November 30.

"'Heavy debt, rising costs': UK’s largest pub group to sell around thousand sites; eyes deal worth 1 billion pounds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/heavy-debt-rising-costs-uks-largest-pub-group-to-sell-around-thousand-sites-eyes-deal-worth-1-billion-pounds/articleshow/125378123.cms,"Stonegate Group, the UK's largest pub operator, is reportedly considering selling approximately 1,000 of its most profitable ""platinum"" pubs for an estimated £1 billion. This move aims to address the company's substantial £3 billion debt burden. The sale of these separately structured sites would not impact the rest of Stonegate's extensive estate.





Stonegate Group, the UK’s largest pub operator and owner of chains including Slug & Lettuce and Be At One, is reportedly considering the sale of around 1,000 sites in a deal potentially worth 1 billion pounds, Independent reported.The move comes as the group seeks to address an estimated 3 billion pounds in accumulated debts.According to Independent, the sites under consideration form a portfolio of the group’s most profitable pubs, often described as its “platinum” collection. These pubs are structured as a separate entity within Stonegate, allowing a sale without affecting the rest of its estate of 4,300 sites. Executives are consulting advisers on options, including selling the pubs in smaller groups rather than in a single transaction.A Stonegate spokesperson told The Sun that no pubs are at risk of closure and all sites will continue to operate under the Stonegate brand. Analysts note that many UK pub chains remain under pressure, with several, such as Oakman Inns & Restaurants, entering administration earlier this year due to elevated costs and reduced revenue.Stonegate’s financial difficulties date back to its 2019 merger with rival company Ei, which left the group heavily indebted just months before the Covid-19 lockdown severely impacted the hospitality sector.Attempts to sell some sites in previous years were unsuccessful, and the group instead refinanced the platinum pubs with a 638 million pounds loan from private equity firm Apollo. The end of a non-call period on this loan in January could allow Stonegate to pursue a potential sale, The Independent reported.Chief executive David McDowall, who joined the company from BrewDog in 2023, had outlined a “transformation plan” to return Stonegate to profitability. Despite these measures, the company posted a 214 million pounds loss in 2024.The wider UK hospitality industry too continues to face challenges from high operating costs, rising energy and food prices, increased national insurance contributions, and the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on customer spending.","Stonegate Group, the UK's largest pub operator, is reportedly considering the sale of around 1,000 sites in a deal potentially worth 1 billion pounds.

Trump 'knew about the underage girls'?











Mark Epstein, the brother of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein , has tried to shut down a viral rumour about the newly released Epstein emails. He said that the name “Bubba” mentioned in a 2018 exchange between the brothers was not a reference to former President Bill Clinton.The clarification came after a March 2018 email between Jeffrey and Mark Epstein was released this week by Democrats, which stirred a row. In the message, Mark asked Jeffrey, who had said he was with Steve Bannon, to “ask him if Putin has the photos of Trump b*****g Bubba.” Because Clinton was long known by the nickname “Bubba”, the reference was speculated by many as Trump having oral intercourse with Clinton.Mark Epstein pushed back in a statement to The Advocate, saying the message was being misread. “They were simply part of a humorous private exchange between two brothers and were never meant for public release or to be interpreted as serious remarks,” he wrote. He added, “For the avoidance of doubt, the reference to ‘Bubba’ in this correspondence is not, in any way, a reference to former President Bill Clinton.”Mark's spokesperson, Ali Clark, said in an email that Bubba is “a private individual who is not a public figure.”Mark said that attaching political motives to a nickname distracts from “the serious questions that remain unanswered.”The wider set of emails points to far more serious claims about Jeffrey Epstein’s political ties with the MAGA chief. In a 2019 message to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote that Trump “knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.” Another email from 2011, sent to Ghislaine Maxwell, claimed that Trump spent hours at Epstein’s home with one of his sex-trafficking victims.California Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said the documents raise “serious new questions” about Trump’s ties to Epstein and accused the Justice Department of obstructing the inquiry. “There’s a massive cover-up at the White House and the DOJ right now over the files.”The White House has dismissed the emails, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejecting any suggestion of Trump being involved in the Epstein scandal.Meanwhile, Trump also claimed that Bill Clinton spent significant time on Epstein’s island and threatened to launch an FBI and DOJ probe into various high-profile figures, including JPMorgan and Chase.The row intensified on Friday when Trump launched a Truth Social rant attacking Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene after she backed a bipartisan move to force the release of all unclassified Epstein files.","Mark Epstein, the brother of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, has tried to shut down a viral rumour about the newly released Epstein emails.

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





Around 2,000 people joined the protest that took place on Sunday in Crowborough, East Sussex, against government plans to accommodate 540 single male asylum seekers at a disused army camp on the edge of the town.During the protests, mothers led chants of “Starmer out” as marchers carried Union Jacks, St George’s crosses, and handwritten placards with slogans including “Protect Us. Protect our children” and “Our children’s freedom gone, so they can have theirs,” The Times reported.This comes after a heated public meeting on Thursday, where private security guards intervened when local politicians were chased out of the community centre hall. Some residents said they were installing panic alarms in their homes and raised concerns about access to local GP services, which are already in high demand, the BBC reported.The government announced in October that the asylum seekers would be accommodated at the disused army camp, as part of efforts to end the use of hotels for migrant accommodation. A Home Office spokesperson told the BBC that the move aims to provide “more suitable accommodation” while public safety remains the first priority.Kim Bailey, chairwoman of Crowborough Shield, a grassroots organisation formed to challenge home secretary Shabana Mahmood, claimed that the plans were “absurd"" Highlighting potential risks for asylum seekers with PTSD living near a police firearms training centre and public shooting range, she said “It’s absurd what they are doing. Vulnerable men from war-torn countries, to Crowborough?She added that the men are “unvetted” and that the rural location could make it difficult for authorities to respond if crime occurs. The campaign has raised more than £12,000 to fund legal action against the Home Office.Wealden District Council, controlled by an alliance of Labour, Liberal Democrat, and Green councillors, criticised the Home Office for an “information vacuum” around the plans, which it said fuelled community tension and threats against local politicians. Crowborough, along with Cameron Barracks in Inverness, were the first military sites identified to accommodate a total of 900 asylum seekers, The Times reported.The Home Office said all residents will undergo mandatory security checks and that “as part of their induction process, clear expectations are set out to asylum seekers staying at the site about their expected behaviour while on and off the site.” Kerrie Knight, an organiser of the Pink Ladies campaign, told The Times the protests were “not about race or religion” but about “risk and safety” and “common sense.”","Around 2,000 people joined the protest that took place on Sunday in Crowborough, East Sussex, against government plans to accommodate 540 single male asylum seekers.

"Did FBI remove Trump’s name from Epstein files? Report claims review of 100,000 documents, 300GB of evidence",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-fbi-remove-trumps-name-from-epstein-files-report-claims-review-of-100000-documents-300gb-of-evidence/articleshow/125394873.cms,"In a recent twist, a report has emerged indicating that Donald Trump's name may have been omitted from the FBI's files on Jeffrey Epstein, igniting a fresh wave of debate. Initially downplaying the gravity of the situation, Trump has now pivoted, calling on House Republicans to unveil the documents in a bid for transparency.

Epstein Files’ Unexpected TWIST: Trump Tells Republicans to Release The Documents Amid GOP Revolt1





An old report has brought back a question Donald Trump ’s team hoped would disappear: did the FBI work through the night to remove his name from the Jeffrey Epstein files before saying there was nothing left to release? The timing is important as Trump has suddenly reversed his stance on making the documents public.Trump announced on Truth Social: “House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide.” It marked a sudden U-turn after months of resisting pressure from both parties. His shift only came once it became clear that the House was preparing to move forward without him.The move was surprising given that Trump had previously dismissed the Epstein issue as a Democratic “hoax” despite having campaigned on transparency in 2024. Bloomberg reported in August this year that an FBI FOIA team had already blacked out Trump’s name from the documents during an exhaustive internal review.Sources familiar with the process told Bloomberg, “We know from news reports that Trump’s name was in the Epstein files. But what hasn’t been reported is that an FBI FOIA team redacted Trump’s name and the names of other prominent public figures from the documents.”The review involved up to 1,000 FBI agents and staff working through more than 100,000 documents.The White House referred questions about the redactions to the FBI. The FBI declined to comment and the Justice Department offered no response. In July, DOJ and the FBI said they had collected more than 300 gigabytes of Epstein-related evidence but concluded that “no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.” The decision angered Trump’s base, with Joe Rogan accusing the administration of “trying to gaslight” its own supporters.The fight over the files also caused serious political fallout. After Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene signed the discharge petition, Trump called her a “ranting Lunatic” and withdrew his endorsement.The House is now expected to back the release of the files, though the Senate will require 60 votes. At the same time, Trump has urged Republicans to refocus on economic issues, warning that Epstein is a “trap.” And that Democrats are trying to distract Americans from the shutdown, he said last week.","A report has emerged indicating that Donald Trump's name may have been omitted from the FBI's files on Jeffrey Epstein.

Something very respectable,” Eric revealed.At the inauguration, Barron Trump shook hands with Biden and leaned to say something, sending lip readers into a tizzy to decode what were said.

He also made it clear that he was aware of the controversy. “Do you remember that whole controversy where Barron went up to Biden … and [the media] had all these like lip-reading experts [analyze it], and they’re like, ‘Barron just told Biden to go F himself’? “ Eric said adding that Barron is a nice kid and he is too courteous to actually use the F word on someone's face.The hilarious conversation came up as Eric was asked who the nicest Trump is.

Probe reveals Trump shooter Thomas Crooks’s links to ‘furry’ porn; MAGA says ‘kid was programmed’ to kill president,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/probe-reveals-trump-shooter-thomas-crookss-links-to-furry-porn-maga-says-kid-was-programmed-to-kill-president/articleshow/125393725.cms,"Emerging revelations about Thomas Crooks, the suspect in the alleged Trump shooting, showcase a dual life dominated by 'furry' artwork and extremist dialogues. Investigators have traced anonymous profiles tied to niche cartoon fetish content and chilling violent discourse.

'We have more guns than they do'





Trump shooter Thomas Crooks’s trans “furry” fantasies have surfaced as investigators and online researchers uncover more of his hidden digital life. New findings suggest the would-be assassin spent years posting under anonymous accounts linked to cartoon fetish art and extremist conversations, according to the Daily Mail.According to the Daily Beast, Crooks final search before shooting POTUS was porn.Donald Trump was shot during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in 2024. Online accounts under the names “epicmicrowave” and “theepicmicrowave” on the site DeviantArt are now being connected to him. The platform hosts pornographic “furry” material involving human-animal hybrid characters. Activity on the accounts showed the use of “they/them” pronouns and an interest in cartoon figures with exaggerated male physiques and female heads.The information follows a detailed investigation presented by conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, who examined Crooks’s online activity, his past political views and a shift from supporting Trump to embracing violent far-left rhetoric.One of the most chilling revelations is Crooks’s interaction with a Norwegian user called “Willy_Tepes”. Carlson says the name appears on a foreign Antifa website linking the user to the Nordic Resistance Movement, which the United States has designated a terrorist organisation.FBI has not publicly mentioned the user, though Carlson said investigators would be aware of the account.Crooks’s online exchanges with Tepes touched on political violence. On 4 August 2020 Tepes wrote: “If a gun and a badge is all that is needed, then authority obviously comes from the barrel of a gun. We have more guns than they do ;)” He added: “There is no way we can avoid a war at this point, so you just better get used to the idea.”In another message he said: “The more guns that are out there, the less likely a gun confiscation will be possible. Nope, guns do not guarantee a victory anymore than jet fighters, tanks and drones do. It is the fighting spirit and brains that wins.” He continued: “We have nothing to lose and everything to win... and the alternative, a global police state, is unacceptable. Nothing in life is simple but that is no argument against doing it :)”After these interactions, Crooks’s YouTube comments came to an abrupt end.Separate comments from early 2020 suggest a political shift. Carlson’s team reports that Crooks mocked Trump supporters as a “cult” and criticised the US president for his “stupidity”. He allegedly described ways to attack government buildings, writing: “the only way to fight the [government] is with terrorism style attacks, sneak a bomb into an essential building [and] set it off before anyone sees you”.MAGA figures reacted to Carlson’s findings. Congressman Tim Burchett suggested Crooks was manipulated by intelligence agencies, telling Benny Johnson: “They programmed this kid. You got a kid who’s got access to guns or has some simple knowledge of a firearm, he was programmed.”Kash Patel responded separately, saying the FBI had gathered extensive data. Patel wrote: “The investigation, conducted by over 480 FBI employees, revealed Crooks had limited online and in-person interactions, planned and conducted the attack alone, and did not leak or share his intent to engage in the attack with anyone.”The FBI maintains that Crooks acted alone and that no evidence links him to foreign direction.","Investigators trace online profiles tied to cartoon fetish content.

A late-night chat about chickens took a bizarre turn in Florida after a man known as “Farmer Pete” allegedly opened fire outside a bar during an argument over egg production. Police say no one was injured, but several arrests followed, reports the New York Post.Port St. Lucie police said the incident happened earlier this month outside a pub. Officers were alerted when 44-year-old Peter Riera, who was actually the culprit, called 911 claiming he had been robbed and was being chased by two men and a woman. When officers arrived, the trio told a very different story.According to the police report, Brandon Pace, his girlfriend Kayla Damiani and their friend Tyler McHargue, said they had only met Riera that night and had been chatting casually after being introduced to him as “Farmer Pete”. Their conversation somehow drifted to chickens and how many eggs they can lay. Witnesses said Riera suddenly became paranoid and began accusing them of trying to “jump” him and attempting to “con” him.Police say Riera then pulled out a gun and fired four shots as the group ran away. Body camera footage obtained by CBS 12 later showed Riera being arrested outside the pub wearing jean overalls and apparently without shoes.The victims also ended up in trouble. Pace was arrested for allegedly obstructing officers and kicking two of them. Damiani was detained for resisting without violence and later released on a $500 bond. McHargue cooperated and was not charged.Riera remains in custody on a $435,000 bond and faces several charges, including aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and discharging a firearm in public.","Peter Riera, 44, called 911 claiming he had been robbed and was being chased by two men and a woman.

Epstein's Shocking 'Murder Plot': Insider Claims 'Betrayal' From Andrew Windsor In Final Days





In a sudden turnaround, US President Donald Trump on Sunday reversed course on one of the most divisive issues of his second term, allowing his loyalist lawmakers to vote to release long-withheld Justice Department files on the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein amid a mutiny in the ranks.“It’s a Democrat Hoax for purposes of deflection, just like the Russia, Russia, Russia Scam!!! They had sleazy relationships with Epstein, and should be prosecuted!!!” Trump said in a social media post, reframing a controversy that appeared to have implicated him and put him on the defensive.The turnaround was apparently precipitated by a brewing revolt among Trump’s MAGA faithful, including three female lawmakers, who had grown increasingly incensed over perceived betrayals on a promise central to his 2024 campaign. Trump had pledged during campaign rallies to “expose the Epstein files” and drain the political swamp of purported pedophiles, a vow that resonated with his conspiracy-minded supporters convinced the documents implicated Democrats like Bill Clinton and elites like Bill Gates.Yet, upon re-entering the White House, his administration stonewalled, citing national security and ongoing reviews. By mid-November, frustration boiled over and a House Oversight Committee dump of 23,000 pages of Epstein’s emails on November 10—many mentioning Trump’s Mar-a-Lago parties and his quip that Epstein liked “beautiful women...on the younger side”—ignited a firestorm. Both Democrats and MAGA influencers accused the President of a cover-up and demanded the complete files be released.In fiery social media posts, Trump directly targeted former President Bill Clinton (who flew on Epstein’s jet 26 times), Obama-era official Larry Summers (who emailed Epstein post-conviction about Harvard donations), and Democratic megadonor and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman (who regretted fundraising with Epstein in 2015). “This is another Russia Hoax—all arrows point to the Democrats. They spent their lives with Epstein on his Island. Stay tuned!!!” Trump thundered, while also implicating the banking giant JPMorgan Chase for allegedly enabling Epstein’s finances.Democrats creid foul, accusing Trump of weaponizing the Justice Department against foes even as Attorney General Pam Bondi complied with the President’s orders to investigate Democrats. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called it “retaliatory theater” to “distract from Trump’s own Epstein emails suggesting he (Trump) “knew about the girls.” The MAGA base wasn’t impressed either with Trump's tactics.The revolt crystallized in a bipartisan discharge petition spearheaded by Republican Congressman Thomas Massie, a Trump critic from Kentucky, which by the weekend had garnered 218 signatures—enough to force a floor vote as early as Tuesday. Even erstwhile Trump loyalists like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, and Nancy Mace, all MAGA partisans, rejected entreaties from House Speaker Mike Johnson to withdraw support to the petition that would facilitate the release, with Greene firing back on CNN that her push for transparency wasn’t “disloyalty—it’s fulfilling what the base demands. ”Trump retaliated angrily, withdrawing his endorsement for Greene’s 2026 re-election and calling her a “traitor” and “disgrace” in weekend tirades. Boebert, undeterred, tweeted, “Promises made, promises kept. No more excuses.” Polling from Rasmussen showed Trump’s approval dipping to 42% among self-identified MAGA voters, the lowest since his inauguration, as online forums buzzed with calls for a “MAGA purge. ”Faced with the specter of a humiliating House defeat, with potentially 50+ defections from the Republican side, Trump blinked on Sunday. His pivot reframes the vote as a Republican triumph, but skeptics see it as damage control. If passed, the measure would compel release of the files within 30 days, subject to a Senate vote before it goes to the President for his signature. Technically, Trump could veto it at that point though aides have indicated he won’t.",President Donald Trump reversed course on one of the most divisive issues of his second term.

MAGA commentator Bill Mitchell waded into the H-1B row on Monday, urging Trump supporters to stop attacking the president and warning that a hardline, anti-immigrant approach on skilled visas would damage the country.Posting on X, Mitchell said: “The America first crowd realizes that this doesn't mean, ‘America alone,’ right? We are part of a global economy. If we do not bring the best talent to America to work for us, our technology will leave America in search of that talent.”He added: “So those who claim to want an end to H-1B's as ‘America first’ will make America last in technology.”Mitchell’s intervention comes as Republicans continue to rage over Donald Trump’s recent Fox News comments, where he said the US lacks certain specialised skills and needs foreign talent in areas such as tech and defence. “You don’t have certain talents. People have to learn. You can’t take people off the unemployment line and say go make missiles,” Trump said. His remarks split his base, while Democrats framed it as another Trump reversal.Last week, Mitchell urged conservatives to look at the H1-B situation realistically. He argued that if H-1B visas were scrapped tomorrow, companies would not suddenly hire Americans but would simply offshore those jobs because many candidates are “underskilled”.He said the uproar is largely driven by online anger: “H-1B has become a burning issue only on X, while people on the street do not even know what the H-1B is. ”He also told supporters not to misinterpret Trump’s wording. Mitchell said the president never claimed America lacked talent entirely, but pointed out that certain industries require specialised skills. “Never attack Trump for ANYTHING while he is president. Chances are you don't know what he knows,” he said, adding that the US does not have enough homegrown talent to meet the demands of the AI era.Mitchell warned that attacks from MAGA risk weakening both Trump and the movement heading into 2026.", MAGA commentator Bill Mitchell waded into the H-1B row on Monday.

Kash Patel deploys FBI SWAT agents to protect girlfriend Alexis Wilkins: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kash-patel-deploys-fbi-swat-agents-to-protect-girlfriend-alexis-wilkins-report/articleshow/125389001.cms,"A report claims Kash Patel has deployed SWAT agents for Alexis Wilkins' security in Nashville.

Kash Patel 'INTERRUPTS' Karoline Presser, Then Takes Podium For BIGGEST Fentanyl Announcement

Girlfriend hitch for Kash Patel







FBI director Kash Patel has arranged a special SWAT team protection for his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins, a report by MS Now claimed, at a time Patel is mired in a myriad of controversies; half of them are because of his young girlfriend. Wilkins is a country music singer and a political commentator dating Kash Patel before Patel became the FBI director. But conspiracy theorists, including staunch MAGA supporters, spread a narrative that Wilkins works for Mossad and 'honeytrapped' Patel.The MS NOW report claimed that Wilkins' security detail is made up of elite FBI agents ""usually assigned to a SWAT team in the FBI field office in Nashville"". The report also cited concerns from former FBI agents who called it unprecedented for a director to deploy such an elite security force for a girlfriend. The FBI has not yet reacted to the report.The FBI SWAT team (Special Weapons and Tactics) handles high-risk operations that may not be possible for regular agents. Their duties include executing dangerous arrests and search warrants, rescuing hostages, responding to armed standoffs or barricaded suspects, providing tactical support during terrorism or organized crime operations, and conducting high-risk surveillance or security for major events.They are highly trained in weapons, breaching, close-quarters combat, and crisis response, and they deploy only when a situation requires specialized tactical skills.“There is no legitimate justification for this. This is a clear abuse of position and misuse of government resources,” said Christopher O’Leary, a former senior FBI agent and MS NOW law enforcement contributor. “She is not his spouse, does not live in the same house or even the same city.”Former FBI director Christopher Wray’s wife Helen received a security detail as she lived with Wray in their home in Atlanta, the report included.Kash Patel has made it clear that Alexis Wilkins is family to him, and while he, as the FBi director, can be criticized for his work, Alexis should not be targeted. He called Alexis a true American patriot who has done a lot for the country.MAGA stopped admiring Patel after Patel walked back on the issue of Epstein files, asserting that Epstein killed himself. While Patel used to question the FBI director's use of a government jet for personal travel, Patel himself was found doing the same. And then, his girlfriend started suing each MAGA influencer who spread the conspiracy theory that she works for Mossad. MAGA does not like that Patel is taking a stand for his girlfriend who is not a 'wife', though Patel made it clear that Alexis Wilkins is not just his girlfriend but his partner.","FBI director Kash Patel has arranged a special SWAT team protection for his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins, a report by MS Now claimed.

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers





Conservative figure James Fishback, who is an outspoken critic of immigration and one of the most influential 'America First' loudmouths, triggered a row after posting a message on X.“I’ll fire every single H-1B working at our state agencies before the sun sets on my first day as Florida Governor. Then we’ll hire incredible Floridians for those posts,” he posted.Fishback is expected to run for governor of Florida in 2026. Fishback, a DeSantis-aligned investor and political activist, has been signalling a bid for months and recently scaled up his public attacks on immigration and the H-1B visa system, which many see as an early pitch to Republican primary voters.The comments come as Donald Trump said in a Fox News interview last week that the United States lacks talent and needs skilled foreigners to fill crucial sectors such as technology and defence. His remarks split the MAGA base, with the White House scrambling to defend the president while Republicans like Marjorie Taylor Greene accused Trump of going against the America First agenda.Fishback has built a public identity around targeting Indian and Chinese talent in the US.Fishback is a 30-year-old investor and former adviser to DOGE and Elon Musk. He has positioned himself as one of the loudest voices calling for a complete dismantling of the H-1B programme. In a recent Fox News interview, he argued that American companies “do not need” foreign skilled workers, accusing employers of hiding job openings while millions of qualified Americans remain underemployed. He has repeatedly pushed for a full immigration moratorium, saying the next chapter of America “should be written by its own citizens. ”His views stand in polar opposite to the tech and finance industries, which rely heavily on high-skilled workers from India and China, particularly in engineering and software development.Fishback was born in 1995, he began studying International Economics at Georgetown University’s Walsh School of Foreign Service but left before completing the degree.

American pop star Taylor Swift has long been known for managing her image and guarding her music. Her silence over the past fortnight, as the Trump administration used tracks from her new album The Life of a Showgirl in a series of official posts, has become a talking point in both political and entertainment circles.Music from the album has already appeared in three posts linked directly to the administration. The first surfaced on the official White House TikTok account, which used her single The Fate of Ophelia over a patriotic slideshow. As Swift sings “pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes”, viewers were shown images of the American flag, President Trump, vice president JD Vance and the first and second ladies. Team Trump later posted two more clips. One featured Father Figure with the caption “this empire belongs to @President Donald J Trump”. The other, celebrating Melania Trump’s Patriot of the Year award, used Opalite as its soundtrack.Row over the administration’s use of popular music is not new. The White Stripes and the estate of Isaac Hayes have tried to sue in the past. Celine Dion, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Abba and Foo Fighters have all demanded that Trump stop playing their songs, according to the Guardian.Olivia Rodrigo slammed the administration, after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) used her track All-American B***h in a video promoting deportation efforts. Instagram later removed the clip.Swift’s lack of response stands out because she is usually quick to challenge unauthorised use of her music.In the past, she has taken action against a theme park for using her music without a licence, pushed back against Etsy sellers making merchandise with her lyrics, pursued YouTubers over copyright breaches and even demanded retroactive songwriting credits from younger artists such as Olivia Rodrigo.Her quiet approach also feels at odds with the political stance she has taken in recent years. In her documentary Miss Americana, Swift spoke about her decision to address social issues and elections, saying she needed “to be on the right side of history”. She has backed Democratic candidates, supported Kamala Harris in 2024. Yet she has not commented on ICE raids, immigration debates or the Israel-Gaza war this year.Furthermore, Trump has recently praised her, saying, “I think that she’s a terrific person”.","Swift's silence over the past fortnight has become a talking point in both political and entertainment circles.

A judiciary under reconstruction



Munir’s expanding power base



(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment reshapes the balance of power in favour of the military. Behind the crisis is the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, a sweeping package pushed through parliament within days. Lawyers, judges and opposition parties argue that it has weakened the courts and elevated the military’s top commander to a position with no modern parallel.Since then, Pakistan’s judiciary has been hit by a series of high-profile resignations. On Saturday, Lahore High Court judge Shams Mehmood Mirza stepped down, and his family said his decision was directly linked to the 27th Amendment. His departure followed those of Supreme Court justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, who issued sharply worded letters condemning the amendment as a direct attack on judicial independence.The creation of a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) lies at the heart of judicial restructuring. The FCC now holds exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters, stripping the Supreme Court of its original powers. Pending petitions have already been shifted to the new court. President Zardari swore in Justice Aminuddin Khan as its first chief justice; six other judges were appointed, including serving Supreme Court and high court judges, though one judge reportedly refused to join.The FCC’s establishment has sparked intense concern. Critics say the president’s new power to transfer judges risks becoming a tool to sideline dissenting voices. Opposition groups argue this will fundamentally weaken judicial independence and concentrate constitutional authority in the executive and military leadership.Government ministers, however, hailed the package as “historic” and a step toward greater efficiency and national unity. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the amendment proved that “solidarity” prevailed during a time of national strain.With judges resigning, courts being reconfigured, and the military gaining unprecedented constitutional control, Pakistan faces a moment of reckoning.The amendment passed with overwhelming numbers in both houses has dramatically restructured Pakistan’s defence architecture, elevating army chief Asim Munir to Chief of Defence Forces with command over all three military branches. His five-year tenure now resets from the date of notification, enabling him to remain in office until 2030.The Senate has since rushed through four related bills, including amendments to the Army, Air Force and Navy Acts, along with changes to Supreme Court practice rules. These laws remove the earlier equality among service chiefs and replace references to the Joint Chiefs of Staff system with a new “National Strategic Command”, further centralising military authority under Munir.Dawn reported that appointments, extensions, and tenures under these reforms “shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.Experts quoted in multiple reports warn that the shift risks internal military tensions and further erodes civilian oversight. Lawyer Osama Malik described the reforms as something “usually granted in absolute monarchies”, arguing they grant lifetime protections not only to Munir but also to President Zardari.Opposition lawmakers responded with uproar, shredding copies of the bill and walking out. PTI leaders labelled the move “deeply undemocratic” and “the final nail in the coffin of an independent judiciary”. Critics say these changes could reshape the political landscape, particularly for nearly 200 cases involving former prime minister Imran Khan.","Pakistan's judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment.

Judicial restructuring: Federal constitutional court



Political reactions



What next







Pakistan’s National Assembly on Wednesday passed the 27th constitutional amendment bill, granting sweeping powers to the military in general and country’s army chief Asim Munir in specific, and restructuring the judiciary.The vote, held amid a ruckus in the lower house, saw 234 lawmakers in favour and only four against, speaker Ayaz Sadiq announced. The session was attended by top political leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.The amendment comes at a time of heightened political tension in Pakistan, with the ruling coalition seeking to consolidate control over key defence and judicial institutions. The legislation follows earlier Senate approval, where it received 64 votes in favour and no opposition, as the opposition benches boycotted proceedings.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the passage as a demonstration of national unity, saying the house exhibited solidarity. He also condemned a recent terrorist incident in Wana, drawing parallels to the Army Public School massacre, and praised law enforcement for securing the safety of students and cadets.The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces, giving him constitutional authority over all three branches: army, navy, and air force. Honorary five-star ranks such as field marshal, marshal of the air force, and admiral of the fleet remain lifetime titles. According to the country's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the reform “aims to bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while preserving military honour and tradition.The bill also establishes a federal constitutional court (FCC) to handle constitutional and provincial matters, leaving the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases. The FCC will have equal representation from all provinces and the power to take suo motu notices on constitutional petitions. The Judicial Commission will oversee judge transfers; refusal of a transfer will be treated as retirement.The ruling coalition, including PML-N, PPP, MQM-P, and allies, backed the amendment. Opposition lawmakers condemned it as unconstitutional. PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan called it the “Baku Amendments” and accused the government of undermining democracy. Mehmood Khan Achakzai of PkMAP protested by tearing a copy of the bill in the house.The amendment now returns to the Senate for final approval before becoming law. Analysts say the 27th amendment significantly strengthens Munir’s role in Pakistan’s military hierarchy while altering judicial oversight, marking a shift in Pakistan’s institutional framework.(With input from agencies, Dawn)","The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Why it matters

The big picture

The Field Marshal’s expanding power evokes a hybrid of Pakistan’s two most dominant military rulers:

Ayub Khan, who introduced centralized presidential control and laid the foundations for military-led governance.

Zia-ul-Haq, who used the Army and Islamization to seize power, marginalize the judiciary, and suppress civilian opposition.

Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament.

If Zia’s coup was loud and brutal against a strong popular leadership, Munir’s is silent, yet possibly more far reaching, being done through a political front office that’s pliant and dependent on the Army for authority. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.

Pranab Dhal Samanta in the Economic Times

Zoom in

The transformation follows the India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025, a four-day exchange of air and missile strikes after the Pahalgam terror attack.

India’s Operation Sindoor targeted Pakistani airbases, radars, and command centers.

Pakistan requested a ceasefire after intense damage - a request reportedly initiated by Pakistan’s DGMO.

Donald Trump, who claimed to have brokered the truce(India has repeatedly denied the US President's claims), was effusively thanked by Munir and PM Shehbaz Sharif. Trump now calls Munir his “favorite field marshal.”

The Financial Times described their dynamic as a “bromance,” with Trump showcased on billboards across Pakistan alongside Munir and Sharif.

This international validation was followed by Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, the second such promotion in Pakistan’s history - and the first codified under the Constitution.

Between the lines

This isn’t just about military command - it’s about rewriting the DNA of the Pakistani state.

The amendment creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, potentially diluting the powers of the Supreme Court and creating ambiguity about the hierarchy of judicial authority.

President Zardari is also granted lifelong immunity in the amendment, mirroring the legal shield given to Munir.

This dual protection signals a strategic alliance between the military and top civilian figures to institutionalize mutual insulation from accountability.

“Too much has been left to ad hoc and arbitrary decisions,” Mazari warned.

The domestic question: Can repression deliver reform?

The three-front storm: Taliban, TTP, and India

“If you nurture snakes in your backyard, they will bite you,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military’s official spokesman, referencing the Taliban. What a comeuppance : The remark could just as well apply to all Pakistan-grown terror groups and the TTP, whose resurgence is a grim case of blowback.

The bottom line





In Pakistan, where generals have often ruled with impunity and influence, Field Marshal Asim Munir is scripting a new playbook-quiet, precise, and constitutionally sealed. His rise is not just another chapter in the country’s well-worn saga of military dominance. It is, as one senior opposition leader put it, “a rewrite of the entire power manual.”Pakistan’s controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment proposes to recast the country’s military command structure by abolishing the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and creating the role of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) - a position that will be held by the Army Chief, currently Field Marshal Asim Munir •The amendment vests unprecedented legal and constitutional power in the CDF, giving Munir operational and institutional control over the army, navy, and air force, as well as the country’s nuclear command.•It also grants five-star officers life-long rank, privileges, and immunity, a move seen as creating a parallel unelected authority beyond the reach of civilian or judicial oversight.“This amendment appears tailored to benefit a specific individual rather than to strengthen the defence structure,” Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, former defence secretary, told Dawn.The CJCSC post - created after the 1971 war to ensure coordination among services - will be dissolved on November 27, 2025, when the current chairman, Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, retires.The 27th Amendment represents the largest shift in Pakistan’s civil-military balance since the Zia era, codifying the military’s supremacy in a way that future civilian governments may struggle to reverse.•The military will no longer merely influence governance from behind the scenes - it will be constitutionally entrenched at the center of executive authority.•Strategic nuclear assets, previously overseen by the National Command Authority, will now fall under the commander of national strategic command, appointed by the PM on the army chief’s advice, and selected from within the army.“All nuclear weapons and delivery systems will be under army control, including second-strike missiles traditionally under the Navy,” warned Dr Shireen Mazari, former human rights minister, a Dawn report said.•The change grants the army a monopoly over promotions, transfers, and postings across the services, threatening morale and inter-service harmony.“If promotions in the Air Force and Navy are determined by an army-origin CDF, it could lead to festering resentments,” Mazari cautioned.At home, Munir is both omnipresent and embattled. According to a Financial Times report, his supporters compare him to Mohammed bin Salman or South Korea’s General Park - ruthless modernisers willing to bulldoze institutions in the name of reform. His critics, however, see echoes of Zia-ul-Haq’s theocratic militarism cloaked in constitutional legitimacy.The judiciary is already split, thanks to a proposed constitutional court that would dilute the Supreme Court’s power. Journalists are censored, civil rights groups are muzzled, and political opponents - most notably former Prime Minister Imran Khan - are jailed or silenced.And yet, Munir has cast himself as the architect of reform. In his speech at the Pakistan Military Academy, he spoke of “treasures hidden beneath our land” and claimed that Pakistan had begun to “regain its rightful place in the comity of nations.”But the economy tells another story. As per the FT report, Pakistan’s investment rate is the lowest in South Asia, its poverty rate has risen to 25%, and its youth unemployment is dangerously high. The country remains dependent on IMF bailouts and Gulf financing that has yet to materialise in promised volumes.While Munir consolidates power at home, Pakistan finds itself encircled by a resurgent triangle of threats - each historically rooted, each dangerously revived. In the west, the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has proved more liability than leverage. Once covertly supported by Pakistan’s security establishment, the Taliban now resist Islamabad’s demands and turn a blind eye to cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil.More ominously, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot long declared outlawed, has regrouped in Afghanistan and resumed attacks in Pakistan’s tribal belt and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This year alone, militant violence has killed over 1,400 people - the highest toll in a decade.“The military simply lacks political support on the ground there,” Iftikhar Firdous, founder of The Khorasan Diary, told FT. “The crackdown has alienated entire communities.”Simultaneously, Pakistan’s eastern border with India remains fragile after the four-day air conflict in May.Add to that domestic insurgencies in Balochistan and the Pashtun belt, and Pakistan now faces not one, but three overlapping security fronts. Instead of acting as a force-multiplier, the military’s expanding political and economic footprint is beginning to stretch its operational capacity thin.The 27th Amendment enshrines military supremacy in Pakistan's Constitution under the guise of reform and modernization.•It moves the country further away from parliamentary democracy, and deeper into military-led constitutional authoritarianism.•As Field Marshal Asim Munir prepares to become the first Chief of Defence Forces, Pakistan’s most consequential question remains: Can a military man fix a failing nation - or will history repeat itself?(With inputs from agencies)","Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment.

ISLAMABAD: A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence that the defence minister said had pushed the country into a ""state of war"".Pakistani govt ministers accused neighbouring Afghanistan of complicity in the bloodshed - an accusation Kabul denied - and vowed retaliation if Afghan authorities failed to rein in the militants Islamabad says were responsible. ""We are in a state of war,"" said defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif after the attack, the first strike on civilians in Islamabad in a decade. ""Bringing this war to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which Pakistan has the full power to respond. ""The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said. The court bomber blew himself up near the entrance at around lunchtime. Images on local media showed people covered in blood lying next to a police van. A vehicle was seen on fire and another car was badly damaged. Police cordoned off the site. Naqvi said the bomber had tried to enter the court building on foot but, unable to find a way in, detonated the device outside, close to a police vehicle.Several of the wounded were in critical condition, a hospital source said.No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The main Pakistani militant group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denied involvement in the attacks. But a group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, according to The Khorasan Diary, a digital platform in Islamabad that monitors militant activity in the region.TTP militants have in recent years focused attacks on security forces. Civilians had not been hit in Islamabad for a decade, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group that tracks attacks.Islamabad says that the Pakistani Taliban and other militants are based in Afghanistan, with the support of India. ""We are totally clear that Afghanistan has to stop them. In case of a failure, we have no option but to take care of those terrorists who are attacking our country,"" Naqvi said, speaking at the scene of the court bombing. The Taliban administration spokesperson in Kabul did not respond to a request for comment on Pakistan's accusations.The court attack happened hours after militants stormed a school near the Afghan border on Monday. The attack on the school in Wana, in the north west, began Monday, when a suicide vehicle rammed the main entrance, killing three people, Naqvi said. Militants then entered the school, which is run by the military but educates civilians.By Tuesday evening, three militants were still inside the compound, security officials said, with rescue operations under way for the students trapped in another part of the school.

Surge in militant violence and worsening ties with Afghanistan







Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country was “in a state of war” after a suicide bomber struck outside the Islamabad district courts on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 27.The blast one of the deadliest to hit the capital in recent years has intensified tensions with Afghanistan, with Asif accusing the Taliban government in Kabul of allowing militants to operate freely.In a post on X, Asif said: “Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: This is a war for all of Pakistan.”He wrote that Pakistan’s military was making “daily sacrifices while providing citizens with a sense of protection and security”, but warned that hoping for negotiations with Kabul would be a “mistake”. Asif insisted that Afghanistan “has the ability to prevent terrorist attacks inside Pakistan” and that bringing the conflict to the capital was “a message from Kabul”.He added that Pakistan “has the strength to respond fully”, saying the attack had erased any remaining doubts about the threat posed by militants operating from Afghan soil.The explosion took place around midday in Islamabad’s G-11 district, just outside the judicial complex where hundreds of lawyers and visitors were present. Police said the attacker tried to enter the court premises but failed, eventually detonating explosives next to a police vehicle, igniting cars and sending a fireball through the street.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed that 12 people were killed and 27 wounded. He said authorities had recovered a severed head believed to be that of the attacker, and CCTV footage captured him moments before the blast. Witnesses described scenes of chaos, with people screaming for help as ambulances rushed to the site.The blast comes amid a sharp rise in militant violence across Pakistan. Security officials say the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has carried out hundreds of attacks this year, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border, but strikes in major cities have been rare. Islamabad was last hit by a suicide attack three years ago.On Monday night, militants also attempted to storm an army-run college in Wana, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Security forces killed two attackers quickly, while others were cornered inside an administrative building. Students and staff were evacuated, and the military said the assault resembled the TTP’s 2014 massacre in Peshawar that killed 154 people.Pakistan says the Afghan Taliban have allowed TTP fighters to take refuge across the border. Afghanistan denies harbouring the group. Peace talks between Islamabad and Kabul have stalled, with Pakistan demanding written guarantees that Afghan territory will not be used for attacks.",Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif says country is in a state of war.

At least 12 people were killed and around 30 others injured after a car exploded near the district and sessions court near G-11 area in Islamabad on Tuesday, local media reported reported. Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif and President Asif Ali Zardari both termed the incident a “suicide blast,” and described the situation as ""Pakistan at war.""Confirming the casualties, the country's interior minister said that those injured were receiving medical care, adding that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was personally monitoring the situation and staying in contact with the hospitals treating the victims.The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, saying in a statement they had targeted judicial officials.""Our fighter attacked the judical commission in Islamabad. Judges, lawyers and officials who carried out rulings under Pakistan's un-Islamic laws were targeted,"" the group said in a statement, threatening to carry out more attacks ""until Islamic Sharia law is implemented"" in the Muslim-majority country, reported AFP.Police said the vehicle caught fire following the blast and was quickly engulfed in flames. The site was subsequently sealed off by authorities who launched a probe to determine the cause of the blast.A heavy contingent of police and security forces rushed to the scene, while rescue teams shifted the injured to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS). Hospital sources said several victims were in critical condition, warning that the death toll could rise.Authorities cordoned off the area and launched an investigation. According to sources, body parts believed to be of the suspected suicide bomber - including a head - were recovered from the site.Naqvi further said, “The attacker stood outside the court for around 12 minutes. He first attempted to go inside the court, but then targeted the police vehicle after he was unable to do so.""He added that an investigation was underway and identifying the attacker was a top priority. “I assure you we will identify him in the next few hours,” he said. “We are investigating this incident from different angles. It is not just another bombing. It happened right in Islamabad,” the minister added.He assured, that things would become clearer in the coming days, adding that those involved would not be spared.Inspector general of Islamabad police Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi and the chief commissioner visited the scene and were briefed on the incident and the ongoing probe. Police said nearby vehicles and motorcycles were also damaged by the explosion and ensuing fire. No group has claimed responsibility so far.In a post on X, Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his condolences to the bereaved families.Country's defense minister termed the incident as a 'wake-up call' for Pakistan, “We are in a state of war.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Sunday that it was committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban but demanded that Kabul must address concerns regarding the use of its territory by terrorists.Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi issued a statement on different media queries regarding the third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime in Istanbul on November 6, which concluded a day later. Turkiye and Qatar mediated the parleys.The peace talks ended without any agreement to tackle the thorny issues of cross-border terrorism , the top officials had said on Saturday.""Pakistan remains committed to the resolution of bilateral differences through dialogue. However, Pakistan's core concern, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needs to be addressed first and foremost,"" the FO said in a statement.It also said that Pakistan's Armed Forces and its people were well determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism from its soil and take action against its supporters, abettors and financiers.In the long statement, the spokesperson said that for the past four years, since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil.""Throughout these years, Pakistan, despite suffering military and civilian casualties, exercised maximum restraint and did not retaliate,"" it said.Pakistan's expectation was that the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna al Khawarij (TTP/FaK) elements present on Afghan soil, the FO said.The Pakistan government last year notified the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as ""Fitna al-Khawarij"", a reference to a group in earlier Islamic history which was involved in violence.Pakistan also tried to positively engage with Afghanistan by offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance, and the intention to constructively engage with Afghanistan so as to enable it to become a stable, peaceful and prosperous country that is at peace within and with its neighbours, the statement said.However, despite all these positive gestures, ""the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction,"" it added.Instead of acting upon the core expectation to stop Afghan territory from being used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions, it said.""Instead, it has tried to confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues. By confusing the main issue of terrorism, it keeps trying to develop a narrative which absolves the Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards the international community and its own people,"" it added.The statement said that Pakistan's October 2025 response to the consistent attacks emanating from Afghanistan was a manifestation of the will and determination that it will not leave any stone unturned to safeguard its territory and its people.The statement added that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK terrorists.Pakistan also accused the Afghan Taliban of using the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue, adding that they had fled in 2015 to avoid a military operation and fought together with the Afghan Taliban against Nato troops.""These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by the Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to the Afghan Taliban,"" it said, and added that the same terrorists established training camps in Afghanistan to launch terrorist activities in Pakistan.The FO rejected the Kabul excuse of lack of control over TTP and demanded definite and concrete actions. Pakistan also rejected the portrayal of TTP as refugees and asked Kabul to hand them over to Pakistan.It said Pakistan has never eschewed dialogue with any Government in Kabul, but it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group.",Pakistan says it is committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

What does it mean?



Opposition backlash and protests



Divided legal opinions



Support for reforms







Pakistan’s government has introduced a major constitutional change that has sparked widespread debate and protests across the country. The proposed 27th constitutional amendment, which will be voted on in Parliament next week, seeks to restructure the military’s chain of command and overhaul the judiciary, prompting strong criticism from the Opposition.The current move mirrors the era of General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s longest-serving de facto head of state, who introduced sweeping constitutional changes to entrench military control under a civilian façade. The proposed 27th Amendment, risks reviving that legacy by placing the armed forces once again at the centre of Pakistan’s political structure.The bill, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after cabinet approval, proposes to abolish the post of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC) and replace it with a new and more powerful position -- chief of defence forces (CDF).According to reports in Dawn, the post will be held by the serving chief of army staff, who will also become the constitutional head of the army, navy and air force. This change would make General Asim Munir the most powerful military officer in Pakistan’s history, formalising his recent promotion to Field Marshal.The amendment also includes plans to set up a new federal constitutional court (FCC) and change how high court judges are appointed.It seeks to transfer some powers from the Supreme Court to the new court, while also granting the president lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution.Pakistan law minister Azam Nazir Tarar presented the bill in the senate, where chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred it to a committee led by Farooq Naek for review. Naek said the goal was to “create consensus among members” before the bill comes up for voting on Monday. The government is confident of securing a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the national assembly.Opposition parties have strongly opposed the amendment, calling it a direct threat to Pakistan’s Constitution. A coalition of opposition groups, the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes Imran Khan’s PTI, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) has announced nationwide protests starting Sunday.“Democratic institutions have been paralysed within Pakistan… the nation must step up against the [proposed] 27th Amendment,” MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said.PkMAP leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai said the protests would begin with the slogan: “Long live democracy, down with dictatorship.” He warned, “The opposition alliance had no choice but to launch a protest movement following the government’s move, which is shaking the foundations of the Constitution.”Legal experts are split on the amendment’s impact. Critics say it would reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, making it “irrelevant,” and tighten executive control over the judiciary.One senior counsel told Dawn, “Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’.”Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar warned that the changes would “empower [the new] Federal Constitutional Court by disempowering the Supreme Court.” He said the amendment also gives the Chief of the Defence Forces constitutional authority for life, formally recognising the Field Marshal rank.Another lawyer pointed out that under the new Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC would outrank the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and serve until the age of 68 -- three years longer than the current limit of 65.Some legal experts, however, have welcomed the changes. Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar called the 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in Pakistan’s justice system.He said the plan to have two separate apex courts -- one for appeals (Supreme Court) and one for constitutional cases (FCC) -- would bring “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence.”He also argued that the reforms could reduce political influence in the judiciary, cut down case backlogs, and modernise the justice system.Khokhar added that the new defence structure under Article 243 was in line with “modern constitutional democracies,” ensuring that the armed forces would operate under a single advisory framework accountable to the prime minister, defence minister and National Security Committee.Newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association in Pakistan, President Haroonur Rasheed also supported the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court, saying it could help streamline the judicial process.","Proposed 27th constitutional amendment will be voted on in Parliament next week.

Blast Hits Jaffar Express in Pakistan, Several Injured

A train under siege



The months that followed saw a stream of attacks:

In October, a blast on the Sindh section of the railway line derailed five bogies and injured several passengers.

In September, an explosion on the track in Mastung derailed six coaches, leaving 12 injured.

In August, six coaches derailed after an improvised explosive device went off in Mastung, while days earlier a pilot engine came under gunfire.

In July and June, two separate blasts in Sindh derailed multiple coaches.

Late last year, a suicide bomber at Quetta Station killed at least 26 people.

One battle after another

Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday, citing “serious security concerns” in Balochistan, news agency PTI reported.The temporary suspension — enforced from 9 to 12 November — follows multiple insurgent attacks on the train over the past year, including a dramatic hijacking in March that left 26 people dead.Railway officials said the move came after fresh intelligence warnings of possible attacks targeting tracks, railway assets and civilian passengers. “The precautionary measure is based on advice from security and intelligence agencies to ensure the safety of passengers, railway staff, civilians and critical rail assets,” a senior official said, as quoted by PTI.The Jaffar Express is one of Pakistan’s busiest long-distance routes, carrying thousands of passengers daily at a cost far lower than road travel. Local commuters have criticised the shutdown, saying it leaves people in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with few affordable transport options.Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups, particularly the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).In March, BLA militants hijacked the train with 380 passengers on board, triggering a two-day standoff in a mountainous tunnel. Twenty-six people were killed before security forces rescued more than 350 passengers. Authorities said 33 militants also died in the rescue operation.Security officials say insurgent groups are increasingly targeting railways to cripple movement and signal the state’s inability to secure critical transport arteries. Analysts note that the frequency of attacks shows “a collapse of basic security control” across parts of Balochistan’s rail corridor.Political leaders in the province argue that Islamabad has ignored decades of local grievances. Balochistan National Party chief Akhtar Mengal recently warned that the state has “lost control” of the region, saying: “There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority.”The suspension comes as Pakistan faces one of its most dangerous security challenges in years. Not only has the BLA intensified operations across Balochistan, but attacks linked to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Islamic State Khorasan (ISK) and cross-border militants have surged.According to the latest Global Terrorism Index, Pakistan recorded a 45% jump in terrorism-related deaths this year. Security officials warn the country is now battling “four fronts at once”—an insurgent network straddling provincial, sectarian and cross-border lines.Diplomatic efforts have yielded little. Peace talks this week between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement, with both sides blaming each other for breakdowns in the ceasefire. Pakistan accuses Kabul of sheltering TTP fighters; the Taliban dismisses the allegations.","Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday.

Pakistan’s government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades. The proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after approval by the federal cabinet, rewrites the chain of command of the armed forces and places Field Marshall Asim Munir higher than any military officer before him.The bill restructures Article 243 of the Constitution and creates a powerful new post: Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). According to Dawn, the position will be held by the serving Chief of Army Staff, who will simultaneously become the constitutionally recognised head of Pakistan’s Army, Navy and Air Force. The development formalises General Munir’s elevation as Pakistan’s Field Marshal — a title that the government has already awarded but is now seeking to permanently embed into the Constitution.The changes have ignited intense debate in Islamabad, dividing political parties, lawyers and civil society. Supporters argue that the bill modernises command structures, while critics see it as a dramatic centralisation of military power that weakens civilian oversight.As per report from Dawn, the bill abolishes the position of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), the top coordinating office among Pakistan’s military services, from 27 November, when the tenure of the current CJCSC General Sahir Shamshad Mirza ends.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told Parliament that no new appointment will be made, because the Army Chief will take over the role’s functions as Chief of Defence Forces.Under the amendment, the President will appoint the Army, Naval and Air Chiefs on the Prime Minister’s advice, while the CDF will be constitutionally empowered to command all three services.A new position Commander of the National Strategic Command will oversee Pakistan’s nuclear and strategic arsenal. Dawn reported that the commander must be an officer from the Army, appointed by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the CDF. This further cements the Army Chief’s control over nuclear command authority.The bill also grants unprecedented rights to officers who attain five-star ranks such as Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force, or Admiral of the Fleet.Law minister Tarar clarified that Parliament not the Pakistan Prime Minister will have the power to cancel such titles.The amendment does not stop at the military. The second half of the proposal restructures Pakistan’s judicial system.According to Geo News, the bill establishes a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC): a powerful new judicial body that would:Legal experts quoted by Dawn warned that the changes could “dethrone” the Supreme Court as Pakistan’s top judicial authority. One senior counsel said the Supreme Court risked being turned into a “Supreme District Court”, dealing mostly with ordinary appeals, while constitutional matters shift to the FCC.Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar argued that the amendment tightens executive control over the judiciary and “empowers the FCC by disempowering the Supreme Court”.However, other senior lawyers called it a “forward-looking reform”. They say separating constitutional and appellate functions would reduce delays, depoliticise the Supreme Court and bring Pakistan closer to judicial models in other democracies.The bill has triggered fierce debate in Islamabad. The timing — months after Munir’s elevation and amid delicate coalition negotiations — has intensified public scrutiny.Dawn reported that the proposal surfaced after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari revealed that PML-N leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, requested PPP support for constitutional reforms.Government allies insist the reform merely formalises existing military structures and honours national heroes. Critics say it permanently rebalances power in favour of the Army.If adopted, the 27th Constitutional Amendment will be one of Pakistan’s most consequential defence reforms since the 1980s, dissolving one of the military’s oldest offices, raising the Army Chief to unprecedented constitutional supremacy, and reshaping Pakistan’s highest courts.","Pakistan's government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades.

Donald Trump Stuns Shehbaz Sharif With India-Pak Peace Remark After Gaza Ceasefire Summit In Egypt





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday once again thanked US President Donald Trump for resolving the India-Pakistan conflict in May.New Delhi has been consistently maintaining that India and Pakistan reached an understanding on May 10 to end the conflict after four days of intense cross-border drone and missile strikes, and no third party was involved in the process.""It was President Trump's bold and decisive leadership that brought about the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, restoring peace in South Asia, averting a major war, and saving millions of people,"" Sharif said while addressing Azerbaijan's Victory Day parade in Baku.Since May 10, when Trump announced on social media that India and Pakistan had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" after a ""long night"" of talks mediated by Washington, he has repeated his claim several times that he ""helped settle"" the tensions between the two countries.India has consistently denied any third-party intervention.Pakistan has praised Trump on multiple occasions, claiming that he brokered a ceasefire during the May conflict.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians.In his address, Sharif also mentioned Kashmir, saying that Azerbaijan's victory in Karabakh is a beacon of hope for all nations fighting against oppression.The Prime Minister said Pakistan seeks peace, but it will not allow anyone to challenge its sovereignty or undermine territorial integrity.The parade also included contingents of the armed forces from Pakistan and Turkiye who marched alongside Azerbaijani forces. The ceremony also included a splendid flypast of JF-17 Thunder jets.","Pakistan has praised Trump on multiple occasions, claiming that he brokered a ceasefire during the May conflict.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: A day after peace talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan in Turkey broke down, the Taliban on Saturday accused “elements within the Pakistani military” of pursuing “anti-Afghanistan policies for years. ”“Unfortunately, certain military elements in Pakistan appear to view a stable and strong Afghanistan as contrary to their interests,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement on X. “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts.”Mujahid also rejected claims that the rise of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was linked to the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul. “Some groups have falsely accused the Islamic Emirate, suggesting that instability in Pakistan and the TTP’s growth began with our arrival. In reality, both date back to 2002, a result of misguided policies by certain Pakistani military elements who aligned with the US, permitted drone strikes in Waziristan, and turned against their own people,” he wrote.He pointed to a series of Pakistani military campaigns against the TTP — including Operations Al-Mizan, Rah-e-Rast, Sher Dil, Nijat, Koh-e-Safid, and Zarb-e-Azb — that, he said, displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians.“In this so-called war on terror, 80,000–90,000 soldiers and civilians were killed, by Islamabad’s own count, long before the Islamic Emirate’s rise,” Mujahid added.Calling Pakistan’s instability “an internal issue,” Mujahid remarked the Taliban has taken steps to prevent cross-border militancy since taking power. These include mediating dialogue among political and religious figures, relocating refugees from the Durand Line, banning weapons among refugee populations, and issuing fatwas against unauthorized foreign jihad.“The Islamic Emirate welcomes all efforts that allow refugees to return safely,” he stated, reaffirming that Afghanistan would not allow its territory to be used to interfere in another country’s affairs.","The Taliban accused “elements within the Pakistani military’ of pursuing “anti- Afghanistan policies for years” “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125186693,imgsize-78016,width-400,resizemode-4/taliban-accuses-pakistani-military-of-fueling-instability-through-quotmanufactured-pretextsquot.jpg"

Will it make Pak army chief Asim Munir's position stronger?



Proposed change to Article 243 Description Why it increases Munir’s power Formal recognition of Field Marshal Field Marshal to be constitutionally recognized as a rank, not just an honorary title Grants Munir secure legal status, enabling tenure extension and legal protection against dismissal or demotion Creation of 'Commander of Defence Forces' (CDF) Establishes a new central position to oversee army, navy, air force Munir may transition to/head this role, consolidating command over all forces, superseding the current setup Shift of supreme command away from president to CDF Reduces President and PM’s operational control over armed forces Centralizes authority in Munir (as CDF or Field Marshal), further reducing civilian oversight Tenure extension via new constitutional language Secures longer term (potentially unlimited) for Munir in his new post Provides Munir greater continuity and leverage in national affairs Centralization of civilian government functions Ministries like education, population welfare moved under federal control Increases central government (and de facto military) power, indirectly empowering Munir Reduction of provincial autonomy Provincial share in federal resources reduced, central government gains more control Weakens provincial challenge to federal/military authority, strengthening Munir’s policy reach

Why Pakistani critics are skeptical?







Taking ""lessons"" from tensions with India, Pakistan has moved to fortify the constitutional basis of military command, signaling a push to modernize defense structures and tighten civilian-military coherence. Its law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house, a move aimed at revising Article 243 to formally enshrine the appointments and parallel ranks of the Army, Air, and Naval chiefs.Citing “lessons” from recent India-Pakistan standoffs, Tarar said the nature of modern warfare had changed, requiring constitutional alignment with evolving command realities.“Recent Pakistan-India tensions have taught us many lessons. The nature and strategy of war have completely changed. Appointment procedures and some positions were previously in the Army Act but were not mentioned in the 1973 Constitution. Parallel ranks exist worldwide for Air Chief and Naval Chief,” Tarar said.The move, however, has come under scanner as many believe it could give more power to military than the civilian government in Pakistan.India, on May 7, launched Operation Sindoor against terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists and targeting key JeM and LeT camps. The move, which came in retaliation to Pahalgam terror attack, turned into a major India-Pakistan issue with the latter also launching a military operation against India.By May 10, the two nations announced a ceasefire after Pakistan approached India for truce talks.Ten days after the truce, Pakistani army general Asim Munir was promoted to the rank of field marshal, the principal military advisor to the prime minister and the president of Pakistan on all matters related to national security. Before Munir, former Pakistan President Genral Ayub Khan had self elevated himself to field marshal in 1959.The proposed changes to Article 243 in Pakistan's Constitution, are designed to significantly bolster the authority of the military, specifically, army chief and recently designated field marshal Asim Munir. Here's how:According to an article by Pakistani media outlet Dawn, legal experts in Pakistan remain divided on whether such institutional adjustments truly warrant a constitutional amendment, noting that most operational reforms can be achieved through ordinary legislation rather than altering Article 243.Constitutional experts argued that modernising command structures or creating a Chief of Defence Staff-type position does not require amending Article 243. Such reforms could be introduced through ordinary legislation or defence rules. Altering the Constitution, they warned, risks expanding military autonomy under the guise of structural integration.Another confusion surrounding Article 243 stems from the changes introduced by the 26th Amendment, which extended the army chief’s tenure from three to five years. The current chief, appointed under the old law and later elevated to the ceremonial rank of field marshal, a position not mentioned in the Constitution, has become the focal point of legal ambiguity.Dawn reported that experts remain divided on whether his term automatically extends under the new law or requires a fresh notification, raising questions about the real intent behind the proposed 27th Amendment: to resolve this technical uncertainty or to further cement the military’s influence within Pakistan’s constitutional framework.","Pakistan's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house.

Another crisis brewing? Pakistan on brink of food supply collapse as flour shortage deepens; prices hit the roof,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/another-crisis-brewing-pakistan-on-brink-of-food-supply-collapse-as-flour-shortage-deepens-prices-hit-the-roof/articleshow/125183013.cms,"Pakistan Cries Foul At UNSC As India Holds Indus Waters Treaty In Abeyance Over Pahalgam Attack

Prices surge, tandoors punished

Trade paralysis and a deepening food crisis

Water shortage adds to worries – dams running dry





(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s twin cities are staring at a worsening flour emergency after the Punjab food department halted wheat supplies to mills in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, triggering panic across markets and raising questions over the country’s fragile food security. The sudden suspension has deepened an already tense economic climate, with transport blockades, water shortages and declining dam levels all feeding fears of another nationwide crisis.Dealers say all existing orders for flour, wheat and fine flour were cancelled from Friday night, leaving shops and tandoor owners without stock, PTI reported citing the The Express Tribune.The Rawalpindi Flour Mills Association, which held an emergency meeting to address the crisis, warned that “production will remain paralysed” unless wheat permits are restored immediately. The association described the ban as “ill-considered” and cautioned that shortages could spiral into a humanitarian emergency in the federal capital and adjoining regions.Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers. According to the Pakistan Naanbai Association, the price of a 79-kilogram sack of red flour has doubled to PKR 11,000 since the Shehbaz Sharif–Maryam Nawaz government took office.Fine flour, used widely for bread and bakery items, has risen from PKR 6,200 to PKR 12,600.The association’s president, Shafiq Qureshi, accused authorities of “state oppression”, claiming that dozens of tandoors have been demolished and nearly a hundred sealed for selling roti at higher prices in line with rising flour rates. Many owners have been fined between PKR 25,000 and PKR 50,000. “Instead of fixing the wheat supply, they are taking out their frustration on us,” Qureshi said, warning that families are being pushed to breaking point as bread becomes increasingly unaffordable.While wheat supply chokes Punjab’s food chain, Pakistan’s transport routes are already gridlocked due to deteriorating relations with Afghanistan. Thousands of trucks carrying food items, pharmaceuticals and export consignments for Afghanistan and Central Asia have been stranded at ports and highways.Senior Vice Chairman of the Goods Transport Association Imdad Hussain Naqvi said drivers are stuck without food, water or security. “This is not just a loss for transporters; it's a loss for the entire state,” he said, as quoted by PTI. He further warned that perishable goods are rotting on highways and thousands of workers are on the brink of starvation.The current wheat crisis comes months after India regulated flows from the Chenab following the Pahalgam terror attack. The move had contributed to a sharp drop in water levels at the country’s two key dams, Mangla and Tarbela.Pakistan is among six countries with the highest levels of inefficient agricultural water use, worsening freshwater losses amid arid conditions, according to the World Bank’s first global water monitoring report, Continental Drying: A Threat to Our Common Future.The study highlights that inefficient irrigation in drying regions—particularly in Pakistan, Algeria, Cambodia, Mexico, Thailand, Tunisia, and Romania—drives massive water waste, with more than two-thirds linked to water-intensive crops.","Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers.

"Sheikh Hasina: Verdict biased, politically motivated",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sheikh-hasina-verdict-biased-politically-motivated/articleshow/125398333.cms,"Hasina Verdict Sparks Outrage as Ex-Indian Envoy Questions Evidence and Awami League Cries Black Day





DHAKA: Former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina was on Monday sentenced to death in absentia by a tribunal for ""crimes against humanity"" over her govt's crackdown on a ""nationwide mass uprising"" last year that led to her ouster. She was accused of crimes such as murder, attempted murder and torture, and other inhumane acts as well as ordering the use of lethal weapons, helicopters and drones to subdue protesters.The Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal's (ICT) verdict, which came months before the parliamentary election, described Hasina, 78, as the ""mastermind and principal architect"" of the violent repression that killed hundreds of protesters, including students. Hasina, whose Awami League has been barred from contesting the poll scheduled to be held in Feb, fled to India in Aug 5 last year amid the unrest.In a statement, Hasina described the ICT as a ""rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected govt with no democratic mandate"", referring to the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt. The judgment is ""biased and politically motivated"" and ""in their distasteful call for death penalty, they reveal the brazen and murderous intent of extremist figures within the interim govt to remove Bangladesh's last elected PM and nullify Awami League as a political force,"" Hasina said.The ICT also handed death sentence to her close aide and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal on similar charges. The third accused in the case and former inspector general of police Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, who testified as a state witness, was sentenced to five years in prison.Hasina said the charges were unjustified, arguing that she and Khan ""acted in good faith and were trying to minimise the loss of life. We lost control of the situation, but to characterise what happened as a premeditated assault on citizens is simply to misread the facts.""Her Awami League party called for a national shutdown on Tuesday to protest the verdict. Hasina cannot appeal the verdict unless she surrenders or is arrested within 30 days of the judgment.The three-member tribunal, headed by chairman Justice Md Golam Mortuza Majumder, began delivering the verdict around 12.30pm, which was broadcast on state-owned BTV. Some of those in the packed courtroom cheered when Hasina was sentenced to death. He admonished them. In a statement, Yunus said the verdict offered justice to those who were harmed in the uprising: ""No one, regardless of power, is above the law."" The BNP, headed by former PM Khaleda Zia, hailed the verdict. In a message to AP, Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed said the ""verdict is a joke and meaningless.""","Sheikh Hasina sentenced to death in absentia by a tribunal for ""crimes against humanity"" She was accused of crimes such as murder, attempted murder and torture.

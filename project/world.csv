Afghan man goes on trial over deadly Munich car-ramming,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/afghan-man-goes-on-trial-over-deadly-munich-car-ramming/articleshow/126556652.cms,"Spate of attacks







MUNICH: An Afghan man goes on trial in Germany on Friday accused of ramming a car into a crowd in Munich last year, killing a two-year-old girl and her mother and injuring dozens.The suspect, partially identified as Farhad N., faces two charges of murder and 44 of attempted murder, with prosecutors saying he acted out of a ""religious motivation"" and expected to die in the attack.The vehicle rampage in February 2025 was one of several deadly attacks linked to migrants which inflamed a heated debate on immigration ahead of a general election that month.Farhad N, who was 24 at the time, is accused of deliberately steering his BMW Mini into a 1,400-strong trade union street rally in Munich on February 13.The vehicle came to a halt after 23 metres (75 feet) ""because its front wheels lost contact with the ground due to people lying in front of and underneath the car"", according to the charge sheet.A 37-year-old woman and her young daughter were both hurled through the air for 10 metres and sustained severe head injuries of which they died several days later.Prosecutors have said Kabul-born Farhad N. ""committed the act out of excessive religious motivation"", and that he had uttered the words ""Allahu Akbar"", meaning ""God is the greatest"", after the car rampage.""He believed he was obliged to attack and kill randomly selected people in Germany in response to the suffering of Muslims in Islamic countries,"" they said when he was charged in August.However, he is not believed to have been part of any Islamist militant movement such as the Islamic State group.Farhad N. arrived in Germany in 2016, at the height of the mass migrant influx to Europe. His asylum request was rejected but he was spared deportation, found work and was able to remain in the country.Police said Farhad N. worked in security and was heavily engaged in fitness training and bodybuilding.The Munich attack came a month after another Afghan man had carried out a knife attack on a kindergarten group that killed two people, including a two-year-old boy, in the city of Aschaffenburg.The perpetrator was later ordered to enter psychiatric care after judges found he had acted during an acute psychotic episode.In December 2024, six people were killed and hundreds wounded when a car ploughed into a Christmas market in the eastern city of Magdeburg. A Saudi man was arrested and is currently on trial.Several Syrian nationals were also arrested and charged with attacks or plots at around the same time, including a knife attack that killed three people at a street festival in the city of Solingen.Germany took in more than a million asylum seekers in 2015-2016 at the height of Europe's migrant crisis -- an influx that has proved deeply divisive and fuelled the rise of the far-right AfD.Conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who took power last May, has vowed to crack down on criminal migrants and has ramped up deportations of convicts to Afghanistan.Germany in December also deported a man to Syria for the first time since that country's civil war broke out in 2011.","Two-year-old girl and her mother killed after car ploughed into a crowd in Munich.

'Phase two' of Gaza ceasefire launched: Violations continue as US plan moves to next stage





US President Donald Trump on Thursday (local time) announced the formation of a Gaza board of peace, calling it a key step in the second phase of a US-backed plan aimed at ending the war in the Palestinian territory.In a post on Truth Social, Trump described the board as the “greatest and most prestigious board ever assembled”, without giving further details, adding that the names of board members would be revealed shortly.He wrote: ""It is my great honour to announce that the bard of peace has been formed. The members of the board will be announced shortly, but I can say with certainty that it is the greatest and most prestigious board ever assembled at any time, any place. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""The announcement comes soon after the formation of a 15-member Palestinian technocratic committee. This committee has been tasked with handling the day-to-day administration of Gaza once the war ends. According to the plan, the committee will function under the supervision of the board of peace, which Trump is expected to chair.The broader proposal also includes the deployment of an international stabilisation force for maintaining security in Gaza and training selected Palestinian police units.The US-backed Gaza peace plan first took effect on October 10. It led to the return of all hostages held by Hamas and brought an end to active fighting in the besieged territory. Israeli forces, however, have killed 451 people since the ceasefire came into effect, according to the Gaza health ministry, raising questions about the stability of the ceasefire.",US President Donald Trump announced the formation of a Gaza board of peace.

DHAKA: Bangladesh's interim government of Muhammad Yunus on Thursday approved a draft ordinance to indemnify from prosecution the protesters who led the demonstrations that toppled then prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League regime on August 5, 2024.At a press briefing, Law Adviser Asif Nazrul said ""the July revolutionists"" were indemnified for the acts they committed with an aim of ""political resistance"" during the uprising under the ""July Mass Uprising Protection and Accountability Ordinance"".""We had announced this earlier.

Jonvic Remulla says no anger toward Vitaly Zdorovetskiy as deportation moves forward





Russian streamer and YouTuber Vitaly Zdorovetskiy did not expect his online fame to end this way. The Russian-born YouTuber, known worldwide as Vitaly “VitalyzdTv” Zdorovetskiy, is now preparing to leave the Philippines and return to Russia after months of legal trouble.GMA News quoted Bureau of Immigration Legal Division chief Arvin Santos, who confirmed that a formal deportation order had already been issued after Vitaly Zdorovetskiy completed all court-required penalties and received clearances from the courts and the National Bureau of Investigation.Zdorovetskiy was arrested in April 2025 after a series of public incidents that caused concern across the country. Authorities said his actions included public disruption, theft, trespassing, and reckless driving. These incidents led to formal charges and court proceedings under Philippine law.In January 2026, immigration officials confirmed that Vitaly Zdorovetskiy had already served the required time of punishment for his criminal cases. After reviewing the court decisions, authorities moved forward with a deportation order. According to reports, he will be sent back to Russia, which is officially recognized as his home country.Speaking to GMA News, Bureau of Immigration Legal Division chief Arvin Santos explained that the process followed strict legal steps.“It is stated in our deportation order that his deportation is subject to clearances from the National Bureau of Investigation and from the courts where he had cases. His cases at the Taguig Regional Trial Court and the Metropolitan Trial Court have already been resolved, and the penalties imposed there are also considered served,” Santos said.Officials also noted that while his charges could have carried a sentence of up to about 18 months, his time in detention during investigations and legal processing was already counted.Interior and Local Government Secretary Jonvic Remulla addressed the issue to calm public concern and protect the country’s image among tourists. He made it clear that the Philippines remains open and welcoming, as long as visitors respect local laws.“We welcome visitors, but they are expected to follow the same rules,” Remulla said.He also stressed that there is no personal anger toward Zdorovetskiy and that the case was handled purely through legal channels.“We have no ill feelings against Vitaly. He has served his time and he has shown his remorse and he is now a free man when he goes back to Russia,” Remulla said.While Zdorovetskiy holds an American green card, officials clarified that he is legally considered a Russian citizen. Because of this, deportation to Russia was the correct legal outcome.Authorities also confirmed that he was not just held for immigration reasons, but was properly charged, tried, and processed through Philippine courts before the deportation order was approved.Also Read: “Secret Beekeeper Society”: Nick Fuentes Calls Candace Owens Claims Wild After Charlie Kirk Time Travel And Future Vision Talk","Russian YouTuber Vitaly Zdorovetskiy faces possible deportation to Russia after Philippines arrest and court penalties.

Share of the world economy: stability where others have slipped

Productivity and competitiveness: the transatlantic gap

Wealth concentration and capital formation

Billionaire Census 2025

Why others have struggled to keep up

A different kind of imbalance





For more than a decade, the idea of American decline has hardened into a familiar refrain. Polarised politics, institutional strain and a relentless cycle of domestic crises have made it easy to assume that US power is ebbing, particularly when measured against a supposedly rising China and a cohort of wealthy democratic allies. Yet when the economic data are examined alongside comparable figures from the G7 and other advanced economies, the picture looks far less straightforward.The United States remains an outlier among rich nations: not free of problems, but unusually resilient in output, productivity and wealth creation. That resilience becomes most visible when America is viewed not in isolation, but relative to its peers.In 1990, the United States accounted for roughly 26 percent of global gross domestic product. More than three decades later, and after repeated predictions of China’s inevitable overtaking, the US share remains virtually unchanged at about 25.9 percent, assuming Beijing’s own growth figures are accurate. That consistency matters because the global economy is far larger today than it was at the end of the Cold War, with US output alone reaching an estimated $30.62 trillion in 2025.The contrast with America’s closest allies is stark. When the Cold War ended, Britain, France, Italy, Japan and Canada together represented around 32 percent of global GDP.Today, that combined share has fallen to below 14 percent. This relative contraction reflects weaker productivity growth, demographic pressure and prolonged underinvestment, particularly in Europe and Japan.At a more granular level, per-capita comparisons underline the divergence. Using data from the International Monetary Fund , the US Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Census Bureau, Mississippi, the poorest US state by GDP per capita, now outperforms four G7 countries on the same measure, while West Virginia with the second-lowest per capita GDP surpasses all six non-US G7 members. Since 2020, US GDP per capita has risen by roughly $20,000, a gain no other G7 economy has matched even over much longer periods.Productivity has been a decisive factor in this widening gap. The United States has outpaced the rest of the G7 in productivity growth, both nationally and at state level, driven by technology adoption, capital depth and labour mobility. Europe’s struggle to keep up has been formally acknowledged at the highest levels. Mario Draghi’s 2024 report on European competitiveness , commissioned by the European Commission, warned that Europe is losing ground to the US and China in productivity, innovation and technological scale. Without EU-wide industrial policy, deeper capital-market integration, large-scale joint investment in digital and green technologies, and a break from what Draghi called a “small-state mentality”, he argued the continent faces a “slow agony”: weaker growth, declining industrial capacity, falling global influence and a shrinking ability to fund social and strategic priorities over time.The resilience of the US economy is also reflected in the accumulation of private wealth. According to Altrata’s World Ultra Wealth Report 2025 , the United States now houses 38 percent of the world’s ultra-high-net-worth population, individuals worth more than $30 million, a larger share than the next ten countries combined. In absolute terms, 192,470 Americans control approximately $22.3 trillion in private wealth.Also read: Why America keeps winning the billionaire game The pace of accumulation has accelerated rather than slowed. Altrata reports that the number of ultra-wealthy Americans rose by 21 percent in the past year alone. China, the nearest competitor, holds about $5.9 trillion across 54,020 individuals, a fraction of the US total. Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, France, Italy and India all trail at a considerable distance.This concentration is not confined to inherited fortunes. The United States continues to generate new wealth through entrepreneurship at a scale unmatched elsewhere. Of the world’s five richest individuals, Elon Musk , Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg , Jeff Bezos and Larry Page , all are American and all built fortunes rooted in technology platforms that reshaped entire industries. Their companies function as capital-generating ecosystems, reinforcing US dominance in finance, innovation and market depth.Altrata’sadds another layer. North America’s billionaire population rose by 7.8 percent last year to 1,198 individuals, of whom 1,135 are American. Their combined wealth now exceeds $13 trillion, more than the market capitalisation of Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA combined.By comparison, wealth creation elsewhere has faced structural constraints. China’s ultra-wealth population has continued to grow, but at a slowing pace, as tighter state control and trade restrictions weigh on its technology sector. Europe crossed the symbolic threshold of 1,000 billionaires for the first time, yet its growth remains more cautious and institutional, with less tolerance for the volatility that characterises US capitalism.That volatility, often criticised by regulators abroad, has proved central to American dynamism. The same conditions that unsettle other economies, rapid technological change, market swings, aggressive capital reallocation, have allowed the US to adapt quickly and continue generating new entrants at the top end of the wealth spectrum. In 2024 alone, Altrata found that 10 percent of individuals globally worth between $1 billion and $2 billion dropped below that threshold, yet in the US new billionaires replaced them almost immediately.None of this negates America’s challenges. Income inequality remains the highest in the G7, infrastructure investment has lagged, and healthcare costs remain structurally high. Public finances are under sustained strain: the US closed fiscal year 2025 with a federal deficit of roughly $1.8 trillion, only marginally lower than the previous year, adding to an already elevated debt burden. The economy also relies heavily on buoyant equity markets and continued investment in artificial intelligence, both of which remain vulnerable to shifts in sentiment and capital flows.But measured against its peers, the United States has not drifted into economic marginality. Instead, it has pulled further ahead at a time when many allies have struggled to adapt. Strong allies once amplified American power. Today, the imbalance runs the other way.Predictions of American decline tend to focus inward, drawing conclusions from political dysfunction alone. A comparative view, grounded in output, productivity and wealth, suggests something more complex: a country whose internal problems coexist with an economic position that remains, by global standards, unusually strong.","In 1990, the United States accounted for roughly 26 percent of global gross domestic product.

Kuwait Airways is shaking up global air travel in 2026 with the announcement of five exciting new direct international routes, strengthening its connectivity between the Gulf, Europe and Asia. The carrier, already serving more than 60 destinations worldwide, is expanding its line-up to include dream leisure spots and strategic business hubs. This move signals both confidence in post-pandemic travel demand and an ambitious bid to make Kuwait a more significant global aviation hub.The new direct services were confirmed in a report by Kuwait Times and while exact start dates for some destinations will be announced closer to mid-2026, a standout launch is already capturing attention. Flights from Kuwait to Mykonos, Greece, are set to resume with a twice-weekly service beginning June 14, 2026. Mykonos is one of Europe’s most popular sun-soaked holiday islands, making it a major draw for both Gulf residents and visitors.Here’s a look at the destinations Kuwait Airways is adding in its 2026 expansion:While Mykonos already has a firm launch date, the exact flight schedules for Beijing, Maldives and Phuket are expected to be published closer to their respective take-off times later in 2026. Kuwait Airways’ new routes reflect a mix of leisure-centric and business-oriented strategy. Destinations like Mykonos, the Maldives and Phuket are perennial favourites among holidaymakers, especially travellers from the Middle East seeking sun, sea and sands without complex transfer logistics.Moscow and Beijing deepen Kuwait’s connectivity with major economic and political capitals, supporting trade, tourism and diplomatic ties.The expansion comes at a time when global aviation is rebounding from pandemic disruptions and airlines are increasingly eyeing direct connections to win back passengers who prefer nonstop travel over long haul journeys with layovers. This trend is also visible in other carriers in the region. For example, Etihad Airways expanded flight options to Europe and Asia in recent seasons, adding year-round and seasonal destinations to its Abu Dhabi network.Kuwait Airways’ network boost is part of a larger regional picture in which Gulf carriers are aggressively expanding routes to connect the Middle East with fast-growing markets in Europe and Asia. Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad and flydubai have similarly broadened their international reach in recent years, responding to robust demand from both leisure explorers and business travellers.For Kuwait, these new flights represent more than just tourism opportunities. They are strategic steps toward enhancing the country’s role as a global transit and tourism hub. With direct flights to top holiday destinations and major capitals alike, Kuwait Airways is positioning itself as a competitive choice for travellers throughout the Gulf and beyond.Kuwait Airways’ 2026 expansion marks a bold chapter in the airline’s global strategy, positioning the Gulf carrier as a key bridge between continents and cultures, with direct flights to sun-soaked beaches, island paradises and vital world capitals.","Kuwait Airways opens five new destinations for business and leisure travel in 2026.

A widespread outage disrupted Verizon’s mobile and data services across the United States on Wednesday, leaving tens of thousands of customers unable to make calls or access cellular data, The New York Times reported.According to the report, Verizon said it was working to restore services after more than 170,000 users flagged problems on Downdetector, a website that tracks service disruptions. The tracker showed the outage began just after noon. Many affected users said their phones displayed “SOS” in the status bar where the network signal normally appears.The Associated Press reported that outage complaints peaked in the early afternoon and remained elevated into the evening, with around 33,000 reports still logged as of 8 p.m. ET. Verizon did not specify the cause of the disruption but said engineering teams had been deployed to resolve the issue “as quickly as possible.”Verizon also acknowledged the outage in posts on X. The company said, “We are aware of an issue impacting wireless voice and data services for some customers. Our engineers are engaged and are working to identify and solve the issue quickly. We understand how important reliable connectivity is and apologize for the inconvenience.”In a later update, Verizon said its “team is on the ground actively working to fix today’s service issue that is impacting some customers. We know this is a huge inconvenience, and our top priority is to get you back online and connected as fast as possible.”Impacted users across the country reported “SOS” mode or no-signal messages on their devices. In New York, alerts warned residents that the outage could disrupt 911 calls, urging them to use landlines, devices from other carriers, or visit police or fire stations in person in case of emergencies, the Associated Press reported.Major hubs affected included Washington D.C., Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles and Atlanta, though customers nationwide reported disruptions.","Verizon says it is working to restore services after more than 170,000 users flagged problems on Downdetector.

US Navy sailor betrays America: Jinchao Wei sentenced for spying for China – inside the secret mission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/us-navy-sailor-betrays-america-jinchao-wei-sentenced-for-spying-for-china-inside-the-secret-mission/articleshow/126534032.cms,"In a significant breach of trust, ex-US Navy sailor Jinchao Wei has received a sentence exceeding 16 years behind bars. Wei engaged in espionage by selling critical military information, including intricate technical manuals and operational specifics on US Navy vessels, to a Chinese intelligence agent, pocketing over $12,000 in the process.

A former US Navy sailor, Jinchao Wei, also known as Patrick Wei, has been sentenced to 200 months in prison for selling sensitive military information to a Chinese intelligence officer.25-year-old Wei was convicted by a federal jury in August 2025 following a five-day trial and one day of deliberation. He was arrested in August 2023 as he arrived for work on the amphibious assault ship USS Essex at Naval Base San Diego.The Justice Department said Wei received over $12,000 for transmitting national defence information. The evidence presented at trial showed that he sent photographs, videos, and thousands of pages of technical and operational manuals about US Navy ships to a Chinese intelligence officer between March 2022 and August 2023. The materials included details on weapons, propulsion, steering, aircraft and deck elevators, desalination systems, and damage-control procedures. Many manuals contained export-control warnings.“Members of the United States military swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States,” said Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.He added: “This active-duty U.S. Navy sailor betrayed his country and compromised the national security of the United States.The Justice Department will not tolerate this behavior. We stand ready to investigate, defend, and protect the interests of the American people.”Wei held a US security clearance that gave him access to sensitive national defence information. Amphibious assault ships like the Essex allow the Navy to project power and maintain an expeditionary presence, making the data he shared more important.Evidence showed that Wei was recruited on February 14, 2022, by a Chinese intelligence officer who initially posed as a naval enthusiast working for the state-owned China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation. Wei suspected the true nature of the contact and even warned a Navy friend that he was “on the radar of a China intelligence organisation” and that the person’s requests were too obvious. Despite this, he continued communications using encrypted messaging apps and began sharing sensitive information.Wei used secret digital methods to hide his activities, including digital “dead drops” that disappeared within 72 hours and new computers and phones provided by his handler. He even created hand-written receipts to document payments for the stolen information. In a post-arrest interview, Wei admitted, “I’m screwed,” and later said, “That I’m sharing the unclassified document to—I mean document with, uhm, him . . . I’m not supposed to do that.”During the trial, Wei was convicted of six counts, including conspiracy to commit espionage, espionage, and unlawful export of technical defence data. He was found not guilty of one count of naturalisation fraud. FBI Special Agent Mark Dargis said, “The FBI will aggressively defend our homeland from anyone threatening our national security, including those on the inside betraying their sworn duty to the United States. ”","Jinchao Wei, 25, has been sentenced to 200 months in prison for selling sensitive military information to a Chinese intelligence officer. Wei was arrested in August 2023 as he arrived for work on the amphibious assault ship USS Essex at Naval Base San Diego. The Justice Department said Wei received over $12,000 for transmitting national defence information.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126534032,imgsize-643637,width-400,resizemode-4/126534032.jpg"

Currency collapse sparked demonstrations





Iran on Thursday closed its airspace amid threats from US President Donald Trump over its crackdown on the protests which have rocked the Islamic Republic since the last two weeks.According to a New York Times report, more than 3,400 people have been killed in the demonstrations. The death toll included over 100 security personnel and thirteen childrenAdditionally, more than 18,400 people have been detained.Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi rejected the claims of mass causalities and accused Israel of hatching a conspiracy to create a large number of causalities in the country.In an interview with the Fox News, Araghchi played down the death toll in his country and claimed that the number is in hundreds.""When terrorist elements led from outside, entered this, you know, protests and started to shoot, you know, police forces, police officers and security forces. And there were terrorist cells. They came in, they used Daesh-style terrorist operations. They got police officers, burned them alive, they beheaded them, and they started shooting at police officers and also to the people,"" Iranian foreign minister said.""So as a result, for three days, we had, in fact, fighting against terrorists, and not with the protesters. It was completely a different story,"" he added.During the interview, he also said that the Iranian government is not planning to hang the detained protestors, claiming that the situation is under government's control.""We are in full control,"" Araghchi said.""And let's, you know, hope that wisdom would prevail. And we don't go for a high level of tension, which could be disastrous for everybody,"" he added.Responding to a question from Fox News host Bret Baier on whether he had a message for President Trump, who is considering some kind of action to help the protesters on the ground, the Araghchi said ""My message is do not repeat the same mistake that you did in June,"" the Iranian Foreign Minister said.""You know, if you try a failed experience, you will get the same result,"" he added.""You know in June, you destroyed the facilities, the machines, but the technology cannot be bombed. And the determination also cannot be bombed,"" Abbas Araghchi added.Araghchi said that the ""terrorists"" are shooting people just to drag US into the conflict.""They wanted to increase the number of deaths. Why? Because President Trump has said that if there are killings, he would intervene. And they wanted to drag him into this conflict,"" the Iranian foreign minister told Fox News.""And that was exactly an Israeli plot. They started to increase the number of deaths by killing ordinary people, by killing police officers, by starting a kind of, you know, fighting inside the different cities,"" he added.Amid the ongoing chain of events, Iran further extended its airspace to commercial aircraft. A notice to pilot said the closure was estimated to last until 7:30 am local time. A previous order had closed the airspace for just over two hours.However, the government offered no explanation of the decision to shut its airspace.Meanwhile, Air India and IndiGO also issued a travel advisory warning of possible delays as they said that their flights are using an alternative routing after the closure of Iran airspace.""Due to the emerging situation in Iran, the subsequent closure of its airspace, and in view of the safety of our passengers, Air India flights overflying the region are now using an alternative routing, which may lead to delays,” it said in a post on X.“Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to passengers due to this unforeseen disruption. Safety of our passengers and crew remains top priority,” it added.Meanwhile, Air India cancelled Thursday morning’s Delhi-New York JFK (AI 101), Delhi-Newark (AI 105) and Mumbai-JFK (AI 119). The return flights were consequentially also cancelled.IndiGo’s Baku-Delhi flight early Thursday morning also returned to the Azerbaijan capital within an hour as it was to overfly Iran after crossing the Caspian Sea.Earlier on Wednesday, some US military personnel were advised to evacuate military base in Qatar as Trump warned of possible action after a deadly crackdown on protesters in Iran.The decision came as a senior official in Tehran brought up the country's retaliatory attack in June at Al Udeid Air Base outside Doha, Qatar.An official, on the condition of anonymity, told news agency Associated Press that the move was precautionary and said such measures also were being taken across the region. The official, citing the need for operational security, would not go into further detail, including whether the evacuation was optional or mandatory, whether it affected troops or civilian personnel, or how many people were advised to leave.The US Embassy in Qatar issued a notice early Thursday saying it had “advised its personnel to exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel” to Al Udeid Air Base. “We recommend US citizens in Qatar do the same,” it added. In Kuwait, the US embassy ordered a “temporary halt” to its personnel going to multiple military bases in the small Gulf Arab country amid heightened tensions. Kuwait is home to U.S. Army Central, the service’s Mideast command.Talking to news agency Reuters, Trump said that Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi ""seems very nice"" but expressed uncertainty over whether Pahlavi would be able to muster support within Iran to eventually take over.""He seems very nice, but I don't know how he'd play within his own country,"" Trump said. ""And we really ‌aren't up to that point yet.Trump's comments went further in questioning Pahlavi's ability to lead Iran after saying last week that he had no plans to meet with him.Trump added that it is possible the government in Tehran could fall due to the protests but that in truth ""any regime can fail.""""Whether or not it falls or not, it's going to be an interesting period of time,"" he said.The demonstrations began December 28 over the collapse of the Iranian rial currency, as the country’s economy is squeezed by international sanctions levied in part over its nuclear program.Trump has repeatedly warned about potential US military action over the killing of peaceful protesters, just months after American forces bombed Iranian nuclear sites during a 12-day war launched by Israel against the Islamic Republic in June.In other developments, a mass funeral was held on Wednesday for some 100 security force members killed in the demonstrations. Tens of thousands of mourners attended, holding Iranian flags and photos of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The caskets, draped in Iranian flags, stood stacked at least three high. Red and white roses and framed photographs of the dead covered them.People elsewhere remained fearful in the streets. Plainclothes security forces still milled around some neighborhoods, though anti-riot police and members of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard's all-volunteer Basij force appeared to have been sent back to their barracks.“We are very frightened because of these sounds (of gunfire) and protests,” said a mother of two shopping for fruits and vegetables, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. “We have heard many are killed and many are injured. Now peace has been restored, but schools are closed, and I’m scared to send my children to school again.”Ahmadreza Tavakoli, 36, told The Associated Press he witnessed one demonstration in Tehran and was shocked by the use of firearms by authorities.“People were out to express themselves and protest, but quickly it turned into a war zone,” Tavakoli said. “The people do not have guns. Only the security forces have guns.”","Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi accused Israel of hatching a conspiracy to create a large number of causalities in the country. He also said that the Iranian government is not planning to hang the detained protestors, claiming that the situation is under government's control.

Iran linked to past plots and threats against Trump





Iranian state television aired footage on Sunday that included a threat directed at US President Donald Trump, following his recent warning of potential military action against Iran’s leadership.The footage showed a mourner at a ceremony for Iranian security personnel killed in recent unrest holding a placard with an image of Trump, referring to the assassination attempt he survived at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in 2024. Text in Farsi beneath the image read: ""This time it will not miss the target"".The incident represents Tehran’s most direct threat against Trump to date, coming after his repeated warnings that the United States would strike Iran if it continued its crackdown on anti-government protesters.Trump was the target of an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was shot in the ear by a gunman identified as Thomas Crooks.The footage was aired on the Islamic Republic of Iran News Network (IRINN), a state-controlled television channel. It was broadcast during a funeral ceremony in Tehran for more than 100 members of the security forces and others described by authorities as “martyrs” killed during recent demonstrations.At the ceremony, attendees held banners reading “Death to America!” while others carried photographs of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The semiofficial Tasnim news agency, which is widely regarded as being close to Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, reported that the funeral marked the first in a series of state ceremonies planned for security personnel in the coming days, as cited by The Independent.Rights groups outside Iran have said that more than 150 members of the security forces and government personnel have been killed during over two weeks of unrestIranian authorities have characterised the demonstrations as “riots” and accused protesters of carrying out “acts of terror”.Iran has previously been linked to assassination plots abroad, most often aimed at Iranian dissidents, with varying outcomes. Iranian officials have also repeatedly vowed to kill Trump following his order to assassinate General Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force, in January 2020.A video released in 2022 by Iranian state-linked media depicted a simulated assassination attempt on Trump at his Mar-a-Lago golf course ahead of the 2024 election.The video resurfaced after the arrest of Ryan Routh, who was detained while allegedly attempting to take aim at Trump at the same golf course, as cited by the New York Post.The US Justice Department has also said that in 2024 it disrupted an Iranian-directed plot to kill Trump, following the arrest of Farhad Shakeri, who court documents say was tasked by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps with carrying out the killing.The current protests broke out in Iran on December 28 after the collapse of the rial, amid economic pressure linked to international sanctions imposed in part over the country’s nuclear programme.Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi gave a different account in an interview with Fox News, saying the protests began peacefully and that authorities initially engaged with demonstrators. He said the unrest later turned violent after what he described as “terrorist elements led from outside” Iran became involved.","Iran has previously been linked to assassination plots abroad, most often aimed at Iranian dissidents, with varying outcomes.

Trump Reveals New Venezuela Leader? Makes U-turn On Delcy, ‘Backs’ Machado After Maduro’s Capture





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday praised Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado for presenting him with her Nobel Peace Prize medal, an award she was conferred months ago.In a post after receiving the medal, Trump took to Truth Social, calling Machado a “wonderful woman.” “It was my great honor to meet María Corina Machado , of Venezuela, today. She is a wonderful woman who has been through so much. María presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you, María!” he wrote.Machado said she presented Trump with her Nobel medal “as a recognition of his unique commitment to our freedom.” After the meeting, she told supporters that the interaction had gone well and that they could “count on” the US president.A White House official confirmed that Trump intends to keep the medal.However, days ago, the Nobel Committee and institute clarified on the permanence of a Nobel laureate's status. It announced that the prize can not be revoked, shared, or transferred to others.The meeting came just days after Trump launched strikes on Venezuela under Operation Absolute Resolve, which led to the toppling of President Nicolas Maduro and his capture along with his wife, who were taken into US custody thereafter.The US raid in Caracas on January 3 had briefly raised hopes among Venezuela’s embattled pro-democracy opposition, led by Machado, who had called for an “end to tyranny” in the country.However, Trump soon sidelined Machado after the US kidnapped Maduro, arguing that she lacked both domestic support and the respect needed to lead the country.Venezuela’s opposition maintains that Maduro rigged the 2024 election to deny victory to Machado’s party, allegations that have been backed by Washington.On Thursday, the White House said Trump’s view of Machado remains unchanged.","US President Donald Trump met with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.

Thank you for joining us today,” remarked Hegseth.“Though the training was gruelling, the fact that ‘no foreign defence minister had ever trained with me before and that this is a historic moment’—as Secretary Hegseth joyfully noted—was more than enough compensation.

American dream fading? US universities plunge in world rankings while surprising nation takes top spot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/american-dream-fading-us-universities-plunge-in-world-rankings-while-surprising-nation-takes-top-spot/articleshow/126553114.cms,"The fading American dream



Why the sudden loss?



China: The new America?







Living the American dream has been on the bucket list for numerous individuals across the world. The journey, as it was known, began with taking the first step and enrolling in an esteemed American educational institution, which was renowned for being the best in the world. Followed by picking up jobs and slowly carving your own career and personal life in the country.Out of the many ways America exercised its soft power, educating the world's best was at the top. However, with Trump's relentless attacks on higher education and its institutions, it seems America might be on the verge of losing one of its most profitable economic sectors, education. New York Times report recently cited the ratings compiled by the Middle East Technical University and they were shocking. While Harvard maintains the third position for academic performance, Stanford is now the only other American college to be in the top-ten list.Who's at the top? Chinese universities have been steadily gaining demand due to the volume and quality of research they produce. As per the Leiden Rankings, compiled by the Centre for Science and Technology Studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands, first in the list is Zhejiang University in China.While Harvard still remains at the top for highly-cited scientific publications, there are seven other Chinese schools in the top 10.Another list, Times Higher Education, compiled in Britain ranked Oxford University at the top with M.I.T., Princeton, University of Cambridge and Harvard along with Stanford in the top five.However, further down the list, 62 American schools went lower in ranks than last year. Whereas, two Beijing schools, Peking University and Tsinghua University went from 42nd and 47th to 12th and 13th, respectively.Some well-known American schools have dropped shockingly in rank. While Duke University fell from 20th to 28th, Emory University dropped from 85th to 102nd and Notre Dame from 108th to 194th.This reordering comes after the Trump administration slashed millions in research funding to American schools that depended heavily on the federal government to fund their scientific endeavours.While these policies did not start the decline, they could surely accelerate it, states the outlet. Rafael Reif, a former president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said on a podcast in 2025 that “the number of papers and the quality of the papers coming from China are outstanding” and are “dwarfing what we’re doing in the U.S.”Added to the situation are travel bans and a nationwide deportation drive that have discouraged applications from the brightest minds across the globe. The number of international students arriving in the U.S. in August 2025 was 19 per cent lower than in 2024, hurting not only the prestige of American schools but also their profits.As per the outlet, China has been shedding billions of dollars into its universities and making them attractive for foreign researchers. In the fall of 2025, the country began offering visas to graduates of top universities in science and technology to visit to study or do business.“The scientific and technological revolution is intertwined with the game between superpowers,” said President Xi Jinping in a 2024 speech, highlighting the administration's focus on the education sector.While globally China is already being considered America's top contender in dominance, it seems lucrative fields like education must also be analysed.","Zhejiang University in China ranks first in the Leiden Rankings, compiled by the Centre for Science and Technology Studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands.

'They're powerful': Venezuela's acting president 'not afraid' of 'diplomatic clash' with US; urges 'respect' for Maduro,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/theyre-powerful-venezuelas-acting-president-delcy-rodriguez-not-afraid-of-diplomatic-clash-with-us-urges-respect-for-maduro/articleshow/126553119.cms,"Venezuela's acting President Delcy Rodriguez addresses the National Assembly in Caracas





Venezuela’s acting president Delcy Rodriguez on Thursday said her government was “not afraid” of a diplomatic confrontation with the United States, even and called on Washington to show “respect for the dignity” of her predecessor Nicolas Maduro, who was ousted in a US military strike.“We have asked of the government of the United States... respect for the dignity of president Nicolas Maduro and respect for the dignity and integrity of the first lady” Cilia Flores, who is also in custody, Rodriguez said in an address to parliament, as quoted by AFP.Maduro and Flores were taken by US forces to New York to face drug trafficking charges, after the vice president Rodriquez was recognised as interim leader provided her government stays with Washington, particularly on access to Venezuela's vast oil resources.Rodriguez also said her government was “not afraid” of a diplomatic confrontation with the United States. “We know they are very powerful, we know they are a lethal nuclear power... We are not afraid to confront them diplomatically, through political dialogue,” she said. Rodriguez, a Maduro ally, is considered someone US President Donald Trump is willing to work with, provided she aligns with Washington’s directives.Rodriguez had spoken by telephone on Wednesday with US President Donald Trump, who described her as “a terrific person.”Trump said on social media that he and Rodriguez had discussed “many topics,” including oil, minerals, trade and national security. “We are making tremendous progress,” he added.In a separate development with regards to oil, Rodriguez, during her parliament address, announced plans to reform the country’s oil legislation as she seeks to recalibrate relations with Washington.Without offering specifics, Rodriguez told parliament that the reforms would address Venezuela’s anti-blockade law, which gives the government tools to counteract US sanctions imposed since 2019.Since Maduro’s capture, President Donald Trump has claimed that the United States now controls Venezuela and its oil sector, demanding what he describes as unfettered access.Rodriguez has been navigating a diplomatic tightrope, trying to meet Trump’s demands without alienating Maduro loyalists who control Venezuela’s security forces and feared paramilitaries.She described her call with the US leader as “productive and courteous” and characterised by “mutual respect.”On Thursday, Rodriguez said that if she must ever visit Washington as interim president, “I will go standing, walking, not dragged.""While Trump has so far cold‑shouldered Venezuela’s opposition, which is widely considered to have won the July 2024 presidential elections, on Thursday he met opposition leader Maria Corina Machado for what the White House called “positive” talks.","Venezuela’s acting president Delcy Rodriguez said her government was “not afraid’ of a diplomatic confrontation with the United States.

Former US senator Kyrsten Sinema, who left politics and has now become a lobbyist, has been sued by a North Carolina woman, Heather Ammel, who claimed that Sinema, the bisexual former Democrat leader, stole her husband, leading to their divorce. The lawsuit claims Sinema wooed her head of security Matthew Ammel by purchasing him a personal massager, drinking Dom Perignon with him in Cindy McCain’s suite at a U2 concert, suggesting he score MDMA so she could “guide him through a psychedelic experience,” and taking him to a Taylor Swift concert.In her complaint, Heather said her husband is an Army veteran who was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after deployments to the Middle East. They married in 2010, and she was a stay-at-home mom. In 2022, he got a job as part of Sinema’s security detail.In 2023, Ammel became the chief and the then chief told him on way out that Sinema was havinhg sexual relations with other security members.Matthew Ammel began accompanying Sinema on work trips in 2023, according to the complaint. They went to Napa Valley, then to a U2 concert at The Sphere in Las Vegas. They began chatting frequently on the encrypted messaging app Signal.Sinema sent him pictures of herself wrapped in a towel, the lawsuit says. The senator volunteered to help him work through his mental health issues and suggested he pick up MDMA to aid in a “psychedelic experience. ”The lawsuit mentions that Ammel attended Swift's concert with Sinema in Miami, the concert for which he previously arranged tickets for his wife and their three children. After returning from a trip to Saudi Arabia with Sinema in November 2024, Matthew Ammel separated from his wife, the complaint said, adding that they are still in a relationship, though Sinema left politics.","Kyrsten Sinema has been sued by a North Carolina woman, Heather Ammel, who claimed that SinemA stole her husband, leading to their divorce.

Russia's ULTIMATUM To NATO As Troops Land In Greenland; 'If You Don't Stop, You Will Face Severe...'





The White House on Thursday reiterated that President Donald Trump wants to 'acquire Greenland' and that the deployment of European troop will not affect his plans to take control of the Arctic island from Denmark.""The President has made his priority quite clear. He wants the United States to acquire Greenland. He thinks it is in our best national security to do that,"" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a media briefing.Also talking about Europe deploying troops to Greenland she said, “I don't think troops in Europe impact the president's decision-making process, nor does it impact his goal of the acquisition of Greenland at all.""Her comments came as European Nato countries began deploying military personnel to the strategic Arctic territory, prompting a sharp response from Russia. The move follows a high-level meeting in Washington between US, Danish and Greenlandic officials that failed to bridge what Denmark described as a “fundamental disagreement” over Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory Trump has repeatedly said the US needs to seize for security reasons.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Thursday that a “working group” would be established to discuss strengthening Arctic security, but stressed that the initiative would not resolve the underlying dispute. “The American ambition to take over Greenland remains intact,” Frederiksen said, calling the situation “a serious matter” and adding that Denmark would continue efforts to prevent such a scenario, according to AFP.The remarks came as France, Germany, Sweden and Norway announced the deployment of military personnel to Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, as part of a reconnaissance mission. Greenland’s deputy prime minister, Mute Egede, said Nato forces would have a greater presence on the island in the coming days, with increased military flights and naval activity, adding that the troops would be “training”, AFP reported.Germany’s defence ministry said the mission was intended to examine ways to ensure Arctic security in response to “Russian and Chinese threats”. French President Emmanuel Macron said the first French military personnel were already en route.Russia reacted strongly to the deployments, with its embassy in Belgium saying the expanding NATO presence in Greenland was “of serious concern” and accusing the alliance of building up forces under a “false pretext” of threats from Moscow and Beijing.Trump has argued that if the United States does not take control of Greenland, “China or Russia will”, remarks that have heightened tensions within Nato and raised concerns among Greenland’s residents about becoming caught in a broader geopolitical confrontation.","White House says deployment of European troops will not affect plans to 'acquire' Greenland from Denmark.

The United States claimed Iran halted 800 planned executions following pressure from President Donald Trump over Tehran’s crackdown on nationwide protests, even as Washington warned that military action remains an option.“The president understands today that 800 executions that were scheduled and supposed to take place yesterday were halted,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday.“All options remain on the table for the president,” she said, adding that Trump had warned Iran of “grave consequences” if the killing of demonstrators continued.The White House also said that ""President Donald Trump is closely monitoring the situation on the ground in Iran,"" as quoted by Reuters.Earlier, Trump had said said that intermediaries from Iran had conveyed guarantees that executions would be halted. According to Trump, the assurances came from “very important sources on the other side,” even as regional allies grew increasingly concerned that rising tensions could trigger direct confrontation.With rhetoric from Washington and Tehran temporarily softening, a senior Saudi official told AFP on Thursday that Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman spearheaded an urgent diplomatic push to restrain Trump, citing fears of “grave blowbacks in the region”.The official said the three Gulf states mounted what he described as “a long, frantic, diplomatic last-minute effort to convince President Trump to give Iran a chance to show good intention”, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the discussions.A second Gulf official corroborated the account, saying the diplomatic outreach also included a warning to Tehran that any strike on US facilities in the region would “have consequences”.The developments come as Iranian authorities continue a nationwide internet shutdown that activists fear is intended to conceal the scale of the crackdown. The blackout has now entered its seventh day. “Exactly one week ago... Iran fell into digital darkness as authorities imposed a national internet blackout,” internet monitoring group Netblocks said in a social media post, as quoted by AFP.Meanwhile, the US announced a new round of sanctions targeting Iranian officials accused of repressing protests challenging Iran’s theocratic leadership. Among those sanctioned is the secretary of Iran’s Supreme Council for National Security, whom the US Treasury Department accuses of being among the first officials to call for violence against protesters.The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control also designated 18 individuals and companies alleged to be involved in laundering money from Iranian oil sales through a shadow banking network linked to sanctioned institutions Bank Melli and Shahr Bank. Shadow banking refers to financial activities that resemble traditional banking but operate outside standard regulatory frameworks.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the United States “stands firmly behind the Iranian people in their call for freedom and justice” and that Treasury “will use every tool to target those behind the regime's tyrannical oppression of human rights.”The protests erupted on December 28 following the collapse of Iran’s rial currency, as the country’s economy has come under pressure from international sanctions imposed in part over its nuclear programme.Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi offered a different account during an interview on Fox News Channel’s “Special Report with Bret Baier” on Wednesday, saying the protests began peacefully “and the government engaged with the protesters and with their leaders.” He said that after the tenth day, however, “terrorist elements led from outside” the country appeared and the demonstrations turned violent.In February, Trump reimposed a “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran aimed at blocking its development of nuclear weapons, including US-led strikes on three major Iranian enrichment facilities.While the threat of US retaliation over the deaths of protesters continues to loom, Trump has signalled the possibility of de-escalation, saying the killing appeared to be ending.The sanctions bar the targeted individuals and entities from accessing property or financial assets held in the US and prohibit US citizens and companies from doing business with them, though US officials acknowledge the measures are largely symbolic, as many of those sanctioned do not hold assets in US institutions.","The United States claims Iran halted 800 planned executions following pressure from President Donald Trump.

What is the Trump phone?





Questions are mounting over whether hundreds of thousands of customers who paid deposits for the Trump Mobile “T1” phone last year will receive refunds, as Democratic lawmakers urge federal regulators to investigate the venture for possible consumer protection violations.A group of Democratic lawmakers has asked the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to examine Trump Mobile, a phone business launched by President Donald Trump’s sons, Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump. The request centres on concerns that customers may have been misled after paying $100 deposits for a phone that was promised months ago but has yet to be delivered.Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, along with 10 other Democratic members of Congress, sent a letter to the FTC questioning whether Trump Mobile engaged in deceptive advertising, or even fraud. The lawmakers specifically raised concerns over claims that the T1 phone would be “Made in the USA”, a description that has since been quietly removed from the company’s website.Less than a month after the product launch in June, references to US manufacturing disappeared and were replaced with the phrase “American-proud design”.The lawmakers also asked whether consumers were misled into paying deposits for a product that has not materialised.NBC News placed a $100 deposit in August to track the phone’s progress. In October, customer service staff promised a ship date of November 13, which passed without delivery. A later update blamed delays on the government shutdown. This week, another operator said the phone was now expected to ship “sometime in Q1 2026”, claiming it was “in the final stages of certification and field testing”.In their letter, lawmakers urged the FTC to investigate “bait-and-switch tactics involving deposits for products never delivered”. They added that the agency’s response would be a test of its independence and commitment to “protecting the public from deceptive or unfair business practices”.Online criticism has intensified. California governor Gavin Newsom’s office posted on X and called MAGA journalists to investigate the matter: ""We call on Nick Shirley, Benny Johnson, and Nick Sortor — who some say are the greatest investigators of our time — to use their powers of journalism to investigate this rampant fraud being perpetrated upon the American people!""Ron Filipkowski also wrote that “600,000 suckers pre-ordered Trump Mobile phones which were supposed to be made in the US and delivered in September”, adding that customers still do not have their phones and are receiving conflicting explanations. Social media started speculating that the phone is being manufactured in China.The Trump Mobile T1 gold smartphone is a $499 device first announced in June 2025 and marketed with a patriotic theme and wireless plans. Hundreds of thousands of customers paid a $100 deposit, but the phone has repeatedly missed launch deadlines and still has not shipped as of January 2026.",Democratic lawmakers have asked the FTC to examine Trump Mobile.

SENATE DRAMA: Vance Saves Trump as War Powers Vote Collapses | Venezuela | Iran





US President Donald Trump on Thursday met Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado at the White House, where she presented him with her Nobel Peace Prize medal.The meeting was confirmed by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who described Machado as “a remarkable and brave voice for many of the people of Venezuela,” and said Trump had anticipated a “good and positive discussion. ”However, Leavitt played down expectations that the meeting marked a shift in Trump’s stance toward Machado’s political future. Asked whether the president still believed she lacked sufficient support to lead Venezuela, Leavitt said his view remained unchanged. “I think the president’s assessment that you just pointed out was based on realities on the ground. It was a realistic assessment based on what the president was reading and hearing from his advisors and national security team, and at this moment in time,” she said.Leavitt added that Trump remains “committed to hopefully seeing elections in Venezuela one day,” but declined to specify any timeline.Machado later told reporters that she had presented Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize medal, calling it “a recognition for his unique commitment with our freedom.” The White House did not immediately confirm whether Trump accepted the medal.Later, Trump also confirmed the gesture calling Machado a ""wonderful woman"".It was my Great Honor to meet María Corina Machado, of Venezuela, today. She is a wonderful woman who has been through so much. María presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you María!"" he said on Truth Social.The meeting followed a closed-door discussion at the White House, after which Machado briefly greeted supporters gathered outside. “We can count on President Trump,” she told them, prompting chants of “Thank you, Trump"".The meeting comes less than two weeks after US forces captured Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in Caracas and transported them to New York to face drug trafficking charges. Machado’s political coalition is widely believed to have won Venezuela’s disputed 2024 presidential election, results that were rejected by Maduro before his arrest.Despite Thursday’s meeting, Trump has previously questioned Machado’s credibility and ability to govern. He has also signalled a willingness to work with acting President Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro’s former vice president, who continues to oversee day-to-day government operations alongside other members of the ousted leader’s inner circle.Leavitt saidthat Machado sought the meeting without preconditions. “I don’t think he needs to hear anything from Ms. Machado,” she said, beyond a “frank and positive discussion about what’s taking place in Venezuela.”Machado spent roughly two and a half hours at the White House and later visited Capitol Hill for meetings with senators. She did not answer questions from reporters about the Nobel medal as she departed, responding only with “gracias.”The White House meeting took place as Washington intensifies pressure on Venezuela’s oil sector, including the recent seizure of a sanctioned tanker linked to Caracas. US officials say interim authorities under Rodríguez have been cooperating with Washington, including releasing detainees held under Maduro. Five Americans were freed earlier this week. However, the acting president, in her address to parliament, said that she ""was not afraid"" of ""diplomatic clashes"" with the US. She further said that she told the US government to show ""respect for the dignity"" of ousted leader Maduro.Trump said on Wednesday that he had a “great conversation” with Rodríguez, his first since Maduro’s ouster. “We had a call, a long call. We discussed a lot of things,” Trump said. “And I think we’re getting along very well with Venezuela.”Even so, Trump has continued to express scepticism about Machado’s leadership prospects. Shortly after Maduro’s capture, he said it would be “very tough for her to be the leader,” arguing she lacked sufficient support within the country.Machado, who has spent much of the past year in hiding after briefly being detained in Caracas, has sought to avoid openly confronting Trump, while quietly building ties with US conservatives and senior officials. Her appearance in Washington marks one of her highest-profile public outings since winning the Nobel Peace Prize last year.","US President Donald Trump met Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado at the White House.

Travel ban on 39 countries versus visa freeze on 76 countries

39 travel ban countries

Partial ban:

Immigration attorney Steven Brown said it is unlikely that India could ever face a visa freeze in the US as India is low on using government resources in the US. But that does not mean it can't change ever, the attorney said explaining the Trump administration's sudden visa freeze on 75 countries, including many of those which were already facing travel ban.Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Pakistan are on the list of the 75 countries. Afghanistan has been facing travel ban as well but the rest are new inclusions. That makes India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives from South Asia excluded from the list.The president has a broad discretion over 212(f) to deny entry to any group of nationals, Brown said, adding that the first Trump administration saw a Muslim ban. There can be no certainty on what's next but this freeze is predicated on countries that use government resources, the attorney said.The US State Department said the visa pause for 75 countries will remain active until the US can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people. The decision comes in the wake of a major welfare scam allegedly being uncovered in Minnesota by the Somali immigrants.In December 2025, the administration published a list of 39 countries from which nationals are either fully or partially banned from traveling to the US.Most of those countries are also featured on the new list of 76 countries. But the immigrant visa ban is not meant for tourists, students, or people coming to the US for employment. The immigrant visa freeze means people seeking permanent residency or Green Cards in the US will be affected.Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Myanmar (Burma), Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Laos, Libya, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Yemen, and Palestinian Authority travel document holders under the full travel ban.Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, Dominica, Gabon, The Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Togo, Tonga, Turkmenistan, Venezuela, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belize, Bhutan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Myanmar, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominica, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, The Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, North Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Republic of the Congo, Russia, Rwanda, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Yemen.","Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Pakistan are on the list of the 75 countries.

Shaksgam Valley: India bristles over China's fresh claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shaksgam-valley-india-bristles-over-chinas-fresh-claim-dispute-explained/articleshow/126529230.cms,"Why China Building Roads In Shaksgam Valley Is A Direct Strategic Challenge For India In Kashmir

What is the Shaksgam Valley?

What is the dispute about?

Why does Shaksgam Valley matter strategically?

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh



The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth



The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications



Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims



For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?





NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The Shaksgam Valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region. It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east. It is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India's claims over Pakistan- occupied Kashmir, and China's growing footprint in the Himalayas.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126529183,imgsize-1792158,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"

Pact To Power Bloc: How Turkish Arms, Saudi Money And Pakistan Nukes May Align In Islamic NATO





Islamic Nato in the making? Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, this can be seen as an effort in direction to reshape security alignments in the Middle East region and beyond, as Bloomberg reported.The pact, initially signed by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in September, reportedly states that “any aggression” against one member would be treated as an attack on all -- a provision that mirrors Article 5 of Nato, of which Turkey is a member and fields the second-largest military after the US.Talks on Turkey’s entry are said to be at an advanced stage, with a deal appearing likely, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on condition of anonymity.Bloomberg reported that the expanded alliance reflects growing overlap in the strategic interests of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan across South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa.Turkey also sees the arrangement as a way to strengthen its security and deterrence posture at a time when questions persist over US reliability and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato, despite Washington’s close military ties with all three countries.Saudi Arabia would bring financial strength to the grouping, Pakistan its nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkey contributes military experience and a rapidly expanding defence industry, said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.“As the US prioritizes its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan said.Turkish defence ministry declined to comment on the report. Pakistan’s information ministry did not respond to requests for comment, while Saudi officials were unavailable over the weekend.If Turkey formally joins the pact, it would highlight a new phase in relations with Saudi Arabia, once rivals for leadership of the Sunni Muslim world. After years of strained ties, the two countries are now deepening economic and defence cooperation, including holding their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.Despite shared concerns over Shiite-majority Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia favour engagement with Tehran rather than confrontation. They also back a stable, Sunni-led Syria and support Palestinian statehood.Turkey and Pakistan already enjoy close military ties. Ankara is building corvette warships for Pakistan’s navy, has upgraded Islamabad’s F-16 fighter jets, and shares drone technology with both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

‘Not 1, Not 1,000’: Jem Chief Masood Azhar Returns With Audio Threat As India Tightens Terror Noose

Def experts: Azhar’s statement sign of post-Sindoor frustration





A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","New audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar has surfaced on social media.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality





Pakistan on Saturday claimed that Iraq has expressed “keen interest” in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft, following talks between the air chiefs of the two countries.According to a statement issued by the Pakistan Army, air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, chief of air staff of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), met lieutenant general staff pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi, commander of the Iraqi Air Force, during an official visit to Iraq.The discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, including joint training, capacity building and operational coordination.“The Iraqi air chief praised PAF’s professionalism and technological advancement, expressed interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak trainer aircraft,” the statement said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Both sides also agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability between the two air forces.The JF-17 Thunder is a single-engine, lightweight combat aircraft jointly developed by China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.Pakistan has claimed that the aircraft proved its capabilities during last year’s conflict with India, although its effectiveness remains disputed.Pakistan had also deployed Chinese-origin J-10 fighter jets during the May 7–10 hostilities with India.The development comes days after Pakistan and Bangladesh air chiefs held talks on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 jets by Dhaka. However, Bangladesh has not officially confirmed any such plan.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif recently claimed that the country has seen increased interest in its fighter aircraft following the May 2025 standoff with India. Reports have also suggested that Pakistan is exploring similar defence deals with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, amid ongoing financial pressures.Notably, Pakistan has repeatedly relied on International Monetary Fund support in recent years, with the IMF approving a $7 billion bailout in September 2024 and an additional $1.4 billion loan in May 2025.",Iraq has expressed “keen interest’ in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft.

'Cry of a wounded conscience': Hindu man killed in Pakistan; sparks widespread protests in Sindh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/cry-of-a-wounded-conscience-hindu-man-killed-in-pakistan-sparks-widespread-protests-in-sindh/articleshow/126447724.cms,"Hindu Farmer Killing in Sindh Triggers Protests A Day After India Exposed Pak's Record on Minorities





Widespread protests erupted in Pakistan’s Sindh province after a young Hindu farmer was killed by a landlord in Badin.According to a report by Pakistan's news outlet the Nation, Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.Following Kolhi’s death, demonstrators staged sit-ins on the Badin–Hyderabad National Highway and the Badin–Thar Coal Road. Hundreds of vehicles remained stranded for hours as protesters demanded justice for the killing of Kolhi and vowed not to disperse until those responsible are arrested.According to a statement shared by activist Shiva Kachhi, the protest has been ongoing without pause.“The protest for the arrest of the killers of the martyred Kailash Kolhi is making history. Shiva Kachhi, Chairman of Pakistan Darawar Ittehad, is leading the historic protest sit-in. This was not just a protest—it was the cry of a wounded conscience. From 10:00 am yesterday until late into the night, the sit-in continued without pause, proving that the demand for justice cannot be silenced,” Kachhi said in a social media post on X.“Men, women, elderly people, and innocent children stayed on the streets with one voice and one demand: justice for Kailash Kolhi.Arrest the killers. Despite exhaustion, hunger, and the cold of the night, the determination of the protesters remained unshaken. Kailash Kolhi’s only ‘crime’ was that he was poor, marginalised, and courageous enough to exist in a system that protects the powerful and crushes the weak. The tears of his children, the grief of his mother, and the silent agony of his widow are today questioning the entire system: Is the blood of the poor so cheap?” he added.Earlier, the victim’s family and community members staged a protest by placing the body at Piru Lashari Stop, where the SSP Badin assured them that the accused would be arrested within 24 hours.The incident occurred four days ago in Raho Kolhi village in the Piru Lashari city area. Despite assurances from district police officials, the main accused has yet to be arrested.The ongoing protest has drawn participation from leaders and workers of several political, nationalist, religious, and social organisations, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Jiye Sindh Mahaz, Qaumi Awami Tehreek, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (Bashir Qureshi group), and Awami Tehreek, The Nation reported.","Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif in a controversial statement has urged the United States and Turkey to “kidnap” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if they believed in justice and humanity, over the Israel-Gaza conflict.In a televised interview, whose clips have now gone viral on social media, Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away.”He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it.”Describing Netanyahu as the “worst criminal of humanity,” Asif claimed that “no atrocities in history match those committed against Palestinians in Gaza.” He added, “No community has done what Israel has done to Palestinians in the last 4,000-5,000 years. He [Netanyahu] is the biggest criminal of humanity. The world has not seen a bigger criminal.”Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes, beginning a sentence with, “And what does the law say about those who support such criminals…” before the show’s anchor, Hamid Mir, interjected and called for a break.Mir warned that Asif’s remarks risked being interpreted as a veiled reference to US President Donald Trump, and indicated that Asif would not remain on air after the break.Pakistan does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has historically expressed strong support for the Palestinian cause. Islamabad also maintains close ties with Iran, another regional critic of Israeli policies.The international criminal court (ICC) has previously issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu in connection with alleged war crimes in Gaza, a legal development referenced during the interview.","Khawaja Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away” He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it” Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126438854,imgsize-837064,width-400,resizemode-4/khawaja-asif-file.jpg"
Gen Z uprising in Pakistan? PhD student's article challenges those in power — why it was taken down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/gen-z-uprising-in-pakistan-phd-students-article-challenges-those-in-power-why-it-was-taken-down/articleshow/126409692.cms,"Badshahi Mosque, Lahore (AP photo)





Is Pakistan heading towards a Gen Z uprising? A PhD student from the country has sparked a debate after critically examining present-day Pakistan, under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and army chief and de facto power centre Asim Munir , without naming either directly.The piece, written through a lens that shows contrast in powerful boomer generation and youth of Gen Z-Alpha, quickly struck a chord online and became a flashpoint for what many described as a quiet rebellion. It highlighted the widening divide between Pakistan’s ruling establishment, often referred to as “Boomers,” and its increasingly restless Gen Z population.The article, titled “It is over,” was written by US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani and published in Pakistan’s daily The Express Tribune on January 1. It was later taken down, reportedly following pressure from the Pakistani military.“For the older men and women in power, it's over. The young generation isn't buying any of what you're trying to sell to them. No matter how many talks and seminars you arrange in schools and colleges, trying to promote patriotism, it isn't working,” Nizamani wrote.Writing from the perspective of Gen Z and Generation Alpha, Nizamani rejected what he described as an imposed narrative of patriotism pushed by those in power, arguing that such efforts no longer resonate with young Pakistanis.“Young minds, the Gen Z, the alphas, they know exactly what is happening, and despite your consistent efforts of trying to 'sell' your views of patriotism to them, they are seeing right through it. Thanks to the internet, thanks to whatever little education we have left, despite your best efforts of keeping the masses as illiterate as possible, you have failed. You have failed to tell people what to think, they are thinking for themselves. They might be a little too scared to speak their minds because they prefer breathing,” Nizamani wrote.He argued that forced patriotism, speeches and seminars cannot replace justice, opportunity and basic rights, and said young people clearly see corruption, inequality and hypocrisy despite censorship and propaganda.Nizamani also highlighted generational differences over economic freedom, writing, “The Gen Z wants erased restrictions on freelancing, the boomers want to increase regulations on freelancing.”Concluding his article, he wrote: “Boomers, we have had enough. We aren't buying your narrative anymore. It's worn out.”The article drew support from followers of former prime minister Imran Khan, who is currently incarcerated. The Canada wing of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) shared the article on X, highlighting its key points.“Zorain Nizamani's article ‘It is Over’ was removed from eTribune most likely for exposing the reality: DG ISPR's university visits are futile. The youth see through propaganda and are no longer easy to mislead or control,” the PTI Canada wing said.Pakistani activist Mehlaqa Samdani also linked the article’s removal to censorship. “Not surprisingly, this article is no longer accessible through the Express Tribune's digital edition, exactly the kind of censorship Zorain talks about,” she wrote.The episode has intensified online debate over whether Pakistan’s younger generation is moving from quiet disillusionment toward open resistance against an entrenched establishment widely seen as out of touch.","US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani wrote an article on Pakistan's ruling establishment.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality

Pakistan's repeated reliance on IMF

Bangladesh shows interest in Pak's JF-17

Pak seeks JF-17 deal with Saudi Arabia





Pakistan on Tuesday expressed confidence that it may no longer need financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund within six months, with Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif claiming the country had seen a surge in aircraft orders following a four-day military standoff with India in May, Geo TV reported.Speaking on a Geo News programme, Asif made a fanciful claim while arguing that the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict showcased Pakistan's ""resolve and military effectiveness"" to the world.Military tensions escalated in May 2025 after Pakistan-sponsored terrorists carried out a terror attack in Pahalgam, killing 26 civilians in April. India responded with a strong military operation, launching Operation Sindoor, under which it targeted and destroyed multiple terror camps and Pakistani military facilities.However, Khawaja Asif, appearing disconnected from the ground reality, made such statements after a Bangladeshi defence delegation met Pakistan's air chief to discuss a potential sale of the JF-17 Thunder, the multi-role fighter aircraft jointly developed by China and Pakistan.There are also reports of talks between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to convert about $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, according to two Pakistani sources cited by Reuters.According to Arab News, several countries have since stepped up defence engagement with Pakistan.“Right now, the number of orders we are receiving after reaching this point is significant because our aircraft have been tested,” defence minister Asif told Pakistan’s Geo News channel.“We are receiving these orders, and it is possible that after six months we may not even need the IMF,” he said.Pakistan markets the Chinese co-developed JF-17 as a lower-cost multi-role fighter and has positioned itself as a supplier offering aircraft, training and maintenance outside Western supply chains.“I am saying this with full confidence,” Asif said. “If all these orders materialise over the next six months, we will not need the IMF.”Pakistan has repeatedly turned to the International Monetary Fund over the years, for financial support to stabilise its fragile economy, with such assistance tied to strict conditions including fiscal reforms, subsidy cuts and revenue-enhancing measures.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a separate $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at bolstering the country’s economic stability and climate resilience.Demonstrating Dhaka’s efforts to move closer to Islamabad, Bangladesh has expressed “potential interest” in acquiring the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft from Pakistan, along with plans to resume direct flights between the two countries from January 29 after a gap of more than a decade.The JF-17, jointly developed by China and Pakistan, was deployed by Pakistan against India during the May 7–10 hostilities. In November last year, Indian Air Force chief Air chief Marshal A P Singh said the aircraft was among at least five high-tech Pakistani fighters shot down during Operation Sindoor.This latest development and closeness between Pakistan and Bangladesh comes under the pretext of Dhaka's straining relations with India.Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are also in talks to convert around $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, as two Pakistani sources told Reuters, in a move that would deepen military cooperation between two Islamic nations. Pakistan and Saudi signed a mutual defence pact last year.The discussions highlight efforts by the long-time allies to operationalise defence cooperation at a time when Pakistan is under acute financial strain and Saudi Arabia is recalibrating its security partnerships amid uncertainty over US commitments in the Middle East.","Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif says country may not need IMF help in six months.

Pakistan’s Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Tuesday said that nearly 71% of terrorist incidents reported in 2025 originated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). He attributed this concentration to a “politically conducive environment and the flourishing political-criminal-terror-nexus which is flourishing there”.Data released by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) reinforces the scale of the surge. KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025” — a year-on-year increase of more than 40%.The broader national picture is even starker. According to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths. These included 2,115 terrorists, 664 security personnel, 580 civilians and 28 members of pro-government peace committees. PICSS said violence intensified in both “tempo and lethality”, pushing multiple security indicators to their highest levels in years.“Militant attacks climbed to their highest annual total since 2014, and the use of suicide bombings and small drones showed a clear upward trend,” the report said.Suicide attacks rose by 53%, while terrorist incidents overall increased to 1,063 — the highest since 2014.Security forces and civilians also bore rising costs. Security personnel fatalities rose 26% to their highest level since 2011, while civilian deaths increased by 24%, marking the worst toll in a decade. Injuries surged by 53% to 2,263, with sharp rises across all categories.The violence has been most acute in KP and Balochistan. In Bannu alone, Deputy Inspector General Sajjad Khan said 27 police personnel were killed in 134 attacks during 2025. Police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations, arresting 105 militants and killing 65, he said.Pakistan frequently accuses Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities of sheltering the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group blamed for a sharp increase in attacks inside Pakistan since 2021. Afghan officials reject the allegations, insisting they do not permit their territory to be used for attacks against other countries.While the TTP operates independently from Afghanistan’s Taliban, the two groups maintain close ties.Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have deteriorated since October, when border clashes followed explosions in Kabul on Oct. 9 that Afghan officials attributed to Pakistan.

ISLAMABAD: The polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target, leaving over 935,000 children under five unvaccinated, officials said, citing security challenges and population displacement as key hurdles, The Express Tribune reported.According to The Express Tribune, citing authorities, thousands of families from North and South Waziristan, Bajaur, and other merged districts have migrated to different parts of the country, complicating monitoring and vaccination efforts.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 19 polio cases in 2025, including four each in North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, and Tank; three in Bannu; two in Torghar; and one each in Dera Ismail Khan and Lower Kohistan, as reported by The Express Tribune.Officials noted that staffing and operational support for WHO and Unicef programmes in the merged districts were reduced last year, while WHO funding cuts also affected campaign coverage, leaving children in these areas at heightened risk.In Sindh, more than 12,000 children under five were reportedly missed during the final polio drive of 2025 in Hyderabad and surrounding areas, according to The Express Tribune.Refusals were recorded mainly in Cantonment areas and municipal towns such as Hussainabad, Preetabad, Qasimabad, and Tando Jam, with absent households and parental refusals cited as primary reasons.Despite these gaps, the nationwide anti-polio campaign successfully vaccinated more than 44.6 million children across Pakistan, according to The Express Tribune.Punjab led with 22.9 million children vaccinated, followed by Sindh with 10.6 million, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 7.15 million, and Balochistan with 2.58 million.Officials said contributions from other regions also added to the national tally.Authorities warned that without sustained vaccination efforts, particularly in displaced and high-risk populations, children in the merged districts remain vulnerable to polio, The Express Tribune reported.","Polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties, claiming that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.In an open letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar, posted on X on New Year’s Day, Mir Yar Baloch said Baloch representatives view the growing strategic partnership between Islamabad and Beijing as “dangerous.”He said Balochistan has “faced decades of repression under Pakistan’s control,” including what he described as “state-sponsored violence” and “human rights abuses.”""The people of Balochistan have endured Pakistan's state occupation, state-sponsored terrorism, and egregious human rights atrocities for the past seventy-nine years. The time has now arrived to eradicate this festering affliction at its roots, ensuring lasting peace and sovereignty for our nation, "" he wrote.In his letter to EAM Jaishankar, Mir Yar Baloch said that China and Pakistan are rapidly moving toward the final stages of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a major Belt and Road Initiative project led by Chinese President Xi Jinping that passes through Balochistan.“The Republic of Balochistan views the escalating strategic alliance between Pakistan and China as profoundly dangerous.We warn that China, in collaboration with Pakistan, has advanced the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to its final phases,” he said.He warned that unless Baloch resistance and defence forces are strengthened, the region could soon see direct Chinese military involvement.“Should the capabilities of Balochistan's defense and freedom forces not be further bolstered and if they continue to be overlooked as per longstanding patterns, it is conceivable that China could deploy its military forces in Balochistan within a few months,” the letter stated.Mir Yar Baloch also said that any Chinese troop deployment without the approval of the local people could have serious consequences for the region.“The presence of Chinese boots on Balochistani soil without the will of the 60 million Baloch people would pose an unimaginable threat and challenge to the futures of both Bharat and Balochistan,” he wrote.China and Pakistan have repeatedly rejected claims that CPEC has a military angle, saying the project is only economic. India, however, has always opposed CPEC, pointing out that it passes through Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and affects India’s sovereignty and security.Earlier this year in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh repeated India’s stance. In a written reply, he said: “Government's position on CPEC is clear and consistent. Government has consistently protested to parties concerned over the inclusion of the so-called 'China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)', which passes through parts of the Indian Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir under illegal occupation of Pakistan, as a flagship project of 'OBOR/BRI' and asked them to cease these activities. Any proposed participation of third countries or expansion of the so-called CPEC projects to third countries is unacceptable.”Mir Yar Baloch also praised India’s recent counterterror military actions, highlighting Operation Sindoor, which targeted key terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir after the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.“We commend the bold and resolute actions undertaken by the Modi Government in the previous year through Operation Sindoor, particularly targeting terrorism hubs facilitated by Pakistan and directed against the Pakistani military in response to Pahalgam terror attack. These measures demonstrate exemplary courage and a steadfast commitment to regional security and justice,” he wrote.There has been no official response so far from the Union government, or from Chinese or Pakistani authorities, to Mir Yar Baloch’s claims.",Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties. He claims that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.

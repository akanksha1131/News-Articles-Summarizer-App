Trump's post on Truth social

China’s military parade





US President Donald Trump lashed out at China as Beijing staged a massive military parade that also involved Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.In a post on Truth Social, Trump claimed that many American workers had sacrificed their lives for China’s freedom. “The big question to be answered is whether or not President Xi of China will mention the massive amount of support and ‘blood’ that The United States of America gave to China in order to help it to secure its FREEDOM from a very unfriendly foreign invader. Many Americans died in China’s quest for Victory and Glory,” he wrote.“I hope that they are rightfully Honored and Remembered for their Bravery and Sacrifice! May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration,"" he added.Turning sharply critical, Trump further accused Beijing of colluding against Washington. “Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.

Anna Wintour taps Chloe Malle as Vogue successor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/anna-wintour-taps-chloe-malle-as-vogue-successor-but-shes-still-in-charge/articleshow/123667594.cms,"



NEW YORK: Anna Wintour ended weeks of fashion-world speculation Tuesday when she named Chloe Malle her successor as head of editorial content at Vogue - but the most powerful person in the business isn't going anywhere.Wintour, 75, remains chief content officer for Conde Nast and global editorial director of American Vogue and the magazine's 27 other editions. Malle, editor of Vogue.com, may be stepping into Wintour's low-heeled slingbacks but she'll report to the original wearer while taking over day-to-day editorial and creative operations at the U.S. edition. And gone is the storied ""editor-in-chief"" title that Wintour held for nearly 40 years.Malle, 39, is the daughter of actor Candice Bergen and the late French director Louis Malle. She joined Vogue as social editor in 2011, moved on to contributing editor in 2016 and has held her current position since 2023. She steered all digital content for Vogue. In June, Malle interviewed the then-Lauren Sanchez ahead of her wedding to Jeff Bezos.""Vogue has already shaped who I am, now I'm excited at the prospect of shaping Vogue,"" Malle said in the announcement.Malle had emerged as a front-runner Since late June, when Wintour told staff that she was giving up her title, a handful of names to succeed her were tossed around. Among them were Eva Chen, vice president of fashion partnerships at Meta; Nicole Phelps, global director of Vogue Runway and Vogue Business; and Sara Moonves, editor-in-chief of W magazine.Other names that floated about soon after the job went up for grabs are Vogue's fashion news director Mark Holgate, British Vogue's head of editorial content Chioma Nnadi and Vogue.com's digital style director Leah Faye Cooper. Malle and Nnadi co-host the Vogue podcast, ""The Run-Through with Vogue.""The news that Malle got the job comes ahead of the latest round of shows at New York Fashion Week, starting next week, and amid the Venice Film Festival, which includes a new documentary about her father. Her appointment is effective immediately. Malle's mother, funnily enough, once played Vogue editor-in-chief Enid Frick on ""Sex and the City"" with some very Wintour-like characteristics.Malle, a Brown graduate and mother of two young kids, has been outspoken about her liberal-leaning politics, just as Wintour has.""I actually love working with Anna, because I love someone telling me exactly what needs to be done and exactly what she thinks about something,"" Malle said in a recent profile by the Independent. ""There's no indecision. There's no ambiguity.""Vogue's past, and future Vogue was founded as a society journal 134 years ago. After Conde Nast acquired it in 1909, it became a traditional industry mainstay with models on the cover, static close-up photography done in studios and a focus on high fashion and heavy makeup.Wintour, a risk-taker who took over the title in 1988, saw the mass appeal in a broader approach. She expanded international editions, elevated fashion's connections to pop culture and began putting celebrities, athletes, music stars and politicians on the covers. Wintour went for a high-low approach to fashion and favored storytelling in photo shoots done outdoors.She embraced then-emerging designers, including Marc Jacobs, John Galliano and Alexander McQueen, through initiatives like the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund. And she transformed the Met Gala from a small, private fundraiser to a global event and fashion's most important night.Considered the fashion bible, American Vogue has had several notable editors throughout its history. Preceding Wintour were Diana Vreeland (1963 to 1971) and Grace Mirabella (1971 to 1988), among others.""Chloe has proven often that she can find the balance between American Vogue's long, singular history and its future on the front lines of the new,"" Wintour said in the statement on Malle's appointment.Under Malle's leadership, direct traffic to Vogue.com doubled, with massive growth across all key metrics, according to the statement on her new job. Site traffic now consistently reaches 14.5 million unique visitors monthly.The retirement of the editor-in-chief title brings Vogue in line with changes throughout the Conde Nast universe. When Radhika Jones stepped down as Vanity Fair's editor-in-chief earlier this year, her role was replaced by a ""global editorial director,"" found in Mark Guiducci. (Guiducci himself was tapped from Vogue, where he served most recently as creative editorial director.) American Vogue joins most every market where Conde Nast operates in the change to a head of editorial content, who reports to a global editorial director.Though Vogue has editions spanning the world, from Britain and France to China and India, Malle's focus will be on American Vogue.Anna Wintour's own future As Conde Nast's chief content officer, Wintour will continue to oversee every brand, including Vogue, Wired, Vanity Fair, GQ, AD, Conde Nast Traveler, Glamour, Bon Appetit, Tatler, World of Interiors, Allure and more, with the exception of The New Yorker, where editor David Remnick retains control.Wintour herself does have a boss. She reports to Roger Lynch, CEO of Conde Nast.""In effect, the addition of a new editorial lead for Vogue US will allow Wintour greater time and flexibility to support the other global markets that Conde Nast serves,"" said a Vogue statement in June.""And it goes without saying,"" Wintour joked back then, ""that I plan to remain Vogue's tennis and theater editor in perpetuity."" She's been a regular at this year's US Open, as in past years.She'll remain at the helm of the annual Met Gala, a major fundraiser for the fashion wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. And she'll stay involved in Vogue World, a traveling fashion and cultural event the magazine began in 2022.Wintour explained the editor-in-chief shift this way:""Anybody in a creative field knows how essential it is never to stop growing in one's work. When I became the editor of Vogue, I was eager to prove to all who might listen that there was a new, exciting way to imagine an American fashion magazine,"" she told staff.""Now, I find that my greatest pleasure is helping the next generation of impassioned editors storm the field with their own ideas, supported by a new, exciting view of what a major media company can be,"" she said.","Chloe Malle is the daughter of actor Candice Bergen and the late French director Louis Malle. She joined Vogue as social editor in 2011, moved on to contributing editor in 2016 and has held her current position since 2023.

Yaron Samid, an Israeli-American technology entrepreneur, has criticised Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin for remarks made during a concert at Wembley Stadium in London on Sunday.During the show, Martin invited two women, Avia and Tal, onstage. When they said they were from Israel, part of the audience responded with boos, while others cheered.Martin appeared uncomfortable but addressed the audience, saying he was treating them “as equal humans on earth, regardless of where you come from or don’t come from.”He also added, “Although it’s controversial maybe, I also want to welcome people in the audience from Palestine because… out of the belief that we’re all equal humans.”Samid said that he and his wife, both Israeli, have been devoted Coldplay fans for over 20 years, travelling globally to see the band live. But the recent comment by Chris Martin, he wrote, was “especially hurtful” and a “tactless misstep” that wounded some of the band’s most loyal supporters.Samid said Martin, who he has long seen as a kind person using music to unite people, seemed to show “growing prejudice against Israeli people.” He highlighted the suffering of Israelis caught in conflicts, noting that many have endured brutal violence and continue to face hardships.He further urged Martin to reflect quietly on his words. “You’re better than this.

Trump TAKES A SWIPE at Biden’s Stumbles; Troops Burst Out Laughing During Visit





US president Donald Trump has a low approval rating, according to recent surveys by Gallup, Reuters/Ipsos and other pollsters.More than seven months into his presidency, the numbers show continued low approval, with Americans divided over his handling of the economy, immigration and the deployment of troops in Washington DC.Gallup’s August survey reported that 40% of Americans approve of Trump’s performance, while 56% disapprove. RealClearPolitics put his net approval margin at minus five points at the end of August, and The New York Times tracker showed minus eight.These figures keep Trump below the first-year ratings of earlier presidents such as Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. Public approval stood at 49% for Joe Biden in August 2021, 36% for Donald Trump in August 2017, 53% for Barack Obama in August 2009, and 56% for George W Bush in August 2001. The highest in the list was George HW Bush, who recorded a massive 69% in August 1989.Public opinion has also been negative on key policy areas. A Reuters/Ipsos poll found only 38% of Americans supported his move to deploy the National Guard in Washington, while 46% opposed it. His immigration policies had 43% approval, and only 37% supported his handling of the economy.Trade has been another sticking point.

Protesters marched in several US cities on Labour Day, criticising president Donald Trump's policies. Hundreds of events were organised by labour groups, local activists and opposition Democratic Party officials.In New York, crowds gathered outside Trump Tower, chanting “Trump must go now” and carrying signs denouncing what they called a fascist regime. Trump has not lived in the building for years, but it continues to be a rallying point for demonstrations.Similar protests were held outside Trump Tower in Chicago, where chants included “No National Guard” and “Lock him up.”Large gatherings also took place in Washington DC, San Francisco and other West Coast cities. In Washington, protesters carried signs reading “Stop the ICE invasion” and “Free DC No masked thugs.” Along the West Coast, from San Diego to Seattle, rallies focused on immigrant rights, and low wages.In Chicago, where Trump has discussed deploying National Guard troops to address street crime, multiple groups joined together to hear speeches.Evanston mayor Daniel Biss told the crowd, “We’re here because our core values and our democracy are under attack.They are threatening to send the military into our streets.”A brief confrontation broke out when a woman shouted support for Trump and the protesters responded with shouts of their own until the woman left a few minutes later.Union members and worker rights groups also marched in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Portland.The Labour Day demonstrations added to a series of recent protests, including the “May Day” rallies on May 1, the “No Kings” marches in June and last month’s demonstrations against Trump’s plan to redraw congressional districts.","Hundreds of events were organised by labour groups, local activists and opposition Democratic Party officials.

It seems like Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's recent outreach to Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin in China's Tianjin has rattled some corners of the American right wing, with prominent MAGA commentators taking to X to criticise India.American television presenter Laura Ingraham and conservative influencer Charlie Kirk were among those lashing out, with posts targeting PM Modi and India's role in US trade and visas.Ingraham, retweeting a photo of PM Modi with Xi and Putin, called the gesture ""insane,"" and went on to complain that any US-India trade deal would require more visas for Indians.""It’s insane that Modi apparently thinks this sort of thing will make the Americans treat him better,"" she wrote.""Don’t forget that any trade deal with India will require us to give them more visas.

Pentagon approves 600 military lawyers to serve as temp immigration judges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pentagon-approves-600-military-lawyers-to-serve-as-temp-immigration-judges/articleshow/123667504.cms,"Stephen Miller (left), Pete Hegseth, JD Vance (AP)





WASHINGTON: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has approved sending up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department to serve as temporary immigration judges, according to a memo reviewed by The Associated Press.The military will begin sending groups of 150 attorneys - both military and civilians - to the Justice Department ""as soon as practicable,"" and the military services should have the first round of people identified by next week, according to the Aug. 27 memo.The effort comes as the Trump administration more regularly turns to the military as it cracks down on illegal immigration through ramped-up arrests and deportations. Its growing role in the push includes troops patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border, National Guard members being sent into U.S. cities to support immigration enforcement efforts, housing people awaiting deportation on military bases and using military aircraft to carry out deportations.The administration's focus on illegal immigration has added strain to the immigration courts, which were already dealing with a massive backlog of roughly 3.5 million cases that has ballooned in recent years.Numerous immigration judges have been fired At the same time, more than 100 immigration judges have been fired or left voluntarily after taking deferred resignations offered by the Trump administration, their union says. In the most recent round of terminations, the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers said in July that at least 17 immigration judges had been fired ""without cause"" in courts across the country.That has left about 600 immigration judges, union figures show, meaning the Pentagon move would double their ranks.The Justice Department, which oversees the immigration courts, requested the assistance from the Defense Department, according to the memo sent by the Pentagon's executive secretary to his DOJ counterpart. The military lawyers' duties as immigration judges will initially last no more than 179 days but can be renewed, it said.A DOJ spokesperson referred questions about the plan to the Defense Department, where officials directed questions to the White House.A White House official said Tuesday that the administration is looking at a variety of options to help resolve the significant backlog of immigration cases, including hiring additional immigration judges. The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the matter should be ""a priority that everyone - including those waiting for adjudication - can rally around. ""Pentagon says the step may require mobilizing reserve officers The memo stressed that the additional attorneys are contingent on availability and that mobilizing reserve officers may be necessary. Plus, the document said DOJ would be responsible for ensuring that anyone sent from the Pentagon does not violate the federal prohibition on using the military as domestic law enforcement, known as the Posse Comitatus Act.The administration faced a setback on its efforts to use troops in unique ways to combat illegal immigration and crime, with a court ruling Tuesday that it ""willfully"" violated federal law by sending National Guard troops to Los Angeles in early June.It is not immediately clear what impact shifting that number of military attorneys would have on the armed forces' justice system. The attorneys, called judge advocates, have a range of duties much like civilian lawyers, from carrying out prosecutions, acting as a defense attorney or offering legal advice.Pentagon officials did immediately offer details on where any of the 600 attorneys will be drawn from and whether they will come from active duty or the reserves.The training that goes into being an immigration judge Until she was abruptly fired in July, former supervising judge Jennifer Peyton administered the intensive training that all judges in Chicago undergo before working in some of the busiest immigration courts in the country. After the weekslong training, new judges are paired with an experienced mentor and have a two-year probationary period.Peyton doubted that military attorneys would be able to master the complexities of immigration law without that rigorous process. She also said it wasn't clear how they would handle the hundreds, or sometimes thousands, of cases on just a Chicago immigration judge's docket each year.""Six months is barely enough time to start to figure out the firehose of information and training,"" she said.Peyton also was concerned that Trump's move didn't supply more administrative workers, including translators, whom judges rely on to make decisions. The stakes, she said, were life or death for people who would come before the new judges.""None of it makes sense unless you were intentionally trying to weaken the immigration courts,"" Peyton said.",Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has approved sending up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department to serve as temporary immigration judges.

Cardi B cleared of assault allegations in civil trial

The case:





A jury on Tuesday cleared rapper Cardi B of all allegations in a lawsuit filed by a security guard who claimed she was assaulted by the rapper at a doctor’s office in 2018.The case was brought by Emani Ellis, who said Cardi scratched her face with a fingernail and spat on her during an argument at a Beverly Hills obstetrician’s office when the rapper was secretly pregnant with her first child.Only nine jurors were needed for a verdict in the civil case, but all 12 agreed Cardi was not liable.Outside court, Cardi celebrated the win, calling the case “frivolous” and warning she would countersue anyone who tries similar lawsuits. She said she had to miss her children’s first day of school because of the trial.""I am not that celeb that you sue, and you think is going to settle. I'm not gonna settle. Especially when I'm super completely innocent,"" she said.During testimony, Cardi admitted she argued with Ellis but denied touching her. “I will say it on my deathbed.

BREAKING: 30,000 'Epstein files' released by GOP





US House of Representatives committee released the first set of documents the investigation into notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Tuesday.Over 33,000 pages of records were uploaded to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform website. The documents were handed over by the Justice Department.Committee chairman James Comer said, ""We're in the process of uploading those documents for full transparency so everyone in America can see them. It's going as quick as we can get them uploaded. We want those to be public as soon as possible.""The committee asked the Justice Department for these records, and the first set was given last month. It is not yet clear what new information is in Tuesday’s release, according to news agency AFP. Many documents related to the Epstein investigation have already been made public.The committee said it expects more records from the Justice Department. These will be redacted to protect victims’ identities and remove any child sexual abuse material.Epstein, a wealthy financier with influential connections, died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking underage girls.The investigation by the committee into Epstein follows weeks of backlash against president Trump and his administration, who were criticised by supporters and critics alike for not releasing additional Epstein documents, despite Trump’s pledge for more transparency.The sudden release also comes as Republican leaders try to contain unrest within the party, while Rep RO Khanna and Rep Thomas Massie push for a floor vote on their bipartisan bill demanding the full release of Epstein files.","Over 33,000 pages of records were uploaded to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform website.

Venezuelan government responds







President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced that US forces killed 11 “narcoterrorists” while carrying out a strike on a drug-carrying vessel linked to Venezuelan gangs. Trump alleged the gang was controlled by Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.""Earlier this morning, on my Orders, US Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social, while sharing footage of the attack.""The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States. The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action. No US Forces were harmed in this strike,” he said.The strike is part of broader US counter-narcotics efforts to strengthen maritime operations off Venezuela and combat threats from Latin American drug cartels. While thousands of US personnel are being deployed, officials have not indicated any plans for a land incursion into Venezuela.“Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America,” Trump added.Earlier on Wednesday while speaking at the Oval Office, Trump described the operation as part of ongoing counter-narcotics efforts in the southern Caribbean.“The US forces shot out a boat… a drug-carrying boat, lots of drugs in that boat,” he said. “So we took it out.”Secretary of state Marco Rubio also addressed the operation on X, calling it a lethal strike and noting that the vessel was operated by a “designated narco-terrorist organisation.” Rubio made the comments shortly before departing for Mexico and Ecuador to discuss drug cartels, regional security, and trade issues.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro responded by deploying troops along the coast and the border with Colombia and urged citizens to join a civilian militia. Maduro has repeatedly claimed that the US is exaggerating Venezuela’s role in drug trafficking to remove him from power.He and other government officials have cited a United Nations report indicating that traffickers move only a small fraction of Colombia’s cocaine through Venezuela.On Monday, Maduro told reporters he “would constitutionally declare a republic in arms” if Venezuela were attacked by US forces deployed in the Caribbean.The Venezuelan government’s press office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Trump’s announcement, and the Pentagon also declined to provide a statement.The latest UN World Drug Report shows that South American countries, including Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, reported increased cocaine seizures in 2022 compared with 2021, but Venezuela is not highlighted as a central hub of trafficking.",US President Donald Trump announced that US forces killed 11 “narcoterrorists” while carrying out a strike on a drug-carrying vessel linked to Venezuelan gangs.

Landmark ruling: Judge blocks Google breakup but forces search overhaul in latest order– What it says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/landmark-ruling-judge-blocks-google-breakup-but-forces-search-overhaul-in-latest-order-what-it-says/articleshow/123664418.cms,"Representative image (AP)





A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a major restructuring of Google’s search engine in an effort to curb what he described as the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly, but stopped short of breaking up the tech giant.US district Judge Amit Mehta, in Washington, DC, issued a 226-page ruling aimed at restraining some of Google’s tactics used to drive traffic to its search engine and other services.The judge ordered Google to give both current and potential competitors access to some of its proprietary search data — the information collected from trillions of queries that helps improve the accuracy and quality of its search results.However, Mehta rejected the U.S. Justice Department’s request to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser and declined to ban the multi-billion-dollar agreements that secure Google as the default search engine on smartphones, personal computers, and other devices. These deals, which bring in more than $26 billion annually, were a central point in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case.The ruling comes at a time when the tech industry is being reshaped by artificial intelligence innovations, including conversational “answer engines” from companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity, which are challenging Google’s dominance as the primary gateway to the internet.While the judge stopped short of a breakup, the decision signals a significant regulatory intervention in one of the world’s largest technology companies, balancing efforts to foster competition with concerns about disrupting a key player in the global digital economy.","US district Judge Amit Mehta, in Washington, DC, issued a 226-page ruling aimed at restraining some of Google’s tactics used to drive traffic to its search engine and other services.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday reacted to a viral AI-generated video that charts his life from childhood to a projected return to the White House, calling it “a little bit scary.”Addressing the video during his Oval Office announcement, Trump said, “I saw something as I was growing up from the time I was a baby till now. I said, 'Who did that?' It was AI-generated. So it's a little bit scary, to be honest with you.”He referenced the video while talking about the viral clip showing objects being thrown outside the White House, dismissing it as fabricated, “If something happens really bad, just blame AI, but also they create things so it works both ways.

Governor, mayor push back

Judge warns of ‘national police force’

Protests and political fallout





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he will deploy National Guard troops to Chicago, describing the city as a “hellhole” plagued by gun violence.“We’re going in,” Trump told reporters, while suggesting Baltimore could be next. He rejected claims that he is targeting Democratic-run cities, insisting, “This isn’t a political thing. I have an obligation.”Citing Chicago crime data, Trump said, “When 20 people are killed over the last two and a half weeks and 75 are shot with bullets, I have an obligation.”Trump, who has already ordered Guard troops into Washington, DC, and Los Angeles in recent months, escalated his rhetoric on Truth Social, calling Chicago “the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far.” He also blasted Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, writing, “He needs help badly, he just doesn’t know it yet,” before posting in all caps: “CHICAGO IS THE MURDER CAPITAL OF THE WORLD!”Gov. Pritzker accused Trump of preparing “an invasion,” while Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson declared at a Labor Day rally: “No federal troops in the city of Chicago! No militarized force in the city of Chicago!” Johnson vowed to rally national opposition against the plan.Trump’s latest comments came hours after a federal judge in San Francisco ruled his earlier use of the military in Los Angeles violated the law. District Judge Charles Breyer barred National Guard reservists and Marines from performing police duties and cautioned that Trump appeared intent on “creating a national police force with the President as its chief.”The injunction takes effect on September 12, leaving a window for the conservative-leaning Supreme Court to intervene.As Chicago residents braced for possible troop deployment, protesters marched through the city in a “Workers over Billionaires” rally, voicing anger over Trump’s plans. Local leaders warned the move could heighten tensions rather than curb violence.","US President Donald Trump said he will deploy National Guard troops to Chicago.

Cost and funding challenges

Canada’s possible role

Trump’s campaign promise





US President Donald Trump says he hopes to “work something out” to have Canada included in his administration’s $175bn “Golden Dome” missile defense system, a project he has touted as America’s answer to Israel’s Iron Dome.“Everybody wants to be a participant in it… We’re gonna be having a Golden Dome the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before,” Trump said on Wednesday while announcing that US Space Command headquarters would move from Colorado to Alabama. He added that Canada has shown interest in being part of the defense shield.Plans for the Golden Dome, obtained by Reuters and presented under the slogan “Go Fast, Think Big!” to 3,000 defense contractors in Huntsville, Alabama, outline an ambitious three-layer system of missile interceptors, radar arrays, lasers, and space-based defenses. The slides noted the US has previously built interceptors and re-entry vehicles but acknowledged it has never developed one capable of reentry while targeting an enemy missile.Lockheed Martin has promoted the system as one that would protect the US from hypersonic missiles, drones, and aerial swarms “with unmatched speed and accuracy.” Other firms linked to the project include Palantir and Anduril, though SpaceX was not mentioned in the latest presentation.The system would include a new missile field in the US Midwest, supplementing existing sites in southern California and Alaska.Trump has placed the price tag for the Golden Dome at $175bn. Congress has so far appropriated $25bn through his tax and spending bill passed in July, which also made cuts to social programs such as Medicaid. Another $45.3bn has been earmarked in his 2026 presidential budget request.Still, officials admit the true cost remains uncertain. “They have a lot of money, but they don’t have a target of what it costs yet,” a US official told Reuters.To close the gap, Trump suggested earlier this year that Canada could contribute $61bn toward the project.If Ottawa commits, it would mark one of the largest defense contributions in Canadian history. The move would deepen North American security integration, though critics warn of the political and financial risks tied to such a massive defense buildout.Trump campaigned in 2024 on building a missile shield for America, repeatedly comparing his plans to Israel’s Iron Dome, which was developed with over $1bn in US funding. Just days after taking office in January 2025, he signed an executive order to “immediately begin construction” of a state-of-the-art missile defense system.“Thanks to President Trump’s vision, Golden Dome will make this a reality, securing our future,” Lockheed Martin declared in a March statement.For Trump, the project is both a campaign promise fulfilled and a defining symbol of his second term, though it remains to be seen whether Canada will agree to pay for a place under the dome.","US President Donald Trump says he hopes to ‘work something out’ to have Canada included in his administration’s $175bn “Golden Dome” missile defense system.

US President Donald Trump addressed a viral video during his Oval Office announcement on Wednesday, in which an object appears to be dumped from a White House window—a clip that has sparked intense speculation online.Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy showed Trump the footage, which has gone viral on X, with millions of viewers asking the same question: What was in the bag?“No, that's probably AI-generated. You can't open the windows. They're all heavily-armored. I know every window up there. The last place I'd be doing it is there,” Trump said. He added, “They're sealed, and each window weighs about 600 pounds.”The video shows the object sailing through the air before hitting the ground. While the act appears to violate standard White House security protocols, neither the Secret Service nor the White House provided any explanation, deepening the mystery and fueling online speculation.Social media users quickly reacted with a mix of theories and humor. “It’s Melania. She is sneaking out before the Epstein files are exposed because her phone # is in them as well!” one user claimed. Another suggested, “That’s the bathroom connected to the Lincoln bedroom.They’re gutting it because Trump doesn’t like art deco.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday laughed off wild social media speculation about his health, and even his supposed death, after several days away from the cameras.The 79-year-old Republican, famous for his love of publicity, had not scheduled public events or press briefings for nearly a week.The unusual silence, paired with his age and recent images showing a bruised hand and swollen ankles, sent rumor mills into overdrive. Some users on X even claimed the White House was hiding his death.“I didn’t see that,” Trump said when Fox News’ Peter Doocy jokingly asked him, “How did you find out over the weekend that you were dead?” Trump smirked, replying: “That’s fake news. I didn’t do anything for two days and they say, ‘there must be something wrong with him.’ Biden wouldn’t do anything for months…”The White House has previously addressed Trump’s health concerns.In July, officials said discoloration on his hand came from “tissue irritation from frequent handshaking” and aspirin use for cardiovascular care.His swollen ankles were linked to chronic venous insufficiency, a benign condition caused by weakened leg veins. His physician, Dr Sean Barbabella, reassured in a letter that Trump “remains in excellent health.”Trump has long bragged about his stamina, even once sharing a meme portraying himself as Superman. But with the two oldest presidents in US history, Biden at 82 when he left office and Trump now 79, health rumors are under heavier scrutiny than ever.","The 79-year-old Republican had not scheduled public events or press briefings for nearly a week.

But critics have questioned the scale of the buildup.Jimmy Story, a former US ambassador to Venezuela, compared the strategy to “using a blowtorch to cook an egg.”Despite fiery rhetoric, Maduro acknowledged ongoing backchannel contacts with Washington, one involving Richard Grenell, a special envoy, and another through John McNamara, the top US diplomat to Venezuela reporting to Rubio. While admitting relations are in “bad shape,” Maduro expressed hope they could be repaired, calling Trump “an intelligent, bold man. He’ll know what to do.”Maduro said the naval buildup represented “the greatest threat that has been seen on our continent in the last 100 years” and claimed US ships carried “1,200 missiles” targeting Venezuela. Still, he signaled he would not suspend deportation flights returning Venezuelans from the US, noting they were part of a “bilateral relationship that has gone well.”Meanwhile, Rubio visited US Southern Command in Florida on Friday to discuss security issues and is scheduled to travel this week to Mexico and Ecuador, trips the State Department says are meant to reinforce Washington’s commitment to countering narco-terrorism and securing borders.",Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro warned that his country would respond with an “armed fight” if the United States launched a military strike.

BEIJING: Pakistan's army chief field marshal Asim Munir had his first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping , along with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif , on Tuesday during which the two sides held wide-ranging talks on bilateral and regional cooperation.Munir is part of Sharif's delegation, which participated in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin and will attend a grand parade of the Chinese army to be held here on Wednesday to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.During his first visit to China in July after taking over as field marshal, Munir met vice president Han Zheng but not President Xi, unlike his predecessor general Qamar Javed Bajwa.His visit followed after he was hosted for lunch by US President Donald Trump, a rare gesture by an American leader which raised eyebrows in China, considering Pak-China all-weather ties.While Xi met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a host of other leaders, who attended the SCO summit in Tianjin, Sharif was allocated the slot on Tuesday to meet the Chinese President in Beijing.Munir was expected to join Sharif to watch the parade in which the Chinese military plans to display its most modern weapons of all varieties, including aerial, ground, electronic and missile systems.The weapons systems were of big interest to the Pakistan military as over 80 per cent of its weapons acquisitions are from China.During the meeting, the two sides held wide-ranging talks on bilateral & regional cooperation, said deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, who was also part of the team.Xi said that as global changes unseen in a century are unfolding at a quicker pace, a strong China-Pakistan relationship is conducive to safeguarding regional peace and development.The two sides should accelerate building an even closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era, to bring more benefits to the two peoples and set up a model for the broader neighbourhood, he said.China stands ready to work with Pakistan to build upgraded versions of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement, and hopes Pakistan will take effective measures to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan, Xi was quoted as saying by the state-run Xinhua news agency.On his part, Sharif hailed the Global Governance Initiative (GGI), proposed by Xi at the SCO summit to improve global governance, saying it is of great significance for world peace, development and stability, and Pakistan will give it full support and work actively to implement it.Pakistan firmly sticks to the one-China principle, and looks forward to further strengthening friendship between the two countries and advancing cooperation in all fields, said Sharif, promising to spare no effort in ensuring the safety of all Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan.","Pakistan's army chief field marshal Asim Munir had his first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday came up with a bizarre solution to tackle floods in the country's northern parts by suggesting that people store the floodwater and take it to their homes.While talking to a local news channel, Asif said that excess water should be taken as a ""form of blessing.""""Now this water, someone should store it.

Op Sindoor: Report Reveals Pakistan Lost Rs 1240cr In 2 Months After Shutting Airspace For India

The Express Tribune





Pakistan’s flagship social safety programme, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), is once again under fire for corruption, with the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) uncovering large-scale graft involving its own employees. According to audit findings, as many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million, local media reported on Sunday.Citing the AGP’s revelations,said the rot runs through every level of the bureaucracy. What was envisioned as a lifeline for the country’s poorest has been consistently hollowed out by systemic fraud and abuse. And the Rs 37 million loss, auditors warn, may only scratch the surface.Just months earlier, audit reports for FY24 exposed irregularities worth Rs 141 billion in BISP, ranging from payments to ineligible beneficiaries to bogus biometric verifications and even funds being transferred to the accounts of deceased individuals.“In effect, those entrusted with administering aid to the poor are instead perpetuating poverty,” the report noted.The AGP findings also highlight the involvement of not just BISP employees but also banks and retailers, some of whom were caught illegally skimming fees from beneficiaries using BISP cards. Despite being identified, several perpetrators reportedly “escaped criminal charges despite being caught red-handed and named publicly,”reported.The culture of impunity, it added, remains entrenched. “Even if guilty officials are prosecuted and terminated, recent history has shown that the fear of consequences has not particularly slowed corruption in most government departments, and BISP is no different.”The report stressed that the system’s checks must be tightened: “Controls need to be more proactive, including transparent biometric systems, stricter verification processes and independent monitoring mechanisms.”With BISP catering to roughly 58 million people—nearly a quarter of Pakistan’s population—its credibility carries enormous weight. “Allowing it to become a corrupt and untrusted institution is not just a betrayal of honest and deserving beneficiaries, but of every single taxpayer and international donor supporting the programme,” the report warned.","As many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million.

Flood Threat For Pakistan As India Releases Water From Swollen Rivers Day After Alerting Islamabad





AMRITSAR: Embarrassed by a viral video showing its side of the parade path at Wagah border badly waterlogged - and its Rangers standing in knee-deep water - while the Indian side looks clean, Pakistan has blamed the elevation of Grand Trunk Road on the Indian side for the mess.The fact is India has already implemented a rainwater harvesting system and improved drainage management to prevent waterlogging.Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days. Its side of the parade area at the site of the daily flag ceremony at the Wagah joint checkpost is wallowing in muddy knee-deep water. Sandbags are seen piled up at a few places on the Pakistani side ahead of the ceremony. In contrast, the Indian side is free of water, except for a small area near the international border gates.Sources say Pakistan has raised the elevation of GT Road with Indian authorities. Pakistan also hastily constructed drainage channels and elevated a portion of the road to facilitate water outflow. BSF IG, Punjab Frontier, Atul Fulzele said there was incessant and heavy rainfall on Aug 8-9, and the video was likely from that period.""There has been no waterlogging at any of the three sites of the ceremonial flag-lowering ceremonies - Attari, Hussainiwala, and Sadqi. "" However, several border outposts (BoPs) along the Punjab Frontier were inundated due to heavy rainfall, and some had to be evacuated, he said.BoPs located in enclaves beyond the Ravi river and short of the international border are also being evacuated due to severe flooding.","Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days.

Hundreds Killed, 1000 Injured As Powerful Quake Flattens Afghanistan | Shocking Scenes On Cam

Why was the Afghanistan earthquake so deadly?



A region prone to earthquakes



Rural construction adds to risk



Crisis within a crisis







The Taliban government in Afghanistan said on Tuesday that the death toll from the earthquake in eastern Afghanistan has crossed 1,400, with more than 3,000 people injured. The numbers, given by government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, were only for Kunar province.The 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck late Sunday night across several provinces. It destroyed villages and left people trapped under collapsed houses made mostly of mud bricks and wood. The difficult terrain has slowed rescue efforts, with Taliban authorities air-dropping commandos to evacuate the injured from areas where helicopters cannot land.The earthquake hit just before midnight on Sunday in a mountainous region near Jalalabad, close to the Pakistan border. Although its magnitude was 6.0, the epicentre was shallow at 8 km below the ground, which caused strong shaking on the surface and aftershocks.Indrika Ratwatte, the UN’s resident coordinator for Afghanistan, told news agency AP that when the walls of mud and wooden homes collapse, the roof falls on the occupants, leading to injury or death. He added that while the area has a low population density, the timing of the quake meant everyone was asleep.The affected area lies in the Himalaya and Hindu Kush ranges, which are seismically active due to the collision of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. This has produced some of the most destructive earthquakes in the region, including the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal.Afghanistan has also faced repeated earthquakes, particularly in the eastern belt. In October 2023, an earthquake killed more than 1,500 people. In 2022, another killed over 1,000.For comparison, the 2011 Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand was of a similar magnitude and even shallower, yet it caused 185 deaths in a city setting. In Afghanistan, scattered rural settlements faced hundreds of deaths, showing a clear contrast.In rural Afghanistan, people rely on natural materials such as stone and wood for building homes, as they cannot afford manufactured materials. These houses are built without engineered designs, building codes or professional standards that provide safety in other countries.A common form of construction uses mud bricks or stone masonry in what is called ""monolithic"" style. Such structures cannot withstand the side-to-side movement of earthquakes. As a result, buildings collapse quickly and crush people inside.It is the third major earthquake since the Taliban seized power in 2021, and the latest crisis to beset Afghanistan, which is reeling from deep cuts to aid funding, a weak economy, and millions of people forcibly returned from Iran and Pakistan.Aid for Afghanistan is also limited as global crises compete for attention and donor countries reduce their budgets.""Less international aid means fewer ambulances, fewer doctors, fewer nurses, fewer midwives to send into the battered farming communities of Afghanistan's mountainous east,"" Arthur Comon, deputy director of operations at the NGO Première Urgence Internationale (PUI) was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP.""This earthquake is a crisis within a crisis,"" United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Afghanistan Indrika Ratwatte told AFP.According to Ratwatte, funding cuts have led to the shutdown of 400 health facilities.The United States had been Afghanistan’s largest donor, giving $3.71 billion in aid since the Taliban takeover in 2021, but in January it reduced its support to only a fraction of that amount.“The Americans had put the country on a drip feed, and then pulled it out before the patient was healed,” said a source at a French NGO.","The Taliban government in Afghanistan said on Tuesday that the death toll from the earthquake in eastern Afghanistan has crossed 1,400.

Another earthquake measuring 5.2 on the Richter scale struck eastern Afghanistan on Tuesday, near the epicentre of Sunday's powerful tremor, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said.The latest quake was centred 34 kilometres (21 miles) northeast of Jalalabad in Nangarhar province, the USGS added.The fresh tremor near the same epicentre comes just a day after a powerful 6.0 magnitude quake devastated parts of the region late Sunday, leaving over 1,400 people dead and nearly 2,500 injured, according to a Taliban government spokesperson.In Nangarhar province alone, another dozen people were killed and hundreds more injured, AFP reported.The back-to-back quakes have flattened thousands of homes, toppled buildings, and triggered large-scale rescue and relief operations.Rescuers, joined by villagers, searched through rubble with their bare hands, while emergency teams struggled to access remote, mountainous areas.More than 5,400 houses were destroyed in Kunar province, government spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat said on X, adding that emergency shelters were being set up and aid offers were pouring in from several countries.The United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Afghanistan, Indrika Ratwatte warned that ""hundreds of thousands"" could be affected.The European Union further announced that it would send 130 tonnes of emergency supplies ($1.2 million) in aid.Afghanistan’s response capacity remains severely limited as international aid has dwindled since the Taliban takeover in 2021. The country is one of the world's poorest, with many people living in mud-brick homes highly vulnerable to collapse in earthquakes, the agency reported.The USGS said Sunday's tremor struck just eight kilometres below the surface, making it relatively shallow and more destructive. Many of those worst affected are Afghans recently forced to return from Iran and Pakistan, resettling in fragile villages near the Torkham border crossing.India has sent humanitarian aid to Afghanistan after a series of powerful earthquakes left over 1,400 people dead.The ministry of external affairs (MEA) confirmed the assistance in a post on X on Monday, saying, ""India extends humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan in the wake of the earthquake.""Earthquakes are common in Afghanistan, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain range where the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates meet, but the scale of destruction in recent days has been especially devastating.","India has sent humanitarian aid to Afghanistan after a series of powerful earthquakes left over 1,400 people dead.

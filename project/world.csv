Future of a giant golden Trump statue ‘Don Colossus’ remains uncertain despite completion; here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/future-of-a-giant-golden-trump-statue-don-colossus-remains-uncertain-despite-completion-heres-why/articleshow/128060007.cms,"(Image credits: AFP)

A massive gold-leafed statue of US President Donald Trump lies on its back inside a sculpture studio in Ohio, its future uncertain more than a year after it was completed.The 15-foot bronze sculpture, dubbed “Don Colossus,” depicts Trump raising his fist moments after surviving an assassination attempt in July 2024. Once installed on a 6,000-pound base, it is designed to stand two storeys tall.The statue was commissioned for $360,000 by cryptocurrency entrepreneurs backing Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. But it has yet to be formally erected, partly because sculptor Alan Cottrill says he has not been fully paid.“I would be a fool to install it without the payment being made, and I am not a fool,” said Cottrill, 73, who says he is still owed around $92,000, as quoted by AP.The stalled project has become a symbol of the instability surrounding cryptocurrency ventures, and of the shifting alliances within Trump’s political and financial orbit.Cottrill alleges that after he was hired, the project’s backers went behind his back and began using images of the sculpture to promote their $PATRIOT cryptocurrency. The token is a meme coin — a digital asset with no intrinsic value that depends on speculation and online communities to build its price.Trump’s close ties to the crypto sector have drawn accusations of major conflicts of interest. Bloomberg News estimates the Trump family fortune grew by $1.4 billion last year from digital assets alone.The $PATRIOT coin launched in November 2024 and drew strong interest as Trump swept the US presidential election that month. But its momentum was short-lived.Days before his January inauguration, and just ahead of the planned unveiling of the statue, Trump launched his own cryptocurrency, $TRUMP. As $TRUMP surged, $PATRIOT’s value collapsed. Although it continues to trade, the coin is now worth more than 95 per cent less than its peak.Those behind $PATRIOT include Republican strategist Dustin Stockton, who was investigated by federal agents over his work on “We Build The Wall,” a fundraising effort that led Trump adviser Steve Bannon to plead guilty to defrauding donors. Stockton did not immediately respond to AFP requests for comment.At his studio in Zanesville, Ohio, about 300 miles west of Washington, Cottrill speaks proudly of his work and his long career. He has sculpted at least 17 US presidents, including a statue of Thomas Edison that stands at the US Capitol.“When they said 15-feet tall, they were starting to get to the scale of my ego,” he laughed.Cottrill says it took a month to create the life-sized figure, followed by three more months to enlarge it, cast it in bronze, and have his team polish and buff the surface by hand.“It’s just overpowering. It’s mammoth,” he said.The project was not without creative disputes. Cottrill said he sculpted the 79-year-old Republican leader’s “turkey neck,” but the crypto backers objected and asked for a more flattering, less realistic look.Trump’s hair proved to be another challenge.“The hardest thing was sculpting his hair. Holy shmoly! Oi yoi yoi!” he exclaimed. “You can’t sculpt and cast something that is…” he paused, trying to find the right word, “wispy.”Asked to reflect on his experience working with the cryptocurrency world, Cottrill was blunt. “The short answer is, I won’t do it again.”More than a year after it was finished, the statue now appears to have a home at the Trump National Doral golf resort in Miami. Cottrill installed the base there last month, but no unveiling date has been announced.","The 15-foot bronze sculpture depicts Trump raising his fist moments after surviving an assassination attempt in July 2024.

Fergie’s ‘Secret Epstein Messages’ Ignite Crisis As Expert Warns Of Congress Showdown | WATCH

Crown Princess’s son denies rape charges





Norway’s royal family faced renewed scrutiny this week as charities reviewed or cut ties with Crown Princess Mette-Marit over her past contact with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , while critics questioned her suitability as Norway’s future queen.The Crown Princess issued a “profound apology” to Norwegians after it emerged she had exchanged messages with Epstein for three years.""I also apologise for the situation in which I have placed the Royal House, especially the King and Queen,"" she said in a palace statement.Hundreds of emails exchanged between Crown Princess Mette-Marit and Jeffrey Epstein between 2011 and 2014 were revealed in files released by the US Justice Department last week.Some messages discussed plans to meet in person and showed that the crown princess spent four days at Epstein’s Palm Beach home in Florida while he was reportedly not present.Emails sent in 2012 from “H K H Kronprinsessen” — Norwegian for “Her Royal Highness The Crown Princess”, show Mette-Marit referring to Jeffrey Epstein as “sweetheart” and “soft hearted,” as cited by CNN.In another exchange the same year, she described Epstein as “very charming,” and wrote: “Is it inappropriate for a mother to suggest two naked women carrying a surfboard for my 15-year-old sons wallpaper?”A separate 2012 conversation records Epstein saying he was on a “wife hunt,” adding: “Paris is proving interesting but I prefer scandinavians (sic).”Mette-Marit replied that Paris was “good for adultery” and that “Scandis better wife material.”The tone of the correspondence surprised many in Norway, and the messages indicate she was aware Epstein had served a jail term in 2008. In an October 2011 email, she wrote: “Googled u after last email… Agree didn’t look too good.”The palace initially issued a statement last week in which the crown princess expressed regret and acknowledged “poor judgment”, but it faced pressure to clarify the nature of her relationship with Epstein.In a further statement on Friday, the palace said she was “deeply saddened” that she had not realised earlier what kind of person Epstein was. It added that she wanted to provide a more detailed explanation but was in a “very difficult situation” and needed time to “gather herself.”Another controversy surrounding Norway’s royal family centres on Crown Princess Mette-Marit’s 29-year-old son, Marius Borg Høiby, who broke down in tears during his first day of testimony this week as he denied four counts of rape in an Oslo court.Høiby is not in the line of succession, having been born before Mette-Marit married Crown Prince Haakon in 2001.Ahead of the trial beginning on Tuesday, Crown Prince Haakon issued a rare statement reaffirming Høiby’s status as a private citizen, saying his stepson was “not a member of the Royal House of Norway and is therefore autonomous.”","Hundreds of emails exchanged between Crown Princess Mette-Marit and Jeffrey Epstein between 2011 and 2014 were revealed in files released by the US Justice Department last week.

Dubai has formally launched the operational phase of fully autonomous RT6 taxi vehicles, marking a major step in the emirate’s push to integrate advanced artificial intelligence into its transport network.The launch was led by Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai. Sheikh Hamdan travelled in one of the autonomous taxis to the venue of the World Government Summit at Madinat Jumeirah, demonstrating the readiness of the technology to operate in real urban conditions on roads open to live traffic. The milestone clears the path for the public launch of the service in the first quarter of 2026.During the journey, Sheikh Hamdan was briefed on the vehicle’s operating system, which relies on artificial intelligence, advanced sensing technologies, and autonomous decision-making to ensure safe and seamless mobility. The RT6 vehicle, developed by Baidu Apollo Go, represents the sixth generation of autonomous taxi technology and has been designed for large-scale deployment.It is equipped with more than 40 sensors, including high-precision LiDAR, multi-band radars, and advanced cameras, allowing it to perceive its surroundings accurately, respond to changing traffic conditions, and comply fully with transport safety standards and traffic regulations.The system is supported by a sophisticated software ecosystem that integrates real-time data, high-definition maps, and deep learning algorithms, enabling smooth interaction with intersections, pedestrians, and other vehicles. The technology draws on extensive global experience, with Baidu Apollo Go vehicles having completed more than 150 million kilometres of safe driving and over 10 million autonomous trips across several cities.The initiative is the result of cooperation between the Roads and Transport Authority and Baidu Apollo Go, following discussions held during the World Governments Summit 2025. Within around 10 months, the partnership progressed from planning to live operations, reflecting Dubai’s regulatory efficiency and smart infrastructure readiness.As part of the expansion, Baidu Apollo Go has opened its first autonomous vehicle operations and control centre outside China at Dubai Science Park. Spanning 2,000 square metres, the facility manages daily operations, monitoring, software updates, maintenance, and safety testing. The company plans to expand its autonomous fleet in Dubai to more than 1,000 vehicles in the coming years, reinforcing the emirate’s ambition to lead the future of smart and sustainable mobility.","Dubai has formally launched the operational phase of fully autonomous RT6 taxi vehicles.

Epstein files fallout: Why UK PM Keir Starmer is under fire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/epstein-files-fallout-why-uk-pm-keir-starmer-is-under-fire/articleshow/127927777.cms,"Epstein files earthquake in US but tremors in UK - Is UK PM Keir Starmer's job under threat? (AP photo)

Mandelson-Epstein Scandal Rocks UK Parliament; Starmer Under Siege Over Russian Spy Claims, Judgment

Leadership challenges add to pressure on Starmer





The global fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal is threatening the political future of a world leader — but not the one many might expect.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has never been directly linked to Epstein, yet he is facing mounting political pressure connected to the wider fallout of the case. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump — whose name appears in some investigative files related to the disgraced financier — is facing no immediate political threat. As political tensions grow in Britain, Epstein victims continue to push for further accountability in Washington.The contrast highlights the different political environments facing both leaders. While British institutions focused on scrutiny and accountability are actively probing links tied to the scandal, Trump’s influence over the Justice Department and strong backing within the Republican-controlled Congress have limited political fallout for him. At the same time, the reach of the Epstein files continues to expand globally, with implications now touching countries including Norway and Poland, nearly seven years after Epstein’s death.In the United Kingdom, public anger over any association with Epstein has been intense. King Charles III stripped his brother, former Prince Andrew, of royal titles and removed him from royal duties due to his links with Epstein.In contrast, the United States has not seen similar political or institutional consequences for figures connected to Epstein, who died by suicide in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking and abuse charges involving underage girls.One of the most prominent figures to face professional consequences was former US treasury secretary Larry Summers. The former Harvard University president stepped back from public roles last year after emails revealed he had exchanged sexist remarks and sought personal advice from Epstein. Summers later said he was “deeply ashamed.”Trump, meanwhile, is attempting to move past renewed scrutiny after the US Department of Justice said there would be no further prosecutions tied to the case. Authorities have not charged Trump or anyone else named in newly released files, and there is no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the president. Some references to Trump in the documents are routine, while others include newly surfaced, unverified sexual assault allegations and accounts from some Epstein victims describing encounters with the future president.Starmer’s political crisis, however, has deepened. His leadership came under further strain after unrest among Labour Party lawmakers added to ongoing challenges facing his government.During a tense parliamentary session, Starmer acknowledged he was aware of the relationship between former Cabinet minister Peter Mandelson and Epstein before appointing him ambassador to Washington.Starmer dismissed Mandelson last year after earlier Epstein documents showed Mandelson maintained ties with Epstein after his 2008 sex offense conviction in Florida. The controversy intensified this week following newly released files suggesting Mandelson may have shared sensitive, market-moving information with Epstein during the 2008 financial crisis. Mandelson is now under criminal investigation and has resigned from both the House of Lords and the Labour Party.“Mandelson betrayed our country, our parliament and my party,” Starmer told parliament.The political fallout in Britain is being driven not only by Epstein’s crimes but by deeper, ongoing tensions in British politics. Starmer is facing pressure less than two years after winning a landslide election victory, with speculation growing about potential leadership challenges within the Labour Party.British prime ministers face constant internal party pressure in a system where leadership challenges can emerge quickly. The current crisis comes after more than a decade of political instability that saw the UK cycle through multiple prime ministers.The Epstein scandal has also revived scrutiny of Mandelson’s long and controversial political career. Once a key architect of Labour’s transformation in the 1990s alongside Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, Mandelson helped move the party toward the political center. However, repeated controversies — often linked to his connections with wealthy and influential figures — have overshadowed his legacy.The scandal has also revived debate about the British royal family, particularly Prince Andrew’s association with Epstein and his settlement with Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of abuse after being trafficked by Epstein. Andrew denied wrongdoing and made no admission of liability or guilt, but the settlement intensified public criticism and contributed to his removal from royal duties.While Epstein-related developments have created turbulence in US politics, they have not posed a direct threat to Trump’s presidency. He has not been accused of any crimes related to the case, though his past association with Epstein continues to draw scrutiny.Trump remains politically resilient despite ongoing controversies, from immigration policies to disputes over election integrity. His political strategy often involves overwhelming public discourse with multiple issues simultaneously, reducing the impact of any single controversy.","UK PM Keir Starmer has never been directly linked to Epstein, yet he is facing mounting political pressure.

"Is Trump's Gold Card illegal? Lawsuit says scientists, engineers waiting in queues while the rich get entry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-trumps-gold-card-illegal-lawsuit-says-scientists-engineers-waiting-in-queues-while-the-rich-gets-entry/articleshow/127917594.cms,"Trump’s $1 Million Gold Card Explained: What America’s Costliest Visa Means For Indian Applicants

Who qualifies for EB-1, EB-2 visas?





A lawsuit has challenged Trump's Gold Card visa program, calling it an illegal fast lane for wealthy foreigners, irrespective of merit while researchers and scientists are waiting in the backlogged queue. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Washington, asked the judge to block the program as it prioritizes wealth over intellect or ability and bypasses Congress in the process.The Gold Card program promises permanent residency in exchange for payments of at least $1 million, like the EB-1 and EB-2 visas. In EB category visas, the applicants have to create jobs in the US but Gold Card visa program gives a waiver to the applicants from that criteria as they are 'gifting' the government a specific amount of money.“Rather than reserving those visas for the world’s best and brightest, the Gold Card program converts those visas into revenue-generating commodities sold to the highest bidder,” the lawsuit by a coalition of immigrants, labor unions and academic organizations argued.People with extraordinary ability qualify for an EB-1 visa showing sustained national or international acclaim and achievements that have been recognized in their field.One must intend to continue to work in this field and show that you will substantially benefit the United States in the future.The lawsuit noted that none of these categories created by Congress includes a million-dollar pay and play option and there is a separate visa category for that. EB-5 was specifically created by Congress to spur investment in the US and this category requires applicants to invest about $1 million in a new commercial enterprise for at least two years, but it also has other, more stringent requirements, including specifications as to where such investments must be made.“If you look at the statute, you can tell Congress made some pretty deliberate decisions about how they wanted to structure the availability of these visas,” said Sarah Wilson, a partner at the law firm Colombo & Hurd and one of the lawyers who brought the suit. Wilson's firm was joined by the Democracy Defenders Fund, a nonprofit that challenged Trump administration on a number of fronts.","A lawsuit has challenged Trump's Gold Card visa program, calling it an illegal fast lane for wealthy foreigners.

Hajj early start tied to long term planning goals





Hajj service and accommodation contracts completed





Hajj camps allocated and coordination ongoing





Focus on smoother operations during the season









Saudi authorities have moved early on preparations for the next Hajj, opening the visa process months before pilgrims begin their journey, a step aimed at tightening planning and easing pressure during the peak season.The Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has announced that visas for the 2026 Hajj season, corresponding to 1447 AH, began being issued on Sunday, February 8, which falls on Sha’ban 20. The early start places the Kingdom nearly four months ahead of the rituals, setting the tone for a more structured and predictable pilgrimage season.Officials said the advanced timeline is part of a broader push to raise service readiness and improve pilgrim comfort. The move aligns with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 framework, which prioritises efficiency, service quality, and better crowd management across the Hajj and Umrah ecosystem.By initiating visa issuance well in advance, authorities aim to give pilgrims, service providers, and Hajj affairs offices more time to prepare, coordinate, and address logistical requirements before arrivals begin.The ministry said contracts covering all services at the holy sites for pilgrims arriving from outside the Kingdom have been finalised.Accommodation agreements in Makkah have also been completed in full through the Nusk platform, clearing a major operational milestone early in the cycle.In terms of demand, 750,000 pilgrims have registered so far. Packages have already been booked for 30,000 pilgrims directly from their home countries, reflecting early engagement with the system.Preparations at the holy sites are advancing alongside visa issuance. Around 485 camps have been allocated for international pilgrims, while 73 Hajj affairs offices have completed their basic contractual arrangements.The ministry said coordination is continuing with Hajj affairs offices and service providers both inside and outside Saudi Arabia to finalise remaining operational details and ensure consistency across services.Officials described the early visa rollout as part of a proactive approach designed to reduce last minute challenges and deliver a more organised Hajj experience.The step forms part of a wider set of organisational and technical measures already under way. These include completing service contracts at the holy sites, approving accommodation and transport agreements, and preparing and allocating camps. Together, these measures are intended to support smooth operations and improve service delivery for millions of pilgrims expected to arrive for Hajj 2026.","Saudi Arabia will begin issuing Hajj 2026 visas from February 8, four months ahead.

NEW DELHI: The United States has accused China of conducting a covert nuclear explosive test on June 22, 2020, just days after the deadly Galwan Valley clash in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed, saying the allegation underscores the need for a new global arms control framework following the expiry of the New START treaty.On June 15, 2020, a week before the alleged nuclear test, the Indian and Chinese troops clashed in Ladakh. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed, while reports at the time estimated Chinese casualties at over 35.US Under Secretary of State Thomas G DiNanno said China used techniques designed to evade international monitoring systems while carrying out yield-producing nuclear tests.""China has conducted nuclear explosive tests, including preparing for tests with designated yields in the hundreds of tons… China has used decoupling – a method to decrease the effectiveness of seismic monitoring – to hide its activities from the world.

Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in the clashes, while intelligence reports at the time estimated Chinese casualties at over 30.DiNanno’s remarks came as the New START treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia, formally expired this week, leaving the world’s two largest nuclear powers without binding limits on their strategic arsenals for the first time in more than five decades.""New START was signed in 2010 and its limits on warheads and launchers are no longer relevant in 2026 when one nuclear power is expanding its arsenal at a scale and pace not seen in over half a century and another continues to maintain and develop a vast range of nuclear systems unconstrained by New START’s terms,"" DiNanno said.He said the treaty imposed uneven constraints on nuclear powers.""…almost all of the U.S. deployed nuclear forces were subject to New START while only a fraction of Russia's much larger stockpile was… exactly zero Chinese nuclear weapons were covered by New START,"" he said.DiNanno said alleged covert testing by China, alongside Russian violations and the growth of global nuclear stockpiles, made it necessary to pursue a new arms control framework suited to present-day threats.""This confluence of factors – serial Russian violations, growth of worldwide stockpiles, and flaws in New START’s design and implementation – gives the United States a clear imperative to call for a new architecture that addresses the threats of today, not those of a bygone era,"" he said.He added that Washington was now in a position to strengthen deterrence while remaining open to meaningful negotiations.""No longer constrained by the political-military circumstances of 2010 and the treaty they yielded and in response to the destabilizing behavior of these other countries, the United States can now finally take steps… to strengthen deterrence on behalf of the American people and our allies,"" DiNanno said.The US has renewed calls for three-way nuclear arms control talks involving China and Russia following New START’s expiration. Washington has said any future agreement must include Beijing, a demand China has firmly rejected.China has denied the US allegations of covert nuclear testing and has said it will not participate in disarmament negotiations at this stage, arguing that its nuclear arsenal remains far smaller than those of the United States and Russia.US President Donald Trump had previously hinted at similar accusations without offering details. On October 31 last year, Trump said Washington would begin nuclear testing ""on an equal basis"" with Moscow and Beijing, without elaborating on the nature of such tests.Analysts have warned that the end of New START marks a turning point in global nuclear stability, with the absence of formal limits increasing the risk of a renewed arms race amid rising geopolitical tensions and mistrust.","US Under Secretary of State Thomas G DiNanno said China used techniques designed to evade international monitoring systems while carrying out yield-producing nuclear tests. On June 15, 2020, a week before the alleged nuclear test, the Indian and Chinese troops clashed in Ladakh.

Tony Hawk has issued a detailed public rebuttal after online speculation claimed one of his weddings took place on a private Caribbean island once owned by Jeffrey Epstein, following the release of a new tranche of US Justice Department documents.The skateboarding icon, 57, addressed the claims directly on Instagram after social media users seized on a third-party tip contained in the files and attempted to connect it to his personal life. Hawk said the allegation was “nonsense”, laid out a verified timeline of his four marriages, and stressed that he had never met Epstein nor visited his island.The confusion stems from an FBI tip referenced in the newly released Epstein-related files. The document summarises a call to the FBI’s tip line, logged by a Threat Intake Examiner at the National Threat Operations Center, in which an unnamed woman alleged she had been exploited as a minor and trafficked to multiple locations, including Little Saint James.In the course of recounting her allegations, the caller claimed she had been on the island “when Prince Edward was there and when Tony Hawk got married on the island”. The document does not present corroboration for that claim and makes clear it reflects the caller’s account. Being named in the files does not indicate wrongdoing, and many entries are unverified tips or third-party statements.Hawk’s name appears three times across the document release. Two of those references relate not to travel or personal associations, but to email discussions about the 2010 video game. The remaining reference is the unverified allegation above, which Hawk says is demonstrably false.Hawk responded via an Instagram Story, writing: “I apologise if they don’t fit a narrative of nonsense,” before listing the locations of each of his weddings:None of those locations overlap with Epstein’s former property in the US Virgin Islands.He said the speculation likely arose from his third wedding in 2006, which took place on Tavarua Island in Fiji. Photographs from that ceremony were later licensed to Getty Images, and the photographer credited on those images is named Mark Epstein.Hawk addressed that point explicitly: “One of the guests in 2006 shot photos of the Fiji ceremony and licensed them to Getty Images. His name is (coincidentally) Mark Epstein.” He added that the photographer is “an accomplished action sports photographer from Wyoming” who is “in no way related” to Jeffrey Epstein.For context, Jeffrey Epstein’s brother, Mark Epstein, is a New York–based property developer; the shared surname appears to have caused the confusion. “This is all easily verifiable information,” Hawk wrote. “Facts are not fungible.” He apologised to the photographer for being “pulled into the misinformation vortex.”Hawk, a father of four and a household name well beyond skateboarding, concluded by reiterating that he had never visited Epstein’s island and had no personal association with the late financier, underscoring that the claim circulating online collapses under basic fact-checking."," skateboarding icon, 57, addressed the claims directly on Instagram.

UNMISSABLE Testimonies: 'Will Break Your F***ing Window': U.S. Citizens Reveal ICE Horror On Capitol





A heated confrontation at a Minneapolis yoga studio has gone viral after a group of students confronted staff over the removal of an anti-ICE protest sign from the premises.In a video shared on TikTok, around a dozen patrons are seen gathering in the studio lobby after a Sunday class, demanding answers from two female staff members. The exchange was led by longtime member Heather Anderson, who repeatedly pressed employees to explain why the company had not publicly condemned Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in the city.“Give us answers… why are you being silent?” Anderson is heard saying in the clip, raising her voice as other customers voiced support. At one point, she urged a staff member to respond “loud and proud,” while accusing the company of failing to take a clear stand.The staffers, identified by the company as a studio manager and a regional director — not corporate executives, appeared visibly uncomfortable during the exchange. One employee told the group, “We’re being berated right now,” a remark that further inflamed tensions.“You’re not being berated, you’re being asked hard questions,” a patron responded, as others demanded to know whether the removed sign would be restored.In a statement, CorePower Yoga confirmed that the original anti-ICE sign had been replaced with standardized signage used across its studios, clarifying that law enforcement or ICE officials may only enter with a valid judicial warrant. The company said it does not condone “violent ICE raids” and emphasized that its studios are intended to be safe and welcoming spaces.Following the incident, memberships of attendees present during the confrontation were temporarily paused as a precaution. The company later reinstated more than half after individual discussions, while Anderson’s membership was fully terminated.Anderson defended her actions in remarks to the New York Post, saying she did not regret how she handled the situation.The episode comes amid heightened tensions in Minneapolis, where anti-ICE protests have intensified in recent weeks. Federal authorities have since announced a reduction in ICE personnel in Minnesota, even as investigations continue into separate protest-related incidents.The viral video has sparked debate online over activism, corporate responsibility, and the boundaries of protest inside private businesses.","A video of a heated confrontation at a Minneapolis yoga studio has gone viral.

No F-22s at the Super Bowl: Why Raptors were dropped from the flyover?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-f-22s-at-the-super-bowl-why-raptors-were-dropped-from-the-flyover/articleshow/128047707.cms,"Kid Rock Or Bad Bunny? Trump’s Preference Shakes Super Bowl Talk





Two F-22 Raptor stealth jets originally slated for the Super Bowl LX flyover were removed due to “operational assignments,” the Air Force announced Friday.Katie Spencer, who helped organise the Department of the Air Force’s sports outreach programmes and coordinated the flyover formation, said the F-22s were part of the original concept but were reassigned as operational demands increased, Independent reported.“We wanted fifth-generation aircraft from the Air Force and fifth-generation aircraft from the Navy,” Spencer said in a Friday interview with The Military Times. “But as things happen in our military, operational tempo has increased, and so the F-22s got pulled for some operational assignments.”Iranian aircraft failed to intercept the US military, and Iran’s air-defence systems failed to spot the stealth aircraft involved in the mission. In the lead-up to the operation, roughly 10 F-22s, along with other US fighters such as F-35s and F-16s, were deployed to the Middle East to support the strike and provide air dominance if needed, according to The National Interest.More recently, in January and early February, a mix of US aircraft conducted strikes on ISIS targets in Syria during an operation known as Hawkeye Strike.Even for the aircraft approved to take part in the Super Bowl flyover, Spencer said the event served a practical military purpose beyond ceremony.As defence officials said in previous years, flyovers doubled as training exercises and did not require additional taxpayer funding.“These flyovers serve as time-over-target training for our crews,” Spencer said. “They serve as recovery efforts with our maintainers. And so the reason that we are so proficient at operations like Midnight Hammer and other things that you’ll see is because we can replicate those real-world scenarios with this type of flying.”The revised flyover for Super Bowl LX will feature aircraft representing 250 years of American airpower. Scheduled to pass over the stadium are two Air Force B-1B Lancer bombers from Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, two Air National Guard F-15C Eagles, a pair of Navy F/A-18E Super Hornets and two F-35C Lightning II fighters from Naval Air Station Lemoore in California.“Our Guard members have stepped in to fill that role, and we’re super grateful for that,” Spencer said.The Super Bowl LX kickoff is set for Sunday at 6:30 p.m. EST.","Two F-22 Raptor stealth jets originally slated for the Super Bowl LX flyover were removed due to “operational assignments,” the Air Force announced Friday.

Freestyle skier Hunter Hess on Friday said that wearing the American flag did not mean he backed everything “going on” in the US.Team USA player of the Winter Olympics, while addressing the presser, said that there are mixed emotions to represent the US.“It brings up mixed emotions to represent the U.S. right now,” Hess said and added, “It’s a little hard, there’s obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of and I think a lot of people aren’t.""“Just because I’m wearing the flag doesn’t mean I represent everything that’s going on in the US.”Fellow freestyle skier Chris Lillis, a 2022 Olympic gold medallist from Rochester, NY, also commented, linking his concerns to immigration enforcement and protests in the US.“I’m heartbroken about what’s happening in the United States,” Lillis said. “I think that as a country we need to focus on respecting everybody’s rights and making sure that we are treating our citizens as well as anybody with love and respect.”“I hope that when people look at athletes compete in the Olympics they realize that that’s the America that we’re trying to represent,” he added.The remarks spread across social media, where critics accused him of criticising the country he was meant to represent and said they would boycott the Games, New York Post reported.“This privileged athlete’s comments clearly show that he puts himself far above his country in this competition,” one user on X wrote. “His comments are an insult to Team USA and the spirit of the Olympics. Cut.”Another wrote that Hess’ “whole purpose in being there is to REPRESENT the USA,” adding that if he had mixed feelings, “there are other skiers that would love to be there.”Others said the comments were enough to make them stop watching.“You know what? I’m going to go on ahead and turn it off right now,” one critic on X wrote, tagging the Olympics’ official account.“I was already planning not to watch; this just seals the deal!” another added.Some argued there was no room for selective patriotism.“When you wear the Stars and Stripes, you represent ALL of us — not just the parts you like,” another commenter wrote. “’Mixed emotions?’ Then stay home and let someone who loves this country shine.”Hess, 27, competed on the US freestyle circuit and came from Bend, Oregon. He had multiple World Cup and X Games podiums, joined the national team in 2017 and competed in the halfpipe.","Freestyle skier Hunter Hess on Friday said that wearing the American flag did not mean he backed everything ""going on"" in the US.

Nithya Raman, a sitting member of the Los Angeles City Council and one of the most prominent progressive voices in city politics, has entered the race to become the next mayor of LA.The 44-year-old, who represents the city’s Fourth District, jumped into the contest just ahead of the filing deadline, setting up a high-stakes primary challenge to incumbent mayor Karen Bass. While she previously endorsed Bass, calling her an ""icon"", Raman said the city needs ""big changes."" “I have deep respect for Mayor Bass. We’ve worked closely together on my biggest priorities and her biggest priorities, and there’s significant alignment there,” she told the Times.“But over the last few months in particular, I’ve really begun to feel like unless we have some big changes in how we do things in Los Angeles, the things we count on are not going to function anymore.”Bass, 72, who is running for a second term, has been facing mounting criticism over the city's Palisades fire response, which killed 12 people and destroyed thousands of homes. Now, she will be challenged by Raman with a campaign on housing, homelessness, transparency and ""safety in our streets.""What's interesting is that Raman is backed by Democratic Socialists of America, which scored one of the most divisive and controversial wins last fall with the election of New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani, a fellow Indian-origin leader like Raman. This immediately makes her a national figure to watch within left-leaning politics.Among more than two dozen opponents from across the political spectrum, Nithya Raman stands out. She is an immigrant, an urban planner, a homelessness activist and a mother of twins. In 2020, she also became the first woman sworn in to the LA City Council, representing the Fourth District—which includes parts of Koreatown, Hollywood, Los Feliz, Silver Lake, and many other areas of the second-largest city.Born in a Malayali family in Kerala, India, Raman moved to Louisiana at six years old. She grew up to gain an undergraduate degree from Harvard University and a Master's in Urban Planning from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.In terms of her career, she is an urban planner who has worked for slum dwellers in India until 2013, when she moved to LA. In LA, she co-founded SELAH, a homeless coalition after serving as co-chair of the Silver Lake Neighbourhood Council Homelessness Committee. Raman also served as the first executive director of Time's Up Entertainment, a women's rights organisation that emerged from MeToo activism.In 2020, she became the first Asian-American woman and the first South Asian to serve in the City Council. Raman is married to a television screenwriter, Vali Chandrasekaran and mom to young twins Karna and Kaveri.With her campaign, she will be targeting the youth demanding affordability and the conservatives, wanting restoration after the destructive fires. But she will be competing with reality TV star Spencer Pratt, a victim of the fires, Democratic socialist Rae Huang, Brentwood tech entrepreneur Adam Miller and Asaad Alnajjar, an employee of the Bureau of Street Lighting.What works best in her favour is that she won't lose completely. Raman would still hold her council seat, since she does not face re-election until 2028.","Nithya Raman, 44, is a sitting member of the Los Angeles City Council.

A skier died Thursday after a catastrophic fall on one of Mammoth Mountain’s steepest expert runs, with the accident unfolding in full view of stunned onlookers riding a nearby chairlift. The incident marks the fourth death at the popular California ski resort this season.The unidentified skier was attempting Dropout 2, a notorious double-black-diamond trail that plunges nearly 1,200 vertical feet from the 11,000-foot summit ridge.Regarded as one of the steepest marked runs in the state, the slope is visible from Chair 23, which transports advanced skiers to some of the mountain’s most extreme terrain.Witnesses said the skier fell near the top of the icy, heavily moguled run, lost both skis and slid headfirst down the slope for hundreds of yards as horrified bystanders watched helplessly from above.“Looked like he lost skis high in deep moguls,” one eyewitness wrote on Reddit, calling it the “worst thing I’ve ever seen on the mountain.”Mammoth Mountain confirmed that ski patrol rushed to the scene and administered life-saving care before the skier was transported to paramedics. Despite the efforts, the guest succumbed to injuries, the resort said in a statement.The tragedy comes days after another alarming incident at Mammoth, where a 12-year-old girl survived a terrifying fall after dangling from a ski lift. Authorities have not yet released the identity of the deceased skier.","A skier died Thursday after a catastrophic fall on one of Mammoth Mountain's steepest expert runs.

— Richard Hanania (@RichardHanania) February 7, 2026









An online debate over Asian and Indian students in US universities has flared up after an American political influencer pushed back strongly against allegations of cheating in exams.The row began after an X user claimed that Asian, especially Indian, students routinely cheated during exams at Rutgers University. The user wrote that his father, who taught computer science there for over a decade, would come home “upset and demoralized” because Asian students would “cheat en masse on exams” and then deny it even when caught. The post ended by suggesting that this showed “different philosophies of success”.The claim drew a response from American political scientist Richard Hanania. Replying on X, Hanania said: “Yeah, well I’ve never seen an Indian cheat in my life!” He went on to add that a lot of these claims are based on racism against Indians: “Some forms of racism rely on data. Others rely on anecdotes. Don’t be an anecdotal racist. It’s too easy to tell yourself stories you want to hear.”Hanania has previously defended Indians and Asian communities against negative portrayals.Earlier this month, the right-wing analyst had criticised anti-Indian hate and praised Indian workers after a report showed they earn the highest median pay in Germany. In a post, he wrote: “Indians win again. How can a group be so beneficial while bringing no harms across so many countries? It’s absolutely awe-inspiring. ”Hanania has previously said that “anti-Indian hate is the dumbest form of racism” and has defended H-1B visas, which allow skilled foreigners to work in the US legally. He has also spoken out against anti-India rhetoric within conservative circles, including criticism of figures such as Steve Bannon and Ron DeSantis.Indian and other Asian students make up the largest share of international students in the United States. Indians are the biggest single group, largely studying STEM subjects such as engineering, computer science and data science. China is the second largest source country. Most Asian students are enrolled at the graduate level and play a major role in US universities through tuition fees, research output, innovation and skilled labour contributions.","American political scientist Richard Hanania responded to claims of cheating in exams.

You’re a part time-mother anyway,” he once texted her, referencing their two children.“Stop leaving your ‘watercolors’ of c–ksucking around where the kids can see them and your crotchless underwear on the floor for everyone to see and your anal lubricant around,” he added.In her Palm Beach County filings, Elizabeth alleged her estranged husband “exerted financial warfare” and harassed her friends, including Tawil and New York jeweller Anne Baker, with unnecessary and intimidating subpoenas.The husband claimed the jeweller sold Elizabeth a $125,500 diamond and platinum chain, a $98,000 Georgian diamond collet-set necklace, and a $68,000 emerald-cut diamond bracelet, and may have information about the wife’s alleged affair.Elizabeth alleged Jeffrey “stalked” her and screamed at and followed her during one of their children’s school events.“Throughout these proceedings the husband has sent text messages . . . of naked photographs he has taken of her to harass and embarrass her,” she claimed in court papers.He also stole and photographed her journal, she said.“I had a loving and long-term relationship . . . a loving relationship with someone I have known for a long time and I had a miscarriage,” she said of her relationship with Tawil during a July deposition.The dispute unfolded alongside references to Leeds in documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. Leeds’ name appeared dozens of times in the Justice Department’s Epstein document dump and he was quoted in a 2002 New York Magazine profile of Epstein titled “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery.”“You may read about Jeffrey in the social columns, but there is much more to him than that,” Leeds said in the profile. “He’s a talented money manager and an extremely hardworking person with broad interests.”In one email, publicist Peggy Siegal listed Leeds as a “smart investor and knows politics,” while in another message, Next Model Management founder Faith Kates wrote to Epstein about Leeds.“Did u know your friend jeffrey leeds got married friday?” she wrote on March 18, 2012, three days after his wedding to Elizabeth. “Finally.”Epstein’s ex-girlfriend, physician and former model Eva Dubin also wrote to Epstein about Leeds.“Jeff Leeds says hello,” she emailed in September 2012.Leeds was not accused of misconduct in connection with Epstein.“Mr. Leeds had no professional or personal relationship with Epstein,” his lawyer, Peter Trombadore, said in a statement. “No one has suggested otherwise. Any such claims would be utterly false and defamatory.”The two “may have met in passing, though Mr. Leeds has no recollection of any such meeting,” the attorney added, saying Leeds “never went to Mr. Epstein’s office or any of his homes, was never on his plane or his island.”The couple married in a March 2012 ceremony in Manhattan presided over by former Mayor Rudy Giuliani. At the time, Jeffrey gave Elizabeth $1 million to use as she wished. Leeds Equity Partners had more than $4 billion in assets under management.The husband’s current net worth was unclear, but a prenuptial agreement indicated he had $90 million in assets before the marriage.Jeffrey filed for divorce in Palm Beach in January 2025. Days later, Elizabeth, who took their two young children and moved to Wyoming four months earlier, filed her own case there.The couple bought their five-bedroom apartment in the Park Avenue pre-war building in 2016 for $22.5 million and put it back on the market. The Hamptons home, on 4.6 acres, was once owned by the Carnegie family.Their Palm Beach property, an 11,567-square-foot house on a 1.3-acre lot a block from the ocean, was rented out, according to court records.“Elizabeth requests that the press and the public let this matter proceed privately, especially for the sake of the parties’ two young children. Other than that, she will not be making any comments at this time,” said Richard Segal, a lawyer for the wife.“This is a private matter,” Trombadore said. “Mr. Leeds asks that his privacy and that of his family during this challenging time be respected as he works to resolve issues amicably and focuses on the best interests of the children. We are not going to address specific allegations outside of Court except to state that they are completely without merit and denied.”","The couple’s legal fight involved real estate valued at $100 million. Jeffrey Leeds, 69, accused Elizabeth Leeds, 43, of having a long affair with Miami businessman Alberto Alejandro Tawil, 66, and alleged she was impregnated by him. He claimed his wife used marital money to invest more than $275,000 in a Mozambique business.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128040189,imgsize-101326,width-400,resizemode-4/fading-light-fading-love.jpg"

Arrest after months of investigation

What happened onboard

Named a suspect earlier

Family seeks justice





The stepbrother of 18-year-old Anna Kepner has been arrested and charged in connection with her death, nearly three months after the Florida teen was found dead aboard a Carnival Cruise ship, according to reports.Federal authorities had been investigating the mysterious circumstances surrounding how Anna ended up hidden under a bed inside her family’s cabin during a Caribbean voyage last November.The FBI, which has been leading the probe, reportedly arrested the 16-year-old stepbrother this week. Because he is a minor, the specific charges against him have not been made public and court records remain sealed.He is understood to have appeared before a federal judge in closed proceedings. Officials have declined to comment further due to the juvenile status of the accused and the ongoing investigation.Anna, a cheerleader from Central Florida, was travelling with her grandparents, father, stepmother, siblings and stepsiblings on a Carnival Cruise ship sailing from Florida to Mexico when tragedy struck.On the morning of November 7, she was found dead in the family’s cabin. According to investigative sources, her body was discovered under a bed, wrapped in a blanket and covered with life vests.Her death was later ruled a homicide. The death certificate listed the cause as “mechanical asphyxia,” indicating she had been suffocated. Reports have stated there were bruises on her body, but no signs of sexual assault and no alcohol or drugs in her system.In the weeks following Anna’s death, her stepbrother had been identified as a “suspect” in a court filing related to an unrelated custody case. He was previously taken into custody and released to the supervision of a guardian.The recent arrest and charging mark the first major breakthrough in the high-profile case.Anna’s grieving parents have previously described her death as “violent and senseless” and expressed anguish that the person responsible had not yet been fully held accountable.With the arrest now confirmed, the legal process is set to move forward — though much of it may remain shielded from public view due to the accused’s age.The investigation remains active, and further details are expected to emerge as proceedings continue.","The FBI, which has been leading the probe, reportedly arrested the 16-year-old stepbrother this week.

NEW DELHI: Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday. Toll rose to 36 on Saturday after some critically injured people died in hospitals, said a PTI report.In a related development that has attracted the attention of Indian security establishment, the Islamic State in its latest al-Naba issue called on members of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) to defect and join the Islamic State in Khorasan Province.The claim regarding the blast was issued via IS central's mouthpiece, Amaq, stating the attack was a Fidayeen operation carried out by a soldier of the Islamic State in Pakistan Province (ISPP) -- active since 2019 -- inside the mosque compound. Amaq claimed over 200 casualties in contrast to the official Pak govt admission of 36 deaths and injuries to scores.The suicide bomber was identified by Amaq as Saifullah Ansari. His photograph taking the bayah (oath of allegiance) was also posted by the IS mouthpiece. The statement also mentioned that hundreds of Pakistani Shias had joined the pro-Iran 'Zaynabiyoun brigade' militia in Syria.The claim by Amaq followed an official denial by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which strongly rebutted any involvement in the incident.The blast, which occurred during prayers at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque in Tarlai area, was the deadliest in Islamabad since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.The explosion coincided with the visit of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to Pakistan. The attack is being seen as a result of growing sectarian tensions in the country.Earlier in Jan, ISKP had claimed responsibility for a blast in Bajaur district that killed a senior Lashkar commander named Najibullah.","Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday.

'Home-Grown Ills': Islamabad Mosque Blast Triggers Blame Game As India Rejects Pakistan's Blame





The Islamic State on Saturday claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad, which killed at least 36 people and injured many others.In a statement released through its Amaq News Agency, the Islamic State in Pakistan, an offshoot of Daesh, said the bomber opened fire at security guards when they tried to stop him at the entrance and then exploded inside among worshippers.The group also said Shiite Muslims in Pakistan were a target, claiming they provided recruits to militias fighting the Islamic State in Syria.The blast took place on Friday at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque-cum-shrine in the Tarlie area of the capital. The attacker, identified as 32-year-old Yasir from Peshawar, entered the mosque while worshippers were offering weekly prayers and detonated explosives.Authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said they arrested four suspects, including three alleged facilitators and the mastermind, during intelligence-based raids in Peshawar and Nowshera.Investigators said an identity card recovered during the probe confirmed the attacker’s identity. Official records showed his permanent address in Abbas Colony on Charsadda Road in Peshawar.Officials also said the attacker had spent around five months in Afghanistan before the bombing, where he allegedly received training in weapons handling and suicide attacks.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif had earlier claimed that India and Afghanistan were involved in the attack, without presenting any evidence.India had strongly rejected the allegations, saying, ""It is unfortunate that, instead of seriously addressing the problems plaguing its social fabric, Pakistan should choose to delude itself by blaming others for its home-grown ills. India rejects any and every such allegation, which is as baseless as it is pointless.""","The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad.

Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States aimed at easing tensions between the two countries, slated to take place on Friday in Turkey.“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query, reported Dawn.Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar is expected to take part in the meeting, the daily reported citing a diplomatic source, adding that “Islamabad’s participation was seen as significant.”An Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the meeting is likely to be held in Turkiye on Friday. The format of the talks remains unclear, though the official said the main meeting would take place that day.A regional official told Reuters that the priority of the talks was to avoid conflict and de-escalate tensions between Iran and the US, adding that several regional powers had been invited at the foreign ministers’ level.According to the official, countries invited include Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).US outlet Axios, citing two sources and a US official, reported that Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible agreement related to Iran’s nuclear programme.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had instructed Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” in an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.The talks, he said in posts on X, would be held “within the framework of our national interests”.US President Donald Trump has said he is hopeful Washington would “work something out” with Iran but warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal was reached.In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”“In return, we expect sanctions to be lifted,” he added, while warning that Iran was prepared for war if talks failed, saying any conflict would likely spread beyond Iran.Turkiye has been leading diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and engaging with regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.","Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States.

A Pakistani anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan, sister of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan in connection with a protest held in Islamabad in November 2024.According to news agency PTI citing a media report, the warrants were issued by the ATC in Rawalpindi after Aleema Khan failed to appear before the court despite earlier directions.The court also issued non-bailable arrest warrants against her two guarantors and ordered that all three be arrested and produced before it on Wednesday, without fail. Aleema’s application seeking exemption from personal appearance was rejected.The case, registered at Sadiqabad Police Station, relates to a protest at D-Chowk in Islamabad on November 24, 2024 and includes charges of protesting against the government, chanting anti-government slogans, vandalism and stone-pelting. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing.The court also issued a show-cause notice to the Superintendent of Police (SP), Rawal, for failing to execute the arrest warrants.The SP has been directed to appear before the court on Wednesday and explain why Aleema Khan was not arrested and presented despite clear orders, according to Pakistani news website Express Tribune.During Monday’s hearing, Aleema Khan’s defence counsel sought a one-day exemption, citing difficulties in travel and daily affairs after her bank accounts, Computerised National Identity Card and passport were reportedly blocked. The court, however, did not accept the plea.The proceedings have drawn attention as Aleema Khan had earlier skipped multiple hearings in the case and appeared only after the court issued property seizure orders and several arrest warrants. She is among those nominated as accused in protest-related cases filed following the November demonstrations.The protest followed Imran Khan’s “final call” for nationwide demonstrations demanding the restoration of the party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) electoral mandate, the release of party leaders and the reversal of constitutional changes.The D-Chowk protest ended on November 26 after a security operation, with several cases registered across Rawalpindi district.

Troops ‘physically handicapped’ by vast terrain

Insurgency background and wider fallout





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country’s security forces are “physically handicapped” by the sheer size of Balochistan as they battle a fresh surge in militant violence, after authorities reported killing 177 insurgents in sweeping counter-terror operations across the province.Addressing the national assembly, Asif described the scale of the challenge facing troops deployed in Pakistan’s largest and least populated province, where coordinated attacks triggered one of the deadliest security crises in recent years. His remarks came after militants launched simultaneous assaults in multiple towns, targeting civilians, homes and security installations.“Balochistan constitutes over 40 per cent of Pakistan geographically...To control it is much more difficult than a populated city, and it needs deployment of massive forces. Our troops are deployed there and are in action against them (terrorists), but they are physically handicapped by guarding and patrolling such a big area,” Asif told lawmakers, as quoted by PTI.Security officials said the death toll of militants had risen to 177 in the past two days following large-scale raids and gun battles.The operations were launched after insurgents carried out coordinated attacks at 12 locations, with authorities confirming that at least 17 police and security personnel were killed, along with dozens of civilians.Asif said the weekend violence claimed 33 civilian lives and 17 members of the security forces. He ruled out talks with the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), saying no negotiations would be held with “terrorists” responsible for killing civilians, including women and children.Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, has long faced a separatist insurgency driven by ethnic Baloch groups who accuse the central government of discrimination and exploitation. Authorities say groups such as the BLA have targeted security forces, infrastructure and projects linked to the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor.Train services between Balochistan and the rest of Pakistan remained suspended for a third day, while mobile and internet services were cut in several districts during clean-up operations. Provincial officials said services were expected to resume once the security situation stabilised.Asif dismissed claims that Balochistan had been neglected, saying the province had seen development, including multiple airports. He also rejected the “missing persons” narrative, alleging that names of militants killed in operations had appeared on such lists. “This narrative has been concocted. I also used to support this cause and protest over it. But, terrorists and criminal elements have hijacked all these narratives,” he said.","Khawaja Asif says security forces are 'physically handicapped' by sheer size of Balochistan.

In a bizarre case, police in Pakistan’s Rawalpindi district registered a case on Sunday of abduction against a “jinn” (supernatural spirit) following the disappearance of an 11-year-old boy, news agency ANI reported, citing ARY News.The incident occurred in the garrison city when the boy went missing from his home on January 21. After ten days without any sign of the child, his father approached the Taxila Police Station and filed a First Information Report (FIR).In the FIR, the father alleged that supernatural entities, known locally as jinns, had forced his son to run away.The complainant said that this is not the first time such an incident has occurred. He added that the jinns had “abducted” his son several times before.He highlighted that while the boy had returned home after previous incidents, this time ten days had passed without his return, prompting him to formally accuse the supernatural spirits of kidnapping.According to ARY News, similar claims have been reported in Pakistan’s legal system before. In Lahore, a mother had lodged a case against jinns over the disappearance of her married daughter, a matter that eventually reached the courts.A report by Dawn in September stated that a special investigation team of Lahore police was formed under the directions of the city's high court Chief Justice Aalia Neelam to probe the six-year-old case of the missing woman, believed to have been abducted by a jinn.The team, headed by Lahore Investigation DIG Zeeshan Raza, was tasked with locating and recovering the woman.","11-year-old boy went missing from his home in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, on January 21.

(With PTI inputs)





Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January, data released on Monday by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) showed.The fatalities included 242 militants, 73 civilians, and 46 security personnel, according to the Islamabad-based think tank.At least 135 people were injured, among them 71 were civilians, 52 security personnel, and 12 militants.PICSS reported 87 militant attacks across Pakistan in January, a 28% rise from the 68 incidents recorded in December 2025. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bore the brunt, with 58 incidents—38 in the mainland districts and 20 in the tribal areas. The restive Balochistan followed with 27 attacks, while Punjab reported two targeted incidents.Balochistan emerged as the main theatre of militant violence and security operations, recording its highest monthly militant death toll since the current insurgency began in 2001. While the province remained relatively calm for most of January, violence surged dramatically in the final two days. Coordinated attacks by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) across at least 12 locations, followed by intensified security operations, placed the province at the centre of the conflict.At least 172 militants were killed, the majority in the final two days of last month.Security forces arrested at least 60 suspected militants during the previous month, while militant groups kidnapped eight individuals. In Punjab, 53 militants were arrested, 48 of them from Lahore, the state capital and Pakistan's second-largest city.Meanwhile, no militant attacks were reported in January from Sindh, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), Islamabad, or the Gilgit-Baltistan region, according to the data.","Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January.

Balochistan Crisis: Pakistan-Origin Commentator Takes Apart Islamabad, Exposes Lies On India

What is clear: the scale, coordination and symbolism of the violence mark a sharp escalation in a conflict long treated by Islamabad as containable.

Why it matters

The big picture

What's different now is the interplay of three key factors:

Zoom in: What is ""Herof""?

Herof Phase 2.0 expands on that template:

Geographic spread: Violence has been reported in Quetta, Noshki, Mastung, Kalat, Kharan, Panjgur, Gwadar, Pasni, Turbat, Kech and Awaran.

Operational depth: Suicide bombings, vehicle-borne explosives and armed assaults occurred almost simultaneously.

Human footprint: For the first time, women are reported to be participating in direct combat roles alongside men.

What they are saying

Between the lines

Zoom in: Bashir Zaib's message

The regional angle

What’s next

The bottom line





Pakistan's latest surge of violence in Balochistan reflects a deepening, not isolated, security crisis as the Baloch Liberation Army escalates its campaign through ""Operation Herof.""Over several days, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) unleashed what it calls ""Operation Herof, Phase 2.0,"" a wave of coordinated attacks across Balochistan that included suicide bombings, gun assaults and arson in major towns and remote districts alike.Pakistani authorities say dozens of civilians and security personnel were killed, followed by one of the largest counterterrorism strikes in decades. Officials claim more than 130 militants were killed in 48 hours alone. However, the BLA has refuted these official claims and reiterate that it inflicted severe casualties on Pakistan forces.Balochistan sits at the intersection of Pakistan’s security, economy and foreign policy- and all three are now under strain. The province anchors China’s Belt and Road ambitions through the port of Gwadar, hosts globally significant mineral deposits at Reko Diq, and borders both Iran and Afghanistan at a time of regional instability.As analyst Michael Kugelman put it after the attacks, ""Today’s attacks in Balochistan should serve as a wake up call to those… keen to invest in Pakistan’s critical mineral reserves."" He warned that many of those reserves lie in areas now directly hit by violence- and that resentment over ""external exploitation of local resources"" is central to the insurgency.For Islamabad, the stakes go beyond security. Investor confidence, relations with Beijing, and Pakistan’s credibility as a destination for critical minerals are all on the line.Balochistan's troubles are hardly new, but they're shiftingSince Pakistan's birth, Baloch ethnic factions have, time and again, risen up against the central government. They've sought more autonomy, a larger share of the country's wealth, or even complete independence. Each insurrection has been met with military force, temporary quiet, and, ultimately, unaddressed issues.First, economic importance. Balochistan is now crucial to Pakistan's economic story. Think of the Chinese-funded projects and the West's interest in copper, gold, and rare minerals.Second, political disillusionment. Elections since 2018 have been widely criticized, and the space for peaceful opposition has shrunk. This has intensified the feeling that political solutions are impossible.Third, the evolution of militant groups. Organizations like the BLA have become more dangerous, adept at using the media, and ideologically focused. They've adopted tactics from global insurgencies while staying rooted in local grievances.As per a report in the Native Voices: ""Herof is a Balochi literary term meaning ""black storm"", commonly used in Baloch poetry, including by the veteran poet Karim Dashti.""The BLA first used the term in August 2024, launching Herof 1.0 with attacks across 12 districts. That campaign shocked authorities by striking areas previously considered relatively stable, including Lasbela and Musakhel, and by introducing a female suicide bomber into the group’s operations.An intelligence officer cited by Native Voices estimated 800 to 1,000 fighters may be involved- a number that suggests months of recruitment, training and coordination.Pakistani officials describe the violence as foreign-orchestrated terrorism.Balochistan chief minister Sarfraz Bugti said security forces killed 145 members of what he termed ""Fitna al-Hindustan,"" the state’s label for the BLA. He claimed militants aimed to seize hostages and storm government installations, and alleged backing from India and Afghanistan- accusations both countries deny.Residents recount chaos and fear. ""(It) was a very scary day in the history of Quetta,"" said Khan Muhammad, a local resident, describing armed men openly patrolling streets before security forces moved in.India’s foreign ministry rejected Pakistan’s claims, calling them ""baseless,"" and urged Islamabad to address ""long-standing demands of its people in the region"" instead of deflecting blame outward.As per the Native Voices, the Baloch resentment has roots in a series of flashpoints.Several incidents hardened public anger: the killing of university student Hayat Baloch by paramilitary forces in 2020; the death of Malik Naz inside her home the same year; the crackdown on the Haq Do Tehreek protests in Gwadar; and the custodial killing of Baalach Mula Baksh in 2023. Each episode sparked protests. Each was followed by arrests, internet shutdowns, or worse.The arrest of activist Dr Mahrang Baloch in 2025 marked another turning point. To many young Baloch, her detention signaled that even peaceful dissent had become intolerable. Analysts say that belief has fed recruitment into armed groups, including among women, a shift now visible on the battlefield.Each episode narrowed political space- and widened the insurgency’s recruitment pool.As Kugelman noted, framing the crisis solely around body counts ""telegraphs your policy failures- because the question is why are there so many fighters to start with."" Analysts argue the BLA has successfully tapped into accumulated resentment, especially among young Baloch who see peaceful activism punished and armed resistance rewarded with attention.One of the most striking elements of Herof II has been its media choreography.As per the Native Voices, the BLA released new footage of its leader Bashir Zaib, seated on the back of a motorcycle, moving through rugged terrain believed to lie between Kharan and Chagai- a region synonymous with mineral wealth.Observers see layered symbolism: mobility, control and defiance. A senior Baloch journalist described the location choice as deliberate- close to Reko Diq and other high-profile mining sites that have drawn interest from companies like Barrick Gold and financiers such as the Asian Development Bank.The subtext to Islamabad and investors alike: the insurgency can operate where Pakistan’s economic future is being planned.Timing matters.Analysts believe the BLA launched Herof II amid unrest in neighboring Iran’s Baloch-populated regions and persistent instability in Afghanistan to amplify its message beyond Pakistan’s borders.Balochistan’s long frontier with Iran- and proximity to Gulf shipping lanes- means sustained violence here resonates in Middle Eastern, US and European policy circles, particularly as Western governments search for alternatives to Chinese-dominated mineral supply chains.The message appears aimed as much at foreign capitals as at Islamabad.In the short term, security operations will intensify. Expect heavier troop deployments, stricter controls around mining projects, transport corridors and Chinese-linked infrastructure, and continued information blackouts during operations. Islamabad will likely double down on its claims of foreign sponsorship, even as evidence remains contested.The longer-term trajectory is murkier.The paradox facing Pakistan is stark: Balochistan is now too economically important to ignore- but remains too politically neglected to stabilize.Unless that gap is addressed, the ""black storm"" the BLA invokes may only deepen, reshaping the conflict from a peripheral insurgency into a central challenge to the state.The spy-action film Dhurandhar has inadvertently revived global interest in the region by featuring elements that touch on Pakistan’s underworld and geopolitics set around Baloch communities.Dhurandhar revolves around a simple but unsettling idea: in covert conflict, what matters most is not the spectacle of action but the slow, almost invisible shifts beneath it. That logic offers a useful lens for what’s happening in Balochistan.Today, Balochistan can no longer be treated only as a security issue measured through attacks and casualties. It has become a political problem rooted in governance, representation, and legitimacy, and it cannot be managed through messaging, denial, or communication blackouts.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) unleashed what it calls ""Operation Herof, Phase 2.0,"" a wave of coordinated attacks across Balochistan that included suicide bombings, gun assaults and arson in major towns and remote districts alike. Officials say dozens of civilians and security personnel were killed, followed by one of the largest counterterrorism strikes in decades.

Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir As Pakistan Buys Global Influence





Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif revealed that both he and field marshal Asim Munir were forced to 'beg' billions in loans from friendly nations to bridge the country’s external financing gap.Speaking to leading exporters and business leaders at an event in Islamabad, Sharif said Pakistan’s growing dependence on foreign loans is humiliating and often forces officials to agree to unjustifiable demands.""We feel ashamed when Field Marshal Asim Munir and I go around the world begging for money,” he said, reported ANI citing local news.“Taking loans is a huge burden on our self-respect. Our heads bow down in shame.We cannot say NO to many things they want us to do,” Sharif added.Sharif praised Pakistan’s key allies—China, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar—for standing by Islamabad through difficult times, calling China the country’s “all-weather friend.”This is not the first time the premier has expressed discomfort over seeking loans. In January 2023, he said it embarrassed him to ask for further loans, despite acknowledging Saudi Arabia’s financial support.He has repeatedly stressed the need for Pakistan to achieve self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on IMF programmes.Notably, Pakistan is currently facing a severe debt crisis, with total public debt exceeding Rs 76,000 billion as of March 2025, nearly doubling in just four years. The nation relies heavily on IMF bailouts and loans from China--particularly for China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects--to manage debt servicing and avoid default.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at strengthening economic stability and climate resilience.","Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir.

As Bangladesh Elections Near, Hindu Minority Faces Rising Attacks, Islamist Return And State Silence





A veteran Bangladesh politician, Bangladesh Awami League senior leader Ramesh Chandra Sen died on Saturday while in custody at Dinajpur District Jail.Sen, 83, reportedly became unwell inside the jail early Saturday morning and was taken to Dinajpur Medical College Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at around 9:29 am local time, according to prison officials. Jail Superintendent Farhad Sarkar said the body would be handed over to his family once all legal procedures have been completed, as reported by ANI.His death, only days before the country’s general election scheduled for February 12, has heightened concerns over the treatment of incarcerated political leaders and renewed allegations of custodial negligence. Organising Secretary of Bangladesh Awami League Central Committee Shafiul Alam Chowdhury Nadel, alleging negligence and calling out Yunus said on X, ""Ramesh Chandra Sen from a teacher to a politician and a public representative. A five-time MP and former minister—this elderly, ill man was arrested and led away with his hands tied. He has now passed away in Dinajpur jail due to a lack of medical treatment. Yunus, you must answer for this.""President of Bangladesh Students' League Saddam Hussein also claimed medical neglect saying, ""Eighteen months ago, this widely respected, elderly leader was attacked, humiliated by BNP-Jamaat mob and taken into police custody, without any specific charges.One false and fabricated case after another was imposed on him to justify his continued detention. Despite his deteriorating health, he was deliberately denied bail, denied minimum medical treatment, and denied basic human rights. "" ""At 86 years of age, Sri Ramesh Chandra Sen was kept behind bars for one and a half years without trial and without proper medical care. This happened under the illegal, murderous-fascist Yunus regime, which chose cruelty over humanity and repression over the rule of law,"" he added.Further mentioning other Awami League politicians in custody he added, ""According to Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK), at least 107 prisoners died in custody in 2025 alone—the majority of them leaders and activists of the Awami League. In almost every case, the authorities casually cited causes such as “heart attack” or “sudden illness.” Despite clear legal provisions, not a single custodial death has been properly investigated by this illegal government. ""The veteran Hindu leader had been in custody since August 16, 2024, after being arrested by police in Thakurgaon. ""Bangladesh Police have arrested a Hindu leader of Awami League and put him on a farcical trial. Ramesh Chandra Sen, an octogenarian, was arrested from his house in Thakurgaon who was having his dinner. Surprisingly, he hails from Mirza Fakhrul's constituency,"" the Bangladesh Awami League had said, just days after his arrest nearly two years ago.A court subsequently ordered his transfer to Thakurgaon District Jail and later to Dinajpur. There, he was facing three cases, including a murder charge linked to the political turmoil that followed a mass uprising against the government of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Born on April 30, 1940, in Ruhia Union under Thakurgaon Sadar Upazila, Sen was elected multiple times from the Thakurgaon-1 constituency to the Jatiya Sangsad. A presidium member of the Awami League, he secured his most recent parliamentary victory in the 2024 general election, before the party was later barred from political activity by the current interim administration.Meanwhile, the interim government, headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and tasked with overseeing the electoral process for February 12 elections, has faced criticism at home and abroad over its human rights record. Opposition figures contend that deaths of prominent detainees, particularly former Awami League leaders, point to systemic failings and raise concerns about the adequacy of medical care in custody.His death comes at a politically sensitive moment in Bangladesh, with the Awami League excluded from the forthcoming polls and rival parties competing for advantage.","Bangladesh Awami League senior leader Ramesh Chandra Sen died on Saturday while in custody at Dinajpur District Jail.

Bangladesh’s main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on Friday unveiled its election manifesto, promising electoral reforms and accountable governance, while outlining a tougher foreign policy stance, centred on border security and river-water sharing.The manifesto was launched by BNP chairman Tarique Rahman in Dhaka. The party pledged to uphold the “dignity of the vote” and ensure that no one is above the law, committing to a government that is accountable and directly answerable to citizens.A key feature of the manifesto is its emphasis on long-standing flashpoints in Bangladesh’s relationship with India, although New Delhi hasn’t been mentioned in as many words in the bullet points, including cross-border shootings, alleged “push-ins” and unresolved sharing of common rivers. The BNP said it would adopt a more assertive approach to frontier management and river diplomacy if voted to power.Under what it calls a “Bangladesh Before All” doctrine, the party framed its foreign policy around “equality and self-dignity” and the slogan “Friend Yes, Master No”. It said Dhaka would not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and would not allow interference in its own.The strongest language came for border-related concerns.The manifesto vows to take “a strict position” to stop “border killing, push-in, and smuggling”, reflecting persistent Bangladeshi complaints over deaths along the India-Bangladesh border and allegations of people being pushed across without due process.On river-water sharing, the BNP promised “effective measures” to secure Bangladesh’s “fair share” from common rivers “like Teesta and Padma”. It proposed implementing a “Teesta Master Plan”, pursuing a Padma barrage project and strengthening the Joint River Commission (JRC), the bilateral body responsible for managing shared rivers.Although India is not explicitly named in the manifesto’s bullet points, the border and river issues highlighted are central to Dhaka-New Delhi ties.The manifesto also signals interest in reviving regional platforms, promising to make SAARC “effective” and to pursue ASEAN membership, potentially broadening Bangladesh’s diplomatic options beyond its immediate neighbourhood.The manifesto was unveiled just six days ahead of Bangladesh’s national elections scheduled for February 12, the first since the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in 2024. With the Awami League barred from contesting, BNP is widely seen as the front runner in the upcoming elections.

As a 24-hour wave of synchronised violence swept through Balochistan over the weekend, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) released the photos of two women fidayeens — Asifa Mengal (23) and Hawa Baloch (24) — who carried out the attacks on symbols of Pakistan’s authority in the restive province.The two women swapped their regular lives to join the BLA’s Majeed Brigade, their fidayeen squad and blew themselves up at different locations during the offensive Herof 2.0 that saw BLA rebels attacking govt offices, banks and Frontier corps HQ and other military installations across Kalat, Gwadar, Mastung, Noshki, Kharan, Turbat, and Pasni areas. The BLA’s media wing, Hakkal, also released the footage of the attacks and hostages on social media.According to BLA, Asifa, born in 2002 in Noshki, diverged from a conventional life, eventually taking part in a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) attack against the ISI headquarters in her hometown on Jan 31, 2026. The BLA said that it was on her 21st birthday in 2023 that Asifa joined their Majeed Brigade. Her path was mirrored by Hawa Baloch, an aspiring writer from the Kech district. For Hawa, the conflict was personal; she followed the trajectory of her father, Nabi Baksh Baloch, also a BLA member, who was killed in Sistan, Iran in 2021.She had joined the Majeed Brigade after her father’s killing.The wave of attacks saw around a dozen participants ranging from 60-year-old Hatam Naz Sumalani to 70-year-old Nako Fazal Baloch who blew themselves up at different locations during the violence. But by trading classrooms and social media feeds for the frontlines, Mengal and Baloch have signalled a deepening crisis within the province.Both BLA and Pak govt have claimed to have inflicted heavy casualties with the BLA’s claim pegging the Pak personnel deaths to over 100. Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti said that they had eliminated over 145 rebels. The operation has involved suicide bombings, grenade attacks on police stations, and the capturing of highways to block military.

Reactions and political context





A Bangladesh court on Monday sentenced former prime minister Sheikh Hasina to a total of 10 years in prison in two separate corruption cases linked to alleged irregularities in the allocation of residential plots under the Purbachal New Town government project near Dhaka.According to news agency ANI, Dhaka Special Judge Court-4 handed Hasina five years’ imprisonment in each case, taking the total sentence to 10 years.The verdict was delivered by Judge Robiul Alam.In the same cases, Hasina’s niece Tulip Rizwana Siddiq, a British MP and daughter of Sheikh Rehana, was sentenced to two years in each case, totalling four years in prison.Another niece, Azmina Siddiq, and Hasina’s son Radwan Mujib Siddiq, also known as Bobby, were sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment each.The 79-year-old former premier was sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for allegedly using her official influence to allocate residential plots to others, including Tulip Siddiq, under the Rajuk New Town Project in Purbachal on the outskirts of the capital.The court pronounced the judgment at around 12.30 pm (local time).Apart from Hasina and her relatives, several others were also convicted. According to news agency PTI, those sentenced to five years’ imprisonment included a former junior housing minister, a former secretary of the housing ministry, a former Rajuk chairman and officials of the state-run Rajuk authority, which oversees plot allocations.Only one of the accused, a senior Rajuk official, was present in court, while the rest were tried in absentia.“The trial of the accused was not obstructed regardless of where they (accused) were in the world,” the judge said while delivering the verdict, as quoted by PTI.The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) filed the cases on January 13, 2025, initially against 16 individuals, later submitting charge sheets against 18 accused on March 10, 2025.A total of 31 witnesses testified during the trial, with the recording of testimonies concluding on January 5 this year. The court had fixed February 2 for pronouncing judgment in both cases.The corruption watchdog alleged Hasina colluded with government officials to illegally secure plots in the Purbachal New Town Project for herself and her family members, despite them being ineligible under existing rules.Hasina has earlier been convicted in multiple other cases related to the same project and sentenced to a cumulative 26 years in prison in previous verdicts.Hasina’s now-disbanded Awami League described the sentences as “entirely predictable” and alleged the cases were “fabricated” by the interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.Tulip Siddiq rejected the allegations, calling the process “flawed and farcical from the beginning to the end”. “I’m absolutely baffled by the whole thing,” she was quoted by the BBC as saying, adding that she had not received any summons or charge sheet.She said she had engaged lawyers in both the UK and Bangladesh.Sheikh Hasina has been living in exile in India since August 5, 2024, after her government was toppled in a student-led uprising.Following her ouster, an interim government under Muhammad Yunus initiated a series of legal proceedings against Hasina, her family members and former Awami League leaders.Earlier, a special tribunal sentenced Hasina to death on charges of committing crimes against humanity for her alleged role in brutally suppressing the student-led uprising.Separately, on an Anti-Corruption Commission complaint, a court on November 27 had sentenced Hasina to a total of 21 years’ imprisonment.","Sheikh Hasina sentenced to 10 years in prison in two separate corruption cases.

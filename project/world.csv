Tariffs 'accelerate' transition

BANGKOK: Massive planned US duties on solar panels made in Southeast Asia could be a chance for the region to ramp up its own long-stalled energy transition , experts say.Earlier this month, Washington announced plans for hefty duties on solar panels made in Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia.The levies follow an investigation, launched before US President Donald Trump took office, into ""unfair practices"" in the countries, particularly by Chinese-headquartered firms.If approved next month, they will pile upon tariffs already imposed by the Trump administration, including blanket 10-percent levies for most countries, and 145 percent on Chinese-made goods.For the US market, the consequences are likely to be severe. China makes eight out of every 10 solar panels globally, and controls 80 percent of every stage of the manufacturing process.The new tariffs ""will practically make solar exports to US impossible commercially"", said Putra Adhiguna, managing director at the Energy Shift Institute think tank.Southeast Asia accounted for nearly 80 percent of US solar panel imports in 2024.And while investment in solar production has ramped up in the United States in recent years, the market still relies heavily on imported components.For Chinese manufacturers, already dealing with a saturated domestic market, the raft of tariffs is potentially very bad news.Many shifted operations to Southeast Asia hoping to avoid punitive measures imposed by Washington and the European Union as they try to protect and nurture domestic solar industries.The proposed new duties range from around 40 percent for some Malaysian exports to an eye-watering 3,521 percent for some Cambodia-based manufacturers.But there may be a silver lining for the region, explained Ben McCarron, managing director at Asia Research & Engagement.""The tariffs and trade war are likely to accelerate the energy transition in Southeast Asia,"" he said.China will ""supercharge efforts"" in regional markets and push for policy and implementation plans to ""enable fast adoption of green energy across the region"", driven by its exporters.Analysts have long warned that countries in the region are moving too slowly to transition from planet-warming fossil fuels like coal.""At the current pace, it (Southeast Asia) risks missing out on the opportunities provided by the declining costs of wind and solar, now cheaper than fossil fuels,"" said energy think tank Ember in a report last year.For example, Malaysia relied on fossil fuels for over 80 percent of its electricity generation last year.It aims to generate 24 percent from renewables by 2030, a target that has been criticised as out of step with global climate goals.The tariff regime represents a double opportunity for the region, explained Muyi Yang, senior energy analyst at Ember.So far, the local solar industry has been ""largely opportunistic, focused on leveraging domestic resources or labour advantages for export gains"", he told AFP.Cut off from the US market, it could instead focus on local energy transitions, speeding green energy uptake locally and driving a new market that ""could serve as a natural hedge against external volatility"".Still, replacing the US market will not be easy, given its size and the relatively nascent state of renewables in the region.""Success hinges on turning this export-led momentum into a homegrown cleantech revolution,"" said Yang.""Clearance prices"" may be attractive to some, but countries in the region and beyond may also be cautious about a flood of solar, said Adhiguna.Major markets like Indonesia and India already have measures in place intended to favour domestic solar production.""Many will hesitate to import massively, prioritising trade balance and aims to create local green jobs,"" he said.","Washington announced plans for hefty duties on solar panels made in Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia.

Ukraine destroyed a Russian Su-30 fighter jet using a missile fired from a seaborne drone, the Ukrainian Defence Intelligence (DIU) announced on Saturday, and said this was the world's first downing of a combat aircraft by a maritime drone.""On May 2, the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine special operations unit, in coordination with the Security Service of Ukraine and Defence Forces of Ukraine, eliminated a russian Su-30 fighter jet in the Black Sea, marking the first time in history that a naval drone has destroyed a manned combat aircraft,"" it said in a statement and shared a video of the drone strike.The ""historic strike"" was executed by DIU's Group 13, as per the statement.The Russian Su-30, a multi-role fighter jet with an estimated value of $50 million, was ""engulfed in flames mid-air before crashing into the sea.""Ukraine carried out the operation near the port in Novorossiisk, a major Russian port city on the Black Sea.The Russian defence ministry is yet to comment on the Ukrainian claim.Meanwhile, a Russian drone strike on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, wounded 47 people, local officials said. Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov said drones hit 12 locations in the city late Friday. Residential buildings, civilian infrastructure and vehicles were damaged in the assault, according to Kharkiv regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov.Following the drone attack on Kharkiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged ""stronger"" and ""more decisive"" support from the country's allies.""While the world hesitates with decisions, nearly every night in Ukraine turns into a nightmare, costing lives.

Washington: A US appellate court on Saturday ruled against allowing Voice of America staff to return to work, throwing its resumption of operations into question after President Donald Trump shuttered the broadcaster in March.Voice of America (VOA), a US government-run news service for international audiences, has been off the air since Trump ordered the dismantling of the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees VOA and other broadcasters including Radio Free Asia and distributes federal funding for their operations.Two Trump-appointed judges, Neomi Rao and Gregory Katsas, wrote in their ruling the lower court ""likely lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over USAGM's personnel actions.""A third judge, Cornelia Pillard, appointed by former president Barack Obama, dissented.The ruling throws plans for VOA employees to return to work into disarray, with several indicators emerging prior to Saturday's court ruling.""A Justice Department attorney has sent an email to our lawyer, David Seide, informing him that USAGM expects VOA staff to begin a 'phased return' to work and programming to resume next week,"" the service's chief national correspondent Steve Herman posted on social media platform X.Two VOA employees also said Saturday that work email accounts that were frozen have been unblocked, although they had yet to receive any formal notice telling them they can return to work.Kari Lake, the far-right former broadcaster appointed by Trump to oversee USAGM, celebrated the appellate ruling in a post on X.""BIG WIN in our legal cases at USAGM & Voice of America. Huge victory for President Trump and Article II,"" Lake wrote.""Turns out the District Court judge will not be able to manage the agency as he seemed to want to.""The president has questioned why the broadcaster that reaches millions of weekly listeners and viewers worldwide is not promoting his administration's viewpoint, bristling at the editorial ""firewall"" that let the service operate independently.In an April letter to lawmakers, several former directors of VOA, nominated across party lines over the decades, pressed Congress to intervene to restore the broadcaster, after a judge said Trump's shutdown violated the law.May 3 is World Press Freedom Day , which celebrates the role of a free press and highlights the challenges for journalism around the globe.","A US appellate court on Saturday ruled against allowing Voice of America staff to return to work.

TOKYO: Tokyo has lodged a protest against Beijing after a Chinese helicopter ""violated"" Japan 's airspace and four vessles entered its territorial waters around disputed islands.The islands in the East China Sea -- known as the Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan -- are claimed by Beijing but administered by Tokyo and are a frequent hotspot in bilateral tensions.The Japanese foreign ministry said in a statement released late Saturday that its vice minister lodged ""a strong protest"" with the Chinese ambassador to Japan ""over the intrusion of four China Coast Guard vessels into Japan's territorial waters around the Senkaku Islands"" on the same day.The vice minister also protested ""the violation of Japan's territorial airspace by a helicopter launched from one of the China Coast Guard vessels, strongly urging (China) to ensure that similar acts do not recur"".Japan's defence ministry said the helicopter flew within Japanese airspace for about 15 minutes on Saturday near the Senkaku islands.""The Self-Defence Forces responded by scrambling fighter jets,"" the ministry said.Public broadcaster NHK and other local media reported that this is the first time a Chinese government helicopter violated the Japanese airspace off the disputed islands.On the same day, China's coast guard announced it had used a helicopter to ""expel"" a Japanese airplane from airspace around the disputed islands.Liu Dejun, spokesman for China's coast guard, said a Japanese civilian aircraft ""illegally entered"" the airspace of the islands at 11:19 am (GMT 0219) and left five minutes later.Beijing frequently announces it has driven Japanese vessels and aircraft away from the islands, but Japanese officials have told AFP that Chinese authorities sometimes announce expulsions when none have occurred.Unnamed Japanese officials told local media that Beijing was possibly reacting to a small Japanese civilian aircraft flying near the islands.Chinese and Japanese patrol vessels in the East China Sea have routinely staged dangerous face-offs around disputed islands.Tensions between China and other claimants to parts of the East and South China Seas has driven Japan to deepen ties with the Philippines and United States.","Japan protests China's airspace 'violation' near disputed islands.

Harris won't be able to be back home, predicts Brazilian psychic Athos Salome



Team Harry vs Team King Charles



Prince Harry gave an explosive interview to the BBC, in which he said he wanted to bury the hatchet with the royal family and that he did not nurse any emotional wound. He revealed that he does not talk to his father, confirming what has long been in speculation -- that he had wanted to get back. But the interview did much damage to his prospects of returning home as it came out of the blue after he lost the legal case of security in the UK.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle resigned from their royal duties in 2020 and left the UK to start a new life in California. Their main grievance was the prying family that choked them like they did to his mother, Princess Diana. His security cover in the UK was withdrawn as a result, but Harry contested that and now he has lost the case. This means if Harry, Meghan and their children come to the UK, they are not under Royal security.The loss converted into a sudden interview that stunned the world as it was clear that the sit-down was being planned in the shadows and Prince Harry was ready to take the Royal Family down once again in public.Psychic Athos Salome , referred to as the ' Living Nostradamus ', told The SUN that Harry will leave California as he feels trapped there though he would not be back in Buckingham, his new home will be a third country.A silent rapprochement with King Charles in possible but it will be only between the fathers and the son. Prince William will remain distant and resentful.After Prince Harry's interview, social media users got divided between team Harry and team Charles -- sparring at the new Royal feud. King Charles was slammed as a pathetic father, after being a pathetic husband to Princess Diana, as Harry revealed that his father does not speak to him. Team King, on the other hand, pilloried Harry for his attack on his family.","Prince Harry gave an explosive interview to the BBC, in which he said he wanted to bury the hatchet with the royal family.

"Warren Buffett plans to retire by year’s end, recommends Greg Abel as his successor to lead Berkshire Hathaway",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/warren-buffett-plans-to-retire-by-years-end-recommends-greg-abel-as-his-successor-to-lead-berkshire-hathaway/articleshow/120857738.cms,"Warren Buffett on Saturday announced his plans to retire by the end of the year recommending Greg Abel as his successor to lead Berkshire Hathaway.""I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the Chief Executive office of the company at year end,” Buffett said.He announced his retirement at the close of a five-hour Q&A session during the annual shareholder meeting , declining to take questions on the decision. He revealed that only his children, Howard and Susie Buffett, were aware beforehand, while Greg Abel- seated beside him on stage- had no prior notice.While many investors believe Abel is well-suited to lead Berkshire Hathaway, questions remain about his investment acumen. Buffett reinforced his confidence in Abel by pledging to keep his fortune invested in the company.Further adding in his statement revealing that he'll retain his shareholding and lending support to Abel, the billionaire investor added, ""I have no intention - zero - of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. I will give it away eventually.""“The decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg’s management than mine,"" he further said, justifying his decision.Investors, numbering in thousands at the Omaha venue, rose to their feet in extended applause to honour Buffett's six-decade leadership of the company.CFRA analyst Cathy Seifert observed that Buffett's decision to step aside would not have been straightforward. ""This was probably a very tough decision for him, but better to leave on your own terms,"" Seifert said. ""I think there will be an effort at maintaining a 'business as usual' environment at Berkshire. That is still to be determined.""Investors such as Steven Check, who manages Check Capital Management, said that they remain confident about succession plans due to Abel's proven track record and Berkshire's self-sustaining business model. Buffett has indicated that Abel's management style could be more involved than his own, potentially enhancing the performance of Berkshire's portfolio companies. ""I think we'll get a more hands-on manager and that could be that a good thing,"" Check said.Addressing the crowd at the shareholders meeting before announcing the retirement plans, Buffett had also cautioned about the severe global repercussions of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, telling thousands of investors present that “trade should not be a weapon,” while acknowledging that “there’s no question trade can be an act of war.”“It’s a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don’t like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done,” Buffett said. “We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best,” he added.Also read: Warren Buffett warns against using 'trade as a weapon', slams tariff tactics at Berkshire AGM This comes as Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway reported significantly lower profits Saturday morning, posting just over one-third of last year’s earnings—moments before thousands of shareholders poured into an Omaha arena to hear from the legendary investor himself. The decline in profits was primarily attributed to a significant decrease in Berkshire's investment valuations and insurance losses of $860 million, stemming from policies issued by Geico and other insurance subsidiaries before the severe Southern California wildfires.Berkshire's first-quarter net earnings decreased to $4.6 billion ($3,200 per Class A share) from $12.7 billion ($8,825 per Class A share) in the corresponding period of the previous year.Buffett consistently advises investors to concentrate on operating earnings, which exclude the fluctuations in investment values. Although Berkshire must report these investment changes regardless of stock sales, these variations can obscure the actual performance of its operations.The operating earnings experienced a 14% reduction, reaching $9.6 billion ($6,703.41 per Class A share), compared to $11.2 billion ($7,796.47 per share) in the previous year. This performance fell short of FactSet Research's projection of $7,076.90 per Class A share.Notwithstanding the earnings reduction, the Q&A session with Buffett continues to be the highlight of Berkshire's annual shareholder weekend. Investors are particularly interested in understanding the reasons behind the company's unprecedented cash holdings of $347.7 billion, an increase from $334.2 billion at the conclusion of 2024.Read more: Buffett's Berkshire sees profit fall amid wildfire losses, draws thousands to Omaha meeting","Buffett announced his retirement at the close of a five-hour Q&A session during the annual shareholder meeting.

MEXICO CITY: Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Saturday that US President Donald Trump proposed sending American troops into Mexico to help her administration fight drug trafficking but that she rejected it.Her remarks to supporters in eastern Mexico came in response to a Wall Street Journal article published the day before, describing a tense phone call last month in which Trump reportedly pressured her to accept a bigger role for the US military in combating drug cartels in Mexico.""He said, 'How can we help you fight drug trafficking? I propose that the United States military come in and help you.' And you know what I said to him? 'No, President Trump.'""She added: ""Sovereignty is not for sale.

""The President has been crystal clear that Mexico must do more do combat these gangs and cartels and the United States stands ready to assist and expand the already close cooperation between our two countries.""The US military presence has increased steadily along its southern border with Mexico in recent months, following Trump's order in January to increase the army's role in stemming the flow of migrants.The US Northern Command has surged troops and equipment to the border, increased manned surveillance flights to monitor fentanyl trafficking along the border and sought expanded authority for US Special Forces to work closely with Mexican forces conducting operations against cartels.Trump designated many of the gangs and cartels smuggling drugs into the US as foreign terrorist organizations on Feb 19, restricting their movements and lending law enforcement more resources to act against them.But Sheinbaum's hardline stance Saturday signaled that US pressure for unilateral military intervention would put her and Trump on a collision course after months of cooperation on immigration and trade.""We can work together, but you in your territory and us in ours,"" Sheinbaum said.","Claudia Sheinbaum: ""Sovereignty is not for sale.

I’m not a martyr.”Craig Robinson, her brother and co-host of the In Michelle Obama (IMO) podcast, chimed in with humor: “I’d be doing a podcast with Barack Obama.”The rumors aren’t new. Whispers of a marital rift first surged after Michelle skipped Donald Trump’s second inauguration—fueling theories that her absence signaled deeper trouble at home.But on the April 23 episode of IMO, she set the record straight.“People couldn’t believe that I was saying no for any other reason. They had to assume that my marriage was falling apart,” Michelle explained. “I’m here really trying to own my life… It took everything in my power to not do the thing that was ‘right’ but to do the thing that was right for me.”She later told Bartlett that skipping the event was part of shedding the pressure of always being the model figure.“I think I just told myself, ‘I think I’ve done enough of that,’ and if I haven’t, then I never will. It’ll never be enough. So let me start now.”Despite the buzz, Michelle described her relationship with Barack as grounded in complementary differences.“When I met Barack Obama, he showed up in my life as the opposite of a box checker… He did nothing by the book. He was brilliant and interesting.”The Obamas, married since 1992, are parents to Malia, 26, and Sasha, 23. Since leaving the White House, Michelle has embraced a candid tone—both in her bestselling books and her podcast—taking control of her narrative, one rumor at a time.","Former First Lady of the US, Michelle Obama, has finally spoken out about persistent rumors surrounding her marriage.

One strike and you’re out: Trump’s harsh ‘catch and revoke’ rule could cost foreign students their visa over minor offenses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/one-strike-and-youre-out-trumps-harsh-catch-and-revoke-rule-could-cost-foreign-students-their-visa-over-minor-offenses/articleshow/120862322.cms,"In a dramatic escalation of its immigration enforcement agenda, the Trump administration has rolled out a new policy enabling the US government to revoke the visas of foreign nationals—students, workers, and visitors alike—for even minor legal infractions.The “Catch and Revoke” directive, unveiled by Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the April 30 edition of the State Department newsletter, introduces a strict one-strike rule. “Whenever the government catches non-US citizens breaking our laws, we will take action to revoke their status,” Rubio stated, calling a visa “a privilege, not a right.”While the policy outlines priority revocations for crimes like domestic violence and assault, its broad and ambiguous language has drawn backlash. “They stripped student visas from people for speeding tickets,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council. “Now they're suggesting they'll do the same to everyone.”The policy also singles out foreign students allegedly supporting Hamas or joining pro-Palestinian campus protests. Rubio blamed the Biden administration for failing to protect Jewish students during recent unrest on campuses. “They allowed campus buildings to be overrun by violent thugs,” he wrote.Citing the Immigration and Nationality Act, Rubio said student visa holders found to support or endorse terrorist groups would be deemed inadmissible. The policy builds on intelligence-sharing with law enforcement to identify and cancel such visas immediately.Rubio also tied the new rule to broader reforms under Trump’s second term. In his 100-day statement, he claimed the State Department had transformed into “a leaner machine” by dismantling offices like the Global Engagement Center, cutting funding to NGOs, and streamlining operations to eliminate bureaucracy.Additional executive actions include requiring US universities to disclose all foreign funding sources or risk losing federal support, measures aimed squarely at international students and institutions seen as sympathetic to America’s adversaries.Rubio defended the changes as a necessity for national security. “The time of contemptuously taking advantage of our nation’s generosity ends,” he wrote.The new policy coincides with Trump’s broader America First strategy abroad, including diplomatic efforts to expel China from managing the Panama Canal, pressuring NATO allies to increase defense spending, and reclassifying the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization.Legal resistance is already underway. Several visa revocations have been reversed in court, and more challenges are expected. Civil liberties groups argue the policy could violate due process and chill free speech.Secretary Rubio was sworn in on January 21, 2025. “With an impending reorganization that will unleash the Department’s talent from the ground-up,” he concluded, “the State Department is set to continue to play a pivotal role in ensuring the safety, security and prosperity of the American people.”",The new policy was unveiled by Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the April 30 edition of the State Department newsletter.

Trump's space budget is a largesse for SpaceX,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-space-budget-is-a-largesse-for-spacex/articleshow/120861589.cms,"WASHINGTON: Elon Musk and SpaceX are big winners in President Donald Trump's 2026 spending plan.Trump is delivering on Musk's wishlist at both Nasa and the Pentagon to reorient federal spending on space in a way likely to drive billions of dollars in new business to Musk's space technology company, if Congress signs off on the budget plan. At the Pentagon, Trump is calling for a massive jump in spending - a 13% increase to $1.01 trillion -- almost entirely via allocations in a congressional budget reconciliation plan.The jump would happen while many other federal agencies would be slashed, in part to supercharge federal spending in two areas where SpaceX is positioned to profit - a vast missile defence system and space missions to Mars and the moon.Trump has proposed a Golden Dome defense system to track and kill missiles headed toward US targets, possibly sent by China, Russia, North Korea or other rivals. Pentagon officials say SpaceX is considered likely to be the top recipient of this burst of new spending, because SpaceX manufactures both rockets that can launch military payloads into orbit and satellite systems that can deliver the surveillance and targeting tools needed for the project.Trump's budget plan also calls for an undisclosed but large amount of new money for "" US space dominance to strengthen national security.""Nasa's budget faces overall cuts in Trump's plan -- down 24% from $24.8 billion in the current budget year-- but there are increases that largely match SpaceX's own corporation priorities. The spending plan goes after Musk's commercial rivals, calling for Nasa to phase out funding for the Space Launch System, a rocket program being led by Boeing, and also the Orion astronaut capsule, being built by Lockheed Martin, part of three planned flights to take humans back to the moon.Instead, Trump's budget calls for ""more cost effective commercial systems that would support more ambitious subsequent lunar missions,"" an industry that SpaceX now dominates. Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, which has developed its own new rocket, also could be a big beneficiary of this shift, industry executives said Friday.","Trump is delivering on Musk's wishlist at both Nasa and the Pentagon to reorient federal spending on space.

US approves HawkEye 360 sale to boost India’s surveillance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-approves-hawkeye-360-sale-to-boost-indias-surveillance/articleshow/120859126.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a move to boost New Delhi’s surveillance power amid heightened military tension, the US state department has approved the sale of HawkEye 360 technology to India, which will help the country gain maritime domain awareness in the Indo-Pacific, aided by a growing constellation of satellites in Low Earth Orbit.The proposed sale, the state department statement said, “will improve India's capabilities to meet current and future threats by bolstering its maritime domain awareness, analytical abilities and strategic posture”.A US Defence Security Cooperation Agency statement said New Delhi requested purchase of the SeaVision software, including its preferred software enhancements, training as a technical assistance field team, remote software, analytic support, documents, and other logistics and programme support elements. The estimated total cost is $131 million. “The principal contractor will be Hawkeye360, located in Herndon, Virginia,” the statement said.HawkEye 360, an American geospatial analytics private company, collects and analyses radio frequency (RF) signal location with a constellation of satellites in Low Earth Orbit. These satellites detect and geolocate radio frequency (RF) emissions. They track communication signals from ships, aircraft, vehicles, and coastal systems. Some vessels, which ‘go dark’ to roam undetected in disputed areas and evade tracking after turning off their Automatic Identification System (AIS), can also be detected with this advanced technology.Indian forces can now identify illegal fishing, smuggling and perform effective surveillance in the Indian Ocean Region with the help of this technology.With this technology, India gains deeper visibility across its Exclusive Economic Zone. Currently, the Indian Navy uses P8i reconnaissance aircraft and Sea Guardian drones to monitor strategic locations and detect vessels keeping their AIS switched off.The Hawkeye 360 system uses Electro-Optical (EO), Infrared (IR), and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) as additional layers. Each layer improves detection, verification and classification of threats. EO satellites capture high-resolution daytime imagery; infrared sensors identify thermal emissions from engines and exhausts; and SAR satellites capture radar-based images regardless of weather and time. This layer confirms ship size, speed, and location. The system combines speed, precision, and adaptability and works continuously across all weather and time conditions.“The proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the US by helping to strengthen the US-Indian strategic relationship and to improve the security of a major defence partner, which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia regions,” the US statement said.","The HawkEye 360 system uses Electro-Optical (EO), Infrared (IR), and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) as additional layers.

FBI's Indian-origin director Kash Patel has come under fire for allegedly making personal trips on government aircraft and some Senate Democrats have asked the US Government Accountability Office to review this data. The CBS reported that if the review takes place, then Parel's flight records will be looked into to determine the purpose of his travel, the money spent and whether Patel reimbursed the government for personal trips.In April, the FBI director made many appearances which could be matched with the trip details to find out whether he took his FBI jet and whether he reimbursed in case those were personal visits. On April 5, Kash Patel participated in a charity hockey game hosted by the FBI. The next day, his jet was back to JFK Airport and Patel was seen at a hockey match where Washington Capitals star Alex Ovechkin broke the NHL scoring record.The reports claimed Patel made use of the FBI's Gulfstream 5 jets to travel to Las Vegas, where he has a home, and to Nashville, where Patel's girlfriend, a country singer Alexis Wilkins, lives. Several trips of Patel were captured by public flight trackers, ncluding a weekend jaunt to Las Vegas on March 7 and a weekend in Nashville on March 24.It is at the director's discretion how often to use government aircraft for personal travel and for what specific purposes, the CBS report said.

Pakistan on Friday announced that it would continue to keep the Wagah border crossing open for its citizens stranded in India, following New Delhi's decision to revoke visas in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack.The Attari-Wagah border which connects Amritsar in India with Lahore in Pakistan, was shut on Thursday after remaining open until April 30.Reports said that around 70 Pakistani nationals were left stranded at the border on Thursday, after the deadline for their departure from India had passed a day earlier.Responding to media questions, a spokesperson for Pakistan’s ministry of foreign affairs confirmed the presence of stranded Pakistani nationals at the Attari border, including children.“We are aware of the media reports indicating that some Pakistani nationals are stranded at Attari. We are open to receiving our citizens in case the Indian authorities allow them to cross the border from their side,” the Pakistan MoFA spokesperson said.The spokesperson further said that the Wagah crossing would continue to remain open in the future for Pakistani nationals wishing to return.The foreign office of neighbouring Pakistan also criticised India’s decision to revoke visas, stating, “The Indian decision to revoke visas of Pakistani citizens is creating serious humanitarian challenges,” and pointed to disruptions in medical treatments and family separations.The Centre issued ‘Leave India’ notices after the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, which killed 26 people—mostly tourists—and was linked to Pakistan-based terrorists.The exit deadlines varied by visa type: April 26 for Saarc visa holders, April 27 for 12 other categories including business, tourism, and student visas, and April 29 for medical visa holders.

The Wagah border, the only fully-fledged international crossing between the two nations, was closed to all cross-border transit, leaving Afghan trucks stranded.The stranded trucks, laden with goods such as dry fruits, liquorice, and other Afghan exports, are critical to Afghanistan’s economy, particularly during its peak harvest season. Afghan traders and truck drivers, many of whom faced days of uncertainty, have welcomed the move. “We were stuck with nowhere to go,” said Ghani Gul, an Afghan driver stranded in Pakistan. “This permission means we can deliver our goods and support our families.”While the immediate focus is on 150 trucks, the FO’s willingness to review additional cases suggests that further transit facilitation could be possible if Afghanistan provides the necessary details.

Even in a country where the military has always loomed over governance, this is the first time that the ISI head will also officiate as NSA.The appointment, effective immediately, comes less than 10 days after the April 22 terrorist attack on tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam that put Pakistan in India’s crosshairs and triggered a diplomatic firestorm.Lt Gen Malik, who took over as ISI chief in Sept 2024, will advise PM Shehbaz Sharif on national security and foreign policy while steering Pakistan’s intelligence apparatus. The dual role, announced via a cabinet division notification, is widely seen as a power grab by the military, sidelining the civilian leadership at a time of reckoning.Pakistan’s denial of involvement in the Pahalgam attack – 26 people were killed – and calls for a “neutral” probe have done little to placate India.While Malik’s elevation amplifies ISI’s influence in shaping Pakistan’s response, both militarily and politically, critics argue this move exposes the fragility of Pakistan’s civilian governance.“Appointing the ISI chief as NSA hands the military a blank check to dictate terms, not just on security but in backchannel talks with India,” said a former diplomat.Malik’s track record as adjutant general, where he oversaw the crackdown on ex-PM Imran Khan’s supporters during the 2023 riots, suggests a hardline approach. His closeness to Army chief Gen Asim Munir, who handpicked him for the ISI role, has fuelled concerns of a military-driven agenda.Posts on X reflect public unease, with some calling it a step toward a “soft coup”, while others see it as a pragmatic response to India’s stand.The consolidation of power in Malik’s hands risks alienating civilian stakeholders and complicating diplomacy, especially after PM Narendra Modi vowed “complete operational freedom” for India’s armed forces.With the NSA post vacant since April 2022, Malik’s appointment fills a strategic void but raises questions about whether Pakistan’s military is preparing for war, negotiation, or both.","Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik appointed as the country’s national security adviser.

Thai prosecutors dropped royal defamation charges on Thursday against an American scholar accused of insulting the monarchy over an article published on a political website.Paul Chambers a longtime Southeast Asia politics scholar in Thailand, was arrested last month in Phitsanulok province, north of Bangkok, under the kingdom's strict lese-majeste laws .The case marked a rare instance of a foreign national being charged under Thailand's lese-majeste law, which bans criticism of King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his close family and carries sentences of up to 15 years in jail per offence.The Office of the Attorney-General said on Thursday it had decided ""not to indict"" Chambers.""The director-general had decided not to indict the suspect,"" the statement said, adding that prosecutors would seek to dismiss the case in court and coordinate with police.The Thai army, a staunch defender of the monarchy, filed the complaint over a short blurb posted on a political think tank website this year.A military spokesperson last week defended the decision to file the case following criticism that the army had no legal standing to do so under the Thai law.Trade talks between Thailand and the United States have been indefinitely postponed, fuelling speculation that the arrest may have strained diplomatic ties between the two countries.International watchdogs have expressed concern over the use of the lese-majeste laws, known as Article 112 against academics, activists and even students.One man in northern Thailand was jailed for at least 50 years for lese-majeste last year, while a woman was given a 43-year prison sentence in 2021.In 2023, a man was jailed for two years for selling satirical calendars featuring rubber ducks that a court said defamed the king.","Paul Chambers a longtime Southeast Asia politics scholar in Thailand.

Who is Chinmoy Krishna Das?

A Bangladesh court on Wednesday granted bail to former Iskcon leader Chinmoy Krishna Das in a sedition case , reported Bangladesh's The Daily Star.Das was arrested following a controversy that erupted when a sedition case was filed against him and 18 others in Chittagong on October 30 last year.The charges were linked to the hoisting of a saffron flag above Bangladesh's official flag during the October 25 rally at Laldighi Maidan in Chattogram.Das was presented before a Chittagong court on Tuesday, where his bail plea was denied, and he was sent into custody. The arrest has triggered widespread outrage, with many demanding his immediate release.Das serves as the spokesperson for the Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote , a group that champions the rights and security of minorities. He has been a vocal advocate for the Hindu (Sanatani) community in Bangladesh, calling for key reforms such as a minority protection law, a tribunal for fast-tracking cases of minority persecution, and the establishment of a dedicated ministry of minority affairs.He gained widespread attention for organising large public rallies, including one in Chittagong on October 25 and another in Rangpur on November 22, which sparked significant socio-political discussions across the country.Das hails from Satkania Upazila in Chittagong. From 2016 to 2022, he was the Chittagong divisional secretary of Iskcon. He gained popularity at an early age for his religious speeches and earned the nickname of ‘Shishu Bokta’, or ‘child orator’, reports Bangladeshi media.",Chinmoy Krishna Das is a former Iskcon leader.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remain unused.

The latest bombshell interview of the BBC with Prince Harry has mortified the Royal Family as palace insiders said Queen Elizabeth, had she been alive to see Prince Harry's latest outburst, would have been ""horrified"" by it all. The sit-down was after Harry lost an appeal over the levels of security he and his family are entitled to while in the UK.

He has been fighting the case legally as he wants security cover in the UK, but finally he lost it.And there came his explosive interview, nothing less than his autobiography 'memoir', as he said he does not know how much longer his father, King Charles, would live. Though his indication was more conciliatory, that he hinted at his father's imminent death in connection with his and Meghan Markle's security in the UK was beyond to process for the royal insiders.Harry said the king won't speak to him because of this security issue and he did not want to fight because he did not know how long his father, fighting with cancer, will live.""I can't see a world in which I would bring my wife and children back to the UK at this point. There have been so many disagreements between myself and some of my family,"" he said, adding that he has forgiven them.""I would love reconciliation with my family.

A United Nations judge has been sentenced to six years and four months in prison for forcing a woman to work as a domestic slave in the UK.Lydia Mugambe, 50, who was pursuing a PhD in law at the University of Oxford, was found to have kept a young Ugandan woman as an unpaid domestic worker and nanny at her residence.Mugambe was convicted in March of several charges, including conspiring to breach UK immigration law, facilitating travel for exploitation, forcing labor, and intimidating a witness.Mugambe, who serves as a high court judge in Uganda, prevented the woman from securing regular employment and required her to serve as a domestic worker and provide childcare services, according to prosecutors.During sentencing, Judge David Foxton noted the defendant's complete lack of remorse and her attempts to shift responsibility onto the victim.Mugambe obtained a fraudulent visa for the woman, which specified employment as a private servant at the diplomatic residence of John Mugerwa, Uganda's former deputy high commissioner in London.Prosecutors indicated that Mugerwa supported the victim's visa application, knowing she would work in servitude for Mugambe. In exchange, Mugambe offered assistance with his legal proceedings in Uganda.The court learned that Mugambe arranged the victim's travel and airport collection, after which the young woman became enslaved at the judge's Kidlington, Oxfordshire residence.In court, prosecutor Caroline Haughey KC read the victim's statement, describing her ""almost constant fear"" due to Mugambe's influential position in Uganda.The unnamed victim expressed inability to return to Uganda, fearing consequences and possible permanent separation from her mother.Haughey stated that Mugambe took advantage of her victim's unfamiliarity with employment rights and misrepresented the purpose of her UK visit.The court highlighted a ""clear and significant imbalance of power"" in the relationship between Mugambe and her victim.The Crown Prosecution Service authorised charges against Mugambe's associate, Mr. Mugerwa, for conspiracy, but he had diplomatic immunity, which the Ugandan government did not waive.Mugambe, however, denied the accusations, insisting she ""always"" treated the young Ugandan woman with ""love, care and patience.""","Lydia Mugambe, 50, was pursuing a PhD in law at the University of Oxford.

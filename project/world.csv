Israel-Hamas peace plan: Pakistan sending troops to Gaza? Spotlight on 'peacekeeping force',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/israel-hamas-peace-plan-pakistan-sending-troops-to-gaza-spotlight-on-peacekeeping-force/articleshow/124245873.cms,"Trump's 20-point peace plan







Pakistan’s top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations’ peacekeeping force under a comprehensive peace deal announced by US President Donald Trump.The decision was announced by Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday.At a press conference in Islamabad, Dar was asked directly about Pakistan’s role in the initiative, which aims to end the bloodshed in Gaza. “The force [here] is a peacekeeping force. On the ground, there will be Palestinian law-enforcement agencies... there will be [separate] forces supporting them. Indonesia has offered 20,000 troops for that. I am sure Pakistan's leadership will also be making a decision on this,” he said.Dar explained that the idea was to set up an independent Palestinian government of technocrats overseen by an international body. He said Pakistan had asked for the arrangements to be documented at the UN Security Council.He shared that a preparatory meeting of leaders from eight Muslim countries with US President Trump was held in New York last week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. “The objectives were to try for a ceasefire in Gaza, make arrangements for sending humanitarian aid, stop the forced displacement of Palestinians and make arrangements for the return of the displaced Gazans,” he said.Dar added that the plan also included Gaza’s reconstruction and halting Israel’s efforts to annex the West Bank. According to him, Trump proposed that his team work with the foreign ministers of the Muslim nations to create a “workable solution.”The foreign minister said Saudi Arabia had reached out to Pakistan with a draft joint statement on the plan, which was later revised after his input. He noted that the Palestinian Authority welcomed the statement.On Monday, Donald Trump unveiled a 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the Gaza war by demanding Hamas’s disarmament, the immediate release of all hostages within 72 hours, and a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces. Under the proposal, Hamas would be excluded from any future governance; militants willing to abandon arms would receive amnesty, while those wishing to leave Gaza would be allowed safe passage. The plan also involves a temporary technocratic Palestinian committee ruling Gaza under oversight by an international “Board of Peace” led by Trump and including Tony Blair, until the Palestinian Authority is reformed.The initiative calls for humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza without interference from either Israel or Hamas, managed by UN agencies and the Red Crescent, with reconstruction under a “New Gaza” framework. Trump gave Hamas three to four days to accept the plan or face what he called “a very sad end.”",Pakistan's top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations' peacekeeping force.

Direct hit! Houthi Missiles Hit Dutch Cargo Ship In Gulf Of Aden, Two Injured, Crew Rescued





Yemen’s Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for a missile strike on the Dutch-flagged cargo ship Minervagracht in the Gulf of Aden, marking one of their most serious assaults on shipping outside the Red Sea since November 2023.The attack occurred on Monday and involved a cruise missile, according to Houthi military spokesperson Brig Gen Yahya Saree, who said the strike targeted the vessel over alleged violations of “the entry ban to the ports of occupied Palestine” by the ship’s owners, Amsterdam-based Spliethoff, reported news agency AP.The rebels stated the operation was “in response to the crimes of genocide and starvation perpetrated by the Zionist enemy against our people in the Gaza Strip, and to affirm the continued ban on Israeli maritime traffic in the Red and Arabian Seas”, according to the Times of Israel.The strike injured two crew members and forced the evacuation of all 19 sailors, hailing from the Philippines, Russia, Sri Lanka, and Ukraine, after the ship caught fire and was left adrift, according to the European naval force operating in the region, Operation Aspides.The US Navy-overseen Joint Maritime Information Centre initially reported that the Minervagracht had no ties to Israel, though a follow-up note said the centre was “reviewing vessel affiliations for possible links to Israel”.The attack highlights the Houthis’ widening campaign against shipping, which has already targeted over 100 vessels and Israel in response to the ongoing war in Gaza.While some of their strikes have hit targets with tenuous or no direct links to Israel, the campaign has disrupted maritime traffic in the Red Sea—a corridor for roughly $1 trillion in goods annually prior to the war—and has killed at least eight mariners and sunk four ships over the past two years.Monday’s assault indicates the group’s expanding operational reach in the Gulf of Aden, far from their usual Red Sea strikes, and comes amid heightened tensions in the Middle East following renewed Israeli ground operations in Gaza and UN sanctions on Iran.","Yemen’s Houthi rebels claim responsibility for a missile strike on the Dutch- flagged cargo ship Minervagracht in the Gulf of Aden.

US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that even after ending seven global conflicts, if he still hadn't received the Nobel Prize, it would be an insult to the country.Addressing the dozens of top generals and admirals in Quantico, Va, Trump said that despite solving global conflicts, the Nobel Prize will be given to some guy that didn’t do a damn thing but not him.“Nobody’s ever done that. Will you get the Nobel Prize? Absolutely not.” “They’ll give it to some guy that didn’t do a damn thing. They’ll give it to the guy who wrote a book about the mind of Donald Trump and what it took to solve the wars,” he continued.“The Nobel Prize will go to a writer.” The president added, “No, but let’s see what happens, but it will be a big insult to our country. I will tell you that. I don’t want it. I want the country to get it. And it should get it because there’s never been anything like it.”The president expressed optimism that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza would conclude with his 20-point peace plan, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated support for on Monday. Success would mark the resolution of eight conflicts. “If this works out, we’ll have eight, eight in eight months. That’s pretty good,” Trump said.The president has been raking up global support in his push for a Nobel Peace Prize, but ending the war in Gaza and the war in Ukraine are major diplomatic tests for him. He has garnered nominations so far from Pakistan, Cambodia, Israel and GOP lawmakers as he touts his role in talks to end various global conflicts.The White House has publicly argued it is “well past time” Trump gets the prize as they push for it ahead of the decision in December by the Norwegian Nobel Committee.","US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that even after ending seven global conflicts, if he still hadn't received the Nobel Prize, it would be an insult to the country.

Global oil market influence



Understanding how UAE fuel prices are set

Tips to save on fuel in 2025





The UAE Fuel Price Committee has announced the fuel prices for October 2025, reflecting a slight increase across all fuel types compared to September. These adjustments align with global oil market trends and are part of the UAE's monthly review process to keep domestic fuel prices in line with international rates.These price changes are determined based on the average global price of oil and are applicable across all Emirates, including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and others. The UAE's approach to fuel pricing ensures that residents and businesses experience consistent and transparent fuel costs. For people commuting daily to work, school, or errands, the small price hike may feel noticeable at the pump. Middle-class and lower-income residents can manage costs by:The recent increase in UAE fuel prices for October 2025 is closely linked to trends in the global oil market, which plays a major role in determining local fuel costs. Factors such as international supply and demand, geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions, and fluctuations in crude oil prices all have a direct impact on the rates residents pay at the pump. For example, disruptions in major oil-exporting countries or unexpected changes in production can quickly drive up global prices, which then filter down to domestic markets. Additionally, seasonal demand spikes, such as increased travel during holidays, can also influence pricing.By understanding these global dynamics, everyday commuters and middle-class families can better anticipate changes and plan their monthly fuel budgets more effectively, rather than being caught off guard by sudden hikes.Fuel pricing in the UAE follows a deregulated model introduced in August 2015, which links local petrol and diesel rates to international oil prices. This policy ensures transparency and aligns retail prices with global market conditions. Each month, the UAE Fuel Price Committee reviews global trends and announces new rates, typically during the final days of the month. These rates take effect from the 1st day of the following month.This approach means UAE motorists feel the impact of both upswings and drops in the international energy market, encouraging more efficient fuel usage while maintaining pricing fairness.Looking to keep more dirhams in your pocket while filling up? Think of it as fuel-saving hacks for everyday heroes. First, carpooling like a boss sharing rides with friends or colleagues not only saves cash but also gives you some gossip time on the road. Next, combine your errands; that extra trip to the supermarket? Toss it in with the school run. Drive like a Zen master gentle acceleration, smooth braking, and no sudden sprints can stretch every litre farther. Don’t forget your car needs TLC too; proper tire pressure and timely servicing mean your engine sips fuel, not gulps it. And if you really want to be clever, fill up during off-peak hours, so you avoid long queues and unnecessary idling. A little planning and some smart moves can turn fuel anxiety into a monthly money-saving win.While the October 2025 fuel price adjustments represent a modest increase, they underscore the UAE's commitment to aligning domestic fuel prices with global market conditions. Staying informed about these changes allows consumers and businesses to plan and adapt accordingly.","The UAE Fuel Price Committee has announced the fuel prices for October 2025, reflecting a slight increase across all fuel types compared to September.

Michigan shooting: Officials search for motive in deadly church attack; incident classified as 'targeted violence',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/michigan-shooting-officials-search-for-motive-in-deadly-church-attack-incident-classified-as-targeted-violence/articleshow/124223391.cms,"Michigan church shooting (Picture credit: AP)

FBI Probes Dark Motive Behind Michigan Church Massacre, Leavitt Hints at Anti-Mormon Hate





Investigators in Michigan are intensively examining the life and actions of a man who killed four people and injured eight others in a church attack over the weekend, as officials work to determine his motive behind the attack and know what drove him to commit the violence.Authorities continue to classify the incident as an ""act of targeted violence,"" with the motive remaining unclear, according to Reuben Coleman, acting special agent in charge of the FBI’s Detroit field office, according to the New York Times.The suspect, identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford of Burton, Michigan, was killed in a gunfight with police shortly after the rampage. Sanford, a Marine Corps veteran who served from 2004 to 2008 and achieved the rank of sergeant, had attended high school locally.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was quoted as saying by Fox News that the FBI is exploring whether Sanford harboured religious animosity.“All they know right now is this was an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith, and they are trying to understand more about this, how premeditated it was, how much planning went into it, whether he left a note”, she said.Authorities are also examining Sanford’s property, mobile phone records and speaking with his family, who have cooperated with investigators.The attack occurred Sunday morning at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints meetinghouse in Grand Blanc Township, a community of about 8,000 near Flint.Sanford drove a pickup truck into the building, brandishing two American flags, opened fire on worshippers, and set the church ablaze. Two victims were killed by gunfire, and two more were found later in the charred remains of the building.Eight others, ranging in age from 6 to 78, were hospitalised for gunshot wounds or smoke inhalation, as per Reuters.Grand Blanc Police Chief William Renye confirmed that all worshippers had been accounted for and said authorities are still investigating how the fire began, noting Sanford had likely used an accelerant such as petrol, reported BBC.Officials have interviewed more than 100 people connected to the incident as part of the probe.A separate account from a local Burton City Council candidate, Kris Johns, said Sanford had described members of the church as ""the antichrist"" during a conversation a week before the attack.Google Maps images show a Trump campaign sign at Sanford’s residence, though officials have not linked this to his actions.The Michigan shooting marks the 324th mass shooting in the US in 2025, according to the Gun Violence Archive. It comes a month after a shooting at a Catholic church in Minneapolis and coincidentally involved another 40-year-old Iraq War Marine veteran in a separate North Carolina shooting.Officials, including Governor Gretchen Whitmer, are urging the public to avoid speculation. “While it might feel natural to want to know why this attack happened, speculating is unhelpful and it can be downright dangerous,” she said, as cited by BBC.The FBI has deployed crisis response teams, bomb technicians, and more than 100 agents to assist in the ongoing investigation.Church representatives emphasised the sanctity of places of worship and called for healing. “We pray for peace and healing for all involved,” said Doug Andersen, a spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.","Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, killed in gunfight with police after shooting at Michigan church.

Thinking of inviting your parents, siblings, or even a friend, to visit you in the UAE? You’ll now need to show what’s in your paycheck. The country has introduced new income rules for sponsoring visitors, with different salary slabs depending on who you’re inviting. It’s part of a bigger shake-up to the UAE’s visa system, which now includes new categories, special permits, and updated rules for families, professionals, and humanitarian cases.Inviting someone to the UAE on a visit visa now depends not just on who they are, but also on how much you earn. As part of sweeping updates to its visa system, the UAE’s Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has introduced income-based eligibility rules for residents sponsoring friends and family.According to the ICP, the updated policy lays out three distinct salary thresholds:These new requirements are part of a broader set of regulatory updates introduced by the ICP. The income-based criteria are intended to ensure financial responsibility on the part of the sponsor and to streamline the process in a way that supports transparency and sustainable immigration management.According to the ICP, the changes were introduced following extensive studies that examined present and future trends in residency and international mobility.The analysis also incorporated feedback from customers, stakeholders, and frontline service centers. These insights were gathered via mechanisms such as customer councils, call centers, and the authority’s complaints and inquiry platforms.Once the visit visa is approved, visitors, whether family or friends, can generally stay in the UAE for 30 to 90 days, depending on the visa type issued. Some of these visas also come with the option to extend the stay, usually in two stages:These extensions are not automatic and are subject to approval and additional fees.If you're planning to sponsor a friend or relative, make sure all the required documents and conditions are in place before applying. The process is straightforward, but attention to detail matters. Here’s what’s expected:If you’re sponsoring a relative, you’ll need to submit proof of kinship and a valid justification for the visit. For instance, if you're sponsoring a foreign woman whose husband resides in the GCC, you must also attach a copy of his UAE or GCC residence permit.As part of the updated framework, the UAE has launched four new types of visit visas tailored to specific professional and economic sectors:These new categories are intended to attract global talent and enhance the UAE’s visibility as a destination for innovation, leisure, and industry-specific gatherings.Also read: UAE launches 4 new special Visit Visas for AI, cruise, events, and entertainment Beyond the visit visa updates, the ICP has introduced sweeping changes to residency rules, aimed at offering more flexibility across humanitarian, family, and professional circumstances. Here’s a summary of key developments:A one-year renewable residency permit can now be issued to foreigners from countries experiencing war, disasters, or unrest. Notably, this permit does not require a guarantor or host. Its issuance or cancellation will be based on reports by the General Directorate of Identity and Foreigners Affairs.Importantly, the Director General of Identity and Foreigners Affairs has the authority to waive standard requirements like financial solvency or kinship degree in special humanitarian cases involving relatives or in-laws. This aims to ensure compassionate handling of vulnerable individuals.Two categories of women are now eligible for a renewable one-year residence permit:All applicants must demonstrate financial capability and adequate housing. Custody disputes will be settled by a designated legal committee.Applicants must now either prove financial solvency related to their planned business or demonstrate they are already engaged in a similar business either abroad or through a UAE-based entity.Regulations for truck drivers have been streamlined. These visas can be single or multiple-entry and must be sponsored by licensed freight or logistics companies. Conditions include providing a financial guarantee, valid health insurance, and paying required government fees.","Residents must earn between AED 4,000 and AED 15,000 monthly to sponsor family or friends for UAE visit visas.

New York Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani on Sunday responded to Mayor Eric Adams’ shock decision to drop out of the race just over a month before Election Day, calling it a reflection of Adams’ ties to wealthy donors and national political figures rather than a shift in the city’s priorities.“It is very much the same race,” Mamdani told reporters. “It’s a race between us and the failed politics that we’ve seen, whether it’s Andrew Cuomo or Eric Adams… We’re going to show that they can’t dictate the outcome of this race”, he said, as per ABC 7 New York.Mamdani, who decisively defeated Cuomo in the Democratic primary, emphasised that his campaign remains focused on New Yorkers and the affordability crisis.“New Yorkers deserve leadership that is thinking about how to benefit the people of the city… too often politicians, be it Andrew Cuomo or Eric Adams, the meetings that they have or the phone calls with someone like Donald Trump , they’re only speaking about themselves”, he said, as quoted by democracynow.org.Criticising Adams’ record, Mamdani highlighted rising costs under the mayoralty. “This is a mayor who raised the rent by 12% on more than 2 million New Yorkers… and time and time again, exacerbated a cost-of-living crisis,” he claimed.Mamdani also addressed US President Donald Trump’s involvement and efforts to influence the race.“Donald Trump has spoken time and again about how he wants to narrow this race… yet we’re seeing the moment where he is shaping this race. But we’re going to show him that New Yorkers are tired of his politics and they’re tired of being priced out of the city”, he said, according to The Hill.He issued a pointed message to Cuomo, who has likely benefited from Adams’ exit. “To Andrew Cuomo. You got your wish. You wanted Trump and your billionaire friends to help you clear the field. But don’t forget, you wanted me as your opponent in the primary too, and we beat you by 13 points”.Despite Adams’ withdrawal, Mamdani insisted his campaign strategy remains unchanged. “We will have the same focus as we’ve always had, on working-class New Yorkers, their struggle to afford this city… and making sure the politics of the past do not dictate our future”.In polls, Mamdani currently leads the field with 45% support, ahead of Cuomo at 25%, Sliwa at 9%, and Adams at 8%.",New York Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani on Sunday responded to Mayor Eric Adams' shock decision to drop out of the race.

How to apply and what documents you need

Why expatriates are choosing Abu Dhabi for civil marriage

Legal benefits and global recognition of Abu Dhabi civil marriage





Abu Dhabi’s civil marriage service lets couples solemnize a legally recognized, secular marriage at the Abu Dhabi Civil Family Court under Law No. 14 of 2021. The service is open to most residents and visitors (with a key exception for Muslim UAE nationals) and is designed to be fast, internationally recognised and simple to navigate. If you’re planning to marry in Abu Dhabi, here’s a clear, practical guide to who can apply, what to prepare, how the ceremony works, the fees and why the reform matters for expatriates.Abu Dhabi’s civil-marriage scheme is governed by Abu Dhabi Law No. 14 of 2021 and applies to people regardless of religion or nationality, except for UAE nationals who are Muslims they remain subject to Sharia-based family law. Applicants must be at least 18 years old, give mutual consent, must not be married to someone else, and must not be related within the first or second degree. Tourists and non-residents can apply online and must travel to Abu Dhabi for the ceremony once approved. The move to allow civil marriage grew from wider UAE reforms introduced since 2021 to provide non-religious personal-status options and align with international norms.Couples can submit applications through the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department’s online portal or at authorised typing centres. The core documents are passports (and Emirates ID if resident), a completed application form, and proof that any prior marriage has been legally dissolved (divorce decree or death certificate).A prenuptial agreement is optional. There are two service tracks: the standard service (about AED 300, processed within roughly 10 working days) and an express option (around AED 2,500) that can be processed in one working day and lets couples choose the ceremony date. After approval, the court schedules the ceremony at its Civil Family Court.On the ceremony day both parties attend the Abu Dhabi Civil Family Court with IDs; no external witnesses are required because the civil marriage officer serves as the legal witness. Vows are played via a pre-recorded audio available in multiple languages, though couples can exchange rings, recite their own vows and bring guests or a photographer. After signing, the marriage certificate is legally binding; many couples choose to have the certificate attested by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for overseas use and embassy recognition. The process is intentionally straightforward to ensure the marriage is widely accepted by foreign authorities.Abu Dhabi has emerged as a preferred destination for non-Muslim expatriates and mixed-nationality couples seeking to formalize their unions legally. For many, coming from countries with strict marriage laws, religious restrictions, or cumbersome bureaucratic processes, Abu Dhabi offers a simpler, faster, and transparent system. Unlike traditional procedures that may require approval from multiple authorities or religious institutions, the civil marriage framework in Abu Dhabi allows couples to complete the process efficiently through a single legal channel.The system is particularly appealing for couples who previously faced hurdles due to differences in religion or nationality. Expats report that the process is streamlined, well-documented, and predictable, reducing both time and administrative stress. By providing a legally recognized, state-backed platform, Abu Dhabi has become a go-to destination for couples who want their marriage to be valid, hassle-free, and compliant with international legal standards.One of the biggest draws of Abu Dhabi’s civil marriage system is its legal robustness and international recognition. Marriage certificates issued here are accepted in most countries worldwide, making them highly valuable for practical purposes such as visa applications, bank accounts, inheritance rights, and other family law matters.This global validity ensures that couples do not face disputes or complications when moving, working, or studying abroad. The civil certificate also acts as a formal proof of marital status, recognized by governments and institutions alike, which can simplify processes like sponsorship for spouses, property ownership, and social benefits. For expatriates, having a legally enforceable marriage document from Abu Dhabi provides peace of mind, ensuring that their rights and obligations are protected both locally and internationally.","Abu Dhabi’s civil marriage service lets couples solemnize a legally recognized, secular marriage at the Abu Dhabi Civil Family Court. The service is open to most residents and visitors (with a key exception for Muslim UAE nationals) Applicants must be at least 18 years old, give mutual consent, and must not be married to someone else.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124227975,imgsize-1511355,width-400,resizemode-4/say-i-do.jpg"
Shutdown showdown: Federal agencies send emails blaming Democrats; cite 'unrelated policy demands',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shutdown-showdown-federal-agencies-send-emails-blaming-democrats-cite-unrelated-policy-demands/articleshow/124245772.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: AP)





Federal agencies under US President Donald Trump have sent emails to employees blaming congressional Democrats for a potential government shutdown, raising concerns among ethics experts about the partisan nature of the communications.Emails, sent Tuesday by at least four agencies, including the departments of interior, homeland security, and health and human services, stated that Trump “opposes a government shutdown and strongly supports enactment of H.R. 5371,” the continuing resolution intended to fund the government through November 22.They added, “Unfortunately, Democrats are blocking a clean continuing resolution in the US Senate due to unrelated policy demands”, as per The Hill.HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said the message was necessary, calling Democrats’ stance “holding the government hostage” and warning it would impact care to millions of Americans.The department of housing and urban development also posted a banner on its website accusing “The Radical Left” of planning to “shut down the government and inflict massive pain on the American people” unless their $1.5 trillion policy demands were met.Ethics experts described the communications as highly unusual but not explicitly illegal.Donald Sherman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington was quoted by The Hill as saying that the emails were “highly inappropriate, highly irregular, but not illegal,” noting they skirt laws like the Hatch Act and the Anti-Lobbying Act by avoiding explicit electioneering or urging calls to Congress.Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer criticised the messaging, arguing that Republicans are responsible for the shutdown, saying, “Their bill has not one iota of Democratic input. That is never how we’ve done this before. It’s up to the Republicans whether they want a shutdown or not”.The shutdown vote escalated after Senate Democrats rejected a Republican funding bill 55-45, falling short of the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster.Schumer said Republicans are trying to “bully” Democrats over healthcare and other priorities.Federal agencies have also been told to prepare for operational disruptions.The Office of Management and Budget warned departments to consider permanent staff reductions in areas “not consistent with the President’s priorities”, a more aggressive step than typical shutdown furloughs, as per news agency AP.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates about 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed daily if the shutdown begins after the September 30 deadline.House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and other Democrats have argued that the government funding bill should include healthcare protections, including extending Affordable Care Act subsidies and reversing recent Medicaid cuts, amid warnings that millions of Americans could face higher premiums if the GOP refuses to negotiate.Trump’s approach has included pointed partisan messaging alongside stalled negotiations. Hours after a White House meeting with congressional leaders, he posted an AI-altered video mocking Schumer and Jeffries, which Schumer called “trolling like a 10-year-old” and Jeffries condemned as “racist and fake”.The standoff marks a critical moment, with both sides digging in, federal workers facing uncertainty, and the first shutdown in nearly seven years looming over Washington.","Federal agencies under US President Donald Trump have sent emails to employees blaming congressional Democrats for a potential government shutdown.Ethics experts described the communications as highly unusual but not explicitly illegal.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Tuesday accused President Donald Trump of being ""racist"" over a deepfake video posted to the social media platform, which depicted him wearing a sombrero.The fabricated video was posted on Trump’s Truth Social account on Monday night and featured Jeffries sporting an exaggerated handlebar moustache with mariachi music playing in the background.The video, released hours after Trump met with congressional leaders about the looming government shutdown, appeared aimed at mocking Democrats’ stance on federal benefits for migrants — a claim Democrats deny.Speaking on the steps of the Capitol, where numerous Democrats rallied for Republicans to negotiate a bipartisan spending bill, Jeffries stated, “Mr. President, the next time you have something to say about me, don’t cop out through a racist and fake AI video.”He added, “When I’m back in the Oval Office, say it to my face. Say it to my face.”Trump, known for attacking minorities and exacerbating racial tensions to energise his MAGA base, has a longstanding record that Jeffries, the first Black lawmaker to lead either party, has consistently opposed.Uploaded hours after Trump met with congressional leaders regarding the shutdown, the video parodied a press conference held by Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York outside the White House following that meeting. The fake audio portrayed Schumer attacking his own party as being deeply unpopular “because of all of our woke, trans bulls—.” It further asserted, “Not even Black people want to vote for us anymore. ”","The fabricated video was posted on Trump’s Truth Social account on Monday night.

Trump embraces shutdown as a political tool







The US federal government officially entered a shutdown after Democrats and Republicans failed again to pass competing funding plans in the Senate, deepening the partisan standoff over federal spending and health care.On a 55-45 vote, the GOP proposal to extend funding until November 21 fell short of the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster, effectively guaranteeing a shutdown from 12:01 am (local time) on Wednesday.Republicans also blocked the Democrats’ version, which sought to extend funding until the end of October while adding over $1 trillion in health care spending, including maintaining Affordable Care Act subsidies and reversing recent Medicaid cuts.The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memo confirming that current federal funding levels “expire at 11:59 pm tonight”, effectively triggering a shutdown.The memo said the GOP-led continuing resolution (CR), which would have extended funding through November 21, was blocked by Democrats due to what the White House called “insane policy demands,” including $1 trillion in new spending.“But it is now clear that Democrats will prevent passage of this clean CR prior to 11:59 pm tonight and force a government shutdown.As such, affected agencies should now execute their plans for an orderly shutdown,” the memo said.A few members of the Democratic caucus, including Senators Catherine Cortez Masto, John Fetterman, and Angus King, broke ranks and supported the Republican funding bill, while Republican Senator Rand Paul opposed his party’s measure, highlighting fractures on both sides.Democrats have framed their resistance as a strategic fight to prevent cuts to health care that could hit millions of Americans and to push back against Trump’s administration, unlike earlier standoffs when they had allowed temporary stopgap funding.As per Fox News, Federal employees were instructed to report for scheduled duty to implement shutdown procedures, while a follow-up memo will be issued if a spending bill is passed, signalling the resumption of full operations once funding is restored.The OMB also instructed federal agencies to begin implementing shutdown plans following the failed votes, according to news agency AP.Agencies were warned that non-essential workers could face permanent layoffs, not just furloughs, in a “reduction in force,” with some departments posting warnings on their websites, including a HUD notice blaming Democrats for the shutdown.Hundreds of thousands of federal workers face furloughs or layoffs, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating that around 750,000 employees could be affected each day once a shutdown begins.If health care tax credits lapse, about 4 million people could lose coverage next year, while 20 million more could see higher insurance costs. By 2034, the CBO projects an additional 10 million Americans could become uninsured due to cuts in the GOP tax law, heightening the stakes of the impasse.Senate majority leader John Thune accused Democrats of forcing a showdown. “The Democrats' far-left base and far-left senators have demanded a showdown with the president,” he said, warning that Americans would bear the consequences, as per the New York Times.Democrats, however, insisted their demands—including extending Affordable Care Act subsidies and reversing Medicaid cuts—were essential to prevent a health care crisis.Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer warned, “If the president were smart, he'd move heaven and earth to fix this health care crisis right away, because Americans are going to hold him responsible when they start paying $400, $500, $600 a month more on their health insurance.”President Trump appeared to welcome the prospect of a shutdown. He threatened to use it to “cut vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like,” later adding that “a lot of good can come down from shutdowns”, suggesting layoffs could target programs favoured by Democrats.He also perpetuated unfounded claims that Democrats were shutting down the government to provide health care to immigrants lacking legal status, echoing debunked conspiracy theories.Earlier, tensions further escalated when Trump posted an AI-generated video mocking Democratic leaders with distorted voices and caricatures, including a cartoon sombrero on House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries.Jeffries responded by sharing a photo of Trump with Jeffrey Epstein , captioned, “This is real.”With both sides entrenched, the stalemate left little hope for a resolution before the deadline, setting the stage for the first government shutdown in nearly seven years.","The US federal government officially entered a shutdown after Democrats and Republicans failed again to pass competing funding plans in the Senate.

Government shutdown: From banks to courts- What stays open and what closes if Senate fails to pass funding bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shutdown-showdown-from-banks-to-courts-what-stays-open-and-what-closes-if-government-funding-lapses/articleshow/124245308.cms,"'Democrat Policies Killing People': Ted Cruz Torches Cory Booker, Padilla At Stormy Senate Hearing

Why and when government would shutdown



What stays open



The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the nation's largest food aid programme, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, would continue operations during a shutdown as funds allow, according to a shutdown planning document published by the US Department of Agriculture.

The US Postal Service would be unaffected because it does not depend on Congress for funding, USPS said in a statement. Post offices will be open.

The IRS would be fully staffed for five days, according to agency shutdown plans published Monday. The strategy does not say what the IRS, which lost about a quarter of its staff this year and now employs about 75,000 people, would do if the shutdown lasts longer than five business days.

More than 13,000 air traffic controllers would continue working, but without pay until the shutdown ends, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Most TSA employees would continue working, according to an agency statement

Last week, the federal judiciary warned that the courts could run out of money to fully sustain operations as soon as Friday if Congress fails to pass a spending bill. That is a shift. The courts sustained operations for five weeks when the govt shut down during Trump's first term.

The Social Security Administration would keep issuing retirement and disability benefits, but would furlough 12% of its staff and pause marketing campaigns, according to the agency’s shutdown plan. Payments would likewise continue under the Medicare and Medicaid healthcare programmes.

Banks

Federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, DEA and prison staff, will remain operational during a govt shutdown, officials confirmed. The Secret Service and Coast Guard will also continue their duties.

In the military, all active-duty personnel will stay on the job. However, nearly half of the Department of War's 741,477 civilian employees could face furloughs.

Services that may close during a govt shutdown



National parks, although the NPS had not officially released a shutdown contingency plan by Tuesday afternoon, Sept. 30.

Visitor centres and tours of federal govt buildings, including the US Capitol, White House and FBI Building, could be halted.

Smithsonian museums may close in the event of an extended shutdown.





The US is staring down a partial government shutdown as the clock ticks toward Tuesday’s midnight deadline, with President Donald Trump and Congress still deadlocked over a spending bill.If no deal is struck, hundreds of thousands of federal employees deemed nonessential will be furloughed — and this time, Trump is warning he may go even further, threatening permanent layoffs. What cuts could follow remain unclear.The chamber rejected a Democratic proposal and then shot down a Republican House-passed stopgap measure that would have funded the government through November 21. With both parties trading blame and refusing to back down, Washington remains with no clear path out of a shutdown.As of Tuesday afternoon, at least 21 of the 23 largest federal agencies posted details about which employees they would furlough.Congress writes detailed spending legislation for most U.S. govt agencies each year but rarely completes it before the fiscal year starts on October 1. Lawmakers typically pass stopgap spending bills to avoid disruption for several weeks or months while they finalize their work. The current stopgap bill is set to expire on September 30. Republicans and Democrats appear unlikely to reach an agreement on an extension that President Trump would sign into law before midnight on Tuesday. This situation could result in wide swaths of the govt lacking funds to continue their operations.Here is a guide to what would stay open and what would close in a govt shutdown, according to plans released so far:","US is staring down a partial government shutdown as the clock ticks toward Tuesday’s midnight deadline.

Trump’s Most Awkward Speech Yet? Generals Refuse to Clap, Silence Fills the Room | WATCH





US defense secretary Pete Hegseth on Tuesday announced new directives for the military, including implementing gender-neutral physical fitness standards and eliminating what he described as ""woke"" culture from the armed forces. The announcement came during an in-person meeting with military officials at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia.The new policies are guided by what Hegseth calls the “1990 test,” which examines whether changes to military standards since 1990 were necessary due to evolving combat needs or were influenced by other priorities. “The 1990s test is simple. What were the military standards in 1990, and if they have changed, tell me why: Was it a necessary change based on the evolving landscape of combat, or was the change due to a softening, weakening or gender-based pursuit of other priorities?” he explained.“I don’t want my son serving alongside troops who are out of shape, or in a combat unit with females who can’t meet the same Combat Arms physical standards as men, or troops who are not fully proficient on their assigned weapons, platform, or task, or under a leader who was the first but not the best. Standards must be uniform, gender neutral and high,” Hegseth said.Women were first allowed in direct combat roles during the Obama administration.While Hegseth did not announce a full rollback of women in combat, he made it clear that the “highest male standards” would now apply to all combat roles. He acknowledged that this could result in fewer women qualifying for some positions.“We very much value the impact of female troops — our female officers and NCOs are the absolute best in the world. But when it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender-neutral,” he said. “If women can make it, excellent. If not, it is what it is. If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it. That is not the intent, but it could be the result. ”Under the new rules, all combat personnel, including generals and admirals, will be required to pass two yearly physical tests. Hegseth emphasized that the standards are “gender neutral” but will be based on the “highest male standard” for physical fitness in combat roles.","US defense secretary Pete Hegseth on Tuesday announced new directives for the military.

Trump administration vs Harvard





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that his administration had struck a deal with Harvard University after what he described as months of negotiations.“I guess we reached a deal with Harvard today, so we’ll see how that, all you have to do is paper it right, Linda,” Trump said, addressing education secretary Linda McMahon during an unrelated executive orders signing ceremony in the Oval Office.Outlining the agreement, Trump said Harvard would pay about $500 million and begin operating trade schools focused on emerging skills. “They’ll be paying about $500 million and they’ll be operating trade schools. They’re going to be teaching people how to do, AI, and lots of other things,” he added.However, the exact terms of the deal remain unclear. Neither the White House nor Harvard University immediately released further details of the arrangement or clarified what the trade school programs would entail.Earlier this month, a federal judge ruled in Harvard’s favour, restoring over $2 billion in federal research funding that had been frozen by the White House, delivering a significant victory for the university. Harvard became the first university to directly challenge the Trump administration in court.The standoff between the Trump administration and Harvard University has escalated since May, when the Health and Human Services (HHS) department froze or cut off significant research funding.In late August, a federal judge ordered $2.7 billion in grants reinstated, ruling that the government had overstepped its authority.The administration’s move to refer Harvard to the debarment process could bypass that court order by blocking the university from accessing new federal funds entirely. Such a step would also disrupt ongoing research in science, medicine, and defence.HHS had sent its investigation to the Department of Justice in July, opening the door for potential legal action. Harvard has denied the allegations, with officials claiming that the government is using accusations of antisemitism as a pretext to tighten federal control over the university’s internal affairs.",US President Donald Trump said his administration had struck a deal with Harvard University after what he described as months of negotiations.

Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts has resigned after being arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) over alleged immigration violations. The development comes as the US Department of Justice (DOJ) has also opened an investigation into the school district’s hiring practices.Roberts’s attorneys announced his resignation on Tuesday, calling the matter a “very complex case.” The 49-year-old, a citizen of Guyana who came to the United States in 1999, was taken into custody last week. According to ICE, Roberts had allegedly violated a removal order issued by a judge in May 2024.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) further disclosed that Roberts had a previous weapons charge from 2020. At the time of his arrest, he allegedly tried to evade authorities and was found with a loaded handgun, a knife and $3,000 in cash in his car.Initially, the Des Moines school district suspended Roberts with pay but converted it to without pay on Monday after the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners revoked his superintendent license. The district has maintained that background checks suggested Roberts was a US citizen.In his resignation letter, Roberts wrote, “Out of concern for his 30,000 students, Dr. Roberts does not want to distract the Board, educators, and staff from focusing on educating DMPS’s students.” His lawyers indicated they would seek to reopen his immigration case but declined to share further details.Meanwhile, the DOJ confirmed that it has launched a civil rights investigation into Des Moines Public Schools. Officials pointed to concerns about race-based hiring practices and specific quotas for teachers of color mentioned on the district’s website.","Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts has resigned after being arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The family of Christian Black, a 25-year-old man from Zanesville who died after suffering injuries while in police custody, announced Tuesday that they have reached a $7 million settlement with Montgomery County.Black had been jailed after crashing an allegedly stolen car and attempting to flee. Black’s death in March this year was ruled a homicide by the county coroner.While the settlement resolves the civil lawsuit, the family is pressing officials to ensure steps are taken to prevent similar deaths in the future. In addition to the settlement with Montgomery County, Black’s family has filed a separate lawsuit against NaphCare, the jail’s healthcare provider, alleging medical negligence and wrongful death, among other claims, according to CNN.Michael Wright, the family’s lawyer, said Montgomery County has accepted responsibility and indicated plans to expand inpatient mental health facilities. However, Wright stressed that the family seeks further accountability. “We want to see more, such as jail officers charged and convicted in their son’s death,” he told reporters at a news conference.Black’s mother, Misty Black, said the settlement does not mark the end of her pursuit of justice.“This check doesn’t stop the criminal side,” she said. “It’s not going to make me go away. I’m here. Justice for Christian Black. I won’t stop until justice is served.”Video footage released by the family and their attorneys showed Black inside a cell, yelling and repeatedly hitting his fist and head against a glass door.

On Cam: 'Surprised' Lavrov Sows ‘TRUST ISSUES’ Doubt As Trump Mulls Tomahawk Missiles For Kyiv





A federal judge on Tuesday ruled that the Trump administration’s efforts to deport noncitizens who protested the war in Gaza violated the US Constitution.US district judge William Young in Boston sided with several university associations, calling the policy an ideological deportation that infringes on First Amendment rights.“This case perhaps the most important ever to fall within the jurisdiction of this district court squarely presents the issue whether non-citizens lawfully present here in United States actually have the same free speech rights as the rest of us. The Court answers this Constitutional question unequivocally ‘yes, they do,’” Young, a nominee of Republican President Ronald Reagan, wrote.The ruling followed a trial in which lawyers for the associations presented witnesses who testified that the Trump administration had coordinated efforts to target students and scholars critical of Israel or sympathetic to Palestinians.“Not since the McCarthy era have immigrants been the target of such intense repression for lawful political speech,” Ramya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, told the court. “The policy creates a cloud of fear over university communities, and it is at war with the First Amendment.”Lawyers representing the Trump administration argued there was no ideological deportation policy.“There is no policy to revoke visas on the basis of protected speech,” Victoria Santora told the court. “The evidence presented at this trial will show that plaintiffs are challenging nothing more than government enforcement of immigration laws, reported AP.John Armstrong, senior official at the Bureau of Consular Affairs, testified that visa revocations were based on longstanding immigration law. He acknowledged his involvement in revoking visas of several high-profile activists, including Rumeysa Ozturk and Mahmoud Khalil, and was shown memos endorsing their removal. Armstrong insisted that revocations were not based on protected speech and denied accusations of targeting individuals for their ideology.","US district judge William Young in Boston sided with several university associations, calling the policy an ideological deportation that infringes on First Amendment rights. “Not since the McCarthy era have immigrants been the target of such intense repression for lawful political speech,” Ramya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124243179,imgsize-859660,width-400,resizemode-4/us-judge-slams-trump-on-deportations-cites-1st-amendment.jpg"

Why is Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst significant?







A lockdown at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL) in Burlington County, New Jersey, was lifted around noon on Tuesday after a hoax shooter threat.A lockdown was imposed just before 11 am ET, which lasted approximately one hour following a report of an active shooter at the major US military installation. However, authorities later determined there was no active shooter threat.Base officials an hour later confirmed in a Facebook post stating, “ALL CLEAR. All personnel are to resume normal operations.” The lockdown had been ordered just before 11 am, with an earlier advisory urging personnel outdoors to take cover.“Our priority is the safety and security of everyone on the installation,” Col. Michael Stefanovic, JBMDL commander, said in a statement. “We worked closely with local law enforcement and emergency responders to ensure the situation was investigated and resolved as quickly as possible.”Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, located in central New Jersey, is a key tri-service US military installation, formed in 2009 through the merger of McGuire Air Force Base, Fort Dix, and Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst. Spanning over 42,000 acres across Burlington and Ocean counties, the base supports air mobility, training, and engineering operations critical to national defense.The installation is home to more than 40 units and mission partners, including the Air Force’s 305th Air Mobility Wing, Army Reserve and Guard units, and Navy test and evaluation programs. Its strategic location allows for rapid global deployment of personnel and equipment, while also serving as a central training hub for service members."," lockdown at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst lifted after hoax shooter threat. lockdown was imposed just before 11 am ET, which lasted approximately one hour.

At least nine people, including four militants, were killed in two separate bomb-related incidents on Tuesday in South Waziristan district of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, reported news agency PTI.The first explosion occurred in Ashangi Lagad village, where five villagers were killed instantly after coming into contact with a bomb-like object lying on the road.The powerful blast sparked panic in the area, with residents demanding that authorities step up efforts to clear unexploded devices and protect civilians. Security forces and local administration officials later reached the site and launched an investigation.Hours later, in the Wacha Khawora area of Wana, four militants were killed when an improvised explosive device (IED) they were attempting to plant went off prematurely. Among those killed were a local militant commander, Yar Muhammad Muslim, Zameed Alam of the Ashangi tribe, and two unidentified associates.Earlier, at least ten people were killed and several others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside the paramilitary headquarters in Quetta on Tuesday.The blast was reportedly heard miles away, and ambulances quickly arrived to transport the wounded to nearby hospitals.“The blast occurred as an explosive-laden vehicle took a turn from Model Town towards Hali Road, near the Frontier Constabulary (FC) headquarters,” said Muhammad Baloch, SSP special operations Quetta.This follows heightened tensions in the region. On September 3, a suicide bombing at a political rally in Quetta killed 11 leaving over 40 injured.

Pakistan-occupied Jammu Kashmir (PoJK) is witnessing rising unrest as Shaukat Nawaz Mir, head of the Neelum Valley Public Action Committee, announced a full-scale shutdown to press for public demands.Authorities have warned that any attempt to carry out the strike will be met with force, reported ANI.The announcement follows months of mounting dissatisfaction among citizens who feel ignored by the local administration.

Amid Trump-Sharif Meeting, Political Expert Explains Why US is Eyeing Pakistan As Military Launchpad





: In an effort to worm its way back into Washington’s good books, Pakistan ’s hybrid military-civilian leadership flashed glimpses of its purported rare earths bearing mineral wealth during a meeting with US President Donald Trump last week, going by a photo released by the White House.Among a dozen photos featured in the White House picture gallery relating to the Shahbaz Sharif- Asim Munir meeting with Trump is one where the duo is showing Trump an open 18x18 inch wooden box with colorful stones presumably bearing some mineral deposits. Two of the larger rocks appear to be bastanzite and monazite clumps that typically bear rare earths elements (REE) such as cerium, lanthanum, and neodymium. Some of the smaller candy-colored pebbles look like gemstones.Pakistan has long spoken of its vast untapped oil, gas, and mineral ores, some bearing rare earths, mostly in the troubled Balochistan region wracked with insurgency, and also in Khyber-Pakhtoonwa. While none of the mineral deposits are commercially proven or quantified, Pakistan’s leadership showcased the baubles to the US President to highlight collaboration and exploration bids it has signed with a private US firm earlier this month.The charm offensive also included PM Sharif wearing a lapel pin the had both the US and Pakistani flags, a gesture some Pakistani trolls on social media termed as “embarrassing.”While there is no direct government-to-government agreement to explore or exploit the mineral wealth, Pakistan's Frontier Works Organization (FWO)—a military-linked engineering and mining entity—signed an MoU on September 8 with the Missouri-based US Strategic Metals (USSM), a private US firm specializing in critical minerals.The agreement, with an initial funding of $ 500 million from USSM, envisages three phases: Phase 1 (Immediate, 2025–2026) involving export of readily available minerals (e.g., antimony and copper concentrates) to US markets, generating quick revenue. Phase 2 (Medium-term, 2026–2028) involving construction of processing plants and refineries in Pakistan, with technology transfer for REE separation and purification. Phase 3 (Long-term, 2028+), involving large-scale exploration and exploitation, including drilling in high-potential REE belts; and developing 5–10 mining projects.Islamabad's rare earths gambit with the US — which could cause Pakistan's patron China to burst a blood vessel since it has a stranglehold on rare earths supply to the US — comes on the heels of the its crypto caper, where it used a British-Pakistani entrepreneur to position itself as crypto capital where American businesses with ties to the Trump family could make a fortune.","Pakistan has long spoken of its vast untapped oil, gas, and mineral ores, some bearing rare earths.

NEW YORK: Despite being among one of the world's worst performers when it comes to democracy, and registering a high number of human rights violation cases, Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif defended the country's 'hybrid model' of governance where the army and civilian leadership work hand in glove in running the country.He made the remarks in an interview to British-American journalist Mehdi Hasan while defending Pakistan. Asif called the US democracy a ""deep state"" and tried to brush away the charges of military might in Pak governance.When asked by Hasan, ""It's a strange system you have in Pakistan. I think you've called it a hybrid model - where the military and civilian leaders effectively share power. But the military leaders are really the ones in charge, are they not? In most countries, the head of the army answers to the defence minister. In your country you, the defence minister, answer to the head of the army, don't you?

The term, Dawn said, is used to describe the informal power-sharing arrangement, whereby the military holds a significant influence on the civilian leadership. ani","Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif defended the country's 'hybrid model' of governance.

Seventeen militants linked to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Saturday were killed in a joint operation by Pakistan’s Frontier Corps (FC) and police in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, officials told news agency AP.According to District Police Officer (DPO) Karak Shahbaz Elahi, the intelligence-led operation took place in the Karak district on Friday following credible reports about the presence of militants affiliated with the TTP and the Mullah Nazir group.As security forces approached, the militants opened fire, prompting retaliation in which all 17 were killed. A substantial cache of arms and ammunition was recovered from the scene. Three security personnel sustained injuries in the firefight.The slain militants were reportedly wanted for multiple crimes, including attacks on security forces, kidnapping for ransom, and other terrorist activities. A curfew was later imposed in Darsha Khel and surrounding villages to facilitate a wider combing operation, as several militants were believed to have fled the area.Separately, at least 23 civilians, including women and children, were reportedly killed in an airstrike in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Monday.","Seventeen militants linked to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed in a joint operation by Pakistan’s Frontier Corps (FC) and police in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Awkward contradictions on Imran Khan







Pakistan's defence minister, Khawaja Asif , has once again defended his country's ""hybrid model"" of governance, insisting that the military and civilian leadership work ""by consensus"" in managing state affairs.Speaking to British-American journalist Mehdi Hasan, Asif dismissed suggestions that the army dominates Pakistan's politics, while controversially describing US democracy as a ""deep state.""When asked whether Pakistan's generals hold more power than elected ministers, Asif retorted, ""No, it's not like that. I'm a political appointee, I’m a political worker."" Pressed further with comparisons to the United States, where civilian leaders have the authority to dismiss top generals, he claimed, ""They (the US) have a different model over here. It's called deep state.""Hasan pointed out that in Pakistan, critics accuse the military of being the real decision-maker. Asif acknowledged the perception, blaming ""past military rulers"" for the image, but insisted the system was based on consensus. Asked directly who prevails if he and Army chief Asim Munir disagree, Asif said: ""It's not equal. We can agree to disagree. It is by consensus, whatever is taking place.""Earlier this year, Asif had described the hybrid arrangement as a ""practical necessity,"" saying that while not an ideal form of democracy, it was helping Pakistan manage its economic and governance crises. Local daily Dawn has reported that Asif often praises the military-civilian partnership, despite critics branding it undemocratic.Turning to geopolitics, Asif insisted Pakistan's tilt toward Washington under US President Donald Trump, with new mineral and crypto trade deals, would not jeopardise Islamabad's ties with Beijing. ""We are not worried about that, because it's a time-tested relationship with China since the late 50s. China is not worried about our flirtations or whatever you call it,"" he remarked.Highlighting defence ties, he said: ""In the past, even today and in the future also, China has been a very reliable ally. Our Air Force, submarines, planes — almost a major portion of our arms are from China, and our defence cooperation is increasing. It is much more robust than before, with China, the main reason is unreliability of other sources like the United States.""He underscored geography as another factor: ""They (China) are reliable and they are our neighbours. We share borders and we share the geography.""The interview also turned uncomfortable when Asif was confronted about his shifting claims on jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan's social media activity. At one point, he alleged Khan was operating his account from Adiala Jail. When reminded that he had earlier accused India of controlling Khan's account, Asif appeared flustered.""You just made two different allegations. Is it Imran in his prison cell or is it India?"" Hasan asked. Asif responded, ""Either he is operating from the cell or he should at least identify who is operating the jail cell.""Pressed further on evidence, Asif cited ""intelligence sources"" but refused to provide details, insisting: ""The evidence I cannot publicly disclose… but it is there.""","Pakistan's defence minister defends country's ""hybrid model"" of governance.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban’s first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that “eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place “until further notice.”Just last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan’s fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide “to prevent immoral activities.” They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

At least one student was killed, dozens were injured, and 65 were feared buried in the debris after Al Khoziny Islamic boarding school building collapsed in Indonesia.Rescue workers, police, and soldiers, who had been digging through the night, pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java. Additional bodies were spotted, suggesting the death toll could rise, AP reported.Families of the students gathered at hospitals and near the collapsed building, anxiously awaiting news of their children. Relatives wailed as they watched rescuers pull a dusty, injured student from the buried prayer hall.A notice board at the command post established in the boarding school complex listed 65 students as missing as of Tuesday morning. They were mostly boys in Class 7 to Class 11, aged between twelve and seventeen.“Oh my God... my son is still buried, oh my God please help!” a mother cried hysterically upon seeing her child's name on the board, followed by the cries of other parents facing similar losses.“Please, sir, please find my child immediately,” pleaded a father, holding the hand of one of the rescue team members. Heavy slabs of concrete, rubble, and unstable parts of the building hampered search and rescue efforts, said Nanang Sigit, a search and rescue officer leading the operation.Heavy equipment was available but not being used due to concerns it could cause further collapse. “We have been running oxygen and water to those still trapped under the debris and keeping them alive while we work hard to get them out,” Sigit said.He added that rescuers had seen several bodies under the rubble but were focused on saving those still alive. Several hundred rescuers participated in the effort, equipped with breathing apparatus, extrication tools, medical evacuation equipment, and other support devices.The students had been performing afternoon prayers in a building undergoing an unauthorised expansion when it suddenly collapsed on top of them, provincial police spokesperson Jules Abraham Abast said. Residents, teachers, and administrators assisted injured students, many with head injuries and broken bones.Female students were praying in another part of the building and managed to escape, survivors said. One male student, a thirteen-year-old boy, was killed, and ninety-nine other students were injured and taken to hospitals, some in critical condition, officials said. Authorities were investigating the cause of the collapse. Abast said the old prayer hall was two stories, but two additional floors were being added without a permit.“The old building's foundation was apparently unable to support two floors of concrete and collapsed during the pouring process,” Abast said.","Rescue workers, police, and soldiers pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java.

Nepal's former Prime Minister and CPN-UML chairman KP Sharma Oli has publicly dismissed speculation that he plans to leave the country, accusing the Sushila Karki-led government of attempting to strip him of his security and official entitlements amid ongoing political tension, reported news agency ANI.Addressing a gathering of Yuwa Sangh Nepal, the youth wing of his party, in Gundu, Bhaktapur, Oli declared, ""Do you think we will flee by handing over the nation to this groundless government?"" He said he remained committed to restoring “peace, good governance and constitutional order”, as quoted by the agency.Oli’s remarks come weeks after the fall of his government on September 9, which followed large-scale Gen Z-led protests. Since vacating the Prime Minister’s official residence in Baluwatar, Oli has relocated to a rented house in Gundu, following an arson attack on his private residence in Balkot by protestors.The CPN-UML chief alleged that the current administration lacked democratic legitimacy and was formed through “vandalism and arson”, not the people’s mandate.Challenging the government to disclose any communication he had with state authorities during the protests, Oli said, “Publish them with courage.Make public the instructions I gave.” He denied any wrongdoing and questioned the basis of efforts to link him to the violent unrest.He also raised concerns over reported threats to his safety and criticised the government for inaction. “On social media, there are open calls to attack my residence. What is the government doing? Just watching?” he asked.The former PM expressed strong objection to reports that the government was planning to withhold passports of several political leaders, including himself, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Arzu Rana Deuba, Ramesh Lekhak, and Deepak Khadka.Oli accused the ruling dispensation of creating a climate of insecurity and targeting opposition leaders. “This government is throwing the country into insecurity,” he alleged.Meanwhile, a recent monitoring report by Nepal’s national human rights commission (NHRC) blamed the previous government, led by Oli and then-home minister Ramesh Lekhak, for failing to anticipate the scale of the Gen Z protests. The NHRC said that while the initial demonstrations on September 8 were peaceful, the use of excessive force by security personnel on September 9 led to dozens of deaths and widespread violence.Rights groups have held Oli and Lekhak accountable for the crackdown, which played a key role in the fall of their administration. The NHRC report highlighted poor coordination, declining morale among security forces, and inadequate preparation as contributing factors to the high casualties.","KP Sharma Oli accuses Sushila Karki-led government of attempting to strip him of his security and official entitlements.

India Dragged Into Bangladesh Politics: Muhammad Yunus Accuses New Delhi of Spreading Propaganda





DHAKA: Bangladesh's student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) threatens to halt elections after the Election Commission (EC) refused to allocate the symbol it demanded ahead of the February polls.NCP, a large offshoot of Students against Discrimination (SAD), which led last year's street campaign dubbed as the July Uprising, toppling then prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League and installing professor Muhammad Yunus as the chief adviser.""The commission could not show any legal logic for not allocating the 'shapla' (water lily) as our symbol and therefore we are sticking to our demand,"" NCP's convenor Nahid Islam was quoted as saying on Wednesday by newspapers a day after the EC revealed its decision on the issue.Islam said NCP would give its ""final reaction"" once the EC takes its ""formal decision"".However, the party's chief coordinator for northern Bangladesh, Sarjis Alam, threatened to halt the polls unless their demand was met.""Since there is no legal barrier, the NCP must get the 'shapla' as its symbol; there is no other option. Unless we get it, we will see how the election is held and how someone could dream of attaining power,"" Alam posted on social media.EC's senior secretary, Akhter Ahmed, on Tuesday told a media briefing that NCP would not be allotted the symbol they demanded as it is ""not included in the list of electoral symbols as per the regulations"".""The 'shapla' is not on our list of 115 electoral symbols. According to the rules, political parties must choose a symbol from the approved list,"" he said.The ""shapla"" is the national emblem of Bangladesh.NCP chief coordinator Nasiruddin Patwary led the party delegation to the EC to get its registration earlier and said the party must be registered with the ""shapla"" symbol.Asked how they would secure the symbol since it was not included in the EC's revised list, he said amendments could be made at any time.Patwary also said the party expected to win around 150 constituencies out of 300, with nominations including former army officers, as well as women, farmers, and workers involved in the July uprising.Several political analysts, however, speculate a bleak fate for NCP in elections, particularly after their nominees witnessed a landslide defeat in students' union elections in two major public universities - the premier Dhaka University and suburban Jahangirnagar University.Bangladesh's largest Islamist Party, Jamaat-e-Islami-backed Islami Chhaita Shibir, won in most of the posts in both elections. Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, the student wing of former prime minister Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party, also witnessed an astounding defeat, though it emerged as the second biggest student group in the central students union polls in the two universities.",Bangladesh's student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) threatens to halt elections.

Yunus discusses SAARC revival with US envoy Gor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/yunus-discusses-saarc-revival-with-us-ambassador-designate-to-india-sergio-gor/articleshow/124078736.cms,"File photos





While it’s well known that Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived, he has now raised the issue with Sergio Gor, the US ambassador-designate to India who will also play the role of Special Envoy for South and Central Asia.Yunus met Gor on the margins of the ongoing UNGA session in New York. According to Dhaka, the chief advisor noted that the interim government has intensified efforts to revive SAARC, which has not held a summit in over a decade.SAARC summits are held biennially but the process has remained stalled since the summit in Kathmandu in 2014. The Uri terrorist attack in 2016 put paid to the summit that Pakistan was scheduled to host that year and India has since maintained Pakistan’s continued support for cross-border terrorism has made unfeasible the SAARC dialogue, including summits and important meetings.However, India has continued to support SAARC activities in diverse sectors for closer cooperation and blamed Pakistan for blocking trade and connectivity initiatives in the region. While it hasn’t withdrawn from the Association, India has sought to strengthen regional cooperation through the BIMSTEC grouping in which Pakistan is not a member.The US readout said regional cooperation was discussed but didn’t specifically mention SAARC.Bangladesh didn’t say what Gor’s response was to Yunus’ remarks on SAARC but India will be wary of any external pressure to resume the summit process. The idea of Pakistan hosting even a virtual summit has been rendered a non-starter because of the Pahalgam terrorist attack that led to a dramatic military clash between India and Pakistan.India sees the appointment of Gor as ambassador by the Trump administration as a welcome development but will guard against any US attempt to intrude into South Asian affairs through Gor’s dual role, particularly if it has any security fallout for the region. India is already worried about security challenges that Dhaka’s warming ties with Pakistan might entail. It has shown little interest so far in Yunus’ efforts to, as he said earlier, revive the spirit of SAARC.While countries like Bangladesh and Nepal seek a resumption of the summit process, India maintains that there has been no material change in the situation since the 19th summit that Pakistan had to host was postponed and that there’s no consensus among members on the meeting.India closely followed a China-Pakistan-Bangladesh trilateral meeting at Kunming, taking note of reports that this was an effort to create a new bloc in the region, However, Dhaka later denied this was an effort to forge an alliance against any country.Yunus also discussed with Gor the Rohingya crisis, and the “proliferation of disinformation targeting Dhaka”. Yunus has in the past described as fake news some of the reports in Indian media about targeting of Hindus in Bangladesh .According to Dhaka, Yunus also expressed Bangladesh’s interest in joining ASEAN, stating that integration with Southeast Asian economies could significantly accelerate the country’s development. He told Gor Dhaka ismaking “comprehensive preparations” to ensure a free, fair, and peaceful general election in the first half of February.","Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived.

Student bodies warn Labour of losing Indian talent if levy imposed on foreign students,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/student-bodies-warn-labour-of-losing-indian-talent-if-levy-imposed-on-foreign-students/articleshow/124245461.cms,"UK education secretary Bridget Phillipson





LONDON: Bodies representing Indian students, UK academics and UK universities have slammed plans by Labour to impose a levy on international students to pay for maintenance grants for domestic students from low-income families at university or college, saying it will put off international students and hit university finances.UK education secretary Bridget Phillipson pledged to introduce the new means-tested maintenance grants by the end of this parliament in her speech at the Labour Party conference on Monday.The grants will be fully funded by a new international student levy, the Labour Party confirmed, saying this would “ensure revenue from international students is used to benefit working-class domestic students”. The immigration white paper had proposed a 6% levy on international student fees.INSA UK president Amit Tiwari said a 6% levy risked pricing Indian students out of higher education market.In the year ending June 2025 Indian students were the second-largest cohort, after Chinese students, to study in the UK, with 98,014 study visas granted. “Indian students alone contributed over £4 billion to the UK economy last year,” Tiwari said. “Adding a new charge will push them towards Canada, Australia and the US.”Policy consultancy Public First predicts a 6% levy will lead to a loss of 16,100 international students in the first year, leading to a £240 million loss of fee income to the sector, and a loss of 77,000 international students in the first five years, leading to a loss of £2.2 billion.Jonathan Simons, partner at Public First, said: “Around 40% of our universities are currently in deficit; a levy will lead to a further loss of jobs and places for UK students. There is a danger that the very students govt wishes to help won’t be able to access a course because the international students won’t be there to subsidise them.”","UK education secretary Bridget Phillipson pledged to introduce the new means- tested maintenance grants by the end of this parliament.

£5bn Bitcoin scam busted: Chinese national convicted in UK in largest cryptocurrency seizure; pleads guilty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/5bn-bitcoin-scam-busted-chinese-national-convicted-in-uk-in-largest-cryptocurrency-seizure-pleads-guilty/articleshow/124226701.cms,"



A Chinese national pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency, worth more than £5 billion ($6.7 billion).Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, led a large-scale scam in China by cheating more than 1,28,000 victims and storing the stolen funds in bitcoin assets between 2014-2017, the Met Police said in a statement, as per BBC.The Met said that the 47-year-old's guilty plea followed a seven-year probe into a global money laundering web. A total of 61,000 bitcoins were seized from Qian, the Met reported. Police said the probe began in 2018 after receiving a tip-off about the transfer of criminal assets.Qian had been ""evading justice"" for five years up to her arrest, necessitating a complex investigation involving multiple jurisdictions, said Detective Sergeant Isabella Grotto, who led the Met's investigation.She fled China using false documents and entered the UK, where she attempted to launder the stolen money by purchasing property, the Met stated. Qian received assistance from a Chinese takeaway worker named Jian Wen, who was jailed for six years and eight months last year for her role in the criminal operation.Wen, 44, laundered the proceeds from the scam and moved from living above a restaurant to a ""multi-crore rented house"" in North London, according to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) earlier this year.She also purchased two properties in Dubai worth more than £500,000, the CPS reported. The Met said it seized more than £300m worth of bitcoin from Wen. Wen claimed that she bought the properties for an employer from China.However, the CPS stated that the large amount of bitcoin and lack of evidence regarding its acquisition indicated it was from a criminal source. Chinese media outlet Lifeweek reported in 2024 that investors, mostly between 50 and 75 years old, had poured ""hundreds of thousands to tens of millions"" of yuan into investments promoted by Qian. The schemes capitalised on cryptocurrency's popularity in China at the time, promising daily dividends and guaranteed profits, according to Lifeweek.Qian's company claimed it would help China become a hub for finance and technology and showcased projects and investments it said it had across the country. Some of the victims—including business people, bank employees and members of the judiciary—were reportedly urged to invest in Qian's scheme by friends and family.The investors reportedly knew little about Qian, who was described as ""the goddess of wealth."" ""Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are increasingly being used by organised criminals to disguise and transfer assets, so that fraudsters may enjoy the benefits of their criminal conduct,"" said Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor Robin Weyell.""This case, involving the largest cryptocurrency seizure in the UK, illustrates the scale of criminal proceeds available to those fraudsters,"" Weyell added. Monday's conviction marked the ""culmination of years of dedicated investigation"", which involved the police and Chinese law enforcement teams, said Will Lyne, the Met's Head of Economic and Cybercrime Command.The Met stated the investigation is still ongoing. The CPS is working to ensure the fraudsters do not get hold of the stolen funds, the Met reported. Many of the victims had some of their money returned to them by a compensation scheme established in China, the CPS said last year. Qian is being held in custody ahead of sentencing. The date of her sentencing has yet to be fixed.","Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, led a large-scale scam in China.

First-cousin marriage: UK NHS cites benefits; conservatives slam report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/first-cousin-marriage-uk-nhs-cites-benefits-conservatives-slam-report/articleshow/124213696.cms,".





UK’s National Health Service (NHS) is facing criticism for linking first-cousin marriages to “stronger extended family support” and economic benefits.Experts warn that marrying a first cousin carries health risks, including a higher chance of children inheriting recessive genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis or thalassaemia, reported The Standard.The controversy comes after NHS staff in Bradford described marrying a cousin as a “cultural practice”.The guidance, released by NHS England’s genomics education programme, although noting that first-cousin marriages, common in the British Pakistani community, are linked to a greater risk of genetic conditions in children, it recommended public health measures such as awareness campaigns rather than banning cousin marriages, saying that outlawing the practice could stigmatise communities.The document received severe backlash from the conservatives of the UK, including Tory MP Richard Holden, who said that the NHS should act against “damaging and oppressive cultural practices” and call for an end to cousin marriage, reported The Daily Mail.“The Conservatives want to see an end to cousin marriage as a backdoor to immigration too, but Labour are deaf to these sensible demands. Sir Keir Starmer should stop running scared of the misogynistic community controllers and their quislings who appear in the form of cultural relativist-obsessed sociology professors, and ban a practice the overwhelming majority, from every community in Britain, want to see ended for good,” he said.Holden has also proposed a bill to ban first-cousin marriages, though Downing Street has said the government has no plans to take this step.Aneeta Prem MBE, founder of the Freedom Charity, also criticised the guidance, saying cousin marriages are a safeguarding risk. She added that the practice is linked to dishonour abuse, where young people are pressured and have little real choice. “The health evidence is clear. These are preventable harms that place families and the NHS under immense pressure. This is about protecting rights, not targeting communities,” she said, as quoted by The Daily Mail.First-cousin marriages have been legal in the UK since a law was passed during Henry VIII’s reign.","First-cousin marriages have been legal in the UK since a law was passed during Henry VIII’s reign.

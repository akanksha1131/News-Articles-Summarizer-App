Former US President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama , were spotted together over the weekend on a lavish getaway in Portofino, Italy, aboard Steven Spielberg ’s $250 million superyacht, the Seven Seas, putting recent speculation about their marriage to rest.The former first lady arrived first on Friday, climbing aboard the 357-foot luxury vessel via a tender.As per TMZ, photographs captured her greeting Spielberg with a warm hug, wearing a casual double denim outfit and Birkenstocks. She spent time chatting with Spielberg and his wife, Kate Capshaw, while enjoying the scenic Italian coastline.Barack Obama joined the trip the following evening, arriving with a full entourage that included Italian intelligence personnel, bomb-sniffing dogs, and the Italian military police, the carabinieri, as per the New York Post.He was later seen on the yacht’s deck having breakfast with Michelle, before the two couples headed ashore to Punta Chiappa for lunch. At one point, Barack was photographed focused on a laptop while seated alone on the yacht.The outing comes days after Barack made light-hearted remarks about his marriage, joking that he had spent “over eight years now trying to dig myself out of a hole with Michelle,” calling it “challenging” but noting that he was “almost breaking even at the moment”, as per the Daily Mail.The couple, married for nearly 33 years, share daughters Malia, 27, and Sasha, 24.The Obamas had previously addressed marital rumours during a joint appearance on Michelle’s podcast in July, in which she dismissed speculation about trouble in their relationship. “There hasn’t been one moment in our marriage where I thought about quitting my man,” she said.Barack added humorously, “She took me back! It was touch and go for a while”.This was the first time the Obamas were seen together publicly since the podcast appearance.Their vacation coincided with a high-profile memorial for Charlie Kirk, the slain co-founder of Turning Point USA, held in Glendale, Arizona. Barack had offered prayers for Kirk’s family, describing the murder as “horrific and a tragedy”.Rumours surrounding the couple’s marriage had intensified earlier this year when Michelle skipped high-profile events, including President Trump’s inauguration and Jimmy Carter’s funeral.","Former US President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, were spotted together over the weekend on a lavish getaway in Portofino, Italy, aboard Steven Spielberg ’s $250 million superyacht, the Seven Seas.

'Please don't go out casually': China alerts citizens



Government work suspended in Philippines



Daily life disrupted in Taiwan







Super Typhoon Ragasa slammed into the southern part of China, prompting complete shutdown of schools and businesses in at least 10 cities along with flight cancellations on Tuesday.This came a day after it prompted the evacuation of thousands from northern Philippine villages and led to the closure of schools and offices in the Philippines and neighboring Taiwan, as it threatened flooding and landslides.It is expected to stay over the South China Sea at least until Wednesday, passing south of Taiwan and Hong Kong before making landfall on the Chinese mainland.Chinese authorities alerted the citizens about the typhoon and urged them not to go out ""casually.""""Except for emergency rescue personnel and those ensuring people's livelihood, please do not go out casually,"" AFP quoted Shenzhen emergency authority saying.In Shenzhen, around 4,00,000 residents, particularly those in low-lying and flood-prone areas, were set to be relocated, while the city’s airport announced it would stop operations beginning Tuesday night.Locally known as Nando, the typhoon caused widespread disruption across northern Philippines as it slammed into Panuitan island off Cagayan province with sustained winds of 215 kph (134 mph) and gusts up to 295 kph (183 mph).Thousands of people were evacuated from villages, while over 8,200 residents in Cagayan and 1,220 in Apayao were moved to emergency shelters. Power outages were reported on Calayan island and throughout Apayao, and domestic flights and inter-island ferries were suspended due to rough seas.Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr also suspended government work and classes in Manila and 29 northern provinces to ensure public safety.In Taiwan, Ragasa prompted authorities in southern Taitung and Pingtung counties to close schools and offices in coastal and mountainous areas, as well as on Orchid and Green islands.Ferry services to outlying islands were suspended, and afternoon flights were canceled to protect passengers from the typhoon’s severe winds and rough seas. Residents were advised to remain indoors and take precautionary measures against potential flooding and landslides.Strong winds and torrential rains brought by Ragasa disrupted daily life and transport across the affected regions. Coastal communities were warned of the risk of storm surges, and local officials coordinated emergency measures to safeguard lives and property.","Super Typhoon Ragasa slammed into the southern part of China, prompting complete shutdown of schools and businesses in at least 10 cities.

'Suitcase murders': New Zealand mother found guilty of killing two children; bodies lay hidden for years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/suitcase-murders-new-zealand-mother-found-guilty-of-killing-two-children-hiding-bodies-for-years/articleshow/124059681.cms,"Mother Posts Haunting TikTok; Then Allegedly Kills Husband, 2 Children in Chilling Murder-Suicide

Bodies found by unsuspecting buyers

Flight and extradition

Silent in court, awaiting sentence





A New Zealand jury on Tuesday found 45-year-old Hakyung Lee guilty of murdering her two young children and stashing their bodies in suitcases that went unnoticed for years before a chilling discovery in Auckland.The high court jury in Auckland took only hours to reject Lee’s plea of insanity, convicting her of killing her son Minu Jo, 6, and daughter Yuna Jo, 8, in June 2018. The children’s remains were found four years later, in August 2022, after the contents of a storage locker were auctioned off.The case drew international headlines when unsuspecting buyers, who had purchased the abandoned storage unit online, discovered the children’s remains packed into luggage. Lee had stopped paying the rental fees as she spiraled into financial difficulties.After the killings, Lee fled to South Korea, changed her name, and lived there until her arrest in 2022. She was extradited to New Zealand later that year to face trial. Her lawyers argued she was suffering from severe mental illness after her husband’s death from cancer in 2017, but prosecutors said she knew exactly what she was doing.Throughout the three-week trial, Lee kept her head bowed, her hair covering her face, rarely engaging in proceedings. She returned to the dock for the verdict on Tuesday, standing silently as the jury declared her guilty.Justice Geoffrey Venning ordered Lee to remain in custody until her sentencing on November 26. Under New Zealand law, murder carries a mandatory life sentence with a minimum of 10 years before parole eligibility.","Hakyung Lee, 45, found guilty of murdering her two young children and stashing their bodies in suitcases.

Taliban bans books by Women in Afghanistan's universities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-bans-books-by-women-in-afghanistans-universities/articleshow/124059652.cms,"Image used for representative purposes





The Taliban government is purging books written by women from Afghanistan's male-only university system and outlawing gender studies courses, the latest blows in a campaign against women's rights since the group returned to power four years ago.More than 600 books, many of them written by women, were included in a 50-page list of banned works. The directive was announced in a letter to universities by the Taliban's deputy higher education minister, dated to late August, and published by the Independent Persian on Thursday. The letter said the titles were in conflict with principles of Shariah, or Islamic law.A member of the committee reviewing the books later clarified the Taliban's position to BBC Afghan that ""all books authored by women are not allowed to be taught.""The ban is ""a criminal act,"" said Rahela Sidiqi, the director of The Rahela Trust, a Britain-based group that works in Afghanistan to help women and girls access education. ""It not only affects females. It also affects males. It affects society, because those books were part of the curriculums of those universities.""Alongside the book ban, the Taliban has instructed universities to drop 18 courses spanning topics from human rights and democracy to women's studies, and said more than 200 others were under review.""We know in the spring, there was a committee put together by the Ministry of Higher Education to do exactly this,"" said Lauryn Oates, the executive director of Right to Learn Afghanistan, a group based in Canada that supports human rights and education for girls and women in Afghanistan. ""This will give people the false idea that women don't write books, or that women's ideas are not worth consulting.""The list of texts and subjects being stripped, Oates said, shows that ""they really don't like political science or international relations."" But she said it was also inconsistent, adding that much of it appeared to be coming from ""individual members' personal suspicion of the subjects.""In 2022, Afghanistan's higher education commission released a report after a review of school curriculum. Among the ""deficiencies"" outlined were the promotion of foreign cultural norms, ""moral deficiencies"" and the advancement of ""un-Islamic customs and practices, such as music, television, democracy, etc.""Because the Taliban has banned women and girls from secondary and higher education, the latest wave of censorship primarily affects the curricula of male students. But Sidiqi said the step is reflective of a pattern of ""restricting women from every part of life,"" adding that the removal of women's writing reflects an attempt to ""destroy the history of their life.""The move is part of a wider overhaul of higher education, which the Taliban has pursued since returning to power as it seeks to reshape Afghan society to conform to its hard-line ideology. It has fired scores of university professors who it claims break from state values, stifled dissent on university campuses and restructured curricula to augment the amount of religious education students are required to take.Earlier this week, internet shutdowns hit several provinces of Afghanistan to curb ""misuse,"" which had the effect of curtailing the ability to attend online classes and exchange information.","More than 600 books, many of them written by women, are included in a 50-page list of banned works.

Billionaire Richard Branson ignored on NYC streets while promoting ‘Doorbell of Dreams’



New Yorkers too busy to notice Richard Branson with a mic



Billionaire’s rejections spark laughter and praise online

British billionaire Richard Branson, best known as the adventurous founder of the Virgin Group, recently experienced an unusual moment on the bustling streets of New York City. While promoting his latest initiative, Doorbell of Dreams, the 75-year-old tycoon tried stopping passersby for quick interviews, only to be repeatedly ignored. Despite his global fame and media presence, New Yorkers brushed past him as though he were just another man with a microphone or a street performer. The incident, filmed by entrepreneur Simon Squibb, quickly went viral on Instagram, sparking amusement, admiration, and lighthearted commentary online. What began as a fun campaign to encourage everyday dreamers to pitch their business ideas turned into an unexpected lesson in humility, showing that even billionaires are not immune to everyday rejection, unpredictability, public scrutiny, or the realities of life outside celebrity circles.During a lighthearted promotional event, Branson attempted to stop pedestrians for quick interviews. Despite his global reputation, most passersby ignored him, hurrying along as though he were just another stranger with a microphone.The unusual moment, filmed by entrepreneur Simon Squibb, quickly gained traction on Instagram, showing the tycoon facing rejection after rejection.This unexpected moment wasn’t just a publicity stunt; it was part of a campaign to promote “Doorbell of Dreams.” The initiative, launched by Branson in partnership with Squibb’s startup HelpBnk, invites everyday dreamers to pitch their business ideas in under 60 seconds.What makes the concept unique is its accessibility. Through a specially designed video doorbell, aspiring entrepreneurs can present their ideas, with the hope of receiving mentorship, guidance, or even investment. Originally launched in the UK, the project recently expanded to New York, where Virgin Hotels partnered as a venue for participants. The street interviews were meant to spark curiosity among locals and draw attention to the campaign.The video shows Branson politely approaching strangers with the question, “Can I ask you a question?” But instead of engaging, most people brushed him off. One woman walked by without so much as a glance, while another looked briefly at him before rushing away, clearly preoccupied with her own thoughts, errands, and smartphone notifications, unaware of the rare opportunity to interact with a global icon.For a man who has conquered industries from airlines to space travel, being ignored on the sidewalk was a rare and humbling experience, highlighting the ordinary challenges everyone faces. Squibb, amused by the scene, remarked, “A bit of rejection is healthy.” Branson laughed at himself and replied, “I’m not doing too well, am I?” Eventually, a passerby did agree to share his dream, stating his goal was to achieve financial independence, help others, and contribute positively to the world in meaningful, impactful ways.Once uploaded, the clip drew widespread attention on social media. Many users were stunned that a man of Branson’s stature could blend so seamlessly into the crowd. One viewer commented, “Richard Branson getting rejected? Unbelievable!” Another wrote, “Imagine ignoring one of the world’s most inspirational entrepreneurs who’s just asking you a simple question.”The rejections, however, were not seen as embarrassing but rather refreshing. Viewers praised Branson’s good-natured attitude and willingness to step into unfamiliar situations despite his status. A popular comment read, “This is what humility looks like. Sir Richard Branson has every reason to stay in his comfort zone, but he still pushes himself.”","Billionaire Richard Branson ignored on NYC streets while promoting ‘Doorbell of Dreams’ While promoting his latest initiative, the 75-year-old tycoon tried stopping passersby for quick interviews.

Trump’s H-1B crackdown: How the ‘American Dream’ got expensive; costlier than luxury cars & homes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/us-canada-news/trumps-h-1b-crackdown-how-the-american-dream-got-expensive-costlier-than-luxury-cars-homes/articleshow/124039035.cms,"American dream (AI image generated using ChatGPT)

A $5 million dream out of reach



Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH

Trump’s $100,000 H-1B visa fee



Relief and panic among Indian professionals



The American dream has long been seen as a promise of opportunity and prosperity, but fresh analysis shows it is becoming alarmingly expensive. According to Investopedia, achieving the traditional dream now carries a lifetime price tag of more than $5 million — a sum larger than the value of most luxury homes or cars. At the same time, President Donald Trump’s new crackdown on H-1B visas has added another barrier for many foreign professionals seeking to build their lives in the United States.The Investopedia report, published this month, calculated the costs of eight milestones Americans most associate with the dream: retiring comfortably, raising children, buying a home, affording healthcare, owning a car, taking annual holidays, caring for pets, and holding a wedding. Together, those ambitions total a staggering $5,043,323.Retirement alone is priced at $1.6 million, while home ownership averages nearly $958,000 over a lifetime once mortgage interest, taxes, and insurance are included. Raising two children through university adds $876,092, and new cars — assumed to be bought once a decade — account for another $900,346. Even annual holidays, weddings and pets pile up thousands of dollars more.“This is about showing people the real cost of the dream,” Investopedia editor-in-chief Caleb Silver explained. “Homeownership, raising kids, sending them to college — all of these are rising in price across the board.”As costs soar for Americans, the pathway for foreign workers chasing the same dream is also being reshaped. The Trump administration last week confirmed that all new H-1B visa petitions will carry a one-time fee of $100,000 — a dramatic increase from the current costs of $2,000 to $5,000.The US Citizenship and Immigration Services clarified that the charge applies only to new applications, not to renewals or current visa holders, and will first take effect in the next lottery cycle. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers defended the move, saying it would “discourage companies from spamming the system and driving down wages” while prioritising American workers.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick described it bluntly: “Either the person is very valuable to the company and America, or they’re going to depart, and the company is going to hire an American.”The clarification brought some relief to thousands of Indian IT professionals already in the US, who had feared immediate costs to re-enter the country or extend their stay. Still, immigration lawyers warned of chaos for those caught outside America when the proclamation took effect on 21 September, with many scrambling to return before the deadline.Attorney Cyrus Mehta warned that some visa holders could be stranded. “H-1B visa holders who are out of the US on business or vacation will get stuck unless they get in before midnight September 21,” he said.The H-1B programme allows American firms to hire highly skilled foreign workers, with 65,000 visas issued annually under a congressional cap, plus an additional 20,000 for those with advanced US degrees. For decades, it has been the main gateway for Indian and Chinese professionals entering Silicon Valley.","Investopedia calculated the costs of eight milestones Americans most associate with the dream: retiring comfortably, raising children, buying a home, affording healthcare, owning a car, taking annual holidays, caring for pets, and holding a wedding.

H-1B Crackdown! Trump Imposes $100k Fee; Indians & Tech Giants Face Major Hit; Know All About It

A sharp contrast with US visa curbs



What's in it for India?







While US might have an upper hand in tariff war, China seems to be scoring ahead in visa game. Beijing's K visa, which is set to take effect from October 1, is being billed as a strategic tool to attract young foreign science and technology talent. The order will take affect amid the H-1B visa chaos caused by the Donald Trump administration, driving away foreign talent from working in US companies in the long-run.The K visa specifically targets graduates in STEM fields and early-career researchers with at least a bachelor’s degree from recognized institutions worldwide. Unlike China’s existing work visas, it does not require applicants to secure a local employer before applying. Holders will be able to engage in education, research, entrepreneurship, and business activities, making it an especially flexible option for young professionals and innovators, according to a report by China Briefing.The launch comes as the US tightens its immigration policies. Trump’s latest move to restrict the H-1B visa, long a magnet for skilled foreign workers, mostly Indian, has fueled concerns among international students and professionals.China, by contrast, is sending the message: qualified talent is welcome here.In fact, US categorically said that the motive behind its H-1B move was driven by cheap ""foreign labour"" replacing American workers in several fields including STEM.""Unemployment among recent computer science graduates has reached 6.1 per cent and 7.5 per cent for computer engineering graduates - more than double the rates for biology or art history majors. The number of foreign STEM workers in the United States has more than doubled between 2000 and 2019, while overall STEM employment only increased 44.5 per cent during that time,"" it said.In contrast, China's K visa specifically targets young foreign science and technology professionals, and is seen as a part of Beijing’s broader push to lower barriers for global talent and channel their skills into China’s innovation drive.US government figures show that Indians account for over 70% of the 85,000 H-1B visas granted annually, with many beneficiaries having spent decades building their lives and careers in America. The H-1B visa move would act as a deterrent for the future generations looking to go out of the country for work.With India-China relations showing signs of easing through trade and border dialogues, and both nations facing common trade friction with the US over Russian oil purchases, Indian professionals may now see new opportunities emerging in the market next door.","Beijing's K visa, which is set to take effect from October 1, is being billed as a strategic tool to attract young foreign science and technology talent.

MANILA: More than 10,000 evacuees sheltered in schools and evacuation centres in the Philippines on Monday as heavy rains and gale-force winds from Super Typhoon Ragasa lashed the country's far north.The typhoon, which is gaining strength as it proceeds on a collision course with southern China, was expected to make landfall over the Philippines' Babuyan Islands around midday.The sparsely populated islands lie about 740 kilometres (460 miles) south of Taiwan, where smaller-scale evacuations were also underway.As of 11:00 am (0300 GMT), maximum sustained winds of 215 kilometres per hour were reported at the storm's center, with gusts reaching up to 265 kph as it moved westward towards the Babuyans, the national weather service said.""I woke up because of the strong wind. It was hitting the windows, and it sounded like a machine that was switched on,"" said Tirso Tugagao, a resident of Aparri, a coastal town in northern Cagayan province.""I'm seeing from my house here that the high waves are crashing onto the shore,"" the 45-year-old teacher said. ""I pray everyone will be safe.""Cagayan disaster chief Rueli Rapsing told AFP that his team was prepared for ""the worst"".President Ferdinand Marcos said on Facebook he was closely monitoring the situation and that all government agencies were ""on alert to give help anywhere and whenever needed"".In Taiwan, the state weather service predicted a chance of ""extremely torrential rain"" in the country's east.""Its storm radius is quite large, about 320 (kilometres). Although the typhoon's center is still some distance away, its wide, strong wind field and outer circulation are already affecting parts of Taiwan.""James Wu, a local fire department officer, told AFP that evacuations were ongoing in mountainous areas near Pingtung.""What worries us more is that the damage could be similar to what happened during Typhoon Koinu two years ago,"" he added, describing a storm that saw utility poles collapse and sheet-metal roofs sent flying into the air.Schools and government offices were closed Monday in the Manila region and across 29 Philippine provinces in anticipation of heavy rainfall.Government weather specialist John Grender Almario said Sunday that ""severe flooding and landslides"" could be expected in the northern areas of the main island Luzon.The threat of flooding from Ragasa comes just a day after thousands of Filipinos took to the streets to protest a growing corruption scandal involving flood control projects that were shabbily constructed or never completed.The Philippines is the first major landmass facing the Pacific cyclone belt, and the archipelago is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year, putting millions of people in disaster-prone areas in a state of constant poverty.Scientists warn that storms are becoming more powerful as the world warms due to the effects of human-driven climate change.","More than 10,000 evacuees sheltered in schools and evacuation centres in the Philippines.

US Vice-President JD Vance has said that national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk , warning that such behaviour fuels further political violence.Speaking as guest host of The Charlie Kirk Show on Monday, Vance said: “Call them out, and hell, call their employer. We don't believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility.”The vice-president took over presenting duties from his ceremonial office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, with the programme livestreamed into the White House press briefing room. It was the first episode of the podcast since Kirk, 31, was fatally shot in the neck while moderating a debate at Utah Valley University last week.Vance, who flew Kirk’s body home to Arizona aboard Air Force Two, said he was “filling in for somebody who cannot be filled in for”. He recounted conversations with Kirk’s widow Erika, describing him as “a kind, loving husband”, and admitted her words had inspired him to “be a better husband and… a better father”.In his remarks, Vance directly challenged those making light of Kirk’s assassination. “There is no unity with the people who celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination,” he said.“There is no unity with someone who lies about what Charlie Kirk said in order to excuse his murder… And there is no unity with the people who fund these articles, who pay the salaries of these terrorist sympathisers who argue that Charlie Kirk, a loving husband and father, deserved a shot to the neck because he spoke words with which they disagree. ”He added: “I’m desperate for our country to be united in condemnation of the actions and the ideas that killed my friend. I want it so badly that I will tell you a difficult truth. We can only have it with people who acknowledge that political violence is unacceptable.”Other Republicans have echoed calls for accountability.

The Trucial States and British Control: Foundations of UAE National Day





1820–1853: A series of treaties were signed between Britain and the ruling sheikhs, starting with the defeat of the Qawasim maritime force. These agreements aimed to curb maritime conflict, prohibit the construction of warships or coastal fortifications, and maintain peace at sea.

1853: The Perpetual Maritime Truce formalized an indefinite end to hostilities at sea. Britain limited its role to maritime security without interfering in the internal governance of the emirates.

1892: The Exclusive Agreements prohibited the Trucial States from engaging with foreign powers without British approval. In exchange, the UK pledged military protection against external threats.



Path to federation: Early steps toward UAE National Day





February 18, 1968: Sheikh Zayed met with Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum of Dubai at Al Samha . They agreed to unite their emirates and invite others to join, forming the first step toward regional federation — the Union Accord.



They agreed to collaborate on foreign affairs, defense, security, social services, and immigration policy. Judicial and internal governance would remain under individual emirate control.

The proposed Federation of the Arab Emirates was based on 11 foundational principles including mutual respect for sovereignty, unified foreign policy, and joint developmental goals. A Supreme Council was to be established to oversee federal legislation and policy, with decisions requiring unanimous consent.

December 2, 1971: The United Arab Emirates was officially declared an independent, sovereign state.



A Provisional Constitution was adopted. Abu Dhabi was designated as the temporary capital. Sheikh Zayed was elected as the first President; Sheikh Rashid became Vice-President, both for a five-year term. The Federal National Council (FNC) was established with 34 seats:



8 each for Abu Dhabi and Dubai 6 for Sharjah 4 each for Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Fujairah Ras Al Khaimah was allocated 6 seats should it choose to join later.

1981: Co-founded the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.





December 2 marks a pivotal moment in the history of the United Arab Emirates — the day it became an independent, sovereign nation in 1971. But the choice of this date was not symbolic alone; it was the culmination of decades of treaties, negotiations, British withdrawal, and a shared vision among the region's leaders. This is the detailed story of how the UAE came to be, why December 2 became its National Day, and the constitutional foundations that shaped the Federation.The territory that is now the UAE was historically known as the Trucial States, a group of independent emirates along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf. British involvement in the region began in the early 19th century:British control over the region intensified in the mid-20th century, largely driven by oil exploration and geopolitical interests. They controlled oil concession grants and intervened in territorial disputes to secure exploration zones, including helping define inter-emirate boundaries in the 1950s.However, by 1968, economic constraints pushed the UK to announce a full military and political withdrawal from the Gulf by end of 1971. This move set off a chain of political activity among the Trucial States’ rulers to form a new, self-governed entity before the British departure.The initiative to form a unified state began with Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who became Ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966. Seeing the necessity of regional cooperation, he envisioned a federation that could unify resources and political will.Despite this progress, Bahrain and Qatar opted for independent statehood in August and September 1971, respectively.As the British exit approached, six emirates — Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Fujairah — committed to forming a new union.The Supreme Council of Rulers, composed of the Rulers of each emirate, became the highest federal authority. Decisions would require a majority vote — with both Abu Dhabi and Dubai needed to be part of the majority for any decision to pass.Article 138 specifically enabled the unification of the UAE Armed Forces under federal command, ensuring centralized defense policy and organization.Several shared factors helped facilitate a smooth transition to federation:Immediately after its formation, the UAE began establishing itself as a credible state in the international community:","December 2 marks the UAE’s formation, uniting seven emirates into a strong, independent federation.

D4vd’s subreddit locked: Singer accused of moderating posts on Celeste Rivas’s death; fans claim critical posts deleted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/d4vds-subreddit-locked-singer-accused-of-moderating-posts-on-celeste-rivass-death-fans-claim-critical-posts-deleted/articleshow/124060426.cms,"



Singer D4vd is facing online backlash after Redditors accused him of moderating his own subreddit and allegedly deleting posts critical of him amid the police investigation into the death of 15-year-old Celeste Rivas, Fox11 reported.Users noticed unusual activity on the subreddit, claiming posts raising concerns about the case and the singer’s lyrics were removed. Because D4vd was listed as the sole moderator, Redditors accused him of controlling the narrative to portray himself positively.Hours later, the subreddit was locked, preventing users from posting. Many alleged that D4vd left the subreddit entirely, which disables further posts unless members request to join. Currently, no one is listed on the moderator list.The controversy follows a statement by someone claiming to moderate D4vd’s Discord server and Twitch channel, who said they were unaware of Rivas’ true age or that she was a missing person. “Based on what was shared in D4vd's Twitch streams and from Rivas' role in the Discord server, we believed she was around 18 or 19 years old,” the moderator said. The individual added that they had minimal contact with D4vd or his management.TMZ noted that the moderator is not employed by Twitch and the statement was not on behalf of the platform.The case centers on the discovery of Rivas’ dismembered remains on September 8 in D4vd’s Tesla, a day after her 15th birthday. Police said the body was found wrapped in a bag inside the vehicle’s trunk after employees at Hollywood Tow reported a strong odor. Rivas had been reported missing on April 5, 2024, from Lake Elsinore.Following the discovery, D4vd canceled his world tour shows, including a Seattle performance. He has been cooperating with authorities and a search warrant executed at a Hollywood Hills home linked to him resulted in the seizure of a computer and other evidence. LAPD has not named D4vd a suspect, and the exact circumstances of Rivas’ death remain unclear.D4vd was recently dropped by brands Crocs and Hollister following his connection to the investigation. Authorities continue to probe the case, and no official link has been established between the singer’s music and the teen’s death.","Singer D4vd is facing online backlash after Redditors accused him of moderating his own subreddit and allegedly deleting posts critical of him.

The science: Mixed and inconclusive



Autism, vaccines and politics



What autism research really shows



Dr Trump?







US President Donald Trump has reignited controversy in the medical community by urging pregnant people to avoid Tylenol over an alleged link to autism, despite the absence of scientific consensus. Speaking at a White House event on Monday, he called on mothers-to-be to “tough it out” rather than take acetaminophen, the main ingredient in Tylenol, and raised doubts over standard childhood vaccines.His remarks drew swift condemnation from doctors, medical groups and researchers, who warned that the advice could frighten pregnant women, undermine confidence in vaccines, and push people towards unsafe decisions.Trump, who has long entertained fringe health theories, pressed his case in increasingly urgent tones, declaring: “Taking Tylenol is not good” and urging pregnant women to “fight like hell not to take it.” He added that only an “extremely high fever” could justify its use.Medical organisations quickly pushed back. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has long cited acetaminophen as one of the safest painkillers during pregnancy.Its president, Dr Steven Fleischman, warned that Trump’s claims would terrify mothers-to-be. “I don't want you going back and looking and saying to yourself, ‘I shouldn’t have done this, I shouldn't have done that.’ It's nothing you did. It really is not,” he told news agency AP. “Not treating the fever probably has more adverse effects that you need to worry about than taking the medication.”Acetaminophen—known in the UK as paracetamol—is a widely used pain reliever and fever reducer, found in many over-the-counter and prescription medicines.It works by raising the body’s pain threshold, helping relieve minor aches and pains, and by lowering fever through aiding heat loss. Common uses include treating headaches, backaches, arthritis, toothache, muscle aches, and period pain.Some studies have suggested a possible association between prenatal acetaminophen use and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A Mount Sinai-led review published in BMC Environmental Health this year examined 46 studies covering more than 100,000 participants. It concluded that “higher-quality studies are more likely to show a link” and warned that “even a small increase in risk could have major public health implications. ” Researchers stressed that acetaminophen can cross the placental barrier and may interfere with foetal brain development through oxidative stress or hormonal disruption.“Pregnant women should not stop taking medication without consulting their doctors,” said Dr Didier Prada of Mount Sinai. “Untreated pain or fever can also harm the baby. Our study highlights the importance of discussing the safest approach with health care providers.”Another large-scale analysis, however, painted a very different picture. A Swedish cohort study of 2.48 million children published in JAMA found no evidence that acetaminophen use in pregnancy was associated with autism, ADHD or intellectual disability once sibling-controlled analyses were applied. The authors concluded that earlier findings may have been influenced by “familial confounding” rather than a direct causal link.The US Food and Drug Administration struck a cautious tone, advising physicians that “a causal relationship has not been established” and noting the presence of contrary evidence in the scientific literature. Tylenol maker Kenvue defended the drug, saying: “We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.”Trump’s remarks did not stop at Tylenol. He repeated talking points long associated with the anti-vaccine movement, raising doubts about the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot and calling for delays to hepatitis B vaccination in newborns. “Don’t let them pump your baby up with the largest pile of stuff you’ve ever seen in your life,” he said, before dramatically likening paediatric vaccines to doses “pumping into a horse. ”Medical experts have long debunked any connection between vaccines and autism. “Studies have repeatedly found no credible link between life-saving childhood vaccines and autism,” said Dr Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. She warned that “any effort to misrepresent sound, strong science poses a threat to the health of children.”Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who has spent decades pushing theories about vaccines and autism, stood alongside Trump. Kennedy promoted leucovorin, a folate-based drug already used for chemotherapy side effects, as an “exciting therapy” for some children with autism. The FDA confirmed it had approved the tablet form for children with cerebral folate deficiency but emphasised that evidence for autism treatment remains preliminary.According to the Associated Press, autism is a developmental condition rooted largely in genetics. Hundreds of genes have been linked to the disorder, with environmental factors such as parental age, preterm birth or maternal infections during pregnancy also playing a role. Rates of diagnosis have risen sharply over the past two decades — from 1 in 150 children in the early 2000s to about 1 in 31 today — largely because of broader definitions, improved screening and greater awareness.“There is no single cause,” said Boston University expert Helen Tager-Flusberg. “Different combinations of genes and other factors can all affect how a foetal brain develops.”That complexity underscores why Trump’s simplistic linkage between Tylenol, vaccines and autism struck many scientists as reckless. As Dr Paul Offit of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia put it: “No doubt children will suffer” from such claims.The presentation echoed Trump's briefings during the Covid-19 pandemic, when President Trump revisited debunked medical claims with familiar bravado.“I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning?” Trump asked in April 2020. “As you see, it gets in the lungs, it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that.”Despite acknowledging, “I’m just making these statements from me,” Trump claimed he'd consulted “many doctors.” Scientists condemned the event, calling it misinformation-laden and dangerous.","US President Donald Trump has reignited controversy by urging pregnant people to avoid Tylenol over an alleged link to autism.

Did Amazon trick customers into Prime? A court trial begins today in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-amazon-trick-customers-into-prime-a-court-trial-begins-today-in-us/articleshow/124059450.cms,"



SEATTLE: A trial in federal court in Seattle set to begin this week will cut to the heart of how Amazon defines itself as a champion for the hundreds of millions of consumers who use its online shopping service.The Federal Trade Commission claims, in a lawsuit filed two years ago, that Amazon tricked tens of millions of people into signing up for its Prime membership program, and then made it hard for customers to cancel when they wanted out. “Amazon was aware for years that it was taking consumers’ money without their consent, yet chose to do nothing about it,” the FTC wrote in a recent court filing.Amazon, which denies those claims, hopes a jury will believe that customers signed up for Prime simply because they thought it was a good deal. “The way Amazon drives Prime subscribers is by making the service useful and valuable,” Mark Blafkin, an Amazon spokesperson, said in a statement. “And our approach works — Prime, with hundreds of millions of members, is among the highest performing subscription programs of any kind, as measured by renewal rates and customer satisfaction. ”Though less sweeping than the FTC’s antitrust case against Amazon, the lawsuit targets the company for the way it runs a popular subscription program central to its business and ubiquitous in the lives of many of its customers.“The TrumpVance FTC intends to secure justice for Americans harmed by Amazon’s practices,” Joe Simonson, an FTC spokesperson, said in a statement. “We’re looking forward to the trial.”Since Prime was introduced two decades ago, it has grown into what the FTC called “the world’s largest subscription service.” Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, has long called it a “pillar” of the company. It costs $139 per year or $14.99 a month, and includes fast shipping, video streaming, discounts at Whole Foods, which Amazon owns, and other perks.“We want Prime to be such a good value, you would be irresponsible not to be a member,” Bezos wrote in 2016.Judge John H Chun of the US District Court for the Western District of Washington ruled last week that at least two senior executives, Neil Lindsay and Jamil Ghani, would be considered personally liable if a jury finds that Amazon violated the law. Amazon said the executives acted properly and put customers first.Jury selection was likely to begin Monday, with opening arguments starting Tuesday. The case is set to last for about a month. An estimated 200 million people in the US use Prime to shop on Amazon.","The Federal Trade Commission claims that Amazon tricked tens of millions of people into signing up for its Prime membership program.

Charlie Kirk assassination: Donald Trump signs order labelling Antifa as ‘domestic terrorist organisation’; legality in question,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/charlie-kirk-assassination-donald-trump-signs-order-labelling-antifa-as-domestic-terrorist-organisation-legality-in-question/articleshow/124059000.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)





US President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order designating Antifa as a “domestic terrorist organisation”, a move that immediately raised questions over its legality and enforcement.The order came in the wake of the assassination of MAGA activist Charlie Kirk, although officials have not established a link between the suspect and the left-wing movement, as per BBC.The White House fact sheet argued that Antifa “has a long history of terrorising our communities,” citing incidents involving violence against law enforcement and pro-Trump events.Trump’s order directs all federal agencies to “investigate, disrupt, and dismantle any and all illegal operations” linked to Antifa or its supporters, according to CBS News.On his Truth Social platform, Trump called the group a “sick, dangerous, radical left disaster” and pledged that it would be “thoroughly investigated”.Antifa — short for anti-fascist — is not a formal organisation but a decentralised movement of loosely affiliated activists opposing neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other far-right groups.The Congressional Research Service has described it as “independent, radical, like-minded groups and individuals” lacking a central leadership structure or shared ideology, as per news agency AP.According to scholars, its activists range from anarchists and communists to hardline socialists, and some cells have engaged in violent confrontations. University of Pittsburgh professor Michael Kenney was quoted by CBS News as saying, “There’s tremendous variation inside that movement, even on issues like political violence.”Trump has long targeted Antifa, previously blaming it for unrest during protests in his first term, particularly after the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Then-Attorney General William Barr at the time also cited “antifa-like tactics” by agitators during demonstrations.Trump revived the designation push after Kirk’s killing on September 10, saying in the Oval Office last week that he would pursue a domestic terrorism label if it had the support of his Cabinet.Legal experts stress, however, that the US president does not have statutory authority to designate domestic groups as terrorist organisations. “You can’t prosecute an ideology,” said Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, as cited by CBS News.While foreign terrorist organisations can be formally listed, no equivalent domestic mechanism exists due to First Amendment protections. Analysts note the administration may instead prioritise Antifa-related cases within federal law enforcement, according to AP.The suspect in Kirk’s killing, Tyler Robinson, has been described by authorities as having developed a “leftist ideology” and resentment of Kirk’s views. But investigators have not presented evidence linking Robinson to Antifa.Antifa’s roots trace back to US anti-fascist groups confronting neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan in the 1980s, with the term itself deriving from the German “antifaschistisch.” It became more visible after Trump’s election in 2016 and the violent clashes in Charlottesville in 2017, where its activists opposed far-right demonstrators.Despite the executive order, experts say the designation is largely symbolic. Without a legal framework to enforce it, the move may serve more as a political signal of Trump’s campaign against what he calls “radical left” violence rather than a measure with immediate legal effect.","US President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order designating Antifa as a ‘domestic terrorist organisation’ The order came in the wake of the assassination of MAGA activist Charlie Kirk, although officials have not established a link between the suspect and the left-wing movement.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124059012,imgsize-909030,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-63.jpg"

Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump at his Florida golf course last year, rested his case on Monday without taking the witness stand. Representing himself, Routh concluded his defense after questioning a firearms expert and two character witnesses.US District Judge Aileen Cannon asked whether he wished to testify, to which Routh replied, ""I will not testify."" Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday morning, followed by jury deliberations.Prosecutors allege that Routh spent weeks plotting the attack before aiming a rifle from behind shrubbery at Trump on September 15, 2024, at the Mar-a-Lago Club in West Palm Beach. A Secret Service agent testified he spotted Routh before Trump came into view, prompting the agent to open fire and forcing Routh to drop his weapon and flee.On Monday, firearms expert and former US Marines sniper Michael McClay testified that Routh’s hiding spot provided ""observation of the Hole 6 green."" He confirmed the rifle worked during testing but noted the second round jammed, raising doubts about its ability to fire multiple shots. He also said the scope recovered from the scene was improperly mounted.The two character witnesses described Routh as a peaceful man, though both admitted under cross-examination they had not seen him in years.Routh has pleaded not guilty to attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer, and multiple firearms violations. Prosecutors rested their case Friday after presenting testimony from 38 witnesses over seven days.Judge Cannon had initially set aside three weeks for the trial, but Routh’s short cross-examinations and limited defense presentation have sped up proceedings.The Florida case comes weeks after Trump survived an earlier assassination attempt in Pennsylvania, where a gunman fired eight shots, grazing Trump’s ear before being killed by Secret Service.Routh, a former North Carolina construction worker who later moved to Hawaii, has a history of brushes with law enforcement. He previously faced charges for weapons possession, stolen property, and attempts to recruit fighters for conflicts overseas. He has also pleaded not guilty to separate state charges of terrorism and attempted murder.","Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump at his Florida golf course last year, rested his case on Monday.

US President Donald Trump on Monday cautioned pregnant individuals against using Tylenol, citing an unsubstantiated link to autism, while also advocating for major changes to standard infant vaccination schedules.The White House’s push to reshape healthcare in the United States has sparked concern among medical and scientific professionals over the administration’s proposals.Healthcare practitioners have long endorsed acetaminophen as one of the safest pain relief options during pregnancy, noting that untreated fever and pain can pose risks to both mother and foetus.Trump stated firmly, “Taking Tylenol is not good.” “For this reason, they are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary. That's for instance, in cases of extremely high fever that you feel you can't tough it out,” he added.At the press conference, Trump also proposed significant changes to infant vaccination schedules, claiming without evidence that vaccinating newborns against Hepatitis B—a severe and highly infectious disease—is unnecessary.Echoing anti-vaccination rhetoric, Trump said, “I would say, wait until the baby is 12 years old and formed.”Medical experts warn that this contradicts decades of evidence showing that newborn vaccination within 24 hours of birth is essential to prevent maternal transmission of Hepatitis B, a liver-damaging and potentially carcinogenic disease.The announcement followed a recent meeting of a special advisory panel appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which refrained from endorsing a one-month delay for the initial Hepatitis B vaccination. The panel’s decision to continue discussions provided temporary reassurance to public health experts concerned about the consequences of postponing the vaccine.In a related move, the US pharmaceutical regulator approved the drug leucovorin for the treatment of autism.The Food and Drug Administration said in the US Federal Register that it had approved leucovorin, a concentrated form of folic acid. Folic acid is commonly given to expectant mothers to support healthy fetal development.Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the administration’s controversial health chief, has promoted leucovorin as an “exciting therapy” for children with autism, though experts caution that its efficacy for autism remains under investigation.","US President Donald Trump on Monday cautioned pregnant individuals against using Tylenol, citing an unsubstantiated link to autism.

All upcoming shows of D4vd were canceled as the musician, whose original name is David Anthony Burke, came under investigation following the discovery of a teen's body from his car in Los Angeles. The teen, identified as Celeste Rivas Hernandez, was missing since 2024 and her family claimed that she was in a relationship with someone named David.Same name, D4vd's car, matching tattoos are the unofficial factors linking the 20-year-old musician with a teen but police are looking for solid evidence of their connection and searched D4vd's rented apartment.While cops said D4vd is cooperating in the investigation, speculations are rife about his whereabouts, as he's a celebrity, a regular online streamer but has not been seen in public. As all his upcoming shows have been canceled and he has disappeared from the public view, questions are being raised whether D4vd has fled.""A TikToker claims they drove past D4vd’s Hollywood home last night, where lights were on and voices could be heard.D4vd remains under investigation. The public is confused as to why he hasn’t been arrested yet,"" a purported video of D4vd's house went viral.LAPD has remained tight-lipped about the progress of the investigation but confirmed that they found several pieces of evidence from the house search. It is not yet known how long Celeste had been dead for as when the police discovered the body, it was already rotting. The cause of Celeste's death has not been announced yet.Several theories are doing the rounds as many believe Celeste was pregnant and that's why she was killed. Another viral TikTok theory is that D4vd had been in touch with two different girls with the same name, Celeste etc.","All upcoming shows of D4vd were canceled as the musician, whose original name is David Anthony Burke, came under investigation following the discovery of a teen's body from his car in Los Angeles.

From US to Russia: Tara Reade granted citizenship by Vladimir Putin; accused Joe Biden of sexual assault in 1990s,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-us-to-russia-tara-reade-granted-citizenship-by-vladimir-putin-accused-joe-biden-of-sexual-assault-in-1990s/articleshow/124054820.cms,"Tara Reade (Image/X) and former President Joe Biden (PTI image)





Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday granted Russian citizenship to Tara Reade, the American woman who accused former US President Joe Biden of sexually assaulting her in the 1990s.A decree published on Russia’s official legal information portal confirmed that “McCabe Alexandra Tara, born February 26, 1964,” has been made a Russian citizen. Reade, who also goes by Alexandra McCabe, changed her name in 1998, reportedly to protect herself from an abusive former husband.Reade first made headlines in 2020, claiming that Biden sexually assaulted her in a congressional corridor in 1993, when he was serving as a senator and she was working in his office.Biden firmly denied the allegations, but the claims drew significant attention during his election campaign against President Donald Trump 's first term.Trump himself has faced multiple accusations of sexual misconduct, including harassment and assault. He returned to power in 2025.Investigations into Reade’s account highlighted inconsistencies, including the absence of any record of the complaint she said she had filed with Congress at the time, news agency AFP reported.In May 2023, Reade revealed in an interview with Russian state media outlet Sputnik that she intended to seek Russian citizenship.Speaking from Moscow, she said she feared for her safety in the United States and had decided to remain in Russia.The following year, in July 2024, she announced on social media platform X that she was preparing to return to the US to file a formal complaint against former President Biden. The announcement came just days before the ailing president withdrew from his re-election bid.","Tara Reade accused former US President Joe Biden of sexually assaulting her in the 1990s.

More Than 150,000 Evacuated in Pakistan Punjab After India’s Flood Alert

Waters recede, but threat not over

Fields and cattle lost





Even as floodwaters began to recede in parts of south Punjab, the scale of destruction remains staggering, nearly 2.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes and at least 101 lives have been lost, the Dawn reported.The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has called the ongoing evacuation and relief drive one of the largest in recent memory. More than 1,500 boats were deployed to rescue stranded families, with 12,427 people evacuated from villages along the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers.Multan, Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan districts bore the brunt of the floods. Entire villages were submerged — including the union council of Lati Mari in Alipur tehsil, home to 40,000 people.“Nearly 15,000 people from our basti had to leave on their own as water rose,” said Syed Kausar Shah, a local resident. “Homes and crops were destroyed, and people escaped on a hired boat. Some now live in relief camps, others under the open sky.” He added that two villagers drowned while attempting to flee.Officials declared Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur tehsils safe after a major flood wave passed through Head Panjnad.Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu confirmed that 100,000 people had been evacuated from Jalalpur Pirwala alone in three days.Breaches in Shujabad and Jalalpur Pirwala are now being filled, while helicopters and drones drop food and medicine into cut-off areas. Boats continue to ferry supplies into rural belts.At a press briefing in Bahawalpur, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Panjnad Headworks still faced a “high flood” but levels had dropped from 700,000 cusecs earlier this week to 575,000 cusecs on Saturday. By evening, the Flood Forecasting Division reported further decline to 492,695 cusecs.“There is no threat to Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur cities,” Kathia assured, adding that water in Bahawalpur would also recede within 24 hours. He called the scale of evacuation “historic,” stressing that Multan could have faced forced evacuations if operations were delayed.According to official data, 4,447 mouzas across 28 districts have been inundated. Alongside the mass displacement of people, more than 2.19 million cattle were rescued and shifted to higher ground.For now, the rivers appear to be calming, the Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala was recorded at 95,000 cusecs, categorised as medium flood.

Taliban’s Fresh Threat To US President After Trump Warns Afghanistan Again

'Dark days' ahead



End of online education for girls?







Concerns are growing in Afghanistan over tightening Taliban restrictions on fiber-optic internet access.The war-torn nation's northern Balkh province confirmed a fiber-optic internet shutdown on Tuesday after Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada imposed a complete ban on the technology.There are reports of severe disruption in other parts of the country, including the northern provinces of Kunduz, Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar.The Taliban leadership has not provided an official explanation, however a spokesperson for the governor of Balkh stated that the decision was taken to ""prevent immorality."" But many experts suspect the Islamic fundamentalist group wants to block critical content and preempt any protests.Data from London-based internet monitor NetBlocks show that internet usage in the affected provinces has dropped dramatically.""The disruption of the internet marks the beginning of widespread repression across Afghanistan,"" security expert Bismillah Taban told DW. ""The Taliban could expand their crackdown and evade international oversight. This is a very serious concern.""So far, mobile internet has not been affected. Traders and business owners are warning of severe consequences if this access is also restricted.In addition, prepaid cards are very expensive, and mobile internet is comparatively slow. Fiber-optic internet is primarily used by companies, banks, and government agencies.""Currently, 80% of business is conducted online. We are already facing major challenges. Don't widen the gap between the people and the government any further,"" urged Khan Jan Alokozai, vice president of the Afghan Chamber of Commerce, on X.Sayed Ahmad Shah Sadaat, who served as Afghanistan's education minister from 2016 to 2018, also warned of the potential consequences.""The fiber-optic network, which people rely on for online education, commerce, and the banking system, will negatively impact all areas of life. The Taliban have no alternative internet system. If the network is cut off, Afghanistan faces a dark time ahead,"" she told DW.""Government agencies and institutions such as passport and registration offices, customs offices, banks, and media houses are particularly affected, as they rely on fiber-optic connections. Their failure puts additional pressure on central administrative structures.""International media organisations are also sounding the alarm.""Banning broadband internet is an unprecedented escalation of censorship that will undermine journalists' work and the public's right to information,"" said Beh Lih Yi, regional director of the committee to protect journalists.""The Taliban should end their cycle of repression and unconditionally restore internet access, which is an essential tool for news gathering.""For girls and women, the decision could have especially serious consequences. After being banned from attending schools and universities, many turned to online education as their only means of continuing their studies.""My students had Wi-Fi, but now it no longer works,"" said Afghan filmmaker Sahraa Karimi, who teaches her students from abroad. ""I read in the news that the Taliban have shut down the internet in many cities. I'm heartbroken, how am I supposed to teach the girls now?""Activists inside Afghanistan are also voicing their concerns.""Shutting down the internet is the final step toward backwardness, ignorance, and destruction,"" one woman said in a video message to DW.Another called it ""a direct attack on the dignity, freedom, and future of a nation.""""When the Taliban cut off the internet, it's not just a technical issue,"" warned Pashtana Durrani, founder of the online school network LEARN Afghanistan. ""It's an attack on the country's future.""For many students, she said, the internet is their last link to teachers and lessons.

Together since the 1960s, they married in Kabul in 1970.""Two British nationals named Peter and Barbara Reynolds, who had violated the laws of Afghanistan, were released from custody today following the judicial process,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said on social media.He added that the government ""does not view the matters of citizens from a political or transactional angle"".“God is good, as they say in Afghanistan,” Barbie Reynolds said after she arrived at Kabul International Airport to fly out of the country.The Reynolds’ family members in the U.K. repeatedly called for the couple’s release, saying they were being mistreated and held on undisclosed charges. While the Taliban rejected the abuse allegations, they have never explained what prompted their detention, AP reported.“This is a moment of immense joy for our family, and we are deeply thankful to everyone who played a role in securing their release,” the family said in a statement after their release, mentioning Qatar and the British governments.“This experience has reminded us of the power of diplomacy, empathy, and international co-operation. While the road to recovery will be long as our parents regain their health and spend time with their family, today is a day of tremendous joy and relief.”Their son Jonathan told Sky News in April his parents had ""never heard one accusation or one charge"". He said the British govt had offered to evacuate them when the Taliban took over, to which they replied: ""Why would we leave these people in their darkest hour?Qatar, an energy-rich nation on the Arabian Peninsula that mediated talks between the U.S. and the Taliban before the American withdrawal, assisted in releasing the Reynolds couple from Afghanistan, a diplomat said. The couple left Afghanistan on Friday. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations involved in the case.Earlier this month, the Taliban said they had reached an agreement with US envoys on a prisoner exchange as part of an effort to normalise relations. The meeting came after the Taliban in March released US citizen George Glezmann, who was abducted while travelling through Afghanistan as a tourist. Afghanistan remains a focus of US President Donald Trump. On Thursday, while visiting the UK, Trump suggested that he was working to reestablish a US presence at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan.

Nepal’s deposed prime minister K P Sharma Oli has denied that his government ordered security forces to open fire during the September 8 “Gen Z” protests that left at least 19 people dead.“The government didn’t order to shoot at the demonstrators,” the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) chairman said in a Constitution Day message on Friday. “The bullets were fired at the protesters from automatic guns, which were not possessed by the police personnel, and this must be investigated upon.”Oli alleged that “infiltrating conspirators” had turned the peaceful demonstrations violent. “The infiltrating conspirators turned the agitation violent, and this way our youths were killed,” he said, while demanding a formal inquiry into the incident.The two-day protests against alleged corruption and a ban on social media left at least 72 people dead, including three policemen. Oli resigned on September 9, a day after hundreds of protesters stormed his office demanding accountability for the deaths.In a Facebook post, Oli also pointed to the arson attacks that followed his resignation, claiming that government buildings, the Supreme Court, and Nepal’s national map were set ablaze. “I don’t want to elaborate on the conspiracies behind these incidents, time will speak for itself,” he added.Recalling the challenges Nepal faced during the promulgation of its Constitution, Oli urged unity across generations. “All generations of Nepalis must unite, to confront the assault on our sovereignty and to defend our Constitution,” he said.","Deposed PM KP Oli denies that his government ordered security forces to open fire during the September 8 protests.

Today is Constitution Day — the day the Nepali people, after 70 years of struggle, saw the constitution enacted by the

Constituent Assembly

they themselves had elected. It is the day when a democratic republic, a federal inclusive system, and the rights of the people were established.

The challenges we faced while drafting this constitution are still fresh in your memory. Even overcoming blockades and threats to the country’s

sovereignty

, the constitution was promulgated. Therefore, Nepal’s constitution is a blueprint for the future that the Nepali people have written for themselves.

After the constitution was enacted, we were building transport structures connecting north and south to make the landlocked country accessible and resilient against blockades. We had also signed transport agreements with our northern neighbor and were expanding the strength of our sovereignty. We were laying the foundations for development structures and the economy was growing steadily.

Last week, during what was supposed to be a peaceful Jan Gatha (Jan-G) protest, intruders entered — as the organizers themselves had claimed. Conspirators who infiltrated caused violence, resulting in the deaths of our youth. The government had not ordered the demonstrators to be fired upon. The investigation must determine how automatic weapons, which the police did not possess, were used. I again express my grief over the incident, pay tribute to the deceased youth, and wish speedy recovery to the injured.

At this moment, our constitution is under a major attack. After my resignation from the position of Prime Minister, Singha Durbar was set on fire — the map of Nepal was burned, and the national symbol was targeted for erasure. Offices of public representatives, courts, business institutions, political party offices, the homes of leaders and activists, and personal property were systematically destroyed.

I will not speak much today about the

conspiracy

behind this; time itself will reveal many truths. Was our country truly being destroyed, or was anger being stirred up merely through fabricated narratives of destruction? Our new generation will realize this for themselves. Society that once criticized the crowds at airports will, in time, understand what it means when external movement is blocked. Our new generation will come to understand all of this.

However, this is something that must be understood now; if not, our country’s sovereignty will exist only in history.

Our youth must have read the history of Bhim Malla’s death sentence. Bhim Malla, after expanding the country’s borders and returning, was executed upon his return, leaving only regret as the option. Outcomes of discontent fueled beyond reality only serve as lessons in regret, and such regret will deepen the memory of the nation being built.

All Nepalis across generations must unite — to face attacks on our sovereignty and defend our constitution. Sovereignty is our existence, and the constitution is the armor of our freedom. Only our unity can lift and protect the country from this unimaginable crisis.

I appeal to everyone —

Let us protect the constitution, let us defend our sovereignty.

Donald Trump's H-1B Visa Fee Hike Shocks Tech Giants and Indians, Experts Call The Move 'Regressive'

Global talent visa



MAGA chief’s $100,000 hike shakes H-1B dream







Britain is weighing plans to scrap visa fees for the world’s best scientists, academics and digital experts, reports Financial Times.The move is aimed at boosting growth and positioning the UK as a magnet for global talent.The debate comes just as the United States under Donald Trump has raised the fee for an H-1B visa to $100,000.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has set up a “global talent task force” to explore reforms, with officials in Number 10, the PM's office at Downing Street, and the Treasury discussing options to make it easier and cheaper for high-level professionals to settle in the country. One proposal is to abolish visa charges for people with exceptional achievements.“We’re talking about the sort of people who have attended the world’s top five universities or have won prestigious prizes,” one official was quoted as saying to the Financial Times. “We’re kicking around the idea of cutting costs to zero,"" they added.The task force is chaired by Starmer’s business adviser Varun Chandra and science minister Lord Patrick Vallance. The Home Office is not yet formally engaged in the talks, but officials said all immigration routes are kept under review.A Home Office spokesperson said: “Our global talent routes attract and retain high-skilled talent, particularly in science, research and technology, to maintain the UK’s status as a leading international hub for emerging talent and innovation.”The global talent visa was introduced in 2020, and costs £766 per applicant, with partners and children charged the same fee. An annual health surcharge of £1,035 applies to each person. The visa is aimed at people recognised as leaders or future leaders in science, engineering, medicine, humanities, digital technology, or arts and culture. In the year ending June 2023, the number of visas granted rose by 76 per cent to 3,901, reports Financial Times.Chancellor Rachel Reeves is also looking at the tax system to spot barriers that might stop highly skilled people from moving to Britain. Her recent changes to the non-dom tax regime (The non-dom tax system refers to the special tax status in UK for people who live in Britain but are officially considered “non-domiciled”) raised fears that many wealthy individuals would leave. She is now reviewing inheritance tax rules for non-doms before the autumn Budget.Universities have welcomed the review but urged more support. Jamie Arrowsmith, director of Universities UK International, said the government’s £50 million Global Talent Fund was “relatively modest” and added: “Ultimately to attract global talent we need to be able to offer funding and autonomy and make the transition as smooth as possible.”US President Donald Trump shocked the tech industry on Friday when he announced a massive rise in the cost of H-1B visas, hiking the fee to $100,000. The H-1B programme has long been the main route for skilled foreign workers, especially Indians, to take up jobs in America’s technology, research, and healthcare sectors. Indians make up more than 70% of H-1B holders, many of them working in Silicon Valley companies, hospitals, and universities.Immigration policy analyst Gil Guerra said the change is more likely to cause medium- and long-term labour shortages in the US. David Bier of the Cato Institute warned it would deal a “devastating blow” to American innovation and competitiveness.","UK PM Sir Keir Starmer has set up a ‘global talent task force’ to explore reforms.

Putin Warns UK Against Interference In Ukraine Truce Negotiations | Watch





UK secret intelligence service chief Richard Moore on Friday said there is “absolutely no evidence” that Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to negotiate peace in Ukraine, accusing him of deceiving the world with false promises of dialogue.In a parting speech at the British consulate in Istanbul, Moore said Putin was “stringing us along” while seeking to impose his “imperial will by all means at his disposal.” “Bluntly, Putin has bitten off more than he can chew. He thought he was going to win an easy victory, but he – and many others – underestimated the Ukrainians,” Moore said.Moore warned that the Russian leader is “mortgaging his country’s future for his own personal legacy and a distorted version of history,” adding that the war is accelerating Russia’s decline.The head of Britain’s secret intelligence service, will retire in September this year after serving five years in the role. He will be preceded by UK's first woman intelligence officer, Blaise Metreweli.Moore, a former UK ambassador to Turkey, said the 2022 invasion had backfired on Moscow by strengthening Ukrainian national identity, speeding Kyiv’s westward shift, and prompting Sweden and Finland to join NATO. “Putin has sought to convince the world that Russian victory is inevitable. But he lies. He lies to the world. He lies to his people. Perhaps he even lies to himself,” Moore told reporters.The Ukraine conflict, now in its third year, continues to rage primarily in the country’s east, with tens of thousands killed since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February 2022.","Richard Moore, head of Britain's secret intelligence service, will retire in September this year.

‘Do As I Say Or…’: Trump Loses Temper At NATO Nations Buying Russian Oil; Warns Them To Stop…





US President Donald Trump claimed that the UK Prime Minister supported his criticism of NATO and EU countries over their continued energy purchases from Russia, despite the West’s broader stance on sanctions, calling it a key obstacle to achieving peace in Ukraine.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his return to Washington after a state visit to the United Kingdom, Trump said, “The UK Prime Minister was embarrassed about me calling out NATO and EU countries over buying oil from Russia. And he said that’s not good. He appreciated that I said it, but he said that’s not good. How about that?”Trump further stated that the UK PM Keir Starmer expressed willingness to take action on the issue. “He also agrees to stop buying oil from Russia, and he’s willing to impose sanctions too. And he’s not one of the culprits in terms of Russian oil,”Trump added.The remarks appear to underline ongoing tensions over Europe's energy dependence on Russia, which has remained a point of friction between Washington and several NATO allies. While Trump's comments suggest some level of private consensus with the UK on the issue, there has been no official confirmation yet from Downing Street regarding any new commitments.He reiterated his belief that cutting off Russian oil exports is essential to bringing an end to the war in Ukraine. “Ultimately, if oil prices go down, or if Russia is not selling oil, they have no choice but to settle. When EU or Nato nations are buying oil from Russia, that’s not the greatest thing,” he said.Trump also admitted that the conflict in Ukraine has proven more complex than he had initially expected. He said he felt “let down” by Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite earlier confidence in their personal rapport to help negotiate a peace deal.Trump has consistently criticised Nato and EU nations for what he sees as a contradiction - relying on US defence support while continuing economic ties with Russia through energy trade.(With inputs from agencies)",US President Donald Trump claimed that the UK Prime Minister supported his criticism of NATO and EU countries over their continued energy purchases from Russia.

EU Chief Kaja Kallas To India: Rethink Moscow Ties Or Risk Free Trade Agreement With European Union





The UK has carried out its first deportation under a new returns treaty with France, with home secretary Shabana Mehmood calling it an “important first step” in efforts to curb illegal English Channel crossings.“This is an important first step to securing our borders. It sends a message to people crossing in small boats: if you enter the UK illegally, we will seek to remove you,” Mehmood said Thursday. She added that the government would continue to challenge “last-minute, vexatious” attempts in court, and stressed that Britain would continue to provide refuge through “safe, legal and managed routes — not dangerous crossings. ”According to UK home office sources, the deportee is an Indian national who crossed into Britain illegally on a small boat in August. He was flown on a commercial flight to Paris under the “one-in, one-out” deal signed with France. Once returned, he will be offered a voluntary repatriation scheme to India; refusal would bar him from applying for asylum and could result in enforced removal.The pilot agreement, which began in August and will run until June 2026, allows the UK to deport migrants who arrive illegally while accepting an equal number from France through a new safe and legal asylum pathway, subject to strict eligibility and security checks.The first arrivals under this reciprocal route are expected in Britain in the coming days.Official data show that 2,715 Indian nationals were in UK immigration detention as of August — more than double last year’s figure, an increase of 108 per cent. The deported man is among the first group of migrants held by UK Border Force since the treaty came into force.According to the home office, more than 35,000 people with no right to remain were removed from the UK in the past year, with returns of foreign criminals up 14 per cent and asylum-related removals up 28 per cent.","The deportee is an Indian national who crossed into Britain illegally on a small boat in August.

Charles plays the statesman



The transactional monarchist



Murdoch at the margins



Fortress walls and protest shadows



The bigger picture: Royals as Britain’s bargaining chip

Bottom Line







When Donald Trump strode into Windsor Castle this week in white tie, flanked by King Charles III and Queen Camilla, it wasn’t just another state dinner. It was Britain’s oldest political trick—deploying the monarchy as a velvet glove to soften a hard negotiation. The soaring banquet hall, filled with nearly a thousand years of heraldry, wasn’t just a backdrop; it was a stage. Every polished suit of armour and gilded goblet was calculated to make Trump feel not just welcomed, but enthroned.For Britain, the stakes were high. With Trump’s second term already marked by tariffs, transactional diplomacy, and the unraveling of Western alliances, London needed leverage. The royal family, still Britain’s most effective soft power tool, provided it.Unlike the star-studded dinners of yesteryears—think Hollywood names or fashion royalty—this banquet was stocked with people who wield real influence. At the 160-seat table were Wall Street titans like Blackstone’s Stephen Schwarzman and Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan, tech heavyweights like Sam Altman, Demis Hassabis, Satya Nadella, Marc Benioff, and Apple’s Tim Cook, plus media barons like Rupert Murdoch.The symbolism was obvious: Britain wanted Trump to see that its royals could convene a pantheon of the global elite in his honour. The message—this is the club you still belong to, provided you play nice with us.Tim Cook’s presence was particularly striking. Barely weeks ago, he was in Trump’s bad books for skipping a Middle East trip. Yet here he was, seated beside Tiffany Trump, as if the Windsor seating chart itself was an act of reconciliation.King Charles used his toast to strike a balance—lavishing praise on Anglo-American friendship, while inserting subtle nudges about climate and Ukraine. The king knows Trump’s views on both issues are, at best, sceptical. But the gentle prod, wrapped in regal ceremony, seemed unlikely to provoke the famously thin-skinned president.Trump, for his part, basked in the flattery. He declared himself “the first American president welcomed here,” conveniently overlooking his own previous Windsor visit and the fact that past presidents had dined at Buckingham Palace. Accuracy mattered less than optics. In that moment, Trump was both guest and monarch, enjoying the rarest of British honours: being feted in a castle that has survived every empire from the Normans to the Nazis.Trump is not sentimental about monarchy. But he is sentimental about status. For a man who relishes gilded interiors, gold-plated trophies, and long tables of power, Windsor was the ultimate backdrop. Britain knows this. The castle setting was a calculated bet: flatter the president’s sense of grandeur, and he might be more pliable when it comes to trade talks or military cooperation.Downing Street, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, clearly coordinated with the palace. By seating Trump amid billionaires, bankers, and AI moguls, Britain showed it could still marshal global capital and innovation in ways that appeal to Trump’s business-first instincts.Yet even amid the choreography, there were hints of tension. Rupert Murdoch, Trump’s once-powerful ally turned legal adversary, was seated far from the president’s line of sight. Months earlier, Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal had broken the story about Trump’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein, leading to lawsuits and public feuds. Still, Murdoch was present—because Britain needed the symbolism of its most famous media mogul under the same roof as its most mercurial guest.This was Windsor diplomacy in miniature: even enemies were summoned, but placed carefully so as not to disrupt the main performance.Outside the castle, the spectacle looked different. Protesters projected Trump’s photos with Epstein onto Windsor’s ancient stone walls. Last week in Washington, diners heckled him as “Hitler” during his first public meal out since re-election. The banquet, then, was a temporary reprieve—a fortress designed to shield Trump from the political storms raging beyond the moat.But no banquet lasts forever. Once Trump leaves the Great Hall’s chandeliers and tapestries, he must return to a world less deferential. Britain, however, bet that the glow of Windsor would linger long enough to influence Thursday’s talks at Downing Street.This isn’t new. Britain has long used its monarchy to oil the gears of diplomacy. From Churchill to Thatcher, British leaders have leveraged royal pageantry to charm, flatter, and occasionally disarm foreign leaders. For Trump, whose worldview is explicitly transactional, the spectacle is a tool of persuasion: Britain offers him honour in exchange for concessions.For Starmer, facing an uphill climb to reset Britain’s global standing post-Brexit, Trump’s goodwill is critical. Tariffs, NATO commitments, and US-UK trade are all on the table. The White House may demand tribute, but Windsor shows Britain still knows how to stage-manage power.The Windsor banquet was more than pomp. It was Britain signalling that, despite diminished economic clout, it retains the ability to convene and charm. The monarchy, carefully modernised but still cloaked in medieval grandeur, remains its most potent weapon of influence.Trump got what he wanted: adulation, status, and the appearance of global centrality. Britain got what it wanted: a chance to soften him up before hard negotiations. Both sides left the castle with something—but whether royal flattery can survive Trump’s tariff hammer is the test that lies ahead.",Donald Trump dined with King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle.

LONDON: US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania received the largest ceremonial welcome ever seen for a state visit in living memory on Wednesday at Windsor Castle on their historic second state visit to Britain.Trump is the first US president ever to have a second state visit. Traditionally US presidents just have tea or lunch with the monarch on any subsequent visits to the UK.On Thursday Trump will travel to Chequers where he will meet UK PM Keir Starmer and unlock £31 billion worth of investments from America’s top technology firms, including Microsoft and Google, to boost the UK’s AI infrastructure.The couple spent Tuesday night at the US ambassador’s residence in Regent’s Park where Trump, perhaps suffering from jet lag, posted a flurry of posts on Truth Social until 3.23am UK time, including an article titled “US President Trump dials PM Modi, greets him on birthday”.On Wednesday they flew by Marine One to Windsor Castle and were taken in a horse-drawn procession, together with the King and Queen and William and Kate, through the estate. They watched military parades and Trump inspected the exceptionally large guard of honour.Lt Col Storm Green, captain of the guard of honour, said: “It is the first time we have got all three state colours out — the Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards and Scots Guards — for a foreign head of state.It’s the biggest one I have done in my 28-year career.”For Starmer, the visit serves as a welcome distraction to the problems he is facing domestically.After lunch, they viewed the Royal Collection where Trump took a particular interest in a document indicating when George III realised America was no longer under his control.They laid a wreath on the tomb of the late Queen Elizabeth II at St George’s Chapel. After that there was due to be a flypast by the Red Arrows alongside British and American F-35 jets, followed by a glittering white-tie banquet.The entire day took place within the walls of Windsor Castle. Meanwhile “Stop Trump” demonstrators gathered in London and the Guardian ran an article by London mayor Sadiq Khan slamming Trump.Four men were arrested on Tuesday night after projecting a giant image of Trump and the late child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein onto the exterior walls of Windsor Castle. Police swiftly stopped the projection. The men remain in police custody. Trump has never been officially accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, with whom he was friends earlier in life. On Wednesday, a van could be seen in Windsor displaying a large image on one side of Trump and Epstein with the message: ""Welcome to the UK, Donald. ""A Thames Valley Police spokesperson told TOI: “The driver was at risk of breaching the Road Traffic Regulations Act, and after a brief conversation with officers the motorist left the area. No arrests were made.”",US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania received the largest ceremonial welcome ever seen for a state visit in living memory.

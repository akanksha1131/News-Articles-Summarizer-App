Hamas Demands Israel Exit Clarity As Trump Issues New Threat Amid Hostage Release Deal





President Donald Trump ’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner and senior US envoy Steve Witkoff are travelling to Egypt to advance ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, the White House said on Saturday.The move follows Hamas’ announcement that it is ready to release Israeli hostages under Trump’s proposed peace plan, two years after the conflict began.A White House official said the envoys will finalise the technical details of a hostage release and discuss a long-term ceasefire agreement, according to the Guardian.Egypt will host delegations from Israel and Hamas on Monday to discuss the proposed exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, the country’s foreign ministry confirmed.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also confirmed that Israel’s negotiating team would travel to Egypt to finalise the technical aspects of the proposed Gaza deal, saying he hoped to announce the release of all hostages soon.“I have instructed the negotiating team to go to Egypt to finalise the technical details. The intention is to limit the negotiations to a few days,” Netanyahu said in a televised statement.Israeli PM said that he hopes to bring all hostages home in the coming days, coinciding with the Jewish festival of Sukkot.Speaking on Saturday, he emphasised that Hamas would be disarmed either through diplomacy under Trump’s plan or militarily by Israel.The talks come a month after Israeli airstrikes in Qatar killed six Hamas negotiators, derailing previous ceasefire efforts. Despite Trump urging Israel to halt its bombing in response to Hamas’ declaration, attacks continued over the weekend.Palestinian authorities reported at least 17 deaths, mostly women and children in Gaza City, with dozens more injured. Israeli drones also targeted gatherings in central Gaza and al-Mawasi, previously designated as “safe zones.”Hamas condemned Israel’s continued military operations, accusing Netanyahu of lying about reducing attacks on civilians. Earlier on Saturday, Israeli army radio reported that operations would be limited to “defensive” strikes.Trump, in a post on Truth Social, welcomed Israel’s temporary pause in bombing but warned Hamas to act quickly or risk losing the deal.Trump has described the negotiations as close to completion. In an interview with Axios, he said that Israel had agreed to an initial withdrawal line, which had been shared with Hamas and that once Hamas accepts it, the ceasefire and the hostages-prisoner exchange would begin.He emphasised his intention to restore international support for Israel, which has faced criticism over the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians during the military campaign.Trump also praised Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for helping pressure Hamas to agree to the hostage release. “Erdoğan helped a lot. He is a tough guy, but he is a friend of mine and he was great,” US President said.Israel has stated that its military actions are acts of self-defence, rejecting UN findings and academic assessments that it has committed genocide in Gaza. Trump argued that his plan could help rehabilitate Israel’s global image and secure a diplomatic victory for Netanyahu.",Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff are travelling to Egypt to advance ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas.

'Palestine Action': Hundreds arrested in London for supporting banned group; Keir Starmer appeals for calm amid tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/palestine-action-hundreds-arrested-in-london-for-supporting-banned-group-keir-starmer-appeals-for-calm-amid-tensions/articleshow/124315735.cms,"Police remove a protester in London (PTI image)





London police on Saturday arrested hundreds of protest ers for supporting a banned pro-Palestinian group during a demonstration. The protest went ahead despite official requests to cancel it.Authorities had urged organisers to call off the protest after a deadly attack at a synagogue in Manchester two days earlier.Two people were killed in Thursday’s attack in Manchester and police shot dead the murderer, a British man of Syrian origin who investigators believe may have been motivated by extremist Islamist ideology.Despite the appeal from police and the government, organisers refused to cancel Saturday’s march, which had been planned earlier to protest against the banning of Palestine Action under anti-terrorism laws, as reported by news agency Reuters.Prime Minister Keir Starmer in a post on X urged people to respect the grief of the Jewish community.“This is a moment of mourning. It is not a time to stoke tension and cause further pain. It is a time to stand together,” he said.Starmer added that the UK is a nation that welcomes people of all faiths to stand together as neighbours and friends. This affirms that hatred and violence will never prevail.Police made arrests at Trafalgar Square as demonstrators displayed slogans supporting Palestine Action, which was outlawed in July after its members broke into an airbase and damaged military aircraft.By 5.30 pm GMT, police reported 442 arrests about half the number detained at a similar protest in September. Crowds of more than 1000 applauded those being arrested, while others shouted “shame on you” at the officers.“I'm disgusted by the police actually, they shouldn't be arresting non-violent protesters here,” said Angie Zelter, one of the demonstrators. “We have a right to protest and Palestine Action is not a violent organisation, should never have been proscribed in the first place.”Separately, six people were detained after unfurling a Palestine Action banner on Westminster Bridge near Parliament.Saturday’s demonstration is the latest in a series of rallies where hundreds have been arrested for defying the ban, which makes it illegal to show support for Palestine Action.Police said the protests have drawn police personnel away from strengthened security at synagogues and mosques after the Manchester attack.The protest’s organisers, Defend Our Juries, condemned the attack on the Jewish community and urged police to prioritise community safety over policing demonstrations.The Manchester incident followed a rise in antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crimes across Britain this summer. Pro-Palestinian rallies have also drawn criticism from some Jewish groups.Both Jewish and Muslim communities have expressed growing concern for their safety.",Hundreds arrested for supporting a banned pro-Palestinian group during a demonstration.

""As a result of this incident, flights have been affected.""The airport announced at 23.40 GMT that the closure is now expected to continue until 4.30 am Sunday (0130 GMT), two hours later than initially estimated.Most incoming flights have been diverted to neighboring Latvia and Poland, departures have been canceled, and one flight from Copenhagen was forced to return to Denmark, the operator added.The airport advised travelers to stay updated through its website and airline notifications.European air travel has faced repeated disruptions in recent weeks due to drone sightings and airspace incursions, affecting airports such as Copenhagen and Munich.In August, Nato member Lithuania established a 90 km (60-mile) no-fly zone along its border with Belarus after drones entered its airspace, aiming to give its armed forces time to respond to violations, as reported by Reuters.A staunch supporter of Ukraine, Lithuania shares a 679 km (422-mile) border with Belarus, a close ally of Russia, with the capital Vilnius located about 30 km from the border.","Lithuania has suspended air traffic at Vilnius Airport after balloons were reportedly spotted in its airspace.

Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Saar condemned the deadly terrorist attack that targeted a Manchester synagogue on Thursday, criticising UK authorities for what he described as their “failure to address this toxic wave of antisemitism.”“I am appalled by the murderous attack near Heaton Park Synagogue on the morning of Yom Kippur, the holiest day for the Jewish people. My deepest condolences go to the families who have lost loved ones, and I wish a swift recovery to the injured,” Saar said on X.He called for the “truth” to be told, adding: “Blatant and rampant antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement, as well as support for terror, have recently become widespread in London, other UK cities, and on campuses.”Saar further said Israel expects “more than words” from the Keir Starmer-led government, demanding “effective action and enforcement against antisemitic and anti-Israeli sentiment in Britain.”The attack, carried out with a car and a knife, left two people dead and four injured. Police neutralised the suspect and arrested two others.The incident comes ahead of the second anniversary of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel, after which Israel - a Jewish state - launched a military offensive in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. Tensions between Israel and the UK have also grown following Britain’s recent recognition of a Palestinian state, along with several other Western nations.","Gideon Saar criticises UK authorities for what he described as their “failure to address this toxic wave of antisemitism’ The attack, carried out with a car and a knife, left two people dead and four injured.

Paramount Skydance is set to appoint Bari Weiss as editor in chief of CBS News in the coming days, providing the journalist with significant authority to overhaul the network as it acquires her independent news site, the Free Press, The Post has learned.Weiss, a 41-year-old former New York Times opinion writer who developed the Free Press into a prominent platform with a contrarian perspective, is expected to be named to the top position in a Monday announcement. However, negotiations remain uncertain, and the timeline may change, a source close to the matter stated.In a notable restructuring of CBS News’ longstanding management framework, Weiss will report directly to Paramount Skydance Chief Executive David Ellison as she assists in defining the editorial direction of the Tiffany Network’s third-largest news division, a source indicated.Weiss’s direct reporting line to Ellison means she will not answer to CBS News President Tom Cibrowski, who currently reports to George Cheeks, Chair of TV Media at Paramount Skydance.Insiders mentioned that Weiss’s hiring raises doubts about the potential return of former CBS President David Rhodes to the network, with one source describing their job prospects as an “either/or” scenario.Sources informed The Post that Weiss could serve as a strong counterpart to Cibrowski, a former “Good Morning America” executive who is viewed more as a production expert than a journalist.Others anticipate that it will soon be clear whether Weiss—who has become a leading voice against antisemitism and the “woke” elites in mainstream media—will challenge Cibrowski’s position.Weiss, 40, made her name as a sharp-tongued opinion columnist at The New York Times. Her pieces took aim at the MeToo movement, campus activism, and what she described as “illiberalism on the left.”In 2020, she quit in spectacular fashion, publishing a viral resignation letter accusing the paper of silencing ideological diversity.She then launched The Free Press in 2022, billing it as “fiercely independent.”The outlet quickly drew attention, and controversy, with stories that platformed conservative voices, a friendly sit-down with venture capitalist Peter Thiel, and essays that critics said downplayed the famine in Gaza.","Bari Weiss, a former New York Times opinion writer, is expected to be named to the top position in a Monday announcement.

Who is Sarah Mullally?



Why the role matters







The Church of England, founded in 1554, will be led by a woman for the first time, as Sarah Mullally, the Bishop of London, was announced on Friday as the next Archbishop of Canterbury, the highest-ranking bishop in the Church.Mullally, 63, succeeds 105 men to become the first woman to lead the Anglican Communion, which comprises 85 million (8.5 crore) members worldwide.She will succeed former Archbishop Justin Welby, who announced his resignation in November last year following an independent investigation. The probe found that he had failed to report to the police instances of serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps, despite being aware of them.According to the BBC, Mullally is a former National Health Service (NHS) nurse who became a priest in 2006. In 2018, she was appointed as the first female Bishop of London, making her the third most senior member of clergy in the Church of England.She spent over 35 years in the NHS, and in 1999, became the youngest-ever Chief Nursing Officer for England. A few years later, she decided to pursue the priesthood.In 2012, Mullally became canon treasurer at Salisbury Cathedral, and three years later, she was appointed Bishop of Crediton in the Diocese of Exeter.Mullally will not formally assume her new role until a confirmation of election in January, followed by an enthronement service after paying homage to King Charles III, the head of state.Women were first ordained as priests in the Church of England in 1994, with the first female bishops appointed two decades later, in 2014.Although the monarch—King Charles III in this case—is the formal head of the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury is its most senior bishop and serves as the spiritual leader of both the Church and the worldwide Anglican Communion, which includes numerous national churches.The Archbishop carries the title “Primate of All England,” reflecting their seniority as the “first bishop” in England.","Sarah Mullally, the Bishop of London, was announced on Friday as the next Archbishop of Canterbury.

US government shutdown: Education dept employees' out-of-office emails altered to blame Democrats; claim 'none of us contested',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-government-shutdown-education-dept-employees-out-of-office-emails-altered-to-blame-democrats-claim-none-of-us-contested/articleshow/124280514.cms,"



While the US government has already been shut down, some of the employees of the education department discovered their email accounts had been manipulated during their furlough this week.Five employees of the education department discovered that while they were out of the office, they had included partisan talking points that blamed the government shutdown on Democrats.The employees, who spoke with NBC News and provided copies of their out-of-office messages, reported that the wording had been altered from their original compositions. All are civil servants, not political appointees, and requested anonymity out of fear of professional repercussions.Initially, Education officials sent employees templates of nonpartisan out-of-office messages to use in their emails. Several employees stated they used this language earlier in the week, only to find that while they were furloughed, someone had changed it.“We’re looking to hear from federal government workers. If you’re willing to talk with us, please email us at tips@nbcuni.com or contact us through one of these methods,” one employee said.And now the altered email messages included statements such as: “Thank you for contacting me. On September 10-2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations. Due to the lapse of appropriations, I am currently in furlough status. I will respond to emails once government functions resume.”One individual reported changing the out-of-office message back to the nonpartisan version, only to have it revert to the partisan wording later.“None of us consented to this. And it’s written in the first person, as if I’m the one conveying this message, and I’m not. I don’t agree with it. I don’t think it’s ethical or legal. I think it violates the Hatch Act,” the employee stated, referring to the law that limits federal employees’ political activity.Another employee explained, “I took the statement that they sent us earlier in the week to use. And I pasted it on top of that — basically has a standard out-of-office. They went in and manipulated my out-of-office reply. I guess they’re now making us all guilty of violating the Hatch Act.”On Wednesday, NBC News reported that some employees at federal agencies were being offered partisan language blaming Democrats for the shutdown to use as their out-of-office messages. Additionally, several federal websites now display language targeting Democrats or the “radical left.” The Education Department’s actions have been criticised for involving individual civil servants in political messaging regardless of their personal views.Madi Biedermann, the deputy assistant secretary for communications, responded: “The email reminds those who reach out to Department of Education employees that we cannot respond because Senate Democrats are refusing to vote for a clean CR and fund the government. Where’s the lie?”One employee expressed frustration over the lack of accountability, stating, “Nobody follows the law anymore, so why does it matter? It seems like laws are dotted lines now, not solid lines. It seems there’s no one to hold this administration accountable to laws.” Regarding potential repercussions, the employee added, “Clearly, this wasn’t done by me; it was done while I was in a furlough status. I think I’d be able to argue that point. ”","Five employees of the education department discovered that while they were out of the office, they had included partisan talking points that blamed the government shutdown on Democrats.

Nepal Burns: Gen Z Protest Turns Deadly, 9 Killed as Police Open Fire in Kathmandu, Curfew Impsosed

Why is Moroccan youth protesting?





Moroccan protests driven by teenagers and internet-savvy youth has turned deadly as authorities on Thursday raised the death toll to 3 as violent youth-led demonstrations over corruption and public spending continue to rock the country.Morocco’s Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch praised the response of security forces and said the government was ready for talks, as organisers called for a sixth night of protests. “The death toll in the protests has risen to three,” Akhannouch said in a statement. ""We have unfortunately recorded the deaths of three people"" during the protests, Akhannouch said, describing the events as ""regrettable"", AFP reported.Local authorities reported that security forces had to resort to firearms after teargas failed to stop demonstrators from storming a police facility in Leqliaa, a small town outside Agadir. The group, armed with knives, set fire to part of the facility and to a vehicle.According to Morocco’s Interior Ministry, the three were shot and killed during an attempt to seize police weapons, although no witnesses could corroborate the report.The ministry added that 354 people, mostly law enforcement personnel, were injured, while hundreds of cars, banks, shops, and public buildings were damaged across 23 provinces.The protests dominated by Gen Z participants have taken Morocco by surprise. Demonstrators have voiced frustration over widespread corruption, contrasting the billions invested in preparations for the 2030 World Cup with underfunded schools and hospitals. Chants have included slogans such as, “Stadiums are here, but where are the hospitals?”The unrest has been further fueled by the recent deaths of eight women in a public hospital in Agadir, which has become a rallying cry against the decline of Morocco’s healthcare system.While the country prepares to host soccer's Africa Cup of Nations later this year and gears up for parliamentary elections in 2026, the protests highlight enduring regional disparities and dissatisfaction with public services, particularly among youth.Officials, however, denied that World Cup-related spending has taken precedence over public infrastructure, noting that many challenges facing the health sector were inherited from previous governments.","Morocco's Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch praised the response of security forces and said the government was ready for talks.

What triggered the decision?



Federal judge temporarily halts Trump’s deployment







US President Donald Trump on Saturday authorised the deployment of 300 National Guard troops to Chicago to protect federal officers and assets, White House confirmed.The MAGA leader took the step after weeks of threatening action, despite objections from local leaders.""President Trump has authorized 300 national guardsmen to protect federal officers and assets,"" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. ""President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities,"" she added.The decision follows an incident earlier Saturday in Chicago, where a federal officer shot an allegedly armed motorist.According to the department of homeland security (DHS), law enforcement agents were “boxed in by 10 cars” and could not move their vehicles. ""One of the drivers who rammed the law enforcement vehicle was armed with a semi-automatic weapon,"" DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. ""Law enforcement was forced to deploy their weapons and fire defensive shots at an armed US citizen,"" she added.The motorist reportedly drove herself to the hospital to receive treatment for her wounds. McLaughlin also criticised Chicago police, accusing officers of ""leaving the shooting scene"" and refusing ""to assist us in securing the area.""Chicago police responded that officers attended the scene but said the department ""is not involved in the incident or its investigation. Federal authorities are investigating this shooting. ""The deployment to Chicago comes as Trump escalates his controversial anti-crime and migration operations in Democratic-run cities. Portland, Oregon, was the focus of a separate legal challenge. On Saturday, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking the deployment of 200 National Guard troops to Portland.US District Judge Karin Immergut wrote that Trump’s determination to send troops to Portland “was simply untethered to the facts.” She said the city had seen attacks on federal officers and property, but these were not part of an organised effort to overthrow the government. Regular police could handle the incidents, she claimed.Portland and Chicago are the latest flashpoints in Trump’s national effort, marking another crackdown on Democratic-run states that has previously included deployments to Los Angeles and Washington.","US President Donald Trump authorised deployment of 300 National Guard troops to Chicago to protect federal officers and assets.

A Social Outlet, to a Point





By Claire Cain Miller & Amy FanIn the last decade and a half, boys and young men ages 15-24 more than doubled their average time spent gaming, to about 10 hours a week, according to a major survey.Some teachers say gaming has disrupted focus in classrooms. Some economists have linked it to the decline in young men's work hours. Many readers told us it was a chief reason for the recent struggles of boys and young men, when we started our series on the subject in May.Yet video games also serve an important role in young people's lives. They've become a central way that young people socialise and provide them - especially boys - with a sense of belonging.The increase in time boys and young men spent playing games was the biggest of any activity measured by the American Time Use Survey, the large federal survey that each year asks a nationally representative sample of thousands of people what they did every minute of a day. (The category includes other types of games, like cards, but evidence suggests it's mostly video games.)The rise has coincided with technological changes that made games much more engrossing.Gaming went from an activity done at home on a console or computer to one also done on phones, anywhere and anytime.While parents have always worried about video games (especially whether playing certain games causes violence, a connection that has not been proved), a pressing concern now is about time spent playing. As it has increased, the fear is that video games have displaced other activities in boys' and young men's lives - including physical activity, in-person socialising, homework, jobs and sleep.""Boys would rather sit in front of Minecraft or Fortnite than play outside,"" said Susan Donohoe, an elementary schoolteacher in Portland, Maine. ""They are living a virtual life instead of real outside play and chores, which develop social skills and responsibility.""Yet researchers, and teens themselves, said these virtual worlds were also a place to make and build real friendships.Most teenagers play games with others, even if they're not physically with them, according to a nationwide survey of 1,500 teenagers published last year by the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children's Hospital.Boys - who researchers say tend to prefer doing activities while they're spending time with friends, more than having face-to-face conversations - are more likely than girls to game with others, the survey found. They are more likely to talk with friends while playing, like on FaceTime or Discord. And there is a social cost to abstaining.""It's an opportunity for boys to build up their community and feel connected to others,"" said Zhiying Yue, a scientist at the Digital Wellness Lab who is also a gamer.The hobby is nearly universal: 97% of teenage boys play online games, according to a Pew Research Center survey of teenagers last year, as do 73% of girls. But boys spend much more time doing it, the time use survey showed - 10 hours a week in 2024, compared with two for girls.Young people play video games to satisfy core developmental needs, said Yue: competence, by developing mastery; autonomy, by creating avatars and exploring worlds; and relatedness, by connecting with peers. These are things all adolescents crave, research shows. But boys and young men might seek them in the online world at a time when many say they're feeling adrift in the offline one.The risk is that new technology has made games much more immersive and addictive, said Zach Rausch, chief researcher at Tech and Society Lab at New York University.The major change, he said, came in the 2010s when many games became free to start playing, versus purchased upfront. This shifted companies' business models - the goal became to maximize the time people spent and incentivize small, in-game purchases.Online games update constantly, reward daily check-ins, sell limited-edition virtual goods and make real-time tweaks to keep players hooked. Many never end, making them hard to put down.By 2015, these changes had reshaped gaming - and the hours boys and young men spent playing had pulled ahead of the hours they spent on sports or hanging out with friends or family, the data shows.Males are more susceptible to video game addiction than females, who are more likely to become addicted to social media, research has shown. One reason is that males tend to be drawn to competition and risk-taking, said Dr. Marc Potenza, who studies addiction at the Yale School of Medicine. Brain scans show that when males play video games, they have stronger activation than females in the brain region involved in reward processing.While the Digital Wellness Lab survey found that lonelier adolescents gamed more, gaming didn't alleviate their loneliness - a pattern that was more pronounced for boys. This could be because those with weak social skills were more comfortable making friends online, but then got less practice interacting offline, researchers said.None of the researchers suggested parents ban video games. Games are important to how children bond today, they said, and there are also benefits for cognitive and problem-solving skills, mood and self-esteem. Instead, they recommended parents play alongside children, monitor the time they spend, and have conversations about risks.","Boys and young men ages 15-24 more than doubled their average time spent gaming, to about 10 hours a week.

On Friday, one more court weighed in, and the result was no different.A three-judge panel of the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston said the Republican president cannot enforce the order.

‘Unreliable social media posts’: US judge temporarily halts Donald Trump’s deployment of national guard to Portland; cites potential 10th Amendment violation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/unreliable-social-media-posts-us-judge-temporarily-halts-donald-trumps-deployment-of-national-guard-to-portland-cites-potential-10th-amendment-violation/articleshow/124315160.cms,"AP file photo





A federal judge in Oregon on Saturday issued a temporary restraining order blocking President Donald Trump from deploying 200 National Guard troops to Portland. The decision comes after Trump announced the deployment to protect what he described as a “war-ravaged” city, while a lawsuit challenging the move proceeds in court.The ruling by US District Judge Karin Immergut in Portland marks a setback for Trump, as he attempts to deploy military forces to cities he characterizes as “lawless,” despite opposition from their Democratic officials.In her ruling, Immergut stated that a trial court would likely side with the state’s argument that the president overstepped his constitutional authority by deploying federal troops for local matters, potentially violating the Tenth Amendment.Immergut questioned how much weight should be given to Trump’s social media descriptions of Portland and appeared doubtful about treating those posts as an official or legally binding assessment.""Really? A social media post is going to count as a presidential determination that you can send the National Guard to cities?"" she was quoted as saying by Reuters. ""I mean, is that really what I should be relying on as his determination?""In her order issued on Saturday, Immergut, a Trump appointee, noted that the temporary restraining order will remain in effect for 14 days, expiring on October 18.Immergut found that the timing of the president’s order failed to meet the legal standard for deploying the National Guard, noting that the state presented “substantial evidence that the protests at the Portland ICE facility were not significantly violent or disruptive in the days, or even weeks, leading up to the president's directive.”Democratic Oregon attorney general Dan Rayfield’s office filed the lawsuit on September 28, a day after Trump announced plans to deploy troops to Portland to guard federal immigration facilities from what he called “domestic terrorists.”While Trump described Portland as “war-ravaged,” Oregon officials countered that recent protests in the city were “small and sedate,” noting just 25 arrests in mid-June and none in the three-and-a-half months since June 19.""The president's perception of what is happening in Portland is not the reality on the ground,"" said Caroline Turco, representing Portland. ""The president's perception is that it is World War Two out here. The reality is that this is a beautiful city with a sophisticated police force that can handle the situation.""Trump has also authorized the deployment of 300 Illinois National Guard members to “protect federal officers and assets” in Chicago on Saturday, according to the White House. The move followed protests at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility near the city that resulted in more than a dozen arrests on Friday.The White House also accused state and local officials, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, of failing to address what it called “ongoing violent riots and lawlessness.”","A federal judge in Oregon on Saturday issued a temporary restraining order blocking President Donald Trump from deploying 200 National Guard troops to Portland.

Chicago On Fire: ICE Under Attack, Shells Fired; Protester Grabs Officer's Beard Amid Clashes





The Trump administration plans to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard, Democratic governor JB Pritzker said on Saturday. Pritzker said the state guard received word from the Pentagon on Saturday morning that the troops would be called up without specifying details on the timing or deployment location.“This morning, the Trump Administration’s Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,” Pritzker said in a statement. “It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.”The governor’s office did not immediately respond to requests for further details. The White House and the Pentagon have also not commented on Pritzker’s statement.Trump’s move in Illinois follows similar deployments elsewhere. Over the summer, the President sent National Guard troops to Los Angeles and Washington, DC, as part of a broader federal law enforcement surge. Meanwhile, Tennessee National Guard troops are expected to assist Memphis police.California Governor Gavin Newsom successfully sued to halt the deployment in Los Angeles, winning a temporary block in federal court.The Trump administration has appealed, and a three-judge panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals has indicated the government is likely to prevail.Pritzker dismissed the planned deployment in Illinois as a “manufactured performance,” arguing it would pull National Guard troops away from their families and regular jobs. “For Donald Trump, this has never been about safety. This is about control,” he said.He also noted that state, county, and local law enforcement agencies have been coordinating to protect the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Broadview facility on the outskirts of Chicago. Thirteen protesters were arrested on Friday near the facility, which has been a frequent target of demonstrations during the administration’s surge of immigration enforcement this fall.The planned federalization in Illinois comes amid a series of similar moves by Trump. Last month, he announced the deployment of federal troops to Portland, Oregon, calling the city “war-ravaged.” Local officials, however, have noted that many of Trump’s claims appear to rely on images from 2020, during unrest following George Floyd’s death. City and state officials immediately filed a lawsuit to block the deployment. US District Judge Karin J. Immergut heard arguments on Friday, with a ruling expected over the weekend.So far, 200 National Guard troops have been federalized in Oregon, but they have reportedly remained on the coast for training and have not yet moved into Portland.",Illinois governor JB Pritzker said the state guard received word from the Pentagon on Saturday morning that the troops would be called up. He did not provide details on the timing or deployment location.

D4vd SCRAMBLES For Weinstein’s Lawyer As Police Probe How Celeste Rivas Ended Up In HIS Tesla





The Los Angeles Police Department has now confirmed that singer D4vd is not a suspect in the Celeste Rivas case yet, as the cause of Rivas's death is still unclear. The teen's body was found in the singer's impounded Tesla on September 8 and police confirmed that she had been dead for weeks, but the cause of death is not yet ascertained.“The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner has not yet determined the cause or manner of Ms Rivas Hernandez’s death.

RHD (Robbery-homicide division) is thoroughly examining every aspect of this case to uncover the truth and seek justice for Celeste Rivas Hernandez and her family.”Rivas was missing since last year and many people, including D4vd's neighbors, claimed that Celeste was staying with D4vd at his rented Hollywood Hills apartment.

What is happening in Chicago?







A massive chaos unfolded in Chicago Saturday when US Border Patrol agents shot a woman claiming that it was in self defense as the woman was armed with a semi-automatic weapon and was trying to attack the agents. The agents said they were rammed by 10 cars as they were patrolling. The woman was in one of those cars, driving.The woman was already known to the federal agency for allegedly publicly identifying agents and encouraging people to attack them, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said.The shooting was reported at around 10:30 a.m. near the intersection of South California Avenue and West 35th Street in the city’s Brighton Park neighborhood. ""Agents were unable to move their vehicle and exited the car,"" Tricia said.Protests have occurred in recent days as part of an immigration enforcement effort called ""Operation Midway Blitz,"" which has seen more than 1,000 arrests. Agents have been raiding houses, landing on rooftops from their helicopters and breaking down doors in an operation the Trump administration said targeted gang members of Tren de Aragua, citing a rise in crime.There have also been arrests of local officials and candidates for office who were protesting, including Illinois’ ninth congressional district Kat Abughazaleh, who went viral with a video of an ICE agent slamming her to the ground.Kristi Noem was seen at an ICE facility Friday when law enforcement was cracking down on protesters.Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker accused the federal agents of separating children from their parents, tying their hands, and detaining them in “dark vans” for hours. Videos and photos showing flashbang grenades erupting on the street, followed by residents of the building being led to a parking lot across the street going viral on social media drawing condemnation.“Military-style tactics should never be used on children in a functioning democracy,” Pritzker said in a statement on Friday. “This didn’t happen in a country with an authoritarian regime; it happened here in Chicago. It happened in the United States of America, a country that should be a bastion of freedom, hope, and the rights of our people as guaranteed by the Constitution,” he added.","The shooting was reported at around 10:30 a.m. near the intersection of South California Avenue and West 35th Street in the city’s Brighton Park neighborhood.

TOI Correspondent from Washington:





Driven by a youthful population and a mobile-first approach, India is getting sucked big-time into digital junk on social media platforms even as western nations are showing signs of plateauing and even declining in this aspect.A recent analysis by the digital audience insights company GWI reveals that daily time spent on social platforms by adults in developed countries has been on a downward trend since a peak in 2022 even as it is rising in India. By the end of 2024, usage in the west was down by nearly 10% from its high point, the decline most pronounced in Europe, although the jury is still out on the effect of AI, which is now throwing up new content.However, India's story is one of rapid and ongoing growth. With a median age of just 28.8, India is one of the world's most youthful nations, and this demographic is fueling its digital expansion. The country's users spend an average of 2 hours and 28 minutes per day on social media, notably higher than the U.S. average of 2 hours and 9 minutes per day, and far higher than Europe’s 1 hour 48 minutes.The divergence in usage trends is also reflected in platform preferences and content consumption.In India, platforms that facilitate a mobile-first, video-heavy, and community-driven experience are the most popular. WhatsApp, YouTube and Instagram are major players, with short-form video content like Reels and Shorts dominating engagement.The data suggests that for many in the West, the initial novelty and high engagement of social media are fading. Binge is now cringe. This downward trend is seen most among heaviest historical users: teenagers and people in their twenties.While platforms like TikTok – which is banned in India – are popular in the U.S., the overall consumption patterns are different, with some reports indicating a shift away from reflexive, time-filling scrolling toward more intentional online activities. In other words, westerners are turning up their nose and nos, while Indians are plunging headlong into brain rot, sucking in social media slop just as they are with junk food and sugary drinks, while social media giants are picking their pockets.In a recent essay, the technology writer Cory Doctorow identified a three-stage life cycle for these platforms in a process he called ""enshittification,"" – a predictable pattern of decay as they evolve to prioritize shareholder profit over user value.Stage 1: They are good to their users (Bait). The platform offers a genuinely good service—often at a loss—to attract a massive, locked-in user base. Stage 2: (Switch). Once users are locked in (due to network effects or switching costs), the platform begins shifting the ""surplus"" value away from them and toward its business customers (suppliers, creators, advertisers). Stage 3: (Extraction). Finally, with both users and business customers fully dependent, the platform exploits the business customers, clawing back all remaining value to maximize profit for its shareholders. The platform becomes a ""useless pile of shit,"" filled with ""botshit, crap gadgets,"" and advertising scams.There is now a growing movement towards digital detoxification in the west even as the situation is aggravated by AI – illustrated by the America’s troller-in-chief himself dispensing AI-generated garbage, adding to the copious output of social media sewage. Grassroots Advocacy organizations like the youth-led ""LOG OFF Movement"" are urging people to reject what is being called the “attention economy” amid a push to regulate social media companies, despite the major ones having burrowed their way into Washington DC and now allied with the ruling dispensation.","India is one of the world's most youthful nations, and this demographic is fueling its digital expansion.

India Won't Hold Back in Operation Sindoor 2.0: Army Chief Dwivedi Sends Clear Message To Pakistan





ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Army on Saturday criticised the recent remarks made by the Indian military officers and political leaders, warning that a future conflict between the two countries might lead to a ""cataclysmic devastation"".In a statement, it also said that these ""irresponsible statements"" indicate a renewed attempt at ""fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression"" - a prospect which might ""lead to serious consequences"" for peace and stability in South Asia.A day earlier, defence minister Rajnath Singh had said India can cross any border whenever necessary to protect citizens and safeguard India's unity and integrity. Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Friday issued a stern warning to Pakistan , saying the neighbouring country should stop sponsoring terrorism on its soil if it wants to retain its place on the world map.General Dwivedi also said the restraint shown by New Delhi during Operation Sindoor would not be repeated in case of a future military conflict and urged Indian soldiers to remain poised for action.Also, chief of air staff Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Friday said that at least a dozen Pakistani military aircraft, including US-origin F-16 jets, were destroyed or damaged in Indian strikes during Operation Sindoor.In its statement, the Pakistan Army said that it noted with ""grave concern"" the ""delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements"" coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment.""In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian Defence Minister and its Army and Air Chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,"" it said.The statement said that Pakistan has established a ""new normal of response"", which will be ""swift, decisive and destructive"".It added that the armed forces of Pakistan have the capability and resolve ""to take the fight to every nook and corner of the enemy's territory"".The statement also responded to the threat of ""erasing Pakistan from the map"", saying India ""must know that if a situation comes, the erasure will be mutual"".It also said that earlier this year, the Indian attack against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war. ""...India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation,"" it added.In response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in territories controlled by Pakistan.The strikes triggered four days of intense clashes that ended with an understanding on stopping the military actions on May 10.On Thursday, defence minister Singh said any misadventure by Islamabad in the Sir Creek sector will invite a ""decisive response"" that could be strong enough to change both ""history and geography"".Sir Creek is a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Gujarat's Rann of Kutch and Pakistan and is considered a disputed region due to varying interpretations of maritime boundary lines by both sides.

A day after Pakistan 's foreign minister Ishaq Dar said that Donald Trump 's Gaza peace plan was not endorsed by Pakistan, Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President's plan calling it a ""step towards ending bloodshed.""In a social media post on X, Shehbaz thanked Trump and leaders of Arab and Muslim states for their efforts to bring peace in Palestine.“Alhamdolillah, we are closer to a ceasefire than we have been since this genocide was launched on the Palestinian people. Pakistan has always stood by the Palestinian people and shall always do so,” Shehbaz said.""Gratitude is due to President Trump, as well as to leaderships of Qatar, Saudia Arabia, UAE, Turkiye, Jordan, Egypt, and Indonesia who, met with President Trump on the sidelines of #UNGA80 for the resolution of the Palestinian issue. The statement issued by Hamas creates a window for a ceasefire and ensuring peace that we must not allow to close again. InshaAllah, Pakistan will continue to work with all its partners and brotherly nations to everlasting peace in Palestine,"" he added.Shehbaz took a U-turn as his deputy Dar had claimed that Trump’s version of the peace plan was not the one proposed by the bloc of eight Muslim-majority nations that met the US president on September 22 on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.“I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record,” Dar said, emphasising that “there is no room for politicking” on the issue.Dar explained that the plan took shape during a meeting between Trump and foreign ministers of eight countries - Pakistan, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt - on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session. He said the group had prepared a counter-draft to the US proposal, focusing on an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and an end to the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza.Dar also reaffirmed that Pakistan will never recognise Israel and continues to back the two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al Sharif (Jerusalem) as the capital of a future Palestinian state. He stressed that Pakistan’s stance remains unchanged.Dar also confirmed that the plan envisions deploying an international peacekeeping force in Palestine, and said Pakistan’s leadership would soon decide on contributing troops.Under Donald Trump’s proposed plan, military operations in Gaza would be suspended, existing battle lines would remain in place, and a temporary “technocratic, non-political” Palestinian administration would be established. The plan also calls for creating a “Board of Peace,” chaired by Trump, with former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair reportedly serving as an adviser.On Friday, Trump said Hamas must accept the proposed Gaza peace plan by Sunday, warning that failure to do so would result in further attacks.This comes as Hamas accepted some elements of Trump's plan to end the nearly two-year war and return all the remaining hostages taken in the October 7, 2023, attack.Hamas said it was willing to release the hostages and hand over power to other Palestinians, but that other aspects of the plan require further consultations among Palestinians. Senior Hamas officials suggested there were still major disagreements that required further negotiations.","Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President's plan calling it a ""step towards ending bloodshed"" On Friday, Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar said that Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan was not endorsed by Pakistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124307060,imgsize-660599,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan, authorities said on Saturday.According to the school administration, a fourth-grade student picked up a “toy bomb” on his way to school in Jamrud tehsil, Khyber district, near the Afghan border and brought it into his classroom on Friday.Local authorities explained that “toy bombs” are actually abandoned mortar shells found in the province, especially near the Afghan border, which children often mistake for toys. The bomb exploded when the student dropped it on the classroom floor.The injured students were immediately taken to a hospital in Peshawar for treatment and were later discharged, news agency PTI reported.Security forces have blocked off the area and launched a search operation to locate and defuse any remaining unexploded shells to prevent further accidents. Police have also initiated an investigation into the incident.Incidents involving abandoned mortar shells are common in the region. Last year, on December 27, four boys were killed and two critically injured when an old mortar shell exploded in Bajaur district.Such devices continue to pose serious risks to local communities, particularly children, in heavily mined tribal areas along the Afghanistan border.","At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan.

PoJK protests at the core







Protests in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) continued for a sixth consecutive day on Friday, spilling into the country’s capital, triggering a shocking police raid on the Islamabad National Press Club (NPC) that left several journalists injured and equipment vandalised.The assault has sparked nationwide outrage, with journalist unions announcing a “Black Day” in protest against what they called an attack on press freedom, ANI reported.Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday, where members of the Lawyers’ Community of PoK were holding a peaceful demonstration in solidarity with ongoing protests in the region.Visuals widely shared on social media showed baton-wielding policemen dragging journalists, smashing cameras, and assaulting media staff inside the club premises. In one video, a photojournalist could be seen with a torn shirt and a broken camera.The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) strongly condemned the attack, calling it one of the “darkest days” in Pakistan’s history.PFUJ President Afzal Butt said black flags would be hoisted at press clubs across the country in solidarity. “This is not only the Islamabad press club's issue,” Butt said at a press conference.“Press clubs across Pakistan believe that if they ignore this worst incident, tomorrow it could be Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar or Quetta,” he added.Videos circulating on social media show Pakistani Rangers using tear gas shells and live ammunition to disperse crowds. Internet, mobile, and landline services have been shut down, cutting off residents from their families and worsening the crisis.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and ordered an inquiry into the raid. “Violence against the journalist community cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” Naqvi said, promising disciplinary action against those responsible.However, journalist unions rejected what they termed “mere promises.” They warned that if the government continued to use police action to suppress dissent, the protests would intensify.The Islamabad incident comes amid massive protests in PoK, which have entered their sixth consecutive day.The protests, which began two years ago, were initially sparked by demands for political reforms, subsidised wheat flour, reduced electricity tariffs, free education and healthcare, and an end to privileges for government officials.The unrest intensified after at least three civilians were killed during police firing in Muzaffarabad, ANI reported.Their funeral processions drew thousands, fuelling more anger. Reports suggest that over 10 people have died in the clashes so far, with many critically injured.","Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday.

Pak Parliamentarian Mocks Army Chief Munir As ‘Salesman’, PM Sharif As ‘Manager’ Over Trump Meeting





The Commonwealth Observer Group (COG) has officially released its report on Pakistan’s 2024 general elections, noting “conditions that appeared to impact one party’s ability to fairly contest the election” — namely the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), led by incarcerated former Prime Minister Imran Khan The report, which included a ""Letter of Transmittal"" by COG chairperson and former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, cited the denial to PTI of its election symbol, Khan’s consecutive convictions ahead of polling, and restrictions on freedom of association and assembly.Jonathan wrote: “When looked at in isolation, some – though not all – of the arguments advanced by key institutions in support of their actions appear somewhat justifiable. Yet, collectively, it could not go unnoticed that these decisions consistently limited one party's ability to contest the election on a level playing field.”The observers expressed particular concern over the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s revocation of PTI’s iconic “bat” symbol — linked to Khan’s cricketing past — on grounds that the party failed to hold intra-party elections. With the decision coming just weeks before polling, PTI candidates were forced to run as independents, depriving them of a unifying symbol.The group also flagged Khan’s multiple convictions shortly before polling day, along with restrictions on PTI’s rallies and gatherings. “There were also limitations on fundamental political rights, including freedom of association and assembly. These limitations were felt most acutely by PTI and its supporters,” the report said.The COG called for reforms to strengthen transparency and ensure a level playing field for all parties in future Pakistani elections.The report found that mainstream English-language media “broadly followed the principles of fair and accurate election reporting,” though PTI-affiliated independent candidates received ""less positive"" coverage.By contrast, state-owned PTV News lacked balance, focusing mainly on the ruling PML-N and PPP, and reportedly barred references to Khan by name. The group concluded that these factors may have “impinged on the credibility, transparency and inclusiveness of the electoral process.”The report had been controversial after media reports suggested the Commonwealth had “buried” it following widespread problems in the February 8 polls. Submitted to the Commonwealth secretary-general on November 20, 2024, the publication was delayed without explanation.The PTI had repeatedly demanded its release, arguing it confirmed “systemic rigging, institutional bias, and deliberate targeting” of the party and its founder.","Commonwealth Observer Group releases report on Pakistan's 2024 general elections.

Trump's 20-point peace plan







Pakistan’s top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations’ peacekeeping force under a comprehensive peace deal announced by US President Donald Trump.The decision was announced by Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday.At a press conference in Islamabad, Dar was asked directly about Pakistan’s role in the initiative, which aims to end the bloodshed in Gaza. “The force [here] is a peacekeeping force. On the ground, there will be Palestinian law-enforcement agencies... there will be [separate] forces supporting them. Indonesia has offered 20,000 troops for that. I am sure Pakistan's leadership will also be making a decision on this,” he said.Dar explained that the idea was to set up an independent Palestinian government of technocrats overseen by an international body. He said Pakistan had asked for the arrangements to be documented at the UN Security Council.He shared that a preparatory meeting of leaders from eight Muslim countries with US President Trump was held in New York last week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. “The objectives were to try for a ceasefire in Gaza, make arrangements for sending humanitarian aid, stop the forced displacement of Palestinians and make arrangements for the return of the displaced Gazans,” he said.Dar added that the plan also included Gaza’s reconstruction and halting Israel’s efforts to annex the West Bank. According to him, Trump proposed that his team work with the foreign ministers of the Muslim nations to create a “workable solution.”The foreign minister said Saudi Arabia had reached out to Pakistan with a draft joint statement on the plan, which was later revised after his input. He noted that the Palestinian Authority welcomed the statement.On Monday, Donald Trump unveiled a 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the Gaza war by demanding Hamas’s disarmament, the immediate release of all hostages within 72 hours, and a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces. Under the proposal, Hamas would be excluded from any future governance; militants willing to abandon arms would receive amnesty, while those wishing to leave Gaza would be allowed safe passage. The plan also involves a temporary technocratic Palestinian committee ruling Gaza under oversight by an international “Board of Peace” led by Trump and including Tony Blair, until the Palestinian Authority is reformed.The initiative calls for humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza without interference from either Israel or Hamas, managed by UN agencies and the Red Crescent, with reconstruction under a “New Gaza” framework. Trump gave Hamas three to four days to accept the plan or face what he called “a very sad end.”","Pakistan's top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations' peacekeeping force.

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





At least nine people, including four militants, were killed in two separate bomb-related incidents on Tuesday in South Waziristan district of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, reported news agency PTI.The first explosion occurred in Ashangi Lagad village, where five villagers were killed instantly after coming into contact with a bomb-like object lying on the road.The powerful blast sparked panic in the area, with residents demanding that authorities step up efforts to clear unexploded devices and protect civilians. Security forces and local administration officials later reached the site and launched an investigation.Hours later, in the Wacha Khawora area of Wana, four militants were killed when an improvised explosive device (IED) they were attempting to plant went off prematurely. Among those killed were a local militant commander, Yar Muhammad Muslim, Zameed Alam of the Ashangi tribe, and two unidentified associates.Earlier, at least ten people were killed and several others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside the paramilitary headquarters in Quetta on Tuesday.The blast was reportedly heard miles away, and ambulances quickly arrived to transport the wounded to nearby hospitals.“The blast occurred as an explosive-laden vehicle took a turn from Model Town towards Hali Road, near the Frontier Constabulary (FC) headquarters,” said Muhammad Baloch, SSP special operations Quetta.This follows heightened tensions in the region. On September 3, a suicide bombing at a political rally in Quetta killed 11 leaving over 40 injured. The explosion happened in a stadium car park where hundreds of Balochistan National Party (BNP) supporters had gathered.","At least nine people, including four militants, were killed in two separate bomb-related incidents on Tuesday.

Israel Says Yes, Hamas Says No? Decoding Why Trump’s 20-Point Gaza Peace Is A Dud





Pakistan has formally distanced itself from the 20-point Gaza peace plan unveiled by US President Donald Trump, with country’s foreign minister and deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar telling the national assembly that the final proposal presented by the US was not endorsed by Pakistan or fully representative of the original draft prepared by a group of Muslim and Arab countries.“I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record,” Dar said, emphasising that “there is no room for politicking” on the issue.Dar explained that the plan took shape during a meeting between Trump and foreign ministers of eight countries - Pakistan, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt - on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session. He said the group had prepared a counter-draft to the US proposal, focusing on an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and an end to the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza.Also read: Who will govern Gaza? Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan — Explained While Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif initially welcomed the peace plan and reiterated support for a two-state solution, the endorsement drew sharp criticism at home. Many in Pakistan labelled it a “surrender” and questioned the absence of a clear roadmap to Palestinian statehood in the US version of the plan.Dar highlighted key differences between Pakistan’s draft and Trump’s final proposal, particularly regarding the extent of Israeli withdrawal and the disarmament of Hamas. Pakistan’s position called for a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, while the US proposal suggested a phased withdrawal linked to the release of hostages.“President Trump's committee also came and open talks were held on what they wanted. They gave us a 20-point proposal,” Dar said. Over the next 24 hours, the eight countries exchanged revised drafts informally. “We were exchanging hard copies in hotel rooms,” he recalled.Dar said while there was an initial effort to seek joint signatures from all foreign ministers, consensus on that point was not reached. After Trump's meeting with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu on September 29, the US publicly announced the 20-point plan. Dar later learned from the Saudi foreign minister that some of the urgent proposals by the eight countries had been accepted, while others were left for further dialogue.He reaffirmed Pakistan’s long-standing policy on Palestine. “Pakistan’s policy on Palestine remained the same as that of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. There has not been any change nor will there ever be,” Dar said, reiterating support for an independent Palestinian state with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.(with inputs from agencies)","Pakistan has formally distanced itself from the 20-point Gaza peace plan unveiled by US President Donald Trump.

Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi has been granted a temporary travel exemption to visit India next week. This marks the first high-level visit by a Taliban leader to New Delhi since the group took power in Afghanistan in 2021.According to officials, the UN Security Council sanctions committee has authorised Muttaqi to travel to New Delhi between October 9 and 16.The visit is expected to revive earlier plans that were delayed after sanctions restrictions prevented him from travelling, according to news agency Afghanistan International.Before arriving in India, Muttaqi will attend the seventh round of the “Moscow Format” talks in Russia on October 6 at the invitation of Russian officials. This will be the first time the Taliban participates as a member, rather than a guest in the multilateral forum.Describing the development as an “important step,” Muttaqi said he hoped such platforms would help strengthen trust and improve ties with neighbouring countries.The planned trip to India comes after months of speculation. In August, reports suggested that New Delhi was considering inviting Muttaqi, but government sources had clarified that India would approach the UN for a waiver only once the visit was finalised.Afghan media had then reported that the absence of approval had delayed the plan.India’s engagement with the Taliban has steadily increased in recent years, largely built around humanitarian assistance and developmental aid.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has twice spoken with Muttaqi, including last week when he conveyed condolences over the recent earthquake in Afghanistan and announced India’s relief assistance.Earlier this year, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri also met Muttaqi in Dubai to discuss Afghanistan’s urgent developmental needs.India has consistently maintained that while it is aligned with the international community on the question of formal recognition of the Taliban regime, it will continue to provide humanitarian aid and support to the Afghan people.New Delhi has delivered large quantities of food, medicines and relief material and has over 500 development projects running across Afghanistan.Taliban officials have also called for stronger ties with India. Suhail Shaheen, head of the Taliban’s political office in Qatar, recently said high-level visits such as Muttaqi’s were essential to explore cooperation in trade and other areas, adding that the Taliban valued India’s assistance and historical friendship with the Afghan people.If the visit goes ahead, it will mark a landmark moment in India-Afghanistan relations, signalling New Delhi’s intention to cautiously deepen engagement with the Taliban regime while balancing global concerns about recognition and sanctions.",Amir Khan Muttaqi has been granted a temporary travel exemption to visit India next week.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban’s first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that “eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place “until further notice.”Just last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan’s fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide “to prevent immoral activities.” They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

Yes No





At least one student was killed, dozens were injured, and 65 were feared buried in the debris after Al Khoziny Islamic boarding school building collapsed in Indonesia.Rescue workers, police, and soldiers, who had been digging through the night, pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java. Additional bodies were spotted, suggesting the death toll could rise, AP reported.Families of the students gathered at hospitals and near the collapsed building, anxiously awaiting news of their children. Relatives wailed as they watched rescuers pull a dusty, injured student from the buried prayer hall.A notice board at the command post established in the boarding school complex listed 65 students as missing as of Tuesday morning. They were mostly boys in Class 7 to Class 11, aged between twelve and seventeen.“Oh my God... my son is still buried, oh my God please help!” a mother cried hysterically upon seeing her child's name on the board, followed by the cries of other parents facing similar losses.“Please, sir, please find my child immediately,” pleaded a father, holding the hand of one of the rescue team members. Heavy slabs of concrete, rubble, and unstable parts of the building hampered search and rescue efforts, said Nanang Sigit, a search and rescue officer leading the operation.Heavy equipment was available but not being used due to concerns it could cause further collapse. “We have been running oxygen and water to those still trapped under the debris and keeping them alive while we work hard to get them out,” Sigit said.He added that rescuers had seen several bodies under the rubble but were focused on saving those still alive. Several hundred rescuers participated in the effort, equipped with breathing apparatus, extrication tools, medical evacuation equipment, and other support devices.The students had been performing afternoon prayers in a building undergoing an unauthorised expansion when it suddenly collapsed on top of them, provincial police spokesperson Jules Abraham Abast said. Residents, teachers, and administrators assisted injured students, many with head injuries and broken bones.Female students were praying in another part of the building and managed to escape, survivors said. One male student, a thirteen-year-old boy, was killed, and ninety-nine other students were injured and taken to hospitals, some in critical condition, officials said. Authorities were investigating the cause of the collapse. Abast said the old prayer hall was two stories, but two additional floors were being added without a permit.“The old building's foundation was apparently unable to support two floors of concrete and collapsed during the pouring process,” Abast said.","Rescue workers, police, and soldiers pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java.

Nepal PM Oli ‘Planning To Flee To Dubai’, Gen Z Bring ‘Corrupt’ Govt To Its Knees | Watch





Nepal's former Prime Minister and CPN-UML chairman KP Sharma Oli has publicly dismissed speculation that he plans to leave the country, accusing the Sushila Karki-led government of attempting to strip him of his security and official entitlements amid ongoing political tension, reported news agency ANI.Addressing a gathering of Yuwa Sangh Nepal, the youth wing of his party, in Gundu, Bhaktapur, Oli declared, ""Do you think we will flee by handing over the nation to this groundless government?"" He said he remained committed to restoring “peace, good governance and constitutional order”, as quoted by the agency.Oli’s remarks come weeks after the fall of his government on September 9, which followed large-scale Gen Z-led protests. Since vacating the Prime Minister’s official residence in Baluwatar, Oli has relocated to a rented house in Gundu, following an arson attack on his private residence in Balkot by protestors.The CPN-UML chief alleged that the current administration lacked democratic legitimacy and was formed through “vandalism and arson”, not the people’s mandate.Challenging the government to disclose any communication he had with state authorities during the protests, Oli said, “Publish them with courage.Make public the instructions I gave.” He denied any wrongdoing and questioned the basis of efforts to link him to the violent unrest.He also raised concerns over reported threats to his safety and criticised the government for inaction. “On social media, there are open calls to attack my residence. What is the government doing? Just watching?” he asked.The former PM expressed strong objection to reports that the government was planning to withhold passports of several political leaders, including himself, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Arzu Rana Deuba, Ramesh Lekhak, and Deepak Khadka.Oli accused the ruling dispensation of creating a climate of insecurity and targeting opposition leaders. “This government is throwing the country into insecurity,” he alleged.Meanwhile, a recent monitoring report by Nepal’s national human rights commission (NHRC) blamed the previous government, led by Oli and then-home minister Ramesh Lekhak, for failing to anticipate the scale of the Gen Z protests. The NHRC said that while the initial demonstrations on September 8 were peaceful, the use of excessive force by security personnel on September 9 led to dozens of deaths and widespread violence.Rights groups have held Oli and Lekhak accountable for the crackdown, which played a key role in the fall of their administration.

Six people arrested in this case



How the attack unfolded



Witnesses recall chaos of attack







At least two Jewish were killed and three others critically injured in a car-ramming and stabbing attack outside Manchester’s Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue on Yom Kippur.Police identified the victims as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. Authorities confirmed that one victim was fatally hit by police gunfire during their response to the assailant, calling it a “tragic and unforeseen consequence.”The suspect, 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, a British national of Syrian descent, was shot dead on site. Investigators are treating the assault as a suspected terror attack.The suspect, a British citizen of Syrian descent who was living in Prestwitch, Manchester, entered the UK as a very young child and was granted British citizenship in 2006 as a minor.Greater Manchester Police said late on Friday that at this stage in its investigation it believes Al-Shamie ""may have been influenced by extreme Islamist ideology."" However, it said establishing the full circumstances of the attack will likely take some time.The suspect's name has not appeared in initial searches of police and security service counter-terrorism records. But Greater Manchester Police said he had a non-counter-terror criminal history, including ""a recent arrest for rape, which resulted in him being bailed.""His family said in a statement: ""We fully distance ourselves from this attack and express our deep shock and sorrow over what has happened. Our hearts and thoughts are with the victims and their families, and we pray for their strength and comfort.""In a statement, the UK police revealed that they have arrested six people in the Manchester synagogue attack. All the six were arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism.“We have now arrested three further people, one man and two women, aged between 18 and mid-40s. This brings the number of people in custody arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism to six,"" the police said in a statement.“We will be seeking warrants of further detention for all six individuals and will seek to issue an update on this later,"" it added.Police responded to reports of a car driving towards members of the public and a man stabbing at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue at 09.31 BST on Thursday.Officers declared a major incident and arrived at the scene in north Manchester within seven minutes, shooting dead the suspect at 09.38 BST, who police said had a bomb.A large number of people were worshipping at the synagogue at the time and were held inside while the surrounding area was made safe. Greater Manchester Police said worshippers and security staff demonstrated ""immediate bravery"" and helped stop the attacker from entering the building.In an update on Friday evening, police said witnesses had described seeing a man ""acting suspiciously"" outside the synagogue before the attack, who then walked away after being confronted by security. The police said they do not believe that incident was reported to them, but about 15 minutes later ""the individual returned in a vehicle and began his horrific attack"".""We have been told from witness accounts that a man was seen acting suspiciously outside the synagogue before he was confronted by security and walked away. Based on the information we have at this time, we don’t believe this was reported to Greater Manchester Police because the man had left the area. Around 15 minutes later, the individual returned in a vehicle and began his horrific attack,"" the police said in a statement.“There were a large number of worshippers in attendance but thanks to the bravery of security staff, worshippers and the fast action of the police, the attacker was prevented from gaining access,"" they added.Shah, a local resident, said she was driving past the synagogue when she saw a vehicle ""just sort of rushing past and driving straight for the members of the public"". She then saw a man ""jump out"" and start running towards the people ""with a knife and he just started going on a bit of a rampage"", she said, calling the scene ""traumatising"".Inside the synagogue, Rabbi Daniel Walker described running into the foyer and seeing ""a terrorist trying to batter his way into the synagogue"". He told the BBC the attacker was ""body-charging the doors, throwing heavy plant pots at the doors, doing everything he could to get in"", as he and others held the entrance doors shut.Outside, Tonge said once police arrived, ""they gave him [the attacker] a couple of warnings, he didn't listen so they opened fire,"" adding that the man holding the knife went down on the floor.The man then ""started getting back up and they [the police] shot him again"", Tonge added – describing it as ""nerve-racking"" to witness.A bomb disposal unit was deployed after ""suspicious items"" were spotted around the suspect's waist - police later confirmed the device was ""fake"".An SAS helicopter, dubbed ""Blue Thunder"", was seen flying above the area later. The aircraft, and the troops it carries, are part of a national airborne counter-terrorism response.

LONDON: For the first time in the Church of England’s 491-year history, a woman has been appointed to lead it.On Friday Downing Street announced that Bishop of London Dame Sarah Mullally, 63, who became a Christian aged 16, would be the successor to Justin Welby who resigned in Jan over his handling of a child sex abuse scandal.Currently known as the Archbishop of Canterbury-designate, she will legally become the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury at her confirmation of election at St Paul’s Cathedral in Jan 2026, with a service of installation taking place at Canterbury Cathedral in March 2026.Mullally has been Bishop of London since 2018, the first woman appointed to that role too. Prior to her ordination in 2001, she was chief nursing officer for England — the youngest person ever to be appointed to that role at the age of 37 — having previously specialised as a cancer nurse.The Crown Nominations Commission (CNC) for Canterbury nominated Mullaly following a process of public consultation and prayerful discernment that began in Feb. The CNC was made up of representatives from the Church of England, global Anglican Communion and the Diocese of Canterbury.The most senior bishop in the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury’s ministry combines many roles, including serving as primus inter pares — or first among equals — of the Primates of the global Anglican Communion, which consists of around 85 million people, across 165 countries, including India.The Archbishop of Canterbury also sits in the House of Lords.Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, commended the appointment and called on the Roman Catholic Church to follow suit. Quoting Hindu scriptures, he said: “ Where women are honoured, there the Gods are pleased.”But Gafcon, a movement of Conservative global Anglicans, which is opposed to the ordination of women to holy orders, said it did not accept Mullaly as leader. “Since the newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury has failed to guard the faith and is complicit in introducing practices and beliefs that violate both the plain and canonical sense of Scripture and the Church’s historic and consensual interpretation of it, she cannot provide leadership to the Anglican Communion,” said Dr Laurent Mbanda, chairman, Gafcon Primates Council. “The majority of the Anglican Communion still believes that the Bible requires a male-only episcopacy.”","Dame Sarah Mullally, 63, became a Christian aged 16.

2 Killed in Yom Kippur Stabbing Near Manchester Synagogue, Suspect Shot by Police





One of the victims of the synagogue attack in Manchester may have been fatally shot by officers during their attempt to stop the assailant, police said on Friday.In a statement, police confirmed that the suspect, identified as Jihad Al Shamie, was not carrying a firearm. “The only shots fired were from GMP’s Authorised Firearms Officer,"" the Greater Manchester Police statement said.“It follows therefore, that subject to further forensic examination, this injury may sadly have been sustained as a tragic and unforeseen consequence of the urgently required action taken by my officers to bring this vicious attack to an end,” the statement added.The incident unfolded on Thursday outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue, where worshippers had gathered for Yom Kippur. Two people were killed and three others seriously wounded after a car was driven at a crowd, followed by a stabbing.Police had initially said the suspect was ""believed dead"" after being shot. A bomb squad was later deployed amid fears the attacker was carrying explosives.The two victims were identified as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. Three others remain in hospital in serious condition.The assault took place Thursday morning in Crumpsall, a Manchester suburb, as worshippers gathered for Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.Police said a suspect rammed a car into pedestrians outside the Orthodox synagogue before attacking them with a knife. He was shot dead by armed officers seven minutes later. The attacker was wearing what appeared to be an explosives belt, later confirmed to be fake.Police identified the suspect as Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, a British citizen of Syrian origin who moved to the UK as a child and obtained citizenship in 2006. Authorities are still verifying whether “Al-Shamie” is his birth name. The case is being investigated as a terrorist incident, though the motive remains unclear.Three people – two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s – have been arrested on suspicion of preparing or assisting acts of terrorism. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the attacker had not previously been known to police or to Prevent, the UK’s counter-radicalisation programme. “It’s too early to say whether he acted alone or as part of a wider network,” she said.Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis condemned the attack as the product of “an unrelenting wave of Jew hatred.” Writing on social media, he said: “This is the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come.”Political and religious leaders have pledged reassurance to Britain’s 300,000-strong Jewish community following the attack.","One of the victims of the synagogue attack in Manchester may have been fatally shot by officers.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed that the attack outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Manchester was a targeted terrorist act against Jews. Speaking after chairing an emergency meeting in London, cutting short his trip to a European summit in Denmark. Starmer described the incident as “a vile terrorist attack” motivated by antisemitism.Two Jewish men were killed and three others seriously injured in the Thursday attack. Police confirmed the victims were targeted specifically because of their faith.Starmer also addressed the public on X (formerly Twitter), writing: “This was a vile terrorist attack that attacked Jews, because they are Jews. Antisemitism is a hatred that is rising, once again. Britain must defeat it, once again. To every Jewish person in this country: I promise that I will do everything in my power to guarantee you the security you deserve.”The attack is being treated as a suspected antisemitic terror attack , with authorities alleging that the assailant deliberately targeted and killed Jewish people.Police identified the attacker as a UK citizen of Syrian origin, who was shot dead by armed officers within minutes of the first emergency call.Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the man was wearing a vest resembling an explosive device, which was later confirmed to be fake. He has been named by the police as Jihad Al-Shamie.Within hours of the attack, three other people, two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s, were arrested on suspicion of terror-related offenses, as reported by AFP.The incident unfolded on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, and was declared a terrorist incident by counter-terror officers. Many Orthodox Jewish worshippers, observing Yom Kippur without phones or computers, only learned of the attack after sundown.The attacker reportedly drove into a crowd gathered outside the Synagogue before launching a stabbing spree, leaving multiple victims seriously wounded, according to AFP. A woman who also identified as a Jew and lives next door to the synagogue said that as soon as the suspect got out of the car, he ""started stabbing anyone near him,"" reported BBC.Chief Constable Stephen Watson said the attacker first rammed a car into people gathered outside the synagogue before stabbing victims with a knife. Officers opened fire after issuing warnings, preventing the suspect from entering the building. “They gave him a couple of warnings, he didn't listen until they opened fire,"" the witness told AFP.GMP said they received an alert shortly after 9:30 AM (0830 GMT) that a car had driven into people outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue and that a security guard had been attacked with a knife. They praised the residents for alerting them swiftly, saying the response prevented an even greater tragedy.Two prominent Jewish organizations in the UK told CNN that the attack at the synagogue was sadly something they feared was coming. “As we emerge from the fast of Yom Kippur, the holiest day in our calendar, many in our community will only now be learning of the horrific attack on Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation in Manchester,” a joint statement from the Jewish Leadership Council and Board of Deputies of British Jews said. They called on those in positions of power and influence to take strong action to combat hatred against the Jewish community and reiterated their support for the authorities in protecting their people.The attack has drawn global condemnation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it a “barbaric attack,” while Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar accused British authorities of failing to curb antisemitic and anti-Israel incitement. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the targeting of a synagogue on Yom Kippur as “particularly heinous,” and King Charles III and Queen Camilla said they were “deeply shocked and saddened”, reported AFP.The incident comes just days before the second anniversary of Hamas’s October 7 assault on Israel, which triggered the ongoing Gaza war. Analysts noted it was among the worst antisemitic attacks in Europe since then.Manchester, home to more than 28,000 Jews according to 2021 data, has faced grievously deadly terror attacks before, strikingly the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing that killed 22 people.",UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the attack was a targeted terrorist act against Jews.

A 65-year-old British Pakistani man, known as Boss Man, a grooming gang ringleader, was sentenced to 35 years in prison for raping two schoolgirls in Rochdale.Mohammed Zahid, father of three children, who showed a ""chilling disregard"" for the girls, was one of seven men convicted in June of committing a range of sexual offences between 2001 and 2006. He gave the girls free underwear from his market stall, expecting regular sex for him and his friends in return, BBC reported.Mushtaq Ahmed, 67, Kasir Bashir, 50, Mohammed Shahzad, 44, Naheem Akram, 49, Nisar Hussain, 41, and Roheez Khan, 39, also received lengthy prison sentences at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court.The court heard how the girls were sexually exploited from the age of 13 in filthy flats, car parks, alleyways, and disused warehouses in the Greater Manchester town.Referred to as Girl A and Girl B, they were treated as ""sex slaves"" and expected to ""have sex with the men whenever and wherever they wanted."" Both girls, who were not acquainted with each other, had ""deeply troubled home lives"" and were provided with drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, and places to stay by the men, the court was told.During the sentencing, Judge Jonathan Seely described the treatment of the girls by the ""predatory"" men as ""appalling.""He said, ""They were abused, degraded and then discarded. It would have been obvious to these men that they craved the attention that their home lives didn't provide. They felt they had little or no choice but to submit to the almost incessant sexual abuse meted out to them.""All the paedophiles worked either at the market or as taxi drivers, the court heard.Girl A informed the jury that she may have been preyed on by hundreds of men as her phone number was circulated, adding, ""there was that many it was hard to keep count."" She told local children's services in 2004 that she was ""hanging around"" with groups of older men, drinking and smoking cannabis, the court was told.Girl B, who was residing in a children's home when she encountered the men at the market, claimed that police and social workers were aware of the situation but ""weren't concerned enough to do anything about it.""She said, ""It was in my file, when I looked it up. I read it. I was picked up by the police for loitering and prostituting from the age of 10."" Social services and police have previously apologised for their past failings regarding the girls.The convictions and sentences in full were as follows: - Pakistan-born Mohammed Zahid of Station Road, Crumpsall, was convicted of raping Girl A and Girl B, indecency with a child, and procuring a child to have sex and was jailed for 35 years.Mushtaq Ahmed, 67, of Corona Avenue, Oldham, and Kasir Bashir, 50, of Napier Street East, Oldham, both born in Pakistan, were convicted of repeated counts of rape and indecency with a child in relation to Girl B and were jailed for 27 and 29 years respectively.Mohammed Shahzad, 44, of Beswicke Royds Street, Rochdale; Naheem Akram, 49, of Manley Road, Rochdale; and Nisar Hussain, 41, of New Field Close, Rochdale, were convicted of repeated counts of rape against Girl A and were jailed for 26, 26, and 19 years respectively.Pakistan-born Roheez Khan, 39, of Athole Street, Rochdale, was found guilty of a single count of rape against Girl A and jailed for 12 years. In 2016, Zahid was jailed for five years after being convicted of engaging in sexual activity in 2005 and 2006 with a 14-year-old girl whom he met when she visited his stall to buy tights for school. Bashir was sentenced in his absence after he absconded while on bail before the trial commenced.Detective Chief Inspector Guy Laycock from Greater Manchester Police stated that the men ""preyed on the girls' vulnerability for their own depraved sexual gain."" He added, ""This horrific abuse knew no limits, despite their denials throughout this lengthy investigation and court case.They had a callous disregard for these women when they were girls and continue to show no remorse for their unforgivable actions all these years later.""Liz Fell, specialist prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, commended the men for exploiting the teenagers' ""difficult circumstances"" and praised the victims for coming forward. She said, ""Both victims have shown an enormous amount of strength and dignity throughout what has been a lengthy and challenging legal process.""","Mohammed Zahid, 65, jailed for 35 years for raping two schoolgirls in Rochdale. He was one of seven men convicted in June of committing a range of sexual offences.

Australia adds Twitch to the under-16 ban as rules tighten for online safety







Australia is making a big change to protect kids online, and now Twitch is part of that plan. The government has decided that children under 16 will not be allowed to use Twitch anywhere in the country. This rule will start on December 10, 2025, and Twitch will stop new under-16 accounts from that date. Old accounts that belong to under-16 users will also be removed later. Australia already added Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, X, Snapchat, Facebook and Threads to this list earlier, and now Twitch is being added too.The rule comes from a plan first shared by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in 2024. He said age checks are needed to keep kids safe on the internet. Officials said Twitch works like a social media site because it has live chat and people talk and share things in real time. The government also said platforms that do not follow the rule may face very big fines.Australia says this ban is needed because many kids spend too much time online and may see unsafe things. The government wants stronger age checks so children under 16 cannot make accounts. Authorities said Twitch fits the meaning of a social platform because users talk, chat, stream, and also interact with strangers.This is why Twitch will now follow the same rules as other big apps.Twitch will block new accounts for kids under 16 starting December 10, 2025, and the old accounts of kids will be removed later to meet the rules. Other platforms like Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, X, Snapchat, Threads and Facebook already got the same notice earlier this year.The Australian government said any platform that does not take steps to stop under-16 users may face fines of up to 50 million dollars. This shows how serious the country is about keeping kids safe online.Officials said more platforms may be added soon, as they are still checking how young users interact on different sites. They want companies to take full responsibility and make sure children do not enter unsafe spaces. This rule also makes it clear what counts as a social media site today, even when apps are used for gaming or watching live streams.The ban is part of a bigger plan to make sure all online spaces are safe for children. It also shows that Australia wants strong control over how young users use the internet and how companies protect them.Also Read: Candace Owens Raises Heat While Claiming Erika Kirk Is On Autopilot And Holds No Verifiable Lies After Charlie Kirk Was Killed","Australia adds Twitch to the under-16 ban as rules tighten for online safety.

TikTok Star Megan Farina, Who Mocked Charlie Kirk’s Death ‘Doxxed by MAGA,’ Now Fleeing Home

Megan Farina faces new backlash as users compare her Charlie Kirk video and her Trump criticism





TikToker Megan Farina is getting a new wave of anger online. This started again after she posted a new video where she yelled at Donald Trump and his supporters. Months ago, Megan Farina went viral when she danced and smiled after Charlie Kirk was killed. Many people were shocked by that video. Now, when she is attacking Trump for calling a woman “Piggy” and for his strong Truth Social posts about six Democratic Congress members, people online are calling her “a hypocrite.”The fight grew when conservative creator Collin Rugg shared her new clip on X. Many users wrote that she cannot celebrate someone’s death and then get upset over Trump’s words. They said she is now angry at name-calling but was fine joking about a man’s death. This has made her the center of online debate again, mostly among Trump supporters and MAGA users.Megan Farina first went viral in September after she made a TikTok where she danced and joked after Charlie Kirk was shot and killed. That video brought heavy hate toward her and even toward her boyfriend, whose business got hit with bad online reviews.In her new video, Megan Farina says she is tired of MAGA users calling her evil, ugly, and a bad person. She says she is “done” with the comments and does not want any more abuse in her TikTok section.She also talks about Trump’s “Piggy” remark. Trump had called a Bloomberg reporter “Piggy,” and Megan Farina asked how people can still support him after that.She also reacted to Trump’s Truth Social posts where he said a video by six Democratic members of Congress was “seditious behavior” and wrote that it was “punishable by death.”Online, many people pointed out that Megan Farina herself celebrated someone’s death but is now upset about Donald Trump’s words. Users on X posted things like, “You don’t celebrate a death one day and cry about a name the next.” Others said she can dislike Trump, but celebrating a killing is still wrong.The White House later said Trump does not want those Congress members to be executed. The press secretary said the video may break laws but did not mean Donald Trump was calling for hangings. Megan Farina has continued responding on TikTok, but each video brings more online anger and more debate.Also Read: Candace Owens Raises Heat While Claiming Erika Kirk Is On Autopilot And Holds No Verifiable Lies After Charlie Kirk Was Killed","TikTok star Megan Farina is getting a new wave of anger online.

Candace Owens questions the timeline involving Charlie Kirk and Tyler Robinson





Candace Owens opened her November 21 podcast by talking about the story of Charlie Kirk’s death. She told her viewers that the story people believe right now is, in her words, the “real conspiracy theory. ” She said the whole thing sounds like “totally crazy stuff” and warned her audience not to fall for it.Charlie Kirk was shot on September 10, 2025, while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem. A single bullet hit him while he was onstage. Police later said the shot came from a roof near the quad. Two days later, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson was turned in by his father and became the main suspect. Officials said his clothes matched the same look seen in CCTV video taken after the attack. Candace Owens said many parts of this accepted timeline do not feel right to her, and she told viewers she wanted to break down the story.Candace Owens said the first strange detail is that Tyler Robinson “did not attend UVU” and had “never been on UVU campus.” She asked how someone who had never been there suddenly climbed onto a roof, moved around the roof like “Spider-Man,” and knew exactly where Charlie Kirk would be standing.She also questioned how he took one perfect shot with a 30-06 rifle.Candace Owens then spoke about Robinson’s alleged partner, Lance Twiggs, who she said was a transgender individual and Robinson’s “lover.” She returned to a CCTV picture she had talked about before. It showed Robinson walking into a Dairy Queen right after the shot.She said it looked like he ran inside to hide and then texted Twiggs “every minute” about what he had done. Owens said the official story also claims Robinson kept texting Twiggs even when he went home later.She said these texts sound too neat and too perfect. She asked why a person would text all night instead of speaking face-to-face. Candace Owens also asked why someone called a “boy genius” with a 4.3 GPA would write down every moment of a crime in messages. She said this part alone “is the conspiracy theory.”Candace Owens also wondered why there is almost no public record of Robinson. She said he only appears online, does not show his face in court, and once said he might even be “just an AI app.” She said she is tired of people calling her work a conspiracy and believes the accepted story has more holes than answers.Also Read: Candace Owens raises heat while claiming Erika Kirk is on autopilot and holds no verifiable lies after Charlie Kirk was killed","Candace Owens calls the Charlie Kirk story crazy and questions the role of Tyler Robinson and his lover Lance Twiggs.

Ben Bader found unresponsive after workout, says Jupiter Police Department spokesperson Shawn Reed





Ben Bader, a 25-year-old TikTok star known for his simple lifestyle tips and money advice, died from complications of cardiovascular disease, according to the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner, as reported by TMZ. Ben Bader passed away on October 23 after a gym session at a private club in Jupiter, Florida.Police said he was found on the floor by another person at the gym and was not breathing. First responders tried to save him, but he was later pronounced dead at the hospital. His death was ruled natural, and the medical examiner shared that genetic factors likely played a part. Police told the Daily Mail that an “active investigation” is still going on, and they have not ruled out foul play.The medical examiner's report said Ben had hardening and narrowing of the arteries, a serious heart problem he did not know about. He was believed to be healthy and only had some back and shoulder pain, which he was treating with physical therapy. The report also said codeine was found in his urine but not in his blood, and it did not play a role in his death.Ben Bader was working out at his community gym when he got off the treadmill.About eight minutes later, another gym member found him on the floor. Shawn Reed, spokesperson for the Jupiter Police Department, said Ben was found “unresponsive” at Admiral’s Cove, a private members' club. Reed said Ben was not breathing when people found him, and lifesaving steps were done right away.Ben Bader was taken to a hospital, but doctors could not save him. His girlfriend, Reem, said on TikTok that he passed “extremely suddenly.” She said she had talked to him on FaceTime just hours earlier and he looked happy and normal. The two were supposed to go on a dinner date that same night, and Reem said there were “no signs” that anything was wrong.Reem shared a long, emotional message, calling Ben the “kindest” and “most caring” person she had ever met. She said he was loved by everyone and always stayed positive. She told her followers to hold their loved ones close because “life is unforgiving sometimes.”Ben Bader had celebrated his 25th birthday only a month earlier on September 22. His family, in a statement shared with TMZ, said Ben was a “visionary” who lived with love and helped many people online. They said he was born early at 28 weeks and touched many lives with his kind heart.Ben Bader was known on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, with over 200,000 followers across his pages.

From ‘communist lunatic’ to ‘rational person': Donald Trump takes a U-turn on Zohran Mamdani,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-communist-lunatic-to-rational-person-donald-trump-takes-a-u-turn-on-zohran-mamdani/articleshow/125497178.cms,"A surprisingly cordial Oval Office meeting between Trump and Mamdani

Trump ‘Takes U-Turn’ After Zohran Mamdani ‘Openly Dares’ US President Inside Oval Office | Watch

Months of hostility during the NYC race

Insults set aside in a moment of political pragmatism

Commitment to cooperation going forward





In one of the most dramatic political reversals of the year, President Donald Trump struck an unexpectedly warm tone toward New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani during a meeting at the White House — just weeks after denouncing him as a “communist lunatic” and threatening to cut off federal funding if he won the election. The shift has surprised everyone who had expected a tense encounter, given the bitter exchanges of the campaign. Instead, Trump described Mamdani as a “rational person”, praised his vision for New York and signalled a willingness to work closely with him on affordability and public safety — a remarkable U-turn from the hostility he projected throughout the mayoral race.The highly anticipated meeting delivered none of the fireworks that had been predicted. Instead, Trump appeared eager to reassure the mayor-elect, repeatedly emphasising areas of agreement and mutual concern. He congratulated Mamdani on his election victory and told reporters:“I expect to be helping him, not hurting him.”The president even said he would feel “comfortable” living under a Mamdani administration — a statement that raised eyebrows considering his earlier threats to punish New York financially. Mamdani, who had previously branded Trump a “fascist” and a “despot”, focused instead on shared priorities and avoided engaging in past grievances.The scenes in the Oval Office marked a stark contrast to the ferocious tone of the New York mayoral campaign.During the race, Trump repeatedly attacked Mamdani, calling him a “communist lunatic” and warning that federal funding to the city would be withdrawn if he became mayor. Right-wing commentators amplified the criticism, painting Mamdani — a self-described democratic socialist — as a dangerous ideologue.Mamdani retaliated forcefully, accusing Trump of promoting a “fascist agenda” and using the presidency to intimidate New York voters. He argued that Trump’s rhetoric was an attempt to shift attention from the affordability crisis gripping the city.Mamdani later admitted that a sizeable number of Trump voters had approached him with concerns about costs, housing and public transit — issues that shaped the core of his platform.Trump, too, acknowledged these overlapping voter anxieties during the meeting. He said the pair found “unexpected alignment” on key subjects including cost of living, crime and economic pressure on working families. He even suggested Mamdani might “surprise some conservative people”, signalling a softer, more pragmatic view of the mayor-elect.Reporters did not shy away from raising past hostilities. When Mamdani was asked whether he stood by calling Trump a “fascist”, the president intervened, lightly tapping him on the arm and quipping: “You can just say yes — it’s easier.” Mamdani obliged with a brief “OK, yes,” prompting Trump to add:“I’ve been called much worse than a despot.”Trump softened his own prior remarks as well, insisting that Mamdani’s views were only “a little out there” and saying both men had changed in their approach. The exchange underscored both leaders’ desire to avoid reviving past disputes in front of cameras.Both Trump and Mamdani ultimately stressed their intention to work together on shared priorities. They highlighted affordability, housing, food costs, public safety and immigration enforcement as key areas for collaboration. Although ideological differences remain, the pair emphasised their mutual commitment to serving New Yorkers.Trump ended the meeting by expressing confidence in Mamdani’s leadership:“If he could be a spectacular success, I’d be very happy. I’ll be cheering for him.”","President Donald Trump struck an unexpectedly warm tone toward New York mayor- elect Zohran Mamdani during a meeting at the White House.

Morning fog and safety alerts

Cloudy and dusty conditions





Slight temperature drop









Fog thickened over parts of Abu Dhabi and extended into Dubai early on Friday, creating challenging conditions on the roads and slowing visibility to under a kilometre in several spots. Alongside the fog, cooler air, shifting clouds and light dust defined the morning atmosphere, forming a mix of weather elements that led UAE authorities to issue safety alerts and advise motorists to drive with extra care through the first half of the day.Dense fog settled over several parts of Abu Dhabi and extended into areas of Dubai early on November 21, sharply reducing visibility for motorists. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) issued red and yellow alerts to signal varying levels of fog intensity, cautioning that visibility could dip below 1,000 metres in affected coastal and inland zones.Authorities reinforced the warnings with an advisory urging drivers to slow down, maintain safe distances, and remain alert on the roads. The alerts were placed in effect until 10:30am, the window during which fog and mist were expected to persist.Alongside the fog, the NCM noted that the day would bring partly cloudy skies with occasional dust, particularly in open areas. Low clouds were forecast to form westward over the sea and islands, contributing to changing visibility and muted daylight during the early hours.These cloud formations were expected to shift gradually as the day progressed.Friday also marked a modest decline in temperatures, most noticeable along the coastal stretches. The cooler shift accompanied the fog and cloud cover, creating milder conditions compared to previous days. The temperature dip, though slight, aligned with a broader trend of seasonal transition across the region.","Dense winter fog blanketed Abu Dhabi and Dubai, reducing visibility below 1,000 metres.

‘THIS IS VIOLENCE’: Global Backlash As Brazil Opens Amazon To Oil Drilling On COP30 Eve





A fire broke out at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, on Thursday, forcing thousands of delegates to evacuate and halting negotiations at a critical moment in the two-week conference.Ironically, the blaze appears to have been caused by electrical equipment, likely a microwave — showing that even a summit dedicated to climate action doesn’t always follow its own rules.The blaze began around 2.00 pm (1700 GMT) in an exhibition pavilion. Security footage later showed flames racing up an internal fabric shell lining the walls and ceiling, burning a hole through the roof as smoke filled the corridors and people ran for the exits shouting “fire!”Firefighters said the incident was brought under control within six minutes. Nineteen people were treated for smoke inhalation and two for anxiety, according to the Brazilian presidency of the event.Firefighters and ambulances arrived with sirens blaring as smoke rose from the tents and permanent buildings hosting diplomats, journalists, and activists. The affected area was sealed off with a large sheet, and delegates were escorted in one by one to retrieve belongings, including passports needed for evening flights.Plenary sessions will not resume until Friday.It was the third major incident since the summit began last week, following peaceful demonstrations by Indigenous protesters who first stormed the venue and later blockaded the entrance. COP30 hosts Brazil and United Nations Climate Change said in a joint statement that security responded “swiftly” and the blaze was controlled quickly.After a fire department inspection, Brazil declared the site reopened at 8.40 pm.The disruption hit at a delicate stage in the negotiations, with ministers struggling to break a deadlock over fossil fuels, climate finance, and trade measures. Delegates remain divided over Brazil’s proposed “roadmap” to transition away from fossil fuels, as well as concerns about weak emissions-reduction plans and funding for developing nations.Earlier in the day, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned negotiators that “the world is watching” and urged them to reach an “ambitious compromise.” He also welcomed calls for clarity on the disputed issue of weaning the world off fossil fuels.With less than 24 hours before the summit’s scheduled end, nearly 200 countries are still working to reach consensus. Brazil has described securing a final deal as vital to accelerating global climate action and turning years of promises into meaningful progress.","A fire broke out at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, on Thursday, forcing thousands of delegates to evacuate.

NEW DELHI: A 5.5-magnitude earthquake struck central Bangladesh on Friday, killing at least six people and injuring several, AP reported citing officials. The quake, which shook buildings in Dhaka and sent residents fleeing outdoors, was felt across several parts of the country and in neighbouring regions of India including Kolkata.Also read: West Bengal: Strong tremors jolt Kolkata; no damage reported yet The US Geological Survey said the earthquake occurred at 10:38 am, with the epicentre located in the Ghorashal area of Narsingdi district, about 25 kilometres from Dhaka, at a depth of 10 kilometres. Dhaka-based DBC Television reported that six people died in the capital, including three who were killed when a roof and a wall collapsed, and three pedestrians who were struck by falling building railings.Authorities said the tremors caused significant panic in Dhaka, one of the world’s most densely populated cities with more than 30,000 people per square kilometre. Bangladesh’s central region is typically less seismically active than the north and southeast, where interactions between the India and Eurasia plates make earthquakes more common.A separate update from ANI said a 5.5-magnitude quake near Narsingdi was felt widely across Dhaka around 10:40 am and also in parts of India including West Bengal and areas of the northeast.The USGS recorded the event at 10:08 am IST. As per the ANI report, “There have been no reports of casualties or damage so far,” though later official updates confirmed fatalities in the capital.Last month, Bangladesh recorded a magnitude 3.4 earthquake, according to the National Centre for Seismology. Experts note that shallow earthquakes can produce stronger surface shaking because seismic waves travel a shorter distance.Citing USGS figures, The Daily Star reported that a magnitude 4.0 earthquake releases energy equivalent to about 6 tons of TNT, while a magnitude 5.0 quake corresponds to around 200 tons. The energy rises steeply with each magnitude, with a 7.0 quake equalling nearly 199,000 tons of TNT and a 9.0 quake releasing about 99 million tons, comparable to roughly 25,000 nuclear bombs.Bangladesh sits at the junction of the Indian, Eurasian and Burma plates, which move several centimetres each year. The country is intersected by major faults including the Bogura, Tripura, Shillong Plateau, Dauki and Assam faults, placing it within 13 recognised earthquake-prone zones. Regions such as Chattogram, the Chattogram Hill Tracts and Jaintiapur in Sylhet fall within the highest-risk category.Visuals from Dhaka on Friday showed emergency teams assessing damage as authorities monitored aftershocks and structural impacts across the capital.(With inputs from AP and ANI)","A 5.5-magnitude earthquake struck central Bangladesh on Friday, killing at least six people.

'Boycott politics never work': South Africa President reacts to Trump's no-show at G20; US fires sharp response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boycott-politics-never-work-south-africa-president-reacts-to-trumps-no-show-at-g20-us-fires-sharp-response/articleshow/125476117.cms,"‘WATCH YOUR TONE!’: Leavitt FUMES After Ramaphosa 'Laughs' At Trump’s Last-minute G20 ‘Scramble’





South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday said the United States had shown signs of reconsidering its G20 boycott, calling it a “positive sign” and insisting that “boycott politics never work,” even as the White House dismissed his claim as “fake news” and accused him of “running his mouth. ”“In a way, we see this as a positive sign because, as I’ve often said, boycott politics never work. It’s always best to be inside the tent than being outside of the tent,” the President added.Ramaphosa said Pretoria had received a last-minute communication suggesting Washington might participate “in one shape or form or other” at the Johannesburg summit. “We have received notice from the United States, a notice which we are still in discussions with them over, about a change of mind, about participating in one shape or form or other in the summit,” he said. “This comes at the late hour before the summit begins. And so therefore, we do need to engage in those types of discussions to see how practical it is and what it finally really means.”The White House rejected any suggestion of a reversal. A senior official said only the acting ambassador, Marc D Dillard, would attend the ceremonial handover of the G20 presidency. “This is fake news. The chargé d'affaires in Pretoria will attend the handover ceremony as a formality, but the United States is not joining G20 discussions,” the official said.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reinforced Washington’s position. “The United States is not participating in official talks at the G20 in South Africa,” she said. She added: “I saw the South African president running his mouth a little bit against the United States and the president of the United States earlier today, and that language is not appreciated by the president or his team.” She noted that Dillard would only “receive that send off at the end of the event” and would not “participate in official talks. ”Ramaphosa reiterated that the United States “needs to be here,” saying: “The United States, being the biggest economy in the world, needs to be here. So it's pleasing to hear that there is a change of approach.”The US boycott follows allegations from Washington that South Africa discriminates against white people and Trump’s claims of violence against white Afrikaner farmers, assertions widely rejected in South Africa. Pretoria said Washington also pressured it not to issue a joint G20 declaration, arguing consensus would be impossible without the United States.Ramaphosa pushed back. “We will have a declaration. The talks are going extremely well. I’m confident we are moving towards a declaration, and they are now just dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s,” he said. “We will not be bullied. We will not agree to be bullied.”The US embassy had separately informed Pretoria that South Africa’s G20 agenda “run counter to the US policy views and we cannot support consensus on any documents negotiated under your presidency.”The summit, the first hosted by an African nation, focuses on debt relief for low-income countries, a just energy transition and securing critical minerals. While leaders including Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Javier Milei skipped the event, they sent delegations.Political tensions between the two countries have intensified during Trump’s second term, with high US tariffs on South African goods, Pretoria’s ambassador being expelled and Washington also boycotting the COP30 climate talks in Brazil.Despite the diplomatic friction, US business interests in South Africa remain strong, with more than 600 American companies operating in the country. “The US Chamber of Commerce will use our B20 leadership to foster international collaboration,” chamber head Suzanne Clark said.G20 ambassador Xolisa Mabhongo summed up the stand-off, saying: “The only country that is not in the room is the United States and, of course, it is their choice not to be in the room.”","South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the United States had shown signs of reconsidering its G20 boycott. He said Pretoria had received a last-minute communication suggesting Washington might participate “in one shape or form or other” The White House rejected any suggestion of a reversal, saying only the acting ambassador would attend the ceremonial handover of the G20 presidency.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125477077,imgsize-20624,width-400,resizemode-4/president-of-south-africa-cyril-ramaphosa.jpg"

Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene — once one of Donald Trump ’s most loyal and outspoken allies — is stepping down from Congress, bringing an abrupt end to a turbulent political partnership that has collapsed in public view.On Friday evening (US local time), she announced she will leave office on 5 January 2026, citing deep frustration with Republican leadership and the direction of Washington. Her decision comes days after a public clash with Trump over her support for releasing the Epstein files.In a four-page statement, the Georgia Republican said the legislative branch has been “sidelined” and accused her party’s leaders of refusing to move forward on conservative priorities such as border security and “America First” policies.“No matter which way the political pendulum swings, Republican or Democrat, nothing ever gets better for the common American man or woman,” Greene said. She added that when people understand that “the Political Industrial Complex of both parties is ripping this country apart” and that leaders like her cannot stop “Washington’s machine,” they will realise “they, common Americans, The People, possess the real power over Washington,” and she said she would stand with them “to rebuild it.""I look forward to a new path ahead,"" Greene added.As she prepares to leave the House of Representatives, US media reports, as cited by BBC, suggest she may pursue state office — either the Georgia governorship or a Senate seat.Last week, Greene said she had been contacted by private security firms “with warnings for my safety” after Trump withdrew his support for her. In a post on X, she said “a hot bed of threats against me are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world,” calling him “the man I supported and helped get elected.”Their relationship soured after she joined a small group of Republicans supporting the release of all government-held files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Trump was initially against the legislation but reversed his position when it became clear Greene and other Republicans would join Democrats to pass it.In recent months, she has criticised Trump and Republican leaders on several issues, saying they were not doing enough to lower costs for voters and questioning whether Trump was still putting “America First” due to his focus on foreign policy. She also faulted him for refusing to release the Epstein documents, noting that the president “could have ordered their release at any time.”Trump responded in multiple posts calling Greene a “traitor” and “wacky” and vowing to support a challenger for her seat. The measure requiring the Justice Department to release the Epstein files passed Congress on Tuesday, and Trump signed it into law on Wednesday.",Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene announced she will leave office on 5 January 2026.

Trump ‘Takes U-Turn’ After Zohran Mamdani ‘Openly Dares’ US President Inside Oval Office | Watch

US president Trump met New York City's mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani at the Oval Office on Friday, and the mood was far warmer than anyone expected. They both spoke about shared goals for New York City instead of their usual fights.During the press interaction, a reporter asked Mamdani if he still believed Trump was a fascist. Mamdani had barely started to reply, "" I've spoken about"", when Trump cut in, lightly patted his arm and said, “That’s okay. You can just say yes. It’s easier than explaining. I don’t mind.”Another reporter pressed Trump on Republican leader Elise Stefanik’s claim that Mamdani was a “jihadist.” Trump immediately shut it down. “No, I don’t,” he said when asked if he thought he was standing next to one. “I met with a man who is a very rational person.”Trump had previously called Mamdani a “100% Communist lunatic” and a “nut job.” Mamdani had framed himself as “Donald Trump’s worst nightmare.” But on Friday, both avoided personal blows and focused on affordability in New York, housing, groceries, and rising utility costs- issues that shaped both their campaigns.Trump brushed aside old clashes, including Mamdani’s criticism of deportation raids. He joked he had been called “much worse than a despot.” He also stepped in to defend Mamdani when reporters questioned why he flew to Washington instead of taking transportation that used less fossil fuels, saying, “I’ll stick up for you.”Mamdani said he had requested the meeting to discuss making New York more affordable. Trump admitted he had earlier warned he might pull federal funds if they did not “get along,” but said he no longer expected that to happen.Mamdani’s incoming chief of staff later told NY1 the two leaders still disagreed on many things but found common ground on safety and reducing crime.Trump had played a major role in the mayoral race. He endorsed Andrew Cuomo, questioned Mamdani’s citizenship and even suggested he could have him arrested if he refused to work with immigration agents. Mamdani, born in Uganda and now a naturalised American citizen, defeated Cuomo by arguing he would “stand up to Donald Trump.”","US president Trump met New York City's mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani at the Oval Office on Friday.

Why the meeting matters for New York City

National and symbolic significance





The meeting between New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and US President Donald Trump has drawn national attention because of the sharp ideological division between them and their long history of public hostility. Trump has previously called Mamdani a “communist lunatic” and threatened to withhold federal funding from New York if he won. Now, in their first face-to-face meeting, both leaders are signalling a willingness to talk, marking a pivotal moment of potential cooperation despite deep political antagonism.Mamdani, a democratic socialist, campaigned on policies focused on affordability and expanded public services, while Trump promotes a conservative national agenda that prioritises stricter immigration enforcement, reduced federal spending and business-focused growth. During the election, Trump supported Mamdani’s opponent and publicly criticised Mamdani’s proposals. Their upcoming meeting marks a change in tone after a period marked by sharp political exchanges from both sides.Despite their ideological gulf, Mamdani enters the meeting with a clearly practical agenda focusing on New York’s affordability crisis, housing and transit funding, public safety and federal support for social programmes.His willingness to engage with Trump reflects the realities of governance, where city and federal interests often intersect. At the same time, Trump has the opportunity to address voter concerns about the cost of living and safety, which could influence federal-city relations moving forward.For Mamdani, the meeting raises his national profile and signals that he is prepared to engage across political divides. For Trump, sitting down with a political rival who has criticised him publicly shows a strategic effort to address urban issues and broaden his reach. Together, this encounter illustrates that even strong political opponents may still engage on shared challenges in a deeply divided political climate.",The meeting between New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and US President Donald Trump has drawn national attention because of the sharp ideological division between them.

US President Donald Trump on Friday said he expects a “civil” and “fine” meeting with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, despite their sharp political differences and earlier clashes on the campaign trail.Speaking on the Brian Kilmeade show on Fox News Radio, Trump said he gives Mamdani credit for running a “good race” and believes they share at least one goal. “Look, we’re looking for the same thing. We want to make New York strong,” Trump said. “And you know, there’s such a different philosophy. But I’ll let you know. I’ll let you know over the next year.”Mamdani is a democratic socialist who arrived in Washington for the Oval Office meeting. Trump said the encounter should be “quite civil”, adding, “You’ll find out.”The president was also asked about Mamdani’s election-night remark in which the 34-year-old said, “Turn the volume up,” while speaking to Trump through cameras. Trump said he found the line unclear. “He has to be careful when he says that to me,” Trump said. “I said, ‘What does that mean? Turn the volume up. Does that mean? Let’s go at it?’ I don’t think so.He was very nice in calling.”Trump noted the meeting is set for 3 pm and said he plans to allow reporters in. “I would think so. He’s a politician, so I don’t think he has a problem. The one thing I notice about politicians is the answer is always, ‘Yes’ – other than with Biden,” he said.Before the election, Trump repeatedly attacked Mamdani as a “communist” and warned he could withhold federal funds if he won. The POTUS even endorsed Mamdani's rival Andrew Cuomo in the NYC race saying he would rather have a ""bad Democrat"" than a ""communist"" in the city.","US President Donald Trump said he expects a 'civil' meeting with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, despite their sharp political differences and earlier clashes on the campaign trail.

Surgeon named Jeffrey Epstein is mistakenly dragged into Epstein files scandal by Congresswoman; here's what he said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/surgeon-named-jeffrey-epstein-is-mistakenly-dragged-into-epstein-files-scandal-by-congresswoman-heres-what-he-said/articleshow/125492548.cms,"



A neurosurgeon who happens to share a name with one of the world’s most notorious criminals has fired back after being dragged into a political row by mistake.Dr Jeffrey Epstein, a respected Long Island doctor, was publicly implicated by Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett to be the late sex trafficker and pedophile during a speech. This made the medical expert angry for and he crafted a plan for revenge.Crockett told Congress this week she was “gonna expose it all” after spotting donations from “somebody named Jeffrey Epstein” to former New York congressman Lee Zeldin. She suggested the contributions came from Epstein, even though the donations were made in 2020, long after the convicted offender died in jail in 2019.According to FEC records, Dr Jeffrey Epstein — the neurosurgeon, not the disgraced financier — donated $1,000 to Lee Zeldin in April and August 2020. When Democrats questioned Zeldin about why “Jeffrey Epstein” appeared in his filings, he responded: “Yes, Crockett, a physician named Dr. Jeffrey Epstein (who is a totally different person than the other Jeffrey Epstein) donated to a prior campaign of mine,” Zeldin wrote.Speaking to The New York Post, the real Dr Epstein said he had never faced such an accusation until Crockett’s comments. “Until she said something, it was never an issue,” he said.While people sometimes react to his name because of the deeds of the infamous criminal Epstein, he added that he normally plays it down. “I say my name and sometimes people will give me a look, or whatever. I always look at them and say, ‘I don’t understand,’ and I make it like I’m dumb. ”The doctor joked about the perfect payback. “I think that I should contribute money to Jasmine Crockett and then let everybody know that she also took money from Jeffrey Epstein,” he said.He insisted he is unfazed by the bad title attached to his name. “Listen, that’s my name,” he said. “If my name was Jeffrey Dahmer when that whole thing came out, do you think that would be a problem? Listen, anytime a doppelganger is tied to a less-than-desirable, it’s never a good situation. But it doesn’t matter to me. I could[n’t] care less.”","Dr Jeffrey Epstein, a respected Long Island doctor, was publicly implicated by Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett to be the late sex trafficker and pedophile during a speech.

While Summers' spokesperson maintained that the trip occurred before Epstein's first arrest, revelations of additional flights on Epstein's plane and correspondence with the notorious pedophile have sparked a fierce backlash.





Ex-Harvard president Larry Summers is under fire after newly reported flight records revealed he and his wife travelled to Jeffrey Epstein’s private Caribbean island during their 2005 honeymoon, accompanied by the pedophile's right-hand woman, Ghislaine Maxwell.Summers is already in trouble due to his links to the convicted sex offender.Summers and his wife, Elisa F. New, flew from Massachusetts to Epstein’s island, Little Saint James, on December 21 2005, according to the Harvard Crimson. They travelled on Epstein’s jet, often referred to as the “Lolita Express” in media reports about his alleged trafficking network.A spokesperson for Summers confirmed the visit, telling the Harvard Crimson, “Mr. Summers and Ms. New spent their honeymoon in St. John and Jamaica in December 2005, which was long before Mr. Epstein was arrested for the first time. As part of that trip, they made a brief visit of less than a day to Mr. Epstein’s island.”The records also show that Summers took Epstein’s plane on three other occasions, with several trips occurring while he was serving as Harvard’s president between 2001 and 2006. Their December visit came only months after Palm Beach police had begun investigating Epstein for the rape of a 14-year-old girl.Summers also served as Treasury Secretary under President Bill Clinton. He resigned from the board of OpenAI on Wednesday as pressure mounted over his ties to Epstein. Within hours, he went on leave from both his teaching duties and his role as head of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center at Harvard Kennedy School.The row was further intensified when the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee released more than 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein’s estate. The material includes thousands of emails exchanged between Summers and Epstein from 2013 to 2019, with some messages discussing a woman Summers was interested in. The correspondence continued until the day before Epstein’s 2019 arrest.Epstein died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial. His death was officially ruled a suicide, but conspiracy theorists and some political commentators have long claimed he was killed to prevent him from revealing information about powerful figures such as Trump and Musk. Maxwell was later convicted on sex-trafficking charges and is currently serving a 20-year sentence in a low-security prison.","Larry Summers and his wife, Elisa F.

"Railin’ Nalin: Nikki Haley’ son, Punjab da grand-puttar, goes anti-immigrant",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/railin-nalin-nikki-haley-son-punjab-da-grand-puttar-goes-anti-immigrant/articleshow/125490616.cms,"file photo

The TOI correspondent from Washington





: In the swirling vortex of post-2024 American politics, where Donald Trump's second term has amplified the ""America First"" chorus, a surprisingly new contrarian voice has emerged from an unlikely “desi” family.Nalin Haley, the 24-year-old son of former U.N. Ambassador and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley , is rapidly ascending Republican ranks as a populist provocateur. His hardline stances on immigration—calling for an end to H-1B visas, limits on foreign students, and bans on naturalized citizens holding office (which would disqualify his grandfather) — have ignited a fierce debate whether he is a nepotistic outlier whose views betray his immigrant roots or if he embodies the raw frustrations of Gen-Z conservatives, many, like him, of immigrant origin.Born five days before 9/11 in South Carolina to Nikki (née Nimrata Randhawa) and Michael Haley, Nalin grew up in the shadow of his mother's meteoric rise in the GOP. His Sikh grandfather, Ajit Singh Randhawa, immigrated from Ludhiana in 1969, an agriculture scientist building an academic career at Voorhees College amid the era's anti-immigrant undercurrents. While Nikki Haley embraced Christianity in 1996 after her marriage even as she continued to practise the Sikh faith, her father remained a turbaned, practising Sikh till his death in 2024; Nalin was baptized in the Methodist church at his birth before converting to Catholicism during college.Two recent interviews in which Nalin has expressed unapologetically restrictionist views on immigration mark a stark political divergence from his mother, a polished internationalist who has long championed merit-based legal immigration as ""central to the American story,"" defending H-1B visas for skilled workers and rejecting blanket restrictions. But Nalin has not only called for ending the H-1B program and capping foreign students in universities—""some of them are spies for foreign governments,"" he also wants to stop legal immigration.In an interview with Tucker Carlson, he insisted ""naturalized citizens should not be able to hold public office"" because ""growing up here is a big part of understanding the country."" While railing against H1B visa, he wheeled out the familiar trope of foreign workers ""taking jobs that Americans can do"" amid AI disruptions and a ""fragile economy,"" citing his own friends -- ""All graduated, great degrees from great schools. .. not one of them has a job.""Nikki Haley has remained publicly silent on her son's insurgency, immigration defenders are horrified by his purported “betrayal.” British-Indian American journalist Mehdi Hasan, whose forbears hail from Hyderabad, and whom Nalin called for denaturalizing and deporting, calls his rhetoric ""hypocritical"" and xenophobic,” pointing out that his own Sikh grandfather faced anti-immigrant sentiments. Other critics also warn that his rhetoric endangers foreign-born naturalized lawmakers (19 in the current congress , including Pramila Jayapal and Raja Krishnamoorthi) and such views will eventually come back to bite immigrant legatees, particularly if they are not white.Nalin is unapologetic, arguing that the future of American Gen Z, even those of immigrant origin, lies in being nationalists and ignoring youth anger over ""wanting a job, affordable housing, and safe streets"" risks radicalization.Supporters hail him as a ""polished"" successor to firebrands like Charlie Kirk or even Nick Fuentes, but with broader appeal: Articulate, faith-infused, and focused on economic nationalism rather than fringe extremism. Some see him as a wingman for vice-president JD Vance, whom he has praised, amid talk of a possible run for Congress.","Nalin Haley, the 24-year-old son of former U.N.

Donald Trump’s worst nightmare









In a political moment few expected, two men who have spent the past year trading jabs from opposite ends of the ideological spectrum are about to sit across from each other for the first time. After months of insults, warnings and public sparring, President Donald Trump and New York City’s new mayor elect Zohran Mamdani will finally meet at the White House.Mamdani, a democratic socialist, shares little political ground with the Republican president, but he described the meeting as “an opportunity to make the case for New Yorkers,” saying he intends to raise issues of economic security and public safety. “I'll be ready for whatever happens,” Mamdani told CBS.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday, “President Trump is willing to meet with anyone and talk to anyone and to try to do what's right on behalf of the American people.”Mamdani used similar phrasing, noting that his team initiated the meeting “because I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the more than 8.5 million people who call this city home.”Still, their public remarks about one another have often been far sharper. Let us look at some of the very public jabs the two have thrown at each other.In his victory speech after winning the New York City mayoral race, Zohran Mamdani explicitly taunted President Trump. Addressing Trump by name, Mamdani told supporters, “Donald Trump… I have four words for you: turn the volume up!”. He followed with a defiant warning: “To get to any of us you will have to go through all of us.” He followed with a defiant warning: “To get to any of us you will have to go through all of us.”Donald Trump has increasingly leaned into branding Zohran Mamdani with a label he knows will land loudly. The president has repeatedly referred to Mamdani, who openly identifies as a democratic socialist, as a communist, cycling through variations like “my little communist mayor” and “a communist lunatic.” In June, he amplified the rhetoric further, posting: ""Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Dem Primary, and is on his way to becoming Mayor. We've had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous.""Mamdani, meanwhile, has directed his own criticism toward the former administration. After New York Mayor Eric Adams floated the idea of revising school bathroom policies, Mamdani publicly condemned the move and its echoes of federal hostility toward trans students. He tweeted: ""Awful and dangerous to hear the Mayor echo the transphobic bigotry coming from the Trump administration."" He followed with an additional statement: ""It's completely at odds with the values of our city. ""Donald Trump has also pushed speculation about Zohran Mamdani’s legal status — despite the fact that Mamdani is a naturalized US citizen. Born in Uganda and brought to New York City at age seven, Mamdani became a citizen in 2018, yet the president has publicly suggested otherwise. Over the summer, he claimed: ""A lot of people are saying he's here illegally,"" adding, ""We're going to look at everything.""Trump has further hinted at taking action if Mamdani attempts to block immigration enforcement efforts. If Mamdani were to interfere with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents carrying out arrests or deportations, the president said, ""Well then, we'll have to arrest him.""President Donald Trump had mocked New York City’s Mayor Zohran Mamdani, dismissively referring to him as “whatever the hell his name is” and declaring that the post-election choice facing Americans is now between “communism and common sense.”During the Democratic debate, Mamdani directly confronted Donald Trump, saying, “I am Donald Trump’s worst nightmare, as a progressive, Muslim immigrant who actually fights for the things I believe in.” He also attacked Trump’s immigration policies as authoritarian and criticised the billionaire donors backing Cuomo, calling them “the same billionaires that put Donald Trump in DC.”",President Donald Trump and New York City’s new mayor elect Zohran Mamdani will finally meet at the White House.

Loomer seized the opportunity to challenge Mamdani's authenticity as a self-proclaimed socialist, suggesting his travel choices contradicted his political stance.

Mamdani's Powerful Message To Trump Before White House Sit-Down





New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani found himself on the receiving end of yet another attack from right-wing commentator Laura Loomer after he posted a casual selfie from his seat on a plane.The photo was shared on his X accoun which appeared harmless. But Loomer immediately pounced.Replying to him, she wrote: “Why not just take the train? Also, is that First class? Such a man of the people…”The jab played into a recurring line of criticism from MAGA activists who insist that the self-described socialist mayor-elect is a hypocrite for using air travel instead of what they view as more modest, working-class transport. Loomer and others have repeatedly argued that Mamdani’s policies, including free public buses, taxing the rich, and rent freezes — are out of touch with “real Americans,” and have warned that New York City is “doomed” under his leadership.Last week, Loomer wrote online that Mamdani should be “denaturalized,” adding: “Only in America can an Islamic immigrant from Africa openly support terrorism, maintain their citizenship and become Mayor of America’s most iconic city.” She even claimed people were taking Polymarket bets on “whether or not Zohran Mamdani will be deported.”In May, she went further, posting: “Get ready for another 9/11,” while calling him a “pro-HAMAS Muslim socialist.”Despite her history of cotroversey, Loomer was recently credentialed to cover the US Department of Defence — a move that was not welcomed by many journalists and watchdogs who see it as part of a broader effort to reshape press access under the GOP administration.Mamdani’s campaign is mostly centred on housing affordability, public transport access, taxing the rich and working-class issues. He won the mayoral election in early November against independent candidate and former governor Andrew Cuomo.Mamdani is set to meet US President Donald Trump on Friday. The meeting is expected to cover crime, housing and federal-city cooperation.",New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani sparked controversy with a plane selfie that caught the ire of conservative pundit Laura Loomer.

Row erupts over Nikki Haley's son saying naturalised citizens should not hold office in US: 'Even our white nationalists are brown',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/row-erupts-over-nikki-haleys-son-saying-naturalised-citizens-should-not-hold-office-in-us-even-our-white-nationalists-are-brown/articleshow/125488582.cms,"'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers

Social media response:

America’s such a diverse and multicultural place that even our white nationalists are brown.

Even the racism has been outsourced to Indians.

The irony is wild, a name rooted in Sanskrit(Lotus)and a life rooted in classic American birthright rules. Nikki Haley parents weren’t even U.S. citizens when she was born, yet here we are getting lectures about who’s ‘American enough.’

Another nepo baby with nothing to offer except more ignorant rhetoric of ridiculousness. These politicians did not hug their children enough.

Someone should tell Nikki's son that many of the Founding Fathers were naturalized citizens.

Immature, naive and xenophobic. Good job Nikki!

He doesn’t realize the white supremicists are never going to accept him, does he?





Indian-origin Nikki Haley ’s son, Nalin Haley, stirred a row after suggesting that naturalised citizens should not be allowed to hold public office in the United States. His comments were made during a discussion about immigration and national identity with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson. Both Democrats and the MAGA base were torn on this remark as it undermines a lot of values that are laid out by the current modern Republican party.The debate began when the 24-year-old claimed that only those born in the United States should be eligible to run for public office, saying the country “needs leaders who were raised in the culture from birth.” Supporters argued that he was expressing a patriotic position, but critics countered that his view was unconstitutional and deeply out of step with the nation’s long history of welcoming immigrants into its political and civic life. Nalin also criticised the idea of dual citizenship, calling it “stupid” and arguing that a person is either American or not.Nikki Haley is herself the daughter of Indian immigrants and has not publicly endorsed or rejected her son’s remarks. Meanwhile, last week Nalin called for a ban on all H-1B visas, saying that immigrants are coming in and stealing jobs and opportunities from his friends in the States.The youngster’s remarks come at a time when H-1B visas remain a sensitive issue. Earlier this month, Donald Trump softened his stance on the programme, saying the US is in dire need of foreign skilled workers and lacks sufficient domestic talent. The shift sparked a wave of backlash from his once-loyal MAGA supporters, who now accuse Trump of betraying the “America First” agenda.","Indian-origin Nikki Haley ’s son, Nalin Haley, stirred a row after suggesting that naturalised citizens should not be allowed to hold public office in the United States.

People stand in huge lines to get stuffed into narrow seats with no leg room. The bathrooms are insanely tiny. Disembarking the plane is chaos. The food is barely food. But sure, the problem is wearing comfortable clothing and not dressing up





People are crammed into tiny seats, paying extra for basic comforts, and dealing with constant delays.. but the real crisis is sweatpants? Maybe fix the system before policing outfits

US transportation secretary Sean Duffy drew flak after suggesting that air travel would improve if passengers simply “smartened up” and dressed better.Speaking on Fox Business, Duffy promoted a new campaign urging travellers to “bring civility back” to airports. He said passengers should “be nice, say please, say thank you,” and even suggested a return to the days when people “didn’t wear pajamas to the airport.

Key Topics on the agenda

1. Affordability and the cost-of-living crisis

2. Economic security and federal aid

3. Public safety and immigration

Unequal footing?

Why this meeting matters





New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is set to meet President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday — an unexpected moment for two figures who have spent months taking jibes at each other. Mamdani’s team requested the meeting, and Trump agreed, saying he was willing to “work something out. ”The meeting is expected to be more than a polite handshake. Both sides see it as a chance to push their priorities on issues that will shape New York’s next four years. But it also comes with political baggage: Trump backed Mamdani’s rival Andrew Cuomo before the mayoral election, saying he would rather have a “bad Democrat” than a “communist” running the city.One of Mamdani’s top goals is to confront the cost-of-living crisis that many New Yorkers say has become unbearable. NYC is the wealthiest city in all of USA and housing costs, food prices, childcare and basic services are very expensive in general and Mamdani campaigned on the promise of making the city livable again. He has said repeatedly that the White House must work with the city, not against it, if affordability is to improve.“I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the more than 8.5 million people who call this city home,” he said ahead of the meeting.At the same time, he warned he would not hesitate to call out federal policies he believes harm New Yorkers: “If an agenda hurts New Yorkers, I will be the first to say so.”Despite their ideological clash, Mamdani knows Trump controls major federal resources. The mayor-elect is expected to push for continued or increased support in areas such as housing assistance, transit funding, and social safety programmes. His platform includes bold proposals like a rent freeze, expanded social services and public grocery stores — ideas that would rely heavily on federal cooperation.This creates an unusual dynamic: Mamdani is appealing to a president who has previously threatened to withhold funds from New York and has criticised soicalist and progressive leaders. That tension raises the stakes for both men, not just in the usual left-versus-right sense but also in the up-versus-down fight over power and leverage.Public safety is expected to feature prominently in the discussion. For the Indian-origin Mamdani, safety is tied to the broader social fabric — investment in mental health care, reforming crisis response systems, and making policing more transparent and community-driven. Trump’s approach has focused more on enforcement and stricter penalties, so the two may clash but could also find areas of mutual interest, such as federal support for mental health programmes or anti-gun trafficking initiatives.Immigration will be another flashpoint. Mamdani has always been critical of POTUS's border policies and enforcement methods but says he will defend the rights of immigrant New Yorkers while still engaging in dialogue. He has tried to frame the meeting as an opportunity to advocate rather than simply confront.Mamdani is may be entering the White House with a built-in disadvantage. Trump holds major leverage through control of federal funds and national platforms. He has previously taken aim at Mamdani personally, calling him a “communist” and suggesting the city would face consequences under his leadership. That history could influence how direct Mamdani chooses to be.Still, the meeting gives Mamdani a rare national spotlight. It presents a chance to demonstrate he can challenge Trump without shutting down cooperation entirely. His progressive base back at home expects him to stand firm, which means he must balance principle with pragmatism.For Mamdani, the meeting is about proving he can govern beyond ideology and fight for struggling New Yorkers. For Trump, it signals he is willing to sit down with a fierce critic while still keeping his leverage. The conservative MAGA audience — including figures like Laura Loomer, Ted Cruz, Eric Trump and Tucker Carlson — has consistently attacked Mamdani before and after his win in New York, which makes this a closely watched meeting for the conservative base as well.On the Democratic side, Mamdani has positioned himself as a potential bridge between different factions of the party — from the hard-left activists to the more traditional liberal Democrats. Senior figures such as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are also closely watching his rise, seeing him as a possible middle catalyst who can speak to both poles of the Democratic coalition.","New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is set to meet President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday.

Why the reaction is so intense

Why this matters

What the Democratic video actually said

What happens next

The larger picture





American politics has seen angry words, wild speeches and theatrical showdowns, but a sitting president accusing lawmakers of behaviour “punishable by death” has jolted Washington in a way few statements do. A video released by six Democratic lawmakers urging US service members to reject unlawful orders has triggered President Donald Trump’s most explosive and punitive response since taking office.Six Democratic lawmakers with military or intelligence backgrounds released a video reminding troops that they are legally allowed to disobey illegal or unconstitutional commands. Senator Mark Kelly, a former Navy captain and astronaut, says the law is clear that service members can refuse unlawful orders. The group argues that threats to the Constitution can come from inside the country and that the oath of service requires loyalty to the Constitution above everything else.The messaging was blunt, direct and framed as a constitutional safeguard.President Trump reacted with fury. He called the lawmakers “traitors”, described the video as “seditious behaviour at the highest level” and repeatedly suggested that such offences are “punishable by death”.He demanded their arrest, said an “example must be set” and amplified posts calling for the lawmakers to be hanged.For Trump and his allies, the video was interpreted as an attempt to undermine civilian control of the military by encouraging troops to question the legitimacy of presidential authority. The White House argued that telling 1.3 million service members to assess the legality of orders amounts to destabilising the chain of command.Republicans in Congress supported this reading, calling the Democrats’ video irresponsible and dangerous. They framed the president’s comments not as calls for execution but as a forceful description of potential legal consequences.Democrats, in turn, accused the president of issuing threats against elected officials. They argued that Trump’s rhetoric could endanger their safety at a moment when political tensions in the US are already high.The United States military operates on strict hierarchy, civilian oversight and legal clarity. Any messaging that appears to challenge that hierarchy draws immediate scrutiny. But any suggestion that a president is invoking death penalties against political opponents raises even more fundamental alarms.The debate is unfolding in a country acutely sensitive to political violence. Recent years have seen attempted assassinations, arson attacks on political leaders’ homes and the killing of lawmakers. Trump himself has survived two assassination attempts. As a result, language about treason, sedition and punishment carries a far sharper edge than normal partisan rhetoric.The lawmakers did not tell troops to defy the president. They told them to refuse unlawful commands if they ever arise. This is rooted in longstanding military law and the principle that soldiers cannot be compelled to carry out illegal orders. The video frames this as a way of protecting the Constitution against internal threats.They emphasised that no amount of intimidation or political pressure will deter them from upholding their constitutional duty. Their tone was resolute, but within legal boundaries.The matter is being reviewed at the federal level. Congressional leaders are coordinating with security agencies to ensure the targeted lawmakers and their families are protected. The White House is trying to steady the political fallout without backing away from the president’s core argument that the Democrats crossed a legal line.It remains extremely unlikely that any sedition charges will arise. The threshold for such a charge is high and the lawmakers’ video falls well within political speech protected by law. But the clash has sharpened questions about how far political rhetoric can go when national security and civilian control of the military are involved.At its core, the confrontation is about two competing ideas of loyalty. The Democratic message appeals to loyalty to the Constitution. The president’s response appeals to loyalty to the chain of command. Both ideas are foundational to American democracy. The clash between them is now playing out in the open.This episode also exposes the fragility of the moment. When routine constitutional reminders provoke talk of treason and death, it signals a political environment primed for escalation. In a country already anxious about violence and extremism, the tone of its leaders is not just rhetoric. It shapes public expectations and determines how combustible the months ahead may become.","Six Democratic lawmakers with military or intelligence backgrounds released a video reminding troops that they are legally allowed to disobey illegal or unconstitutional commands.

At least 15 workers were killed and seven others injured on Friday after a boiler exploded at a glue-making factory in Faisalabad, eastern Pakistan, authorities said. Police reported that the factory manager had been arrested, while the owner fled the scene shortly after the blast.The explosion occurred at the industrial unit in Punjab province, severely damaging the building and triggering a fire that spread panic across the neighbourhood. Local administrator Raja Jahangir said the cause of the blast was being investigated and confirmed that nearby homes had also been affected.Police official Mohammad Aslam said an investigation was underway to determine what led to the boiler failure. Pakistan Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif expressed condolences to the families of the victims and directed officials to provide the best possible medical care to the injured.Industrial accidents remain common in Pakistan, where poor safety standards often contribute to fatal incidents. In 2024, a similar boiler explosion at a Faisalabad textile mill left a dozen workers injured.

A judiciary under reconstruction



Munir’s expanding power base



(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment reshapes the balance of power in favour of the military. Behind the crisis is the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, a sweeping package pushed through parliament within days. Lawyers, judges and opposition parties argue that it has weakened the courts and elevated the military’s top commander to a position with no modern parallel.Since then, Pakistan’s judiciary has been hit by a series of high-profile resignations. On Saturday, Lahore High Court judge Shams Mehmood Mirza stepped down, and his family said his decision was directly linked to the 27th Amendment. His departure followed those of Supreme Court justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, who issued sharply worded letters condemning the amendment as a direct attack on judicial independence.The creation of a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) lies at the heart of judicial restructuring. The FCC now holds exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters, stripping the Supreme Court of its original powers. Pending petitions have already been shifted to the new court. President Zardari swore in Justice Aminuddin Khan as its first chief justice; six other judges were appointed, including serving Supreme Court and high court judges, though one judge reportedly refused to join.The FCC’s establishment has sparked intense concern. Critics say the president’s new power to transfer judges risks becoming a tool to sideline dissenting voices. Opposition groups argue this will fundamentally weaken judicial independence and concentrate constitutional authority in the executive and military leadership.Government ministers, however, hailed the package as “historic” and a step toward greater efficiency and national unity. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the amendment proved that “solidarity” prevailed during a time of national strain.With judges resigning, courts being reconfigured, and the military gaining unprecedented constitutional control, Pakistan faces a moment of reckoning.The amendment passed with overwhelming numbers in both houses has dramatically restructured Pakistan’s defence architecture, elevating army chief Asim Munir to Chief of Defence Forces with command over all three military branches. His five-year tenure now resets from the date of notification, enabling him to remain in office until 2030.The Senate has since rushed through four related bills, including amendments to the Army, Air Force and Navy Acts, along with changes to Supreme Court practice rules. These laws remove the earlier equality among service chiefs and replace references to the Joint Chiefs of Staff system with a new “National Strategic Command”, further centralising military authority under Munir.Dawn reported that appointments, extensions, and tenures under these reforms “shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.Experts quoted in multiple reports warn that the shift risks internal military tensions and further erodes civilian oversight. Lawyer Osama Malik described the reforms as something “usually granted in absolute monarchies”, arguing they grant lifetime protections not only to Munir but also to President Zardari.Opposition lawmakers responded with uproar, shredding copies of the bill and walking out. PTI leaders labelled the move “deeply undemocratic” and “the final nail in the coffin of an independent judiciary”. Critics say these changes could reshape the political landscape, particularly for nearly 200 cases involving former prime minister Imran Khan.","Pakistan's judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment.

What next







Pakistan’s National Assembly on Wednesday passed the 27th constitutional amendment bill, granting sweeping powers to the military in general and country’s army chief Asim Munir in specific, and restructuring the judiciary.The vote, held amid a ruckus in the lower house, saw 234 lawmakers in favour and only four against, speaker Ayaz Sadiq announced. The session was attended by top political leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.The amendment comes at a time of heightened political tension in Pakistan, with the ruling coalition seeking to consolidate control over key defence and judicial institutions. The legislation follows earlier Senate approval, where it received 64 votes in favour and no opposition, as the opposition benches boycotted proceedings.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the passage as a demonstration of national unity, saying the house exhibited solidarity. He also condemned a recent terrorist incident in Wana, drawing parallels to the Army Public School massacre, and praised law enforcement for securing the safety of students and cadets.The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces, giving him constitutional authority over all three branches: army, navy, and air force. Honorary five-star ranks such as field marshal, marshal of the air force, and admiral of the fleet remain lifetime titles. According to the country's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the reform “aims to bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while preserving military honour and tradition.The bill also establishes a federal constitutional court (FCC) to handle constitutional and provincial matters, leaving the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases. The FCC will have equal representation from all provinces and the power to take suo motu notices on constitutional petitions. The Judicial Commission will oversee judge transfers; refusal of a transfer will be treated as retirement.The ruling coalition, including PML-N, PPP, MQM-P, and allies, backed the amendment. Opposition lawmakers condemned it as unconstitutional. PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan called it the “Baku Amendments” and accused the government of undermining democracy. Mehmood Khan Achakzai of PkMAP protested by tearing a copy of the bill in the house.The amendment now returns to the Senate for final approval before becoming law. Analysts say the 27th amendment significantly strengthens Munir’s role in Pakistan’s military hierarchy while altering judicial oversight, marking a shift in Pakistan’s institutional framework.(With input from agencies, Dawn)","The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Why it matters

The big picture

The Field Marshal’s expanding power evokes a hybrid of Pakistan’s two most dominant military rulers:

Ayub Khan, who introduced centralized presidential control and laid the foundations for military-led governance.

Zia-ul-Haq, who used the Army and Islamization to seize power, marginalize the judiciary, and suppress civilian opposition.

Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament.

If Zia’s coup was loud and brutal against a strong popular leadership, Munir’s is silent, yet possibly more far reaching, being done through a political front office that’s pliant and dependent on the Army for authority. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.

Pranab Dhal Samanta in the Economic Times

Zoom in

The transformation follows the India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025, a four-day exchange of air and missile strikes after the Pahalgam terror attack.

India’s Operation Sindoor targeted Pakistani airbases, radars, and command centers.

Pakistan requested a ceasefire after intense damage - a request reportedly initiated by Pakistan’s DGMO.

Donald Trump, who claimed to have brokered the truce(India has repeatedly denied the US President's claims), was effusively thanked by Munir and PM Shehbaz Sharif. Trump now calls Munir his “favorite field marshal.”

The Financial Times described their dynamic as a “bromance,” with Trump showcased on billboards across Pakistan alongside Munir and Sharif.

This international validation was followed by Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, the second such promotion in Pakistan’s history - and the first codified under the Constitution.

Between the lines

This isn’t just about military command - it’s about rewriting the DNA of the Pakistani state.

The amendment creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, potentially diluting the powers of the Supreme Court and creating ambiguity about the hierarchy of judicial authority.

President Zardari is also granted lifelong immunity in the amendment, mirroring the legal shield given to Munir.

This dual protection signals a strategic alliance between the military and top civilian figures to institutionalize mutual insulation from accountability.

“Too much has been left to ad hoc and arbitrary decisions,” Mazari warned.

The domestic question: Can repression deliver reform?

The three-front storm: Taliban, TTP, and India

“If you nurture snakes in your backyard, they will bite you,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military’s official spokesman, referencing the Taliban. What a comeuppance : The remark could just as well apply to all Pakistan-grown terror groups and the TTP, whose resurgence is a grim case of blowback.

The bottom line





In Pakistan, where generals have often ruled with impunity and influence, Field Marshal Asim Munir is scripting a new playbook-quiet, precise, and constitutionally sealed. His rise is not just another chapter in the country’s well-worn saga of military dominance. It is, as one senior opposition leader put it, “a rewrite of the entire power manual.”Pakistan’s controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment proposes to recast the country’s military command structure by abolishing the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and creating the role of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) - a position that will be held by the Army Chief, currently Field Marshal Asim Munir •The amendment vests unprecedented legal and constitutional power in the CDF, giving Munir operational and institutional control over the army, navy, and air force, as well as the country’s nuclear command.•It also grants five-star officers life-long rank, privileges, and immunity, a move seen as creating a parallel unelected authority beyond the reach of civilian or judicial oversight.“This amendment appears tailored to benefit a specific individual rather than to strengthen the defence structure,” Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, former defence secretary, told Dawn.The CJCSC post - created after the 1971 war to ensure coordination among services - will be dissolved on November 27, 2025, when the current chairman, Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, retires.The 27th Amendment represents the largest shift in Pakistan’s civil-military balance since the Zia era, codifying the military’s supremacy in a way that future civilian governments may struggle to reverse.•The military will no longer merely influence governance from behind the scenes - it will be constitutionally entrenched at the center of executive authority.•Strategic nuclear assets, previously overseen by the National Command Authority, will now fall under the commander of national strategic command, appointed by the PM on the army chief’s advice, and selected from within the army.“All nuclear weapons and delivery systems will be under army control, including second-strike missiles traditionally under the Navy,” warned Dr Shireen Mazari, former human rights minister, a Dawn report said.•The change grants the army a monopoly over promotions, transfers, and postings across the services, threatening morale and inter-service harmony.“If promotions in the Air Force and Navy are determined by an army-origin CDF, it could lead to festering resentments,” Mazari cautioned.At home, Munir is both omnipresent and embattled. According to a Financial Times report, his supporters compare him to Mohammed bin Salman or South Korea’s General Park - ruthless modernisers willing to bulldoze institutions in the name of reform. His critics, however, see echoes of Zia-ul-Haq’s theocratic militarism cloaked in constitutional legitimacy.The judiciary is already split, thanks to a proposed constitutional court that would dilute the Supreme Court’s power. Journalists are censored, civil rights groups are muzzled, and political opponents - most notably former Prime Minister Imran Khan - are jailed or silenced.And yet, Munir has cast himself as the architect of reform. In his speech at the Pakistan Military Academy, he spoke of “treasures hidden beneath our land” and claimed that Pakistan had begun to “regain its rightful place in the comity of nations.”But the economy tells another story. As per the FT report, Pakistan’s investment rate is the lowest in South Asia, its poverty rate has risen to 25%, and its youth unemployment is dangerously high. The country remains dependent on IMF bailouts and Gulf financing that has yet to materialise in promised volumes.While Munir consolidates power at home, Pakistan finds itself encircled by a resurgent triangle of threats - each historically rooted, each dangerously revived. In the west, the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has proved more liability than leverage. Once covertly supported by Pakistan’s security establishment, the Taliban now resist Islamabad’s demands and turn a blind eye to cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil.More ominously, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot long declared outlawed, has regrouped in Afghanistan and resumed attacks in Pakistan’s tribal belt and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This year alone, militant violence has killed over 1,400 people - the highest toll in a decade.“The military simply lacks political support on the ground there,” Iftikhar Firdous, founder of The Khorasan Diary, told FT. “The crackdown has alienated entire communities.”Simultaneously, Pakistan’s eastern border with India remains fragile after the four-day air conflict in May.Add to that domestic insurgencies in Balochistan and the Pashtun belt, and Pakistan now faces not one, but three overlapping security fronts. Instead of acting as a force-multiplier, the military’s expanding political and economic footprint is beginning to stretch its operational capacity thin.The 27th Amendment enshrines military supremacy in Pakistan's Constitution under the guise of reform and modernization.•It moves the country further away from parliamentary democracy, and deeper into military-led constitutional authoritarianism.•As Field Marshal Asim Munir prepares to become the first Chief of Defence Forces, Pakistan’s most consequential question remains: Can a military man fix a failing nation - or will history repeat itself?(With inputs from agencies)","Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment.

Suicide bomber near court

TTP denies role

Pakistan blames Afghanistan's Taliban government

School attacked





ISLAMABAD: A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence that the defence minister said had pushed the country into a ""state of war"".Pakistani govt ministers accused neighbouring Afghanistan of complicity in the bloodshed - an accusation Kabul denied - and vowed retaliation if Afghan authorities failed to rein in the militants Islamabad says were responsible. ""We are in a state of war,"" said defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif after the attack, the first strike on civilians in Islamabad in a decade. ""Bringing this war to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which Pakistan has the full power to respond. ""The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said. The court bomber blew himself up near the entrance at around lunchtime. Images on local media showed people covered in blood lying next to a police van. A vehicle was seen on fire and another car was badly damaged. Police cordoned off the site. Naqvi said the bomber had tried to enter the court building on foot but, unable to find a way in, detonated the device outside, close to a police vehicle.Several of the wounded were in critical condition, a hospital source said.No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The main Pakistani militant group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denied involvement in the attacks. But a group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, according to The Khorasan Diary, a digital platform in Islamabad that monitors militant activity in the region.TTP militants have in recent years focused attacks on security forces. Civilians had not been hit in Islamabad for a decade, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group that tracks attacks.Islamabad says that the Pakistani Taliban and other militants are based in Afghanistan, with the support of India. ""We are totally clear that Afghanistan has to stop them. In case of a failure, we have no option but to take care of those terrorists who are attacking our country,"" Naqvi said, speaking at the scene of the court bombing. The Taliban administration spokesperson in Kabul did not respond to a request for comment on Pakistan's accusations.The court attack happened hours after militants stormed a school near the Afghan border on Monday. The attack on the school in Wana, in the north west, began Monday, when a suicide vehicle rammed the main entrance, killing three people, Naqvi said. Militants then entered the school, which is run by the military but educates civilians.By Tuesday evening, three militants were still inside the compound, security officials said, with rescue operations under way for the students trapped in another part of the school. Naqvi said that the school assailants were in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan during the attack.Reuters","A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence.

Attack outside court complex



Surge in militant violence and worsening ties with Afghanistan







Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country was “in a state of war” after a suicide bomber struck outside the Islamabad district courts on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 27.The blast one of the deadliest to hit the capital in recent years has intensified tensions with Afghanistan, with Asif accusing the Taliban government in Kabul of allowing militants to operate freely.In a post on X, Asif said: “Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: This is a war for all of Pakistan.”He wrote that Pakistan’s military was making “daily sacrifices while providing citizens with a sense of protection and security”, but warned that hoping for negotiations with Kabul would be a “mistake”. Asif insisted that Afghanistan “has the ability to prevent terrorist attacks inside Pakistan” and that bringing the conflict to the capital was “a message from Kabul”.He added that Pakistan “has the strength to respond fully”, saying the attack had erased any remaining doubts about the threat posed by militants operating from Afghan soil.The explosion took place around midday in Islamabad’s G-11 district, just outside the judicial complex where hundreds of lawyers and visitors were present. Police said the attacker tried to enter the court premises but failed, eventually detonating explosives next to a police vehicle, igniting cars and sending a fireball through the street.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed that 12 people were killed and 27 wounded. He said authorities had recovered a severed head believed to be that of the attacker, and CCTV footage captured him moments before the blast. Witnesses described scenes of chaos, with people screaming for help as ambulances rushed to the site.The blast comes amid a sharp rise in militant violence across Pakistan. Security officials say the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has carried out hundreds of attacks this year, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border, but strikes in major cities have been rare. Islamabad was last hit by a suicide attack three years ago.On Monday night, militants also attempted to storm an army-run college in Wana, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Security forces killed two attackers quickly, while others were cornered inside an administrative building. Students and staff were evacuated, and the military said the assault resembled the TTP’s 2014 massacre in Peshawar that killed 154 people.Pakistan says the Afghan Taliban have allowed TTP fighters to take refuge across the border.

It happened right in Islamabad,” the minister added.He assured, that things would become clearer in the coming days, adding that those involved would not be spared.Inspector general of Islamabad police Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi and the chief commissioner visited the scene and were briefed on the incident and the ongoing probe.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Sunday that it was committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban but demanded that Kabul must address concerns regarding the use of its territory by terrorists.Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi issued a statement on different media queries regarding the third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime in Istanbul on November 6, which concluded a day later. Turkiye and Qatar mediated the parleys.The peace talks ended without any agreement to tackle the thorny issues of cross-border terrorism , the top officials had said on Saturday.""Pakistan remains committed to the resolution of bilateral differences through dialogue. However, Pakistan's core concern, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needs to be addressed first and foremost,"" the FO said in a statement.It also said that Pakistan's Armed Forces and its people were well determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism from its soil and take action against its supporters, abettors and financiers.In the long statement, the spokesperson said that for the past four years, since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil.""Throughout these years, Pakistan, despite suffering military and civilian casualties, exercised maximum restraint and did not retaliate,"" it said.Pakistan's expectation was that the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna al Khawarij (TTP/FaK) elements present on Afghan soil, the FO said.The Pakistan government last year notified the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as ""Fitna al-Khawarij"", a reference to a group in earlier Islamic history which was involved in violence.Pakistan also tried to positively engage with Afghanistan by offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance, and the intention to constructively engage with Afghanistan so as to enable it to become a stable, peaceful and prosperous country that is at peace within and with its neighbours, the statement said.However, despite all these positive gestures, ""the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction,"" it added.Instead of acting upon the core expectation to stop Afghan territory from being used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions, it said.""Instead, it has tried to confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues. By confusing the main issue of terrorism, it keeps trying to develop a narrative which absolves the Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards the international community and its own people,"" it added.The statement said that Pakistan's October 2025 response to the consistent attacks emanating from Afghanistan was a manifestation of the will and determination that it will not leave any stone unturned to safeguard its territory and its people.The statement added that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK terrorists.Pakistan also accused the Afghan Taliban of using the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue, adding that they had fled in 2015 to avoid a military operation and fought together with the Afghan Taliban against Nato troops.""These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by the Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to the Afghan Taliban,"" it said, and added that the same terrorists established training camps in Afghanistan to launch terrorist activities in Pakistan.The FO rejected the Kabul excuse of lack of control over TTP and demanded definite and concrete actions. Pakistan also rejected the portrayal of TTP as refugees and asked Kabul to hand them over to Pakistan.It said Pakistan has never eschewed dialogue with any Government in Kabul, but it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group.",Pakistan says it is committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

What does it mean?



Opposition backlash and protests



Divided legal opinions



Support for reforms







Pakistan’s government has introduced a major constitutional change that has sparked widespread debate and protests across the country. The proposed 27th constitutional amendment, which will be voted on in Parliament next week, seeks to restructure the military’s chain of command and overhaul the judiciary, prompting strong criticism from the Opposition.The current move mirrors the era of General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s longest-serving de facto head of state, who introduced sweeping constitutional changes to entrench military control under a civilian façade. The proposed 27th Amendment, risks reviving that legacy by placing the armed forces once again at the centre of Pakistan’s political structure.The bill, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after cabinet approval, proposes to abolish the post of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC) and replace it with a new and more powerful position -- chief of defence forces (CDF).According to reports in Dawn, the post will be held by the serving chief of army staff, who will also become the constitutional head of the army, navy and air force. This change would make General Asim Munir the most powerful military officer in Pakistan’s history, formalising his recent promotion to Field Marshal.The amendment also includes plans to set up a new federal constitutional court (FCC) and change how high court judges are appointed.It seeks to transfer some powers from the Supreme Court to the new court, while also granting the president lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution.Pakistan law minister Azam Nazir Tarar presented the bill in the senate, where chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred it to a committee led by Farooq Naek for review. Naek said the goal was to “create consensus among members” before the bill comes up for voting on Monday. The government is confident of securing a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the national assembly.Opposition parties have strongly opposed the amendment, calling it a direct threat to Pakistan’s Constitution. A coalition of opposition groups, the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes Imran Khan’s PTI, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) has announced nationwide protests starting Sunday.“Democratic institutions have been paralysed within Pakistan… the nation must step up against the [proposed] 27th Amendment,” MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said.PkMAP leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai said the protests would begin with the slogan: “Long live democracy, down with dictatorship.” He warned, “The opposition alliance had no choice but to launch a protest movement following the government’s move, which is shaking the foundations of the Constitution.”Legal experts are split on the amendment’s impact. Critics say it would reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, making it “irrelevant,” and tighten executive control over the judiciary.One senior counsel told Dawn, “Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’.”Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar warned that the changes would “empower [the new] Federal Constitutional Court by disempowering the Supreme Court.” He said the amendment also gives the Chief of the Defence Forces constitutional authority for life, formally recognising the Field Marshal rank.Another lawyer pointed out that under the new Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC would outrank the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and serve until the age of 68 -- three years longer than the current limit of 65.Some legal experts, however, have welcomed the changes. Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar called the 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in Pakistan’s justice system.He said the plan to have two separate apex courts -- one for appeals (Supreme Court) and one for constitutional cases (FCC) -- would bring “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence.”He also argued that the reforms could reduce political influence in the judiciary, cut down case backlogs, and modernise the justice system.Khokhar added that the new defence structure under Article 243 was in line with “modern constitutional democracies,” ensuring that the armed forces would operate under a single advisory framework accountable to the prime minister, defence minister and National Security Committee.Newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association in Pakistan, President Haroonur Rasheed also supported the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court, saying it could help streamline the judicial process.","Proposed 27th constitutional amendment will be voted on in Parliament next week.

Blast Hits Jaffar Express in Pakistan, Several Injured

The months that followed saw a stream of attacks:

In October, a blast on the Sindh section of the railway line derailed five bogies and injured several passengers.

In September, an explosion on the track in Mastung derailed six coaches, leaving 12 injured.

In August, six coaches derailed after an improvised explosive device went off in Mastung, while days earlier a pilot engine came under gunfire.

In July and June, two separate blasts in Sindh derailed multiple coaches.

Late last year, a suicide bomber at Quetta Station killed at least 26 people.

One battle after another

Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday, citing “serious security concerns” in Balochistan, news agency PTI reported.The temporary suspension — enforced from 9 to 12 November — follows multiple insurgent attacks on the train over the past year, including a dramatic hijacking in March that left 26 people dead.Railway officials said the move came after fresh intelligence warnings of possible attacks targeting tracks, railway assets and civilian passengers. “The precautionary measure is based on advice from security and intelligence agencies to ensure the safety of passengers, railway staff, civilians and critical rail assets,” a senior official said, as quoted by PTI.The Jaffar Express is one of Pakistan’s busiest long-distance routes, carrying thousands of passengers daily at a cost far lower than road travel. Local commuters have criticised the shutdown, saying it leaves people in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with few affordable transport options.Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups, particularly the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).In March, BLA militants hijacked the train with 380 passengers on board, triggering a two-day standoff in a mountainous tunnel. Twenty-six people were killed before security forces rescued more than 350 passengers. Authorities said 33 militants also died in the rescue operation.Security officials say insurgent groups are increasingly targeting railways to cripple movement and signal the state’s inability to secure critical transport arteries. Analysts note that the frequency of attacks shows “a collapse of basic security control” across parts of Balochistan’s rail corridor.Political leaders in the province argue that Islamabad has ignored decades of local grievances. Balochistan National Party chief Akhtar Mengal recently warned that the state has “lost control” of the region, saying: “There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority.”The suspension comes as Pakistan faces one of its most dangerous security challenges in years. Not only has the BLA intensified operations across Balochistan, but attacks linked to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Islamic State Khorasan (ISK) and cross-border militants have surged.According to the latest Global Terrorism Index, Pakistan recorded a 45% jump in terrorism-related deaths this year. Security officials warn the country is now battling “four fronts at once”—an insurgent network straddling provincial, sectarian and cross-border lines.Diplomatic efforts have yielded little. Peace talks this week between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement, with both sides blaming each other for breakdowns in the ceasefire. Pakistan accuses Kabul of sheltering TTP fighters; the Taliban dismisses the allegations.","Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday.

Pakistan’s government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades. The proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after approval by the federal cabinet, rewrites the chain of command of the armed forces and places Field Marshall Asim Munir higher than any military officer before him.The bill restructures Article 243 of the Constitution and creates a powerful new post: Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). According to Dawn, the position will be held by the serving Chief of Army Staff, who will simultaneously become the constitutionally recognised head of Pakistan’s Army, Navy and Air Force. The development formalises General Munir’s elevation as Pakistan’s Field Marshal — a title that the government has already awarded but is now seeking to permanently embed into the Constitution.The changes have ignited intense debate in Islamabad, dividing political parties, lawyers and civil society. Supporters argue that the bill modernises command structures, while critics see it as a dramatic centralisation of military power that weakens civilian oversight.As per report from Dawn, the bill abolishes the position of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), the top coordinating office among Pakistan’s military services, from 27 November, when the tenure of the current CJCSC General Sahir Shamshad Mirza ends.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told Parliament that no new appointment will be made, because the Army Chief will take over the role’s functions as Chief of Defence Forces.Under the amendment, the President will appoint the Army, Naval and Air Chiefs on the Prime Minister’s advice, while the CDF will be constitutionally empowered to command all three services.A new position Commander of the National Strategic Command will oversee Pakistan’s nuclear and strategic arsenal. Dawn reported that the commander must be an officer from the Army, appointed by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the CDF. This further cements the Army Chief’s control over nuclear command authority.The bill also grants unprecedented rights to officers who attain five-star ranks such as Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force, or Admiral of the Fleet.Law minister Tarar clarified that Parliament not the Pakistan Prime Minister will have the power to cancel such titles.The amendment does not stop at the military. The second half of the proposal restructures Pakistan’s judicial system.According to Geo News, the bill establishes a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC): a powerful new judicial body that would:Legal experts quoted by Dawn warned that the changes could “dethrone” the Supreme Court as Pakistan’s top judicial authority. One senior counsel said the Supreme Court risked being turned into a “Supreme District Court”, dealing mostly with ordinary appeals, while constitutional matters shift to the FCC.Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar argued that the amendment tightens executive control over the judiciary and “empowers the FCC by disempowering the Supreme Court”.However, other senior lawyers called it a “forward-looking reform”. They say separating constitutional and appellate functions would reduce delays, depoliticise the Supreme Court and bring Pakistan closer to judicial models in other democracies.The bill has triggered fierce debate in Islamabad. The timing — months after Munir’s elevation and amid delicate coalition negotiations — has intensified public scrutiny.Dawn reported that the proposal surfaced after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari revealed that PML-N leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, requested PPP support for constitutional reforms.Government allies insist the reform merely formalises existing military structures and honours national heroes. Critics say it permanently rebalances power in favour of the Army.If adopted, the 27th Constitutional Amendment will be one of Pakistan’s most consequential defence reforms since the 1980s, dissolving one of the military’s oldest offices, raising the Army Chief to unprecedented constitutional supremacy, and reshaping Pakistan’s highest courts.","Pakistan's government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: A day after peace talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan in Turkey broke down, the Taliban on Saturday accused “elements within the Pakistani military” of pursuing “anti-Afghanistan policies for years. ”“Unfortunately, certain military elements in Pakistan appear to view a stable and strong Afghanistan as contrary to their interests,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement on X. “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts.”Mujahid also rejected claims that the rise of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was linked to the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul. “Some groups have falsely accused the Islamic Emirate, suggesting that instability in Pakistan and the TTP’s growth began with our arrival. In reality, both date back to 2002, a result of misguided policies by certain Pakistani military elements who aligned with the US, permitted drone strikes in Waziristan, and turned against their own people,” he wrote.He pointed to a series of Pakistani military campaigns against the TTP — including Operations Al-Mizan, Rah-e-Rast, Sher Dil, Nijat, Koh-e-Safid, and Zarb-e-Azb — that, he said, displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians.“In this so-called war on terror, 80,000–90,000 soldiers and civilians were killed, by Islamabad’s own count, long before the Islamic Emirate’s rise,” Mujahid added.Calling Pakistan’s instability “an internal issue,” Mujahid remarked the Taliban has taken steps to prevent cross-border militancy since taking power. These include mediating dialogue among political and religious figures, relocating refugees from the Durand Line, banning weapons among refugee populations, and issuing fatwas against unauthorized foreign jihad.“The Islamic Emirate welcomes all efforts that allow refugees to return safely,” he stated, reaffirming that Afghanistan would not allow its territory to be used to interfere in another country’s affairs.","The Taliban accused “elements within the Pakistani military’ of pursuing “anti- Afghanistan policies for years” “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125186693,imgsize-78016,width-400,resizemode-4/taliban-accuses-pakistani-military-of-fueling-instability-through-quotmanufactured-pretextsquot.jpg"

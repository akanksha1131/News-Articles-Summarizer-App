Left-wing candidate Orsi wins Uruguay presidential election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/left-wing-candidate-orsi-wins-uruguay-presidential-election/articleshow/115641551.cms,"'A very different world'



MONTEVIDEO: Left-wing politician Yamandu Orsi was elected president of Uruguay, official results showed on Sunday, in a rebuke by voters of five years of conservative rule.Uruguayans went to the polls for the second round of voting in what became a tight race between Orsi, of the Frente Amplio (Broad Front) alliance, and Alvaro Delgado of the National Party, a member of outgoing President Luis Lacalle Pou's center-right Republican Coalition.Orsi promised in a victory speech on Sunday evening to be a president ""who calls again and again for national dialogue to find the best solutions.""Delgado meanwhile conceded defeat, saying he was sending ""a big hug and a greeting to Yamandu Orsi.""Though the election will shift the balance of power in Uruguay, analysts did not foresee a massive change in the country's economic direction, with Orsi having previously promised ""change that will not be radical.""Both candidates pledged to fight crime linked to drug trafficking and to boost economic growth, which is recovering from the slowdown brought by the Covid-19 pandemic and a historic drought.With 94.4 percent of ballots counted, Orsi won 1,123,420 votes compared to Delgado's 1,042,001, the country's Electoral Court said.Cheers broke out in the capital Montevideo, a bastion of Frente Amplio support, when projections showing Orsi leading were announced.His campaign was boosted by support from Jose ""Pepe"" Mujica, a former guerrilla lionized as ""the world's poorest president"" because of his modest lifestyle during his 2010-2015 time in office.Orsi, seen as an understudy of Mujica, had garnered 43.9 percent of the October 27 first-round vote -- short of the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff but ahead of the 26.7 percent of ballots cast for Delgado.The pair came out on top of a crowded field of 11 candidates seeking to replace Lacalle Pou, who has a high approval rating but is barred constitutionally from seeking a second consecutive term.Following October legislative elections, Orsi will govern with a majority in the Senate, though the Frente Amplio is in the minority in the Chamber of Representatives.The victory for Orsi will see Uruguay swing left again after five years of center-right rule in the country of 3.4 million inhabitants.In 2005, the Frente Amplio coalition broke a decades-long conservative stranglehold with an election victory and held the presidency for three straight terms.It was voted out in 2020 on the back of concerns about rising crime blamed on high taxes and a surge in cocaine trafficking through the port of Montevideo.Polling numbers ahead of the vote showed perceived insecurity remains Uruguayans' top concern five years later.A 72-year-old retiree who voted, Juan Antonio Stivan, said he just wanted the next government to guarantee ""safety -- to be able to go out in the street with peace of mind, as an old person, as a young person, as a child.""Another voter, Aldo Soroara, a 60-year-old winegrower, said he expected whoever is elected as president to do ""the best he can for the people,"" adding: ""You can't ask for much more in these difficult times.""Voting is compulsory in Uruguay, one of Latin America's most stable democracies, with comparatively high per-capita income and low poverty levels.During the heyday of leftist rule, Uruguay legalized abortion and same-sex marriage, became the first Latin American country to ban smoking in public places and the world's first nation, in 2013, to allow recreational cannabis use.Former president Mujica, who is battling cancer and had to use a cane to walk into his polling station to vote, said Sunday: ""Personally, I have nothing more to look forward to. My closest future is the cemetery, for reasons of age.""But I am interested in the fate of you, the young people who, when they are my age, will live in a very different world.""","Left-wing politician Yamandu Orsi elected president of Uruguay, official results show. Orsi won 1,123,420 votes compared to Alvaro Delgado's 1,042,001, the country's Electoral Court said.

"US Rains: Winter storms to bring rain, snow, and disruptions during Thanksgiving week across US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/winter-storms-to-bring-rain-snow-and-disruptions-during-thanksgiving-week-across-us/articleshow/115640804.cms,"Weather experts across the United States have alerted that another winter conditions might affect Thanksgiving week, whilst California and Washington are still managing the aftermath of storm-related damages and electrical disruptions.In California, after two storm victims were found in flood waters on Saturday, officials prepared for additional rainfall whilst dealing with existing flooding and minor earth movements from the previous weather system.The Sacramento-based national weather service has announced a winter storm warning for the Sierra Nevada continuing until Tuesday. Substantial snowfall is anticipated at elevated areas, with winds possibly reaching 55 mph (88 kph). Approximately 4 feet (1.2 metres) of snow is expected, with the most significant accumulation predicted for Monday and Tuesday.Rain and snow will affect the Midwest and Great Lakes areas on Monday, whilst the East Coast will experience the most significant impact during Thanksgiving and Black Friday.A weather system is expected to bring rainfall to the Southeast early Thursday before moving towards the Northeast. Boston and New York areas might experience rain and strong winds, with possible snow in northern New Hampshire, northern Maine and the Adirondacks. Should the system move further inland, mountain regions might see more rain than snow.""The system doesn't look like a powerhouse right now,"" Hayden Frank, a meteorologist with the weather service in Massachusetts, said Sunday. ""Basically, this is going to bring rain to the I-95 corridor so travellers should prepare for wet weather. Unless the system trends a lot colder, it looks like rain.""Frank indicated that no significant storms are forecast nationwide for the weekend, suggesting favourable driving conditions for Sunday travellers. Eastern temperatures will decrease whilst western regions warm up.Two fatalities occurred in the Pacific Northwest following a rapidly intensifying ""bomb cyclone"" that struck the West Coast last Tuesday. The storm brought strong winds that damaged properties and vehicles and caused widespread power cuts in Washington state before moving to Northern California. Approximately 25,000 Seattle residents remained without electricity on Sunday evening.Two bodies were discovered on Saturday in Sonoma County's wine region, north of San Francisco. A walker found a man's body in a swollen stream near Santa Rosa, whilst rescue teams later recovered another body from a vehicle in floodwaters near Guerneville, according to Deputy Rob Dillion. Investigators are assessing whether these incidents were storm-related.Santa Rosa experienced its wettest three-day period on record, receiving about 12.5 inches (32 centimetres) of rain by Friday evening, according to the San Francisco Bay Area National Weather Service. Flooding affected vineyards in nearby Windsor.The risk of floods and mudslides continues with more rain expected from Sunday, although this system will be less severe than the previous atmospheric river event.""However, there's still threats, smaller threats, and not as significant in terms of magnitude, that are still going to exist across the West Coast for the next two or three days,"" weather service forecaster Rich Otto said.As rainfall moves eastward, substantial snowfall is possible at higher Sierra Nevada elevations and parts of Utah and Colorado. California's Mammoth Mountain, which received 2 feet (.6 metres) of fresh snow recently, might receive an additional 4 feet (1.2 metres) before this system clears by Wednesday.The Midwest and East Coast expect heavy rainfall during Thanksgiving, with possible snow in Northeastern states.Recent precipitation in New York and New Jersey helped address wildfire concerns and drought conditions in Pennsylvania. The rainfall provided welcome relief after an unusually dry autumn.""It's not going to be a drought buster, but it's definitely going to help,"" said Bryan Greenblatt, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Binghamton, New York.Northeastern Pennsylvania, including the Pocono Mountains, experienced heavy snowfall. Higher areas reported up to 17 inches (43 centimetres), with less accumulation in valley cities. About 35,000 customers across 10 counties remained without power.In New York's Catskills region, nearly 10,000 residents lacked power on Sunday morning, following heavy snowfall two days prior.West Virginia's precipitation helped alleviate the state's worst drought in over two decades and benefited ski resorts preparing for their upcoming season.","Winter storm warning for Sierra Nevada continuing until Tuesday.

Virginia Rape: Man charged with town's first 'stranger rape' in over 12 years in Virginia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/man-charged-with-towns-first-stranger-rape-in-over-12-years-in-virginia/articleshow/115636501.cms,"A Virginia hiking trail became the scene of a shocking assault when a Honduran man, recently released from jail for indecent exposure, allegedly raped a woman. Denis Romero, who was in the US illegally, is accused of grabbing the victim, forcing her down, and assaulting her.

A Honduran man faces rape charges after allegedly assaulting a woman on a popular hiking trail in Herndon, Virginia , US. Police said this is the first stranger rape in the town in over a decade.Denis Humberto Navarette Romero , 31, was arrested last week for abduction with intent to defile and rape, according to the Herndon police department . The victim, who did not know Romero, was attacked on the busy Washington and Old Dominion Trail between Ferndale Avenue and Grace Street when the suspect allegedly grabbed her arm, forced her to the ground, and assaulted her.However, the victim managed to escape and sought help from a passerby, who called 911 to report the alleged crime.“The woman had been walking along the trail after leaving a business in downtown Herndon when she was approached by the suspect. The suspect brazenly grabbed the victim and forced her to the ground, where he proceeded to rape her. The victim was able to fight off the suspect and run away,"" said Herndon police chief Maggie DeBoard in a press conference, as quoted by local media FFX Now.When police arrived at the trail, they located Romero in a parking lot in the 700 block of Station Street and took him to the Herndon police station for questioning. Detectives found items belonging to the victim in his possession.'This is the only stranger rape we’ve had in the town in my more than 12 years as chief of police,"" DeBoard added, as quoted by New York Post.Police believe there may be more witnesses to this incident and other victims who encountered the suspect.""He has a documented history of sexual assault and exposures in the region, beginning in 2022, including charges in the town of Herndon prior to last night’s incident,” said DeBoard. “What is disturbing is the number of times this offender has been arrested and released. He has continued to re-offend, and his behavior has escalated to a rape in a very public area in our town last night.”On November 14, four days before being arrested on rape charges, he was released from jail after serving half of a 50-day sentence for indecent exposure.Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin criticised the release of Romero, who is in the US illegally. He told The Post, “I am heartsick for this victim and outraged that local Fairfax County officials recklessly released violent illegal immigrants who should have been prosecuted and deported.”Youngkin added, “This is a dereliction of their most basic duty to keep people safe. Prioritizing violent illegal immigrants over the safety of Fairfax residents is unacceptable,” stressing that Virginia is not a sanctuary state.The suspect's preliminary hearing is scheduled for March 5, 2025, according to a local media report.","Denis Humberto Navarette Romero, 31, was arrested last week for abduction with intent to defile and rape.

How the ICC Decides on Cases





Genocide

War crimes

Crimes against humanity

Crimes of aggression

Decisions to issue arrest warrants follow these key steps:

1. Jurisdiction:

2. Investigation:

3. Authorization:





Who Must Comply



Arresting and transferring the accused to The Hague, where the ICC is headquartered.

Supporting investigations and facilitating evidence collection when requested.

Ensuring that their domestic laws allow for full cooperation with the ICC.

Challenges in Enforcement



With inputs from agencies

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed that Canada would comply with an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . He emphasized that Canada is committed to upholding international law and adhering to the regulations and rulings of international courts, framing this as a core value of Canadian identity.Trudeau said: “It’s really important that everyone abide by international law. This is something we’ve been calling on from the beginning of the conflict. We stand up for international law, and we will abide by all the regulations and rulings of the international courts. This is just who we are as Canadians.""On Thursday, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant, citing allegations of crimes against humanity and other offenses linked to the Israel-Hamas conflict, ongoing for over a year. The court also issued a warrant for Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, though Israel claims he was killed in a Gaza airstrike in July. Both Israel and Hamas have denied the accusations.Trudeau reiterated Canada’s call for a ceasefire to protect civilians and emphasized the need for progress toward a two-state solution, envisioning peaceful coexistence between Israel and a Palestinian state. Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly echoed this stance, affirming Canada’s commitment to fulfilling its obligations under the ICC treaty.Netanyahu’s office criticized the arrest warrants, labeling them an antisemitic move, while Israel’s Ambassador to Canada, Iddo Moed, urged the Canadian government to reject and condemn the ICC decision, framing it as undermining Israel's right to self-defense.In contrast, the United States, not an ICC member, rejected the warrants outright, citing concerns about the ICC Prosecutor’s process and expressing its intent to coordinate responses with allies. The ICC, lacking its own enforcement mechanism, relies on its 124 member states, including Canada, to act on its rulings.The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others based on allegations of crimes against humanity and other offenses. These charges reportedly stem from actions taken since the start of the prolonged conflict between Israel and Hamas. The court investigates and prosecutes cases of grave crimes, such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, particularly in situations where national legal systems are unable or unwilling to pursue justice.The ICC operates on the basis of complaints submitted to its Prosecutor, who then investigates whether there is sufficient evidence to pursue a case. This can include documentation from affected parties, states, international organizations, or civil society groups.The ICC was established in 2002 under the Rome Statute and has jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute:The ICC determines whether the alleged crimes fall within its jurisdiction, which applies to actions committed on the territory of member states or by nationals of member states.The Prosecutor gathers evidence, often involving extensive collaboration with states, international bodies, and witnesses.If sufficient evidence exists, the court issues an arrest warrant or summons for the individual.4. Charges: The charges must meet the standard of being serious violations of international humanitarian or human rights law.The ICC operates independently but is bound by its treaty and legal frameworks.All 124 member states of the ICC, including Canada, are legally obligated to comply with its rulings and execute arrest warrants if the accused enters their jurisdiction. Compliance involves:States that are not members, like the United States and Israel, are not legally obligated to comply with ICC warrants. However, the ICC may still pursue its cases if the alleged crimes occurred on the territory of a member state or involve nationals of member states.The ICC lacks its own enforcement mechanism, such as a police force, so it relies entirely on member states to cooperate. In many cases, political considerations or opposition to the ICC’s authority can hinder compliance, as seen with resistance from countries whose leaders or officials are targeted by ICC rulings.","The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others.

In a fact that will make you do a double-take, Pam Bondi and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz are nearly the same age—Bondi at 58 and Walz at 59. Pam Bondi and Tim Walz are both 59 years old. Pam Bondi was born on November 17, 1965, and Tim Walz was born on April 6, 1964.Now, as Bondi’s name floats around as a potential pick for Attorney General under Donald Trump, it’s worth revisiting the meteoric rise of this Florida powerhouse.Pamela Jo Bondi, born November 17, 1965, in Tampa, Florida, is a seasoned attorney, former Florida Attorney General , and prominent figure in conservative circles. Known for her sharp legal mind and media-savvy approach, Bondi made waves during her two terms as Florida’s Attorney General from 2011 to 2019.A graduate of the University of Florida and Stetson University College of Law, Bondi began her career as a prosecutor in Hillsborough County. Her passion for public service and ability to navigate complex legal landscapes quickly elevated her profile within Florida politics.As Florida Attorney General, Bondi tackled major issues, including:Her legal acumen gained national attention in 2020 when she joined Donald Trump's legal team during his first impeachment trial. Her ability to deliver sharp, memorable arguments cemented her place as a trusted Trump ally.However, her career has not been without controversy. Critics have pointed to donations from Trump's foundation to Bondi's political action committee while her office was deciding on a case involving Trump University—a matter she ultimately declined to pursue.Now being floated as a top contender for Attorney General in a potential Trump administration , Bondi’s fiery conservatism and seasoned legal expertise could make her a key figure in the next chapter of Trump’s political saga.In the 2024 US presidential election , Vice President Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate, but their ticket was decisively defeated by Trump and Vance. The Harris-Walz campaign struggled to connect with working-class voters, facing criticism over economic issues and governance challenges. Despite the loss, Walz’s selection highlighted his leadership record as a progressive governor and former congressman.","Pamela Jo Bondi, born November 17, 1965, is a seasoned attorney, former Florida Attorney General, and prominent figure in conservative circles.

Who is Santino Pietrosanti?

Pietrosanti's commitment to diversity

Backlash: Is Jaguar's rebranding too ""woke""?

British vehicle company Jaguar 's latest advertisement, ""Copy Nothing ,"" has ignited a firestorm on social media for featuring models and not a single car. Critics have labeled the ad everything from ""pretentious"" to ""a fashion show for people who forgot what they're selling."" Santino Pietrosanti , the self-styled marketing guru who orchestrated Jaguar's controversial rebranding, is at the center of the fierce debate surrounding the car company's shift toward inclusivity and diversity.In Jaguar's 30-second ad, the models walk through abstract scenes while delivering phrases like ""Create Exuberant"" and ""Live Vivid,"" which have been widely mocked. Notably, not a single Jaguar car appears in the entire ad. This absence has baffled many, especially considering the brand's reputation for sleek luxury vehicles.Pietrosanti, a US native, is the head of brand at Jaguar. He now resides in Milton Keynes, England, where he lives with his Scottish husband, Paul, and their cockapoo, Mia, in a £975,000 home, according to The Daily Mail report.At the Attitude Awards last month, dressed in a spangled dinner jacket over a see-through t-shirt, Pietrosanti shared his vision for the rebrand, describing it as a return to Jaguar's roots of ""something truly special.""""We're not just talking about new cars,"" Pietrosanti told the audience, as quoted by The Daily Mail. ""We are talking about all new ways of thinking and embracing the full spectrum of human potential and creativity. Jaguar has always stood for fearless originality, striving to be a copy of nothing. And we believe that every person has the potential to be something unique, something original, and that's what makes us strong.""A key part of Jaguar's transformation, according to Pietrosanti, is its commitment to diversity and inclusion . ""At Jaguar, we proudly stand with the LGBTQ+ community,"" he said. ""Originality and creativity thrive in spaces where people are free to be themselves.""Under his leadership, Jaguar has established over 15 DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) groups, including initiatives focused on Pride, women in engineering, and neurodiversity. Major policy changes, such as creating support for transitioning employees, have been implemented to drive equity and ensure that Jaguar's workforce reflects the diverse society in which it operates.While Pietrosanti's vision has been hailed by some for championing inclusivity and employee empowerment, others have criticized the rebrand as pandering to a ""woke"" agenda. Regardless of the backlash, Pietrosanti remains steadfast in his belief that Jaguar’s commitment to diversity will not only redefine the brand but will also empower its employees and customers alike.""We're on a transformative journey of our own,"" Pietrosanti declared, ""driven by a belief in diversity, inclusion, creativity, policy, and most importantly, action.""","Santino Pietrosanti, head of brand at Jaguar, is at the center of the fierce debate surrounding the car company's shift toward inclusivity and diversity.

How Scott Bessent went from Dem donor to Trump treasury secretary pick,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-scott-bessent-went-from-dem-donor-to-trump-treasury-secretary-pick/articleshow/115641864.cms,"Trump has nominated Scott Bessent for Treasury Secretary

In the heat of the 2000 presidential campaign, vice-president Al Gore took a break from barnstorming battleground states to attend a fund-raiser for Democratic National Committee in East Hampton. Standing behind Gore onstage was Scott Bessent , a hedge fund manager and - at the time - a major donor to Democrats who co-hosted the event.On Friday, Bessent was tapped by Prez-elect Trump to be his treasury secretary.Having won the trust of Trump and his inner circle, Bessent would lead a Republican economic agenda of cutting taxes, culling federal regulations and enacting sweeping tariffs. The selection caps an extraordinary career arc for an investor who was once a protege of the liberal billionaire philanthropist George Soros and who gave money to top Democrats including Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and Barack Obama.""He was very supportive of the causes and the people that we supported,"" said Will Trinkle, a Democrat who co-hosted the event with Gore. He noted Bessent, who would be the first openly gay treasury secretary, was a strong advocate for gay rights and marriage equality.If confirmed by the Senate, Bessent would help Trump as he attempts to remake the US economy. As treasury secretary, Bessent would work to steer tax cuts through Congress, lead trade negotiations with China and help cull federal regulations that Trump believes are stifling the economy. But friends and former colleagues described him as driven by data and intellectually curious, with an ability to work with people from across the ideological and political spectrum.Last spring, when many business leaders were hesitant to back Trump publicly as his legal troubles mounted, Bessent took a different view. He saw Trump as a ""stock that goes up on bad news"". Concerned about the exploding national debt and the need to make changes to the international trading system, Bessent set up a meeting with Trump. In recent months, he has pitched a ""3-3-3"" plan that would aim for 3% economic growth, reduce the budget deficit to 3% of GDP and increase domestic oil production by 3 million barrels per day. He also came up with an idea that would allow the president to essentially sideline the chair of Federal Reserve, although he has backed down from that proposal in the face of opposition.Stanley Druckenmiller, a hedge fund investor, said while Bessent is soft-spoken, he can also be ""tough and persuasive"" and has the right temperament to work for a demanding boss like Trump.

And in Egypt, official skins can be especially thin: deepening repression has muffled most dissent and sent tens of thousands of perceived political opponents to jail, including one for posting a doctored photo of the president with Mickey Mouse ears.But this month, Egypt found itself facing an opponent it could not silence so easily.""Cairo Airport: Is There a Worse Major Airport?"" the travel blogger Ben Schlappig pondered in a no-holds-barred post on his website, One Mile at a Time. He cited the ""actively hostile and rude"" staff, the ""endless requests for tips,"" the ""disorder"" in line, the ""weak"" dining options and the ""yuck"" lounges. As if salting the wound, he ended by comparing Cairo's airport unfavourably with that of Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, with which Egypt is locked in a yearslong dispute over water rights.It was a verdict almost guaranteed to enrage Egypt's govt, which is making a concerted push to double its tourism numbers, trying to reach 30 million annual visitors by 2028. Luxury hotels are going up . The govt has announced plans to refurbish historic attractions. And a long-awaited new museum of antiquities is opening in stages next to Great Pyramids of Giza.Against this march of progress, Schlappig's complaints might seem like a minor annoyance. Yet Egypt's civil aviation ministry reacted with fury, issuing a more than 1,100-word response this past week, upbraiding Schlappig for his ""unfounded, destructive accusations"" and suggesting it was prepared to take legal action. As evidence, it laid out a step-by-step accounting of the blogger's most recent visit to the airport, drawn from what the ministry called a thorough review of security camera footage. From his first security scan to his arrival at a gate, it said, all went smoothly.By turns self-congratulatory, suspicious and threatening in tone, the ministry defended the airport's quality, saying it holds ""nearly"" four stars from an independent evaluator. It questioned his choices, asking, ""Is it reasonable for a passenger to visit two lounges before a single flight?"" Finally, it ended by accusing him of harbouring sinister motives, saying the sole purpose of his visit appeared to be ""undermining Cairo Airport.""But the blogger quickly fired back ""This is perhaps the most bizarre response,"" wrote Schlappig. ""I know Egypt isn't necessarily the most pro-free speech place on Earth, but I wasn't expecting a Pyongyang-esque response,"" he added, referring to North Korea's capital.Schlappig said he would be avoiding Egypt for the foreseeable future.

And the book kind of lays out the common arguments that those on the left or others make which are baked in social justice.

It's because they looked around at the bureaucracies that they controlled in Washington and the one that was that they didn't control. Obama's spent a disproportionate amount of time focusing on the Pentagon. They were skeptical of leadership and eventually brought in political appointees and generals who would do their bidding the way they wanted.

We need to restore deterrence, restore peace, and get ahead of this escalation ladder, rather than responding to it.""The call for negotiations comes as tensions rise following Washington’s approval of Kyiv’s use of US-supplied missiles for strikes inside Russian territory and the provision of landmines to Ukraine, which led Moscow to deploy an experimental medium-range ballistic missile in response.Waltz whilst critical of Russia, has aligned with Trump in opposing additional support for Ukraine.""President Trump has been very clear about the need to end this conflict,"" he stated to Fox News.""We need to be discussing is who's at that table, whether it's an agreement, an armistice, how to get both sides to the table and then what's the framework of a deal?""Russia initiated its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, prompting the United States and allies to support Kyiv's defence of its eastern territories.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously rejected surrendering territory to Russia, and informed Fox News on Tuesday that Ukraine would face defeat if American funding ceased, according to AFP news agency.President Joe Biden's administration has committed to ensuring a seamless transition to Trump, who intends to implement significant changes in both foreign and domestic policies.On Sunday, Waltz revealed his meeting with Biden's NSA Jake Sullivan and cautioned international adversaries against attempting to exploit the transition period before Trump assumes office in January.""For our adversaries out there that think this is a time of opportunity that they can play one administration off the other.

US Senator and army veteran Tammy Duckworth has criticised Pete Hegseth , President Donald Trump 's nominee for defence secretary, for his views on women serving in combat roles.Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois and a combat veteran who lost both legs in a helicopter crash in Iraq, appeared on CBS News's Face the Nation on Sunday. She argued that Hegseth , an army veteran and former Fox News host, was unqualified for the position due to his stance on women in the military.""Mr Hegseth is not qualified for the position because he doesn’t understand, apparently, even after having served, that women are vitally important to an effective military,"" Duckworth said.She stressed the crucial role of women in the military, especially amid current recruitment challenges.""With the recruiting challenges we’re having right now, if we were to pull all those women out and say you can’t go into combat, we would face a severe personnel crisis in the military,"" she added.Duckworth also criticised Hegseth's lower rank during his service, saying, ""He was a pretty low-ranking guy in the military, and he never had a command position... He was a platoon leader, I think, once or twice, but he never even commanded a company. This is a man who is inordinately unqualified for the position.""Duckworth retired as a lieutenant colonel after becoming one of the first women to fly combat missions during the Iraq War. On the hand, Hegseth retired as a major.Hegseth previously said on a podcast that women in combat roles do not benefit the military, claiming, ""Everything about men and women serving together makes the situation more complicated, and complication in combat means casualties are worse. I’m straight up just saying that we should not have women in combat roles — it hasn’t made us more effective, hasn’t made us more lethal, and has made fighting more complicated.""Hegseth has faced controversies, including a past sexual assault allegation, which he settled in a civil case while denying any wrongdoing, and claims of a supremacist tattoo on his bicep.","US Senator and army veteran Tammy Duckworth has criticised Pete Hegseth for his views on women serving in combat roles.

Toronto's Original Santa Claus parade is set to celebrate its 120th year on Sunday, aiming to spread holiday cheer to an estimated 750,000 spectators. The six-kilometer parade will feature 27 hand-crafted floats and over 2,000 performers.David McCarthy, chair of the Original Santa Claus Parade board of directors, expressed excitement about the event, saying, as quoted by CBC News, “We’re expecting to bring the magic back to the city of Toronto again this year.”Festivities will begin at 10 am at Christie Pits, where children can write letters to Santa, enjoy cookies, and watch a performance by Wiggles star Emma Memma before she joins the parade.At 11:45 am, the Holly Jolly Run—a five-kilometer race with nearly 2,000 participants—will kick off the day. Mayor Olivia Chow will deliver remarks at 12:15 p.m., officially launching the parade.Starting at 12:30 pm at Christie Pits, the parade will follow a modified six-kilometer route due to construction. The procession will travel east along Bloor Street, south on St George Street, and weave through the city before concluding at St Lawrence Market around 3 pm.The parade will be live-streamed on the Santa Claus Parade YouTube channel, offering an alternative to the traditional television broadcast.Toronto police have announced road closures starting at 7 am, with streets reopening by 6 pm. The TTC will increase subway and streetcar services along the route, and special GO Train service will run on the Milton Line.While the parade’s milestone anniversary brings excitement, organizers warn its future is uncertain due to declining sponsorships and rising costs. A $250,000 funding gap remains for this year’s event.A GoFundMe campaign has raised over $125,000 as of Sunday, and recent contributions from the city, province, and a pledge of federal support from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have provided hope. However, McCarthy stressed the need for ongoing community and corporate backing to secure future parades.","Toronto's Original Santa Claus parade will celebrate its 120th year on Sunday.

American Airlines has launched new technology at over 100 US airports to prevent passengers from cutting boarding lines. The system uses an audible alert to notify gate agents if someone tries to scan their ticket before their assigned group is called.The new software will not allow a boarding pass to be accepted until the assigned group is called, meaning passengers who arrive at the gate too early will be asked to return and wait for their turn.The airline tested the system at three airports: Albuquerque International Sunport, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and Tucson International Airport. Following positive feedback from staff and passengers, the technology is being rolled out ahead of the Thanksgiving travel rush .“The initial response from customers and American employees has exceeded our expectations,” said Julie Rath, American’s senior vice president of airport operations , reservations, and service recovery.The new system aims to reduce frustration and potential conflicts caused by line-cutting. Airline industry analyst Henry Harteveldt doesn’t view the move as “shaming” customers who cut the line and believes it will ""bring order out of chaos"" at the gate, creating a fairer boarding process .""And I hope it will defuse any potential flare-ups of anger from people who simply think they're entitled to board out of turn... It’s just not fair,"" Harteveldt said.While the technology is designed to create a smoother experience, some question its overall effectiveness. Seth Miller, editor of air travel site PaxEx.aero, acknowledges the benefits of consistent gate control but remains unconvinced that it's ""100% perfect for passengers."" He points out potential issues, such as families booked on separate reservations, that could lead to delays.American Airlines plans to expand the technology to its hub airports and other locations in the coming months.

The delay prevents the Senate from confirming Donahue’s promotion to a four-star general and his taking command of US Army Europe .Mullin has placed a hold on the promotion to allow the new Republican-controlled Congress and Trump to weigh in, given Donahue's role in the Afghanistan withdrawal , according to a CBS report citing two sources familiar with the situation.However, some army officials believe the hold is politically motivated and are working to have it lifted, the report said.The 2021 withdrawal, based on the Trump administration's agreement with the Taliban, required the group to refrain from engaging in terrorist activities. However, the Taliban ultimately violated the agreement, yet the Biden administration proceeded with the withdrawal in 2021.During the withdrawal, the US evacuated around 125,000 people, including 6,000 Americans.

Former US national security adviser John Bolton has criticised Sebastian Gorka , President-elect Donald Trump 's choice for a counterterrorism position, calling him a ""con man"" and questioning his qualifications. This comes after Gorka was appointed as deputy assistant to the president and senior director for counterterrorism.In an interview with CNN, Bolton said, “Sebastian Gorka is a con man.I wouldn’t have him in any US government.” He argued that Gorka’s appointment could harm counterterrorism efforts.“Fortunately, it’s not the highest position he had been mentioned for. But I don’t think it bodes well for counterterrorism efforts when the [National Security Council’s] senior director is someone like that,” Bolton added.Bolton further raised doubts about Gorka’s qualifications and suggested an FBI investigation into his educational background. He claimed Gorka’s appointment was based on loyalty to Trump rather than merit.“He needs a full-field FBI background investigation about his educational claims and things like that. I think he is a perfect example of someone who owes his position purely to Donald Trump,” Bolton said.Bolton also criticized Trump’s leadership style, claiming the president values blind loyalty over independent opinions. “He doesn’t display loyalty. He displays fealty. And that’s what Trump wants,” Bolton remarked. “He doesn’t want Gorka’s opinions. He wants Gorka to say, ‘Yes, sir.’ And I am fully confident that’s exactly what will happen no matter what Trump says.”This is not the first time Bolton has publicly criticized Trump’s appointments. He previously questioned the qualifications of Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence and Matt Gaetz for attorney general.","Former US national security adviser John Bolton has criticised Sebastian Gorka, President-elect Donald Trump's choice for a counterterrorism position.

Adani Group denies allegations

NEW DELHI: The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will need to use formal diplomatic protocols to serve summons on Adani Group Founder Gautam Adani and his nephew, Sagar Adani, in a case involving alleged payoffs of $265 million (Rs 2,200 crore) to secure solar energy contracts. The SEC lacks jurisdiction to directly summon foreign nationals and must channel its request through the Indian Embassy in the US, sources said.The procedure is governed by the 1965 Hague Convention and the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between India and the US.Officials familiar with the matter clarified that summons cannot simply be mailed but must adhere to these formalities, which could delay the process.The SEC’s summons, dated November 21 and filed in a New York court, mandates a response within 21 days of receipt. ""If you fail to respond, judgment by default will be entered against you,"" the notice warns.Gautam Adani, his nephew Sagar, and others, including Cyril Cabanes of Azure Power Global, face accusations of paying bribes between 2020 and 2024 to secure lucrative solar contracts. These deals allegedly promised $2 billion in profits over 20 years.The indictment, unsealed on Wednesday, alleges the Adani Group raised $2 billion in loans and bonds, including from US firms, based on misleading anti-bribery claims. Prosecutors say the inquiry, initiated in 2022, encountered obstruction.""As alleged, the defendants orchestrated an elaborate scheme to bribe Indian government officials to secure contracts worth billions of dollars and... lied about the bribery scheme as they sought to raise capital from U.S. and international investors,"" said US Attorney Breon Peace.""My office is committed to rooting out corruption in the international marketplace and protecting investors from those who seek to enrich themselves at the expense of the integrity of our financial markets,"" he added.The Adani Group has strongly denied the charges. ""The Adani Group has always upheld and is steadfastly committed to maintaining the highest standards of governance, transparency, and regulatory compliance across all jurisdictions of its operations,"" the company stated.The group assured stakeholders and partners of its compliance with laws and indicated its intention to explore all legal avenues to counter the allegations.An indictment in the US signifies formal charges issued by a grand jury, requiring the accused to respond or face default judgment.

Adul Nabi Bangash, a local politician in Parachinar, the district headquarters, told TOI that on Friday night a group of Shia Muslims attacked Sunni areas, such as Bagan bazaar, with light and heavy weapons. He revealed that both sides had raised militias soon after Thursday’s incident.A local administration official said the dead in the latest clashes included 18 Shias and 14 Sunnis. Nearly 50 others were wounded in overnight fighting.Dr Qaisar Abbas, a district health officer in Kurram, confirmed the casualties and described the condition of nine wounded as serious.Eyewitnesses said armed men broke into stores, petrol stations, homes and govt buildings in Kurram’s Bagan and Bacha Kot neighbourhoods after Friday prayers. Social media users shared videos and pictures of a burning market with orange flames piercing the night sky. Gunfire can also be heard in the background.Businesses, educational institutions and markets remained closed across Parachinar and surrounding areas for the second consecutive day on Saturday. Describing the situation as extremely tense, officials said mobile phone signals remain suspended across the district. Internet services, however, have been blocked in the region for several months.About 150 people have been killed in recent months due to escalating sectarian violence in the mountainous district, which borders Afghanistan on three sides.Previous clashes in July and Sept, which had killed dozens of people, ended only after a council of elders called for a ceasefire.Meanwhile, thousands of people participated in a sit-in in Parachinar, where protesters criticised govt’s failure to protect civilians. Shop owners in the region had announced a three-day strike on Friday to protest against the attack while locals described an atmosphere of fear across the district.No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, which came a week after authorities had reopened a key highway in the region that had been closed for months following deadly clashes. Speculation also surrounds the involvement of the banned terrorist group Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has recently been active in the lower part of Kurram.

PESHAWAR: A mob ransacked and set fire to two police check points on Friday to protest the killing of nearly 50 people by militants in the restive province in northwest Pakistan . Heavily-armed militants on Thursday ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing around 50 people, mostly Shias, in one of the worst attacks in the region in recent years.Rescue authorities said around 50 people, including eight women and five children, were killed and 20 others injured in the attack while police initially confirmed 45 deaths. The toll was raised to 47 on Friday.No group claimed responsibility for the attack on passenger vans.On Friday, in response to the Thurday's killings, all markets and educational institutions in Parachinar remained closed even as enraged locals blocked the main road by burning tires.After a lot of protests, the crowd ransacked Bab-e-Kurram, an entry point to Baggan Main Bazar and burnt two police check points at Palachinar.Deputy Commissioner Kurram Javed Ullah Mehsud said efforts are underway to save the lives of those injured in the barbaric shooting.

The attack is one of the worst in recent years in Pakistan's volatile northwest, a region frequently plagued by sectarian violence and militant assaults.The convoy was en route from Parachinar to Peshawar when gunmen opened fire.Javed Ullah Mehsud, the deputy commissioner of Kurram, confirmed that 45 people have died in the attack on the convoy, while rescue teams rushed to assist the wounded.Although no group has officially claimed responsibility for the attack, the region is known to be under the influence of the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has been linked to similar attacks in the area.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) government spokespersons indicated that the convoy, initially reported to have included 200 vehicles, was traveling through areas dominated by militant groups, raising fears of further escalations in an already tense region.Pakistan’s President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the ambush, calling it a ""cowardly and inhumane act"" and urging that those responsible be brought to justice. He also called for immediate medical aid for the injured.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif echoed Zardari’s sentiments, terming the attack a “brutal” assault on innocent citizens. ""The enemies of the peace of the country attacked the convoy of innocent citizens which is tantamount to brutality. All attempts of anti-national elements to destroy the peace of the beloved country will be thwarted,"" he stated, promising to track down the perpetrators.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur also condemned the attack, directing a delegation of provincial officials to visit Kurram district to assess the situation and report back. He has also ordered the establishment of a Provincial Highways Police unit to secure roads in the region.""Targeting innocent civilians is extremely tragic and condemnable. Those involved in this incident will not escape the grip of the law,"" Gandapur added, offering condolences to the victims' families and announcing financial assistance for them.The area has long been a hotspot for sectarian tensions between Shia and Sunni Muslims, primarily stemming from a longstanding land dispute.This volatile region has witnessed multiple sectarian clashes this year. In October, at least 16 people, including women and children, were killed in similar violence. In September, more than 50 people were killed and 120 injured in clashes between Shia and Sunni tribes over land disputes. This violence led to the closure of critical roads and disrupted essential services in the area. Similar clashes in July resulted in dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries.Kurram district borders Afghanistan’s Khost, Paktia, Logar, and Nangarhar provinces, known as strongholds for groups like ISIS and the Pakistani Taliban, complicating efforts to curb violence in the area.","Militants ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district on Thursday, killing around 50 people.

Bannu has seen heightened militant violence of late, including the abductions of cops, attack on a prison, attack on a girls’ school, and shootouts that have left several security officials dead.On Monday, over half a dozen policemen were abducted from a checkpost in an adjacent North Waziristan tribal district. They were later recovered by police, with the help of tribal elders.Over the weekend at least eight security personnel were killed and three injured in fierce gun battles with militants in Tirah valley of Khyber tribal district, bordering Afghanistan.On Saturday, at least seven security officials were killed and 18 others wounded in Baluchistan’s Kalat region in a pre-dawn terrorist attack on a checkpost. Earlier this month, at least 26 people, including 16 security personnel, lost their lives and 61 others were injured in a suicide bombing at a railway station in Quetta, Baluchistan’s capital.","At least 12 soldiers and six terrorists were killed in a clash between security forces and militants.

Pakistan approves military offensive against separatists in Balochistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-approves-military-offensive-against-separatists-in-balochistan/articleshow/115501124.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Amid a sharp increase in the number of attacks, Pakistani authorities have announced a plan to launch a comprehensive military offensive against separatist militant groups in the country’s southwestern Balochistan province.The surge in attacks in the province had prompted Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to summon a high-profile meeting of civil and military officials in Islamabad on Tuesday to discuss the security situation in Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.“The participants approved a comprehensive military operation against terrorist organisations operating in Balochistan, including the Majeed Brigade (a suicide squad), Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), and Baloch Raaji Aajoi Sangar (BRAS), who are targeting innocent civilians and foreign nationals to scuttle Pakistan’s economic progress by creating insecurity at the behest of hostile external powers,” said a statement issued by the PM’s office after the meeting.The meeting was attended by members of Sharif’s cabinet, provincial CMs and the chiefs of the three armed services. “The army chief reiterated the Pakistan military’s unwavering resolve to eliminate all threats to national security and provide robust support to govt’s initiatives aimed at ensuring peace and stability,” the statement read. It, however, did not give any details about when the military operation would be launched and in which parts of the province.Restive Balochistan, Pakistan’s biggest province by area but poor in terms of development, has been home to a nearly two-decade-old insurgency by separatist militant groups of ethnic Baloch nationals who carry out frequent attacks against the govt, army, and Chinese interests in the region. The insurgents say they are fighting what they see as unfair exploitation of the province’s mineral and gas wealth by the federation at the centre.Pakistan’s govt and military deny the charge that they are exploiting Balochistan’s resources and have long been blaming neighbouring India, Afghanistan, and Iran for fomenting trouble in the province.Thousands of Chinese nationals are currently stationed in Pakistan working on Beijing’s investment projects, such as a strategic port, economic zones, road and infrastructure, and gold and copper mine projects, under the banner of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), part of Beijing’s multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative. The CPEC aims to connect China’s northern Xinjiang province with Pakistan’s port city of Gwadar, Balochistan.

However, his release from prison remains uncertain as he continues to face multiple charges.The 71-year-old former cricketer has been behind bars since August 2023, serving a 14-year sentence alongside his wife, Bushra Bibi, in the Toshakhana, or state treasury, case. The case centers on accusations that the couple illegally acquired and sold state gifts worth over 140 million Pakistan rupees (£501,000) during Khan's tenure as prime minister from 2018 to 2022. Both Khan and his wife deny the allegations.The Toshakhana case alleges that Khan misused state-owned gifts, including diamond jewelry and seven luxury watches , six of which were Rolexes. Among the most expensive items listed is a watch valued at 85 million Pakistan rupees (£305,000).Bushra Bibi, who was arrested in July, was granted bail and released from Adiala Jail on October 24 after nearly nine months in custody. However, on Thursday, a trial court rejected the acquittal requests of both Khan and Bushra Bibi in the Toshakhana II case, which alleges financial losses to the national exchequer from their actions. The court ordered Khan to appear before the trial court after securing bail, warning that his bail could be revoked if he failed to cooperate.""If the official order is received today, his family and supporters will approach the authorities for his release,"" said Salman Safdar, one of Khan’s lawyers. He further claimed that Khan has either been granted bail or acquitted in all other cases he is currently facing.Despite being in jail, Khan’s political influence remains strong. PTI emerged as the largest bloc in February’s general election, although it fell short of a majority and lost. Khan's supporters claim that judicial proceedings are being used to suppress dissent, while the government insists it does not interfere with the judiciary.","Imran Khan was granted bail on Wednesday by the Islamabad high court in a case involving the alleged illegal sale of state gifts.

Wounded Bangladesh protesters receive robotic helping hand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/wounded-bangladesh-protesters-receive-robotic-helping-hand/articleshow/115619038.cms,"(Reuters photo)

DHAKA: Squeezing rubber-covered robotic prosthetic hands , Bangladesh protesters wounded during the deadly revolution to topple autocratic leader Sheikh Hasina test out replacement arms for their lost limbs.""I'll be able to do some everyday tasks with this artificial hand,"" said student Hafeez Mohammad Hossain, 19, whose right hand was ripped off in gunfire on August 5.It was the same day protesters stormed Hasina's palace as she fled to India by helicopter.In the middle of the chaos, Hossain said a police officer levelled a shotgun at him and fired. He described searing pain as gun pellets lacerated his back and leg.Surgeons picked out the gunshot, but were unable to save his hand.""I can't write anymore,"" Hossain said. ""I'm struggling to learn how to write with my left hand.""On Thursday he was fitted with a prosthetic limb, alongside four other students who also lost their hands during the months-long protests in which at least 700 people were killed during a police crackdown.Robolife Technologies , a Bangladeshi organisation manufacturing artificial hands, said the prosthetic limbs use sensors connected to the nerves to move.The company says it allows users to grasp objects, to type and use a phone.""If you ask me whether they work like organic hands, I'd say no,"" said Antu Karim, who is working on the government-backed project to fit the limbs.""But these hands allow the boys to hold a glass if thirsty, or a spoon to eat,"" he added. ""At least, they won't be looked down upon for not having hands.""- 'Rely on others' -Hasina's 15-year tenure saw widespread human rights abuses , including the mass detention and extrajudicial killings of her political opponents.Limbless protesters held a rally earlier this month demanding the interim government who took over after Hasina's fall support those injured in the protests.Many say they have not received the aid they need.The four other former protesters who had arms fitted on Thursday included Mohammad Mamun Mia, 32, a father of two, whose hand was hacked off by a gang he said was loyal to Hasina's Awami League party.The new arm is far from perfect, but it has made a huge difference.""I'll be able to do some regular tasks with this hand,"" he said, saying that while he cannot work driving a tractor in the fields again, he hopes now to open a small business.Arif Hossain Sagar, 19, had his hand amputated after it failed to heal from an injury he sustained during the protests, and doctors worried about gangrene.""I can't do any regular activities now,"" Sagar told AFP. ""I rely on others for eating or bathing.""The new hand will return a degree of normality to his life, he said.Nayeem Hasan, wounded when attackers pounced on him as he went to donate blood to help those injured after a fire, broke into tears.The new arm would help him fulfil his simple dream.""I have a one-year-old daughter who wants me to hold her,"" Hasan said.","Hafeez Mohammad Hossain's right hand was ripped off in gunfire on August 5.

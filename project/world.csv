'Ban H-1B visas': Desi MAGA backer Nalin Haley wants corporates to hire 'certain number of Americans',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ban-h-1b-visas-desi-maga-backer-nalin-haley-wants-corporates-to-hire-certain-number-of-americans-watch/articleshow/125732051.cms,"



Nalin Haley, son of Indian-origin former US ambassador and South Carolina governor Nikki Haley , has again taken aim at the H-1B visa programme while calling on Republicans to prioritise issues affecting young Americans. In a recent appearance on Fox News, he argued that young people feel increasingly shut out of the US job market and housing economy, saying Republican leaders are not addressing their concerns.Haley said the first step for the party was to acknowledge the widening gap between young Americans and the opportunities they were promised. “The goal of every generation is to leave better than you found it right, and now that we are not doing that we are going in the opposite direction and it's getting worse,” he said, adding that GOP leaders were not speaking to these anxieties. “Congress is nothing more than a glorified nursing home. They either don’t know the problems we’re facing or they are ignoring it, and I don't know which one is worse.”Pointing to rising unemployment among graduates, Haley said many of his peers with strong academic credentials are unable to find work. “My friend group graduated with great degrees from great schools and not one of them has a job,” he noted, arguing that they must now compete with “foreign workers who are willing to work half their salary and AI, which is a supercomputer.”He tied these frustrations to the housing market, saying first-time home buyers are older than ever. Haley pushed a range of policy steps, including scrapping the H-1B programme. “I think some things that we need to do is, banning H1b visas, make sure corporations are hiring certain numbers of Americans… and not allow corporations and the Chinese Communist Party to buy entire neighborhoods with single family homes,” he said. He also argued that subsidies should prioritise American first-time home buyers over undocumented immigrants.Asked about complaints that young Americans want “free stuff,” Haley said the real issue was the shrinking attainability of the American dream. “Right it seems less and less attainable with each passing day,” he responded, adding that rejecting neoliberal free-market policies did not necessarily mean embracing socialism. “Capitalism is a broad thing. We need it to work for the average every day American and not just for elites and corporations. ”Haley warned that Republicans risk losing Gen Z if they do not engage more directly. “When you look at Gen Z most of them have a positive view of socialism… Democrat socialist are reaching out to young people,” he said. “So if Republicans do that, which they need to do, it may stop a lot of people my age from going to Democrats.”","Nalin Haley, son of Indian-origin former US ambassador and South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, has again taken aim at the H-1B visa programme.

Allie Beth Stuckey pushes back on Candace Owens’ claim





Candace Owens made a strong claim about Charlie Kirk . She said Charlie Kirk was “betrayed” by people inside Turning Point USA. She wrote on X that she is “fully confident” about this. She also said she will soon share proof and name the people she thinks hurt him. Owens told people who gave money to Turning Point USA that they should ask for a refund because “leadership knew.”Charlie Kirk, who was a well-known American political activist, was shot and killed on September 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University. He was doing a “Prove Me Wrong” talk at the campus when the shooting happened. After his death, Donald Trump said Charlie had once told him he might run for president one day.Owens’ new claim has brought a lot of attention because many people loved Charlie Kirk. Many want to know what she will say next. Many also want to see the proof she says she has. There is also tension inside the Turning Point USA community. This is because some people close to Charlie do not agree with Owens.A Christian influencer named Allie Beth Stuckey spoke out against Candace Owens. She talked about it on her show, Relatable. Stuckey said she did not want to answer Owens in public at first. But she said she felt hurt when Owens suggested she “did not care” about who killed Charlie Kirk.Stuckey wrote on X that she cares deeply and wants the truth. She also said that “just asking questions” does not allow people to spread wrong claims.Allie Beth Stuckey said she wants Christians to look for truth in a fair way. She said words matter, and people should speak with care. Stuckey has been invited to take Charlie’s place on parts of his college tour. She has also appeared on the Charlie Kirk Show since his passing.While Stuckey spoke gently, Candace Owens made an even bigger claim. She said, “Charlie was betrayed. By everyone.” Her words have shocked many people who followed Charlie and his work.After Charlie’s death, his wife Erika Kirk became the new CEO of Turning Point USA. She said she wants to keep his work going.

Perez Hilton explains why Meghan Markle’s turkey video caused a big safety debate







Meghan Markle went viral over Thanksgiving, and the talk quickly turned sharp after many people online said she made a “major safety hazard” in her kitchen. On December 2, 2025, celebrity blogger Perez Hilton jumped into the conversation and joked that Meghan Markle now had a new nickname: “Salmonella Sussex. ” Hilton shared a post on X and wrote, “Martha Stewart would never!” The line spread fast, and so did the clip that started all the drama.The clip came from Meghan Markle’s Instagram Story on November 28. In the video, she showed herself mixing seasoning and rubbing it on a raw turkey with almost bare hands. She also wore her gold wedding band and bracelet while touching the meat. This upset many people because food-safety rules warn against touching raw poultry without gloves and while wearing jewelry. The video was captioned, “Let the ‘game’ begin. Get it? #momjokes.”As the video made its way around social media, comments poured in. Many users teased the Duchess of Sussex for not following basic kitchen safety. And that is when Hilton decided to speak up.In his article , Perez Hilton said the main issue was not Meghan Markle cooking a turkey. It was how she touched and “massaged” the raw meat with almost bare hands and multiple pieces of jewelry.He said that food experts, including the CDC, warn that raw turkey can carry dangerous bacteria like Salmonella and Campylobacter, and the “juices” from the turkey can contaminate anything they touch.Hilton also pointed to FDA guidance, which says that only a plain wedding band is allowed for food workers because bacteria get stuck inside small cracks in jewelry. He noted that Meghan Markle wore more than just her band, and he reacted by writing, “Yeesh!!!”To make the worry bigger, Hilton added that Meghan was not only cooking for her family. In her own newsletter, she said she was also hosting friends for Thanksgiving. He wrote that taking that risk when guests are coming over is not a good idea and joked, “Hope nobody got sick!”As more people reacted online, Hilton said fans “roasted” Meghan for the kitchen mistake. Many comments said it was a simple rule she should have known.Meghan Markle will be back on Netflix with her holiday special With Love, Meghan: Holiday Celebration, which starts streaming on December 3. She also has an acting cameo coming up in the movie Close Personal Friends.Also Read: “I Will Be Naming…”: Candace Owens Alleges TPUSA Leaders Betrayed Charlie Kirk Before Deadly Shooting And Vows To Show Evidence","Perez Hilton joked that Meghan Markle now has a new nickname: “Salmonella Sussex. ” Hilton shared a post on X and wrote, “Martha Stewart would never!” The line spread fast, and so did the clip that started all the drama.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125730499,imgsize-854168,width-400,resizemode-4/meghan-markle-faces-backlash-as-perez-hilton-calls-her-turkey-clip-a-safety-hazard-and-names-her-salmonella-sussex.jpg"
"‘Subject to attack’: Trump warns any country trafficking drugs to US can be striked; names Colombia, Bogota hits back",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/subject-to-attack-trump-warns-any-country-trafficking-drugs-to-us-can-be-striked-names-colombia-bogota-hits-back/articleshow/125731104.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned that any nation sending illegal drugs into the United States could face military strikes, prompting a sharp response from Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused Washington of threatening his country’s sovereignty.Speaking to reporters during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump referred to cocaine shipments from Colombia and said, ""Anybody that's doing that and selling it into our country is subject to attack."" The comments came as the administration continues missile strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific, operations that have killed dozens in recent months.Petro responded on X with an invitation layered with a warning. He said Colombia destroys a drug-production laboratory every 40 minutes “without missiles” and urged Trump to witness the operations firsthand. “Come to Colombia, Mr. Trump, I invite you, so that you can participate in the destruction of the 9 laboratories we do daily to prevent cocaine from reaching the US,” he wrote.Petro added: “Without missiles, I have destroyed 18,400 laboratories during my government; come with me and I'll show you how they are destroyed, one laboratory every 40 minutes, but do not threaten our sovereignty, because you will awaken the Jaguar.Attacking our sovereignty is declaring war; do not damage two centuries of diplomatic relations.”He further said, “You have already slandered me; do not continue down that path. If there is a country that has helped stop thousands of tons of cocaine so that North Americans do not consume it, it is Colombia.”The exchange comes amid rising tensions in the region. The US military has increased its presence in the Caribbean as the Trump administration accuses Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro - whose country borders Colombia - of enabling drug flows into the United States. Maduro has denied the allegations. Trump has also recently suggested that US intervention in Venezuela remains possible.On Tuesday, Trump broadened his warning, saying countries other than Venezuela could also face US action. “I hear the country of Colombia is making cocaine, they have cocaine manufacturing plants, and then they sell us their cocaine,” he said.Petro, who has been sanctioned by the Trump administration, reiterated his caution in a second message: “Do not threaten our sovereignty, or you will awake the Jaguar… Attacking our sovereignty is declaring war.”",US President Donald Trump warned that any nation sending illegal drugs into the United States could face military strikes.

Trump's Shock New Threat Against Venezuela; Maduro On Alert? | 'WE'RE TAKING OUT SONS OF BITC**S'





Gavin Newsom on Wednesday shared a video from US President Donald Trump’s December 2 cabinet meeting, claiming the 79-year-old leader appeared to nod off as senior officials briefed him on key issues, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict.In the clip circulated by the California governor, Trump can be seen sitting with his eyes narrowed and at times fully shut while his secretary of state speaks beside him about how “he is the only leader who can help end” Russia-Ukraine war.News portal People also reported that during the three-hour meeting, the president appeared to close his eyes for several seconds, including during commerce secretary Howard Lutnick’s remarks, before leaning forward again.The visuals drew attention as Trump had posted more than 160 times on Truth Social the previous night between 7pm (local time) and midnight and was active again before 6am People reported this alongside past observations highlighted by The New York Times about Trump’s reduced public schedule and moments when “his battery shows signs of wear,” as noted in a recent NYT report.The White House rejected suggestions that the president had dozed off.Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to People: “President Trump was listening attentively and running the entire three-hour marathon cabinet meeting,” before reiterating a new administration line regarding Somali immigrants in Minnesota. She added: “Just go back and watch his amazing final answer in the press conference… This epic moment put an exclamation point on President Trump’s ninth Cabinet meeting of his second term. ”Last year, Trump similarly pushed back on reports that he had fallen asleep during his New York criminal trial, after multiple courtroom accounts - including one from The New York Times - described him with “his mouth going slack and his head drooping onto his chest.”He dismissed those descriptions, writing: “Contrary to the FAKE NEWS MEDIA, I don’t fall asleep during the Crooked DA’s Witch Hunt… I simply close my beautiful blue eyes, sometimes, listen intensely, and take it ALL in!!!”Trump has often mocked former president Joe Biden as “Sleepy Joe,” and last month criticised Biden again while images of Trump with closed eyes during an Oval Office announcement went viral. “He sleeps all the time… I’m not a sleeper,” Trump said at the time, while meeting Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman.Amid questions about age and stamina, Trump recently pointed to a “PERFECT PHYSICAL EXAM AND A COMPREHENSIVE COGNITIVE TEST ('That was aced')” which he said he had taken recently, responding to NYT reporting on his routine.","Gavin Newsom shared a video from US President Donald Trump’s December 2 cabinet meeting, claiming the 79-year-old leader appeared to nod off.

Stonehenge just got stranger: Archaeologists confirm massive man-made ring of pits underground,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/stonehenge-just-got-stranger-archaeologists-confirm-massive-man-made-ring-of-pits-underground/articleshow/125725186.cms,"Near Stonehenge in Wiltshire, archaeologists confirmed a ring of twenty man-made pits around Durrington Walls, each about ten metres across/ Image: History.com

What exactly has been found?

“The circle is pretty accurate. It suggests that people were pacing the distances out to make sure that the pits were aligned at the same distance all the way around as the distance from the henge to the earlier enclosure.”

How did archaeologists prove the pits are man-made?



“The exceptional size of the pits demanded a novel strategy to explore them without the need for a major, and very expensive, excavation,” he said. “As no single technology can answer all the questions; multiple types of geophysics equipment was used to establish the size and shape of the pits.”

the Guardian

“They can’t be occurring naturally. It just can’t happen. We think we’ve nailed it.”

What might the pit circle have meant?

why

""Now that we’re confident that the pits are a structure, we’ve got a massive monument inscribing the cosmology of the people at the time on to the land in a way we haven’t seen before,"" he said.

""If it’s going to happen anywhere in Britain, it’s going to happen at Stonehenge.""

Stonehenge has long appeared to be the centrepiece of Britain’s ancient ritual world. Yet scientists now argue it may have been only the visible tip of something far grander. Beneath the surrounding landscape near Stonehenge in Wiltshire, researchers have verified a massive circuit of man-made pits, one of the largest prehistoric structures ever identified in Britain, suggesting the builders inscribed their beliefs into the earth on a scale we never previously recognised. The whole complex was built between 3100 BC and 1600 BC, and clearly the people who created it had a purpose driving their work.The newly confirmed structure sits around Durrington Walls and Woodhenge in Wiltshire, within the wider Stonehenge World Heritage Site.Archaeologists have identified around 20 massive pits, each roughly 10 metres in diameter and more than 5 metres deep, set at regular intervals to form what they call the Durrington pit circle. According to the research team, these pits are more than 4,000 years old and were deliberately excavated by humans, evidence that the Stonehenge landscape contains engineered features far beyond the iconic stone circle above ground.Professor Vince Gaffney of the University of Bradford told the BBC that the pits were not only intentionally dug, but also carefully positioned relative to another nearby monument, a level of effort that implies planning, measurement and purpose. Taken as a single design, he said, the precision is striking:The pits were first outlined in 2020, based on large-scale geophysical survey work around Stonehenge. At the time, some archaeologists hailed the feature as “one of the largest prehistoric structures in Britain”, and even suggested it might be early evidence of numerical counting because the circle is too large to have been laid out by eye alone.But there was a problem: not everyone was convinced the features were artificial. Some specialists argued they might be natural hollows in the chalk, and the whole “ring” a coincidence.The new study, published in Internet Archaeology, called The Perils of Pits is intended to settle that argument.Because the pits are so large, they can’t simply be dug out and inspected without a vast excavation. Instead, the team combined several scientific techniques to “see” into the ground and date what was there – a strategy Gaffney describes as unprecedented for a site like this.Before any dramatic claims were made, researchers began by scanning the landscape around Durrington Walls using high-resolution survey tools. The data revealed a striking circular pattern beneath the soil, as if an enormous ring of voids were hiding in the chalk.To investigate further, the team used methods such as electrical resistance tomography to estimate how deep these features went, followed by radar and magnetometry to visualise their shapes underground. This confirmed that real, steep-sided hollows existed where the model predicted, but it still left open the question of whether humans or nature created them.To answer that, the archaeologists turned to the soil itself. They extracted slender cores from deep within the pits and analysed the layers of sediment using techniques designed to read history in the earth.One method, optically stimulated luminescence, dates soil by measuring when it was last exposed to sunlight, effectively telling us when the pits were originally opened and when they were eventually filled in. Another method, sedimentary DNA analysis, pulled preserved fragments of ancient biological material from the soil. In these samples, researchers found traces of animals such as sheep and cattle, evidence of a human-shaped landscape of settlement, grazing and ritual activity rather than a random geological formation.Dr Tim Kinnaird of the University of St Andrews, who used luminescence dating on the sediments, described the complex as a kind of “super henge”, and said the dates showed the pits were dug in the late Neolithic and kept open for roughly 1,000 years, spanning changing cultures.The crucial point, Gaffney told, is that the same soil pattern appears again and again in cores from different pits around the ring:Taken together, the depth, shape, dating and repeated soil signatures convinced the team that these are not random sinkholes but deliberately excavated features, forming a single monumental design in the landscape.No one is pretending we now know exactlyNeolithic communities dug a ring of yawning shafts around Durrington Walls – the people who did it left no written explanation, and the pits themselves are now infilled and invisible on the surface.But the scale and layout make one thing clear: this was not casual ditch-digging.Some pits are thought to be 10 metres wide and 5 metres deep, cut into hard chalk. Carving perhaps 20 of them, accurately spaced over more than a mile, would have demanded planning, labour and an agreed vision of what the circle was for.Gaffney and his colleagues think the structure may have been tied to ideas about an underworld, in contrast to Stonehenge’s familiar alignments with the Sun and sky, and at least shows that ancient peoples were able to muster a significant workforce to put all this together.The pits’ long life , apparently maintained or respected for around a millennium, suggests that whatever the original purpose, later communities kept recognising the circle as meaningful, even as practices shifted.For now, archaeologists are careful to emphasise what remains uncertain: whether the pits marked a boundary, guided movement through the landscape, signalled restricted areas, or acted as symbolic markers of some kind. What the new research does establish, though, is significant. It shifts the Durrington pit circle from speculation to confirmed human construction, a large, deliberate feature that changes how we understand the wider Stonehenge area. Instead of thinking only in terms of the stones themselves, we have to recognise a landscape shaped by people both on the surface and below it.","Archaeologists have identified around 20 massive pits, each roughly 10 metres in diameter and more than 5 metres deep, set at regular intervals to form what they call the Durrington pit circle.

A Manhattan judge on Monday reviewed key evidence in the murder case against Luigi Mangione , including a 911 call from the Altoona, Pennsylvania McDonald’s where he was arrested last year after a dayslong manhunt after he killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.Mangione has pleaded not guilty in both state and federal cases, with federal prosecutors seeking the death penalty.According to Gothamist, prosecutors played the 911 recording in which the McDonald’s manager told a dispatcher the man in the restaurant “looks like the CEO shooter,” adding that customers were “really upset.” Mangione was arrested there on December 9, 2024, five days after Thompson was killed outside the Midtown Hilton in Manhattan.At Monday’s hearing, prosecutors also showed widely circulated surveillance footage of a masked gunman firing at Thompson at close range. Mangione, appearing in court in a grey suit and checkered shirt, watched the footage without visible reaction and took notes, Gothamist reported.His defence team is seeking to toss evidence recovered during his arrest, including a handgun, a loaded magazine and a handwritten notebook found in his backpack.His attorneys argue police conducted an unlawful, warrantless search. Prosecutors say the arrest and search were lawful and that the backpack’s contents tie the 27-year-old to the killing. Much of the same evidence is also being challenged in the federal case.Testimony from a Pennsylvania corrections officer who said Mangione was placed on “constant watch” at SCI-Huntington before extradition because the prison “did not want an ‘Epstein-style’ situation.”The hearing drew unusually large crowds as Mangione’s supporters — some dressed as Nintendo’s Super Mario characters — gathered outside the court holding “Free Luigi” signs and calling for “no death penalty.” A new photo of Mangione from court went viral on social media, echoing the attention he has received since his arrest.The judge in the state case is expected to rule on the suppression issues and could set a trial date in the coming days.","Luigi Mangione, 27, is accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Singapore will require all secondary school students to keep their smartphones and smartwatches locked away for the entire duration of the school day from January 2026, extending an existing restriction that currently applies only during lesson time.The ministry of education (MOE) announced the new rules on November 30, saying they are intended to curb digital distractions and promote healthier screen habits, reported Gulf news.Under the revised policy, students must store devices in lockers or bags not just during classes, but also through recess, co-curricular activities and remedial sessions. Schools may grant exceptions “where necessary,” the ministry said.Citing research on excessive screen exposure, the MOE noted that “screen use among students has been shown to displace important activities such as sleep, physical activity and social interactions.” The ministry added that reducing in-school device dependence is part of a broader effort to improve student wellbeing.Alongside the new restrictions, default ‘sleep hours’ on government-issued learning devices will shift from 11pm to 10.30pm starting January.Parents who have opted out of after-school limits have been urged to adopt the earlier cutoff at home.The move aligns with a growing global push to limit digital distractions in schools. UNESCO estimates that about 40 per cent of education systems now impose smartphone bans. Australia is set to introduce a nationwide bar on social media use for those under 16 next week, while China’s Zhengzhou district requires parents to justify why a child needs a phone “for pedagogical reasons.”The MOE said schools will work closely with parents and reinforce Cyber Wellness education to help students build healthier online habits.","Singapore will require all secondary school students to keep their smartphones and smartwatches locked away for the entire duration of the school day from January 2026.

Speaking at a press conference at the CM House, Afridi claimed that Imran Khan, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, has been held in “complete isolation” since November 4, with no one granted access to him.He said that Khan’s sisters, senior party leaders, lawyers, and even doctors have all been barred from meeting him, effectively placing him in total solitary confinement—a situation he described as “extremely alarming.”PTI leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan. After KP CM Afridi ordered the party members to immediately move to Islamabad, the party has also asked the supporters to gather outside the Adiala Jail later.Talking to reporters, Afridi said that on Tuesday, all parliamentarians would first gather at the IHC to stage a strong protest before the court’s chief justice, noting that despite judicial orders, he himself was not allowed to meet Khan.“This is blatant contempt of court. We will hold a protest at the IHC,” Afridi asserted.He said the parliamentarians would then move to Adiala Jail to attempt to meet Khan and to express solidarity with his sisters.Following the announcement of protests, the Rawalpindi deputy commissioner's office issued the notice on Monday that Section 144 shall be imposed in the city from December 1 to December 3. According to the notice, the order has been enforced on the basis of “imminent threats” identified by the district intelligence committee (DIC), particularly in and around sensitive installations, major roads and other critical infrastructure. The committee’s assessment underpinned the local government’s decision to restrict public gatherings during this period.The Rawalpindi notification prohibits all kinds of gatherings of more than five people. As per the statement, ""All kinds of Assemblies, Gatherings, Sits-in, Rallies, Processions, Demonstrations, Jalsas, Dharnas, Protests and such like other activities, i.e gathering of 05 or more persons.""""Carrying of weapons, spikes, laden batons, gaulails, ball bearings, petrol bombs, improvised explosives or any other instrument that could potentially be used for violence,"" is also listed as one of the restrictions in the notice.Along with these, pillion riding and the use of loudspeakers or display of ""arms and hatred speeches"" are also prohibited.The Islamabad district magistrate’s office issued the order after what it described as “certain segments of society … planning to organise unlawful assemblies … within the jurisdiction of Islamabad Capital Territory,” according to a report in Dawn. The announcement in Rawalpindi came through a notification from the deputy commissioner’s office, which cited security concerns due to potential large gatherings.In Islamabad, the order did not define what would constitute an “unlawful assembly” but noted that authorities deemed it “necessary to control such types of illegal activities which present a threat to public peace, tranquillity and maintenance of law & order.”Pakistan’s former Prime Minister has remained completely out of sight for more than six weeks, with neither his party members nor his family able to establish any direct contact during this period. His prolonged absence from public view has intensified anxiety across the country, fuelling widespread speculation and deepening fears about his safety.The lack of verified updates or appearances has further heightened concerns, with many questioning whether the politician-turned-cricketer may have become the target of a possible assassination attempt or is otherwise being kept in undisclosed conditions.Khan’s sons fear authorities may be hiding “something irreversible” about his condition. His son, Kasim Khan, told Reuters that the family has had no direct or verifiable contact with the jailed former Prime Minister, despite a court order allowing weekly meetings.“Not knowing whether your father is safe, harmed, or even alive is psychological torture,” he said, noting that there has been no independently confirmed communication for months.“We have no reliable information about his condition,” he added. “Our deepest fear is that something irreversible is being kept from us.”Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, filed a contempt of court petition in the IHC on November 28 against the Adiala Jail superintendent and other officials, alleging they prevented her from meeting her brother.Submitting the petition in the presence of Chief Minister Afridi, she cited the IHC’s March 24 order, which had restored a twice-weekly visitation schedule for the 73-year-old former prime minister.Pakistan government officials have rejected rumours that Imran Khan has died in custody or been quietly moved out of Adiala Jail, insisting he remains inside the Rawalpindi facility and is in stable condition.“There is no truth to claims of his transfer from Adiala Jail. He is in good health and receiving full medical care,” Geo News quoted Rawalpindi prison officials as saying.Imran Khan is currently being held in Adiala Jail, where a court first handed him a three-year prison term in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Since then, successive corruption convictions have pushed his total sentence to 14 years, the longest jail term imposed on him so far.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi claimed that Imran Khan has been held in “complete isolation” since November 4. Khan’s sisters, senior party leaders, lawyers, and even doctors have all been barred from meeting him.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125710838,imgsize-1508415,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

A fire on the roof of the Raleigh convention center was contained within an hour on Monday night after a natural gas incident sparked flames around 9.30pm, according to city of Raleigh officials. No injuries were reported.City spokeswoman Julia Milstead told WRAL that the blaze was restricted to the roof and did not spread into the building’s interior. Lights remained on inside the centre during the incident, and no nearby structures were affected, even as flames and smoke were visible across downtown.Milstead said security staff were inside when the fire broke out but were able to exit quickly. Around 50 firefighters responded, and operations began scaling down by 10.45pm, though crews were expected to remain at the site overnight. Residents were advised to avoid the area while work continued.Videos on social media show flames shooting from the rooftop minutes after the fire started. No events were underway at the time.Raleigh mayor Janet Cowell described the convention centre as an “important civic asset” and said officials would meet at City Hall on Tuesday for updates. “I hope we can repair damage and have it back functioning normally as soon as possible,” she said.According to the convention centre’s website, the North Carolina cybersecurity summit is scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, followed by a holiday event on Friday.

Broader visa reforms in 2025





Thinking about retirement abroad? The UAE isn’t just a playground for investors and professionals, it’s also emerging as a smart, tax-friendly destination for retirees. With its 5-year renewable retirement visa, financially stable expatriates aged 55 and above can enjoy long-term residency without needing a job or running a business.But what does it really take to retire here? From minimum savings and property requirements to monthly income thresholds, understanding the costs, and planning wisely, can make the difference between a smooth move and a financial headache. Beyond the numbers, the visa offers clear perks: no income or property tax, access to world-class healthcare, and the freedom to bring your spouse and dependents along for a secure, comfortable lifestyle.Here’s a complete breakdown of the financial requirements, application steps, and benefits of the UAE retirement visa, so you can see if it makes sense for your retirement plans.The UAE’s retirement visa program provides a 5-year renewable residency option for foreign retirees who wish to settle in the country after their working years. The policy is applicable across all emirates, with Dubai offering an additional customized version of the program.It was officially introduced by the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Port Security (ICP) in December 2024, as part of a broader federal update to residency and ID regulations aimed at creating more flexible long-term visa pathways.Applicants must meet all of the following base criteria:In addition, applicants must fulfill at least one of the following financial conditions:Special Case (Dubai Only): Dubai residents are eligible with a lower income threshold of AED 15,000 ($4,050) per month.Applicants are also required to submit a bank statement from the past six months to confirm financial eligibility.The ICP (Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Port Security) manages the retirement visa application process through its digital platforms, namely the official ICP website and the UAEICP smart application.The process involves four primary steps through the UAEICP smart application or official website:In addition to federal guidelines, Dubai offers its own retirement visa initiative, tailored to attract global retirees, their spouses, and dependents. It comes with a choice of four financial qualification options, any one of which would make the applicant eligible:This flexibility allows applicants to tailor their approach based on income, assets, or a mix of both. Foreign applicants can apply through the GDRFAD website under the section titled ‘Issuing a residence permit for the retired foreigner’.To complete the application for the UAE Retirement Visa, applicants must provide documents specific to the financial route they are applying under. The documentation ensures the applicant meets eligibility criteria and supports the processing of the visa.Applicants applying through a financial deposit must submit:Applicants applying through regular income must submit:Note: All documents must be valid and clearly support the financial eligibility route chosen by the applicant. Failure to provide complete documentation may result in delays or rejection.While referred to by some as a “free” visa in media reports, the UAE retirement visa does involve multiple fees for processing, medical testing, and administrative services.Total Estimated Range: AED 2,300 to AED 3,800 ($621 to $1,026)These figures highlight that, while the visa is employment-independent, it is not fee-exempt, and applicants should budget accordingly.The retirement visa is more than just a residency document, it’s a cornerstone of the UAE’s broader strategy for global competitiveness and population diversification.The program strongly aligns with the UAE’s Vision 2031, aimed at diversifying national income sources, significantly increasing global talent retention, and transforming the Emirates into a full-spectrum and vibrant destination — not just for careers but also for retirement, investment, and overall holistic quality of life, reinforcing a strategic and inclusive framework that supports long-term enduring opportunities.The retirement visa is part of the UAE’s broader 2025 residency reforms aimed at attracting long-term residents across diverse sectors. Recent additions include the Blue Visa for environmental experts, expanded Golden Visas for teachers, nurses, digital content creators, and luxury yacht owners, and an enhanced Golden Visa for e-sports and gaming professionals. The rollout also features AI-driven processing for faster approvals, reflecting the UAE’s push for a more inclusive and efficient residency framework. These visa updates reinforce the UAE’s goal to attract and support residents at every stage of life.","Retirees aged 55+ can secure a UAE 5-year visa with AED 1 million in savings, property, or income.

Oregon: Indian man charged with criminally negligent homicide after crash kills two — what probe revealed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/oregon-indian-man-charged-with-criminally-negligent-homicide-after-crash-kills-two-what-probe-revealed/articleshow/125732478.cms,"Rajinder Kumar

'Kumar a criminal illegal; released into US under Biden': DHS

(With PTI inputs)





An Indian national who allegedly crossed into the US illegally three years ago has been charged with homicide after the semi-truck he was driving crashed into a car in Oregon, killing two people — the fourth such incident involving an Indian driver in recent months.Rajinder Kumar, 32, has been charged with criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangerment. The victims — William Micah Carter, 25, and Jennifer Lynn Lower, 24 — were pronounced dead at the scene. Kumar, who was reportedly intoxicated, escaped uninjured.The crash occurred on November 24 in Deschutes County, Oregon. According to the Oregon State Police, officers responding to the scene found a freightliner truck and trailer “stopped in a jackknifed position, blocking both lanes of travel.” A car travelling at highway speed struck the trailer, which was positioned perpendicular to the road.Police said dark conditions and the absence of active emergency warning equipment were key factors in the collision, which shut down the highway for about seven hours during the investigation.The driver was arrested for criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangering. He has been lodged in the Deschutes County Jail.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) described Rajinder Kumar as a “criminal illegal” from India, stating that he entered the US unlawfully through Lukeville, Arizona, on November 28, 2022.“Kumar was released into our country under the Biden administration and issued a commercial driver’s license by Gavin Newsom’s Department of Motor Vehicles. How many more senseless tragedies must take place before sanctuary politicians stop allowing illegal aliens to dangerously operate semi-trucks on America’s roads?” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, blaming California’s Democratic governor Gavin Newsom and former President Joe Biden, also a Democrat.The case is the latest in a series of fatal or serious crashes involving Indian nationals driving commercial trucks.In August, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which comes under DHS, lodged an arrest detainer for Harjinder Singh after he was charged with three counts of vehicular homicide while driving a semi-truck in Florida. That same month, ICE arrested Partap Singh, accused of causing a multi-vehicle pileup in California that left five-year-old Dalilah Coleman with critical, life-altering injuries.In October, ICE issued a detainer for Jashanpreet Singh, who allegedly killed three people in California while driving an 18-wheeler under the influence.","Rajinder Kumar, 32, has been charged with criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangerment.

Trump's 'PACK YOUR BAGS' Ultimatum To Putin Ally Maduro? US Senator Drops 'Russia Exit' Bombshell





Russia and the United States made no progress toward a possible peace deal to end the war in Ukraine after a five-hour meeting between President Vladimir Putin and two envoys sent by Donald Trump, the Kremlin said on Wednesday.Putin met late Tuesday with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, but the sides only reviewed the broad outlines of US proposals and did not reach any compromises or agree on holding a new Putin–Trump summit, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said.""The discussion was very useful, constructive and very substantive and lasted for not five minutes but five hours,"" Ushakov said, as cited by the New York Times.During the meeting, Putin reviewed the US proposals outlined in four documents sent to the Kremlin ahead of the talks.""We could agree on some things, and the president confirmed this to his interlocutors,"" Ushakov said. ""Other things provoked criticism, and the president also made no secret of our critical and even negative attitude toward a number of proposals. But the main thing is that a very useful discussion took place.""Ushakov said Putin conveyed “a series of important signals” and personal greetings to Trump during the talks, though both sides agreed not to reveal specifics to the media.He also confirmed that the discussions touched on the “territorial problem”, the Kremlin’s term for Russia’s claims over the entire Donbas region. Ukraine, however, continues to control roughly 5,000 square kilometres of the territory that Russia says is its own, and nearly all countries recognise Donbas as part of Ukraine.""But there’s still a lot of work to be done, both in Washington and in Moscow. That’s what’s been agreed upon. And contacts will continue,” Ushakov said.A 28-point US peace proposal unveiled last month faced criticism from Ukraine and several European governments for leaning too heavily toward Moscow. US officials later said some elements had been adjusted after feedback from Kyiv and European partners.Ahead of Tuesday’s talks, Putin struck a hardline tone, saying Russia would continue to push forward on the battlefield and portraying Ukraine’s leadership as weakened. Shortly before meeting Witkoff at the Kremlin, he insisted Russia did not seek a war with Europe but warned that if one began, it would “end so swiftly” that no one would remain for Moscow to negotiate with.He also threatened to cut off Ukraine’s access to the sea in retaliation for drone attacks on tankers from Russia’s “shadow fleet” in the Black Sea. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said the remarks highlighted that Putin was not prepared to end the war, as cited by Reuters.Trump’s peace plan calls on Europe to shoulder most of the financing and security guarantees for a postwar Ukraine, even though European governments were not consulted during its initial drafting.""Our people are over in Russia right now to see if we can get it settled. Not an easy situation, let me tell you. What a mess,"" Trump said in Washington on Tuesday.",Putin met late Tuesday with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in- law Jared Kushner.

‘Null and void’: Trump declares all Biden autopen-signed documents invalid; calls them ‘unauthorized’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/null-and-void-trump-declares-all-biden-autopen-signed-documents-invalid-calls-them-unauthorized/articleshow/125731145.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Tuesday declared that all official documents signed by former President Joe Biden using an autopen were “null, void, and of no further force or effect. ” In a post on Truth Social, Trump said any such document - ranging from executive orders to pardons - would no longer be recognised by his administration.The autopen, a long-used device in Washington that reproduces a leader’s signature, has been employed by multiple Democratic and Republican presidents. Trump, however, argued that Biden’s use of it was “unauthorized.”“Any and all Documents, Proclamations, Executive Orders, Memorandums, or Contracts, signed by Order of the now infamous and unauthorized 'AUTOPEN,' within the Administration of Joseph R Biden Jr, are hereby null, void, and of no further force or effect,” Trump wrote.He added, “Anyone receiving ‘Pardons,’ ‘Commutations,’ or any other Legal Document so signed, please be advised that said Document has been fully and completely terminated, and is of no Legal effect.”Trump has repeatedly claimed that Biden, because of age and health concerns, relied excessively on aides and tools like the autopen. He has earlier suggested that staff made decisions without Biden’s full involvement.Biden - before leaving the Oval Office - issued a series of pre-emptive pardons for several family members and political figures. These pardons were described as intended to protect allies and top officials, including high-profile figures such as general Mark Milley, Anthony Fauci, and members of the January 6 committee.Family members, including Biden’s brothers James and Frank, his sister Valerie, and their spouses, were also listed as recipients of clemency in these accounts. These descriptions framed the pardons as a precautionary move ahead of Trump’s inauguration.Trump’s latest declaration appears to be aimed at sweeping aside any documents from Biden’s presidency that carried an autopen signature, potentially setting up legal and political challenges over the validity of measures taken in the final stretch of the previous administration.","US President Donald Trump declared that all official documents signed by former President Joe Biden using an autopen were “null, void, and of no further force or effect” In a post on Truth Social, Trump said any such document - ranging from executive orders to pardons - would no longer be recognised by his administration.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125731347,imgsize-1080701,width-400,resizemode-4/joe-biden-left-donald-trump-ap.jpg"
"MAGA ally pushes to end dual citizenship, not realising Melania and Barron Trump would be caught in the crossfire",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maga-ally-pushes-to-end-dual-citizenship-not-realising-melania-and-barron-trump-would-be-caught-in-the-crossfire/articleshow/125727781.cms,"About Melania's citizenship

What is the Exclusive Citizenship Act of 2025?





A Republican senator tried to end dual citizenship, but somehow placed Melania Trump and her son Barron in the firing line.Both the first lady and the president’s youngest child got into a debate that was not meant to involve them.MAGA ally Bernie Moreno of Ohio is preparing to introduce legislation that would require all Americans to declare an exclusive allegiance to the United States.His proposal is called the Exclusive Citizenship Act of 2025. It aims to abolish dual nationality entirely.However, the senator did not realise that the change would affect Melania and Barron, who both hold Slovenian and American citizenship.Moreno was born in Colombia and has since renounced his Colombian nationality. He has framed the proposal as a matter of loyalty.Speaking to Fox News, he said becoming a citizen had been a defining moment in his life. “One of the greatest honours of my life was when I became an American citizen at 18, the first opportunity I could do so,” he said. “It was an honour to pledge an Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America and only to the United States of America. Being an American citizen is an honour and a privilege and if you want to be an American, it’s all or nothing.It’s time to end dual citizenship for good.”Melania was born in Slovenia and naturalised as a United States citizen in 2006. She remains the only first lady to have done so. In her 2024 book The Art of Her Deal, journalist Mary Jordan reported that both Melania and Barron have kept their Slovenian passports, reports the Daily Beast. Jordan explained that Melania had filed the necessary paperwork herself because Barron did not receive Slovenian citizenship automatically. “She did that to give her son options,” Jordan said. She added that a Slovenian passport made it easier for him to work, study and inherit property in Europe.Under Moreno’s plan, dual citizens would have one year to renounce any foreign nationality or lose their American citizenship. Enforcement would fall to the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which would monitor dual nationals using a new tracking system.Currently, Americans can hold more than one citizenship without being forced to choose. Moreno argues that this creates “conflicts of interest and divided loyalties.”","Bernie Moreno of Ohio is preparing to introduce legislation that would require all Americans to declare an exclusive allegiance to the United States.

'No 'American Dream' when H-1Bs can come': Ex-DOGE advisor hits back at Vivek Ramaswamy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-american-dream-when-h-1bs-can-come-ex-doge-advisor-hits-back-at-vivek-ramaswamy/articleshow/125724710.cms,"



A row erupted after former DOGE adviser and Florida gubernatorial candidate James Fishback hit back at Vivek Ramaswamy over his comments about the ""American Dream.""Ramaswamy is running for governor in Ohio and posted on X defending the uniqueness of American opportunity and dismissing the idea of other national ideals. “There’s no ‘Canadian Dream. ’ There’s no ‘British Dream.’ There’s no ‘Chinese Dream.’ It’s called the American Dream for a reason. It’s what makes American exceptionalism possible,” he said.Fishback is an outspoken critic of immigration programs and H1-B. He replied. “There’s no ‘American Dream’ when H-1Bs can come here and steal our jobs and dignity. I'm running for Florida Governor to end the H-1B scam so our workers can get great paying jobs again,” he said.Fishback has built his campaign around restricting immigration.The Florida candidate has repeatedly claimed that the H-1B programme blocks opportunities for US workers and unfairly benefits Indians. He has argued that even immigrants who later become citizens should not be part of the American Dream.The ex-DOGE advisor formally launched his campaign last week, telling CNN that Americans are being pushed out of entry-level jobs.“You have got recent college graduates in my home state of Florida who cannot get jobs. We are the hungriest, smartest, and most brilliant people on Earth. The idea of importing cheap labourers for entry level accounting or IT workers from India and China is preposterous,” he said.When challenged on why he is targeting Indians, who make up less than one per cent of Florida’s population, he replied: “I single out Indian Americans not because they are Indian Americans; I single them out because they receive about 77 per cent of all H-1B visas.

Trump ‘CORNERS’ Putin, Xi, Khamenei-friendly Maduro; Venezuela Loses 2 Allies Before US Strikes Hard

A ‘drug war’ that doesn’t add up





A military footprint not seen in years





At least 10 US naval vessels patrolled the Caribbean, including guided-missile destroyers and amphibious assault ships.

The USS Gerald R Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, has been dispatched to the region.

B-52s and B-1 bombers conducted flights near Venezuelan airspace.

F-35 stealth jets, Reaper drones, P-8 Poseidon spy planes, and special-forces MH-6M helicopters have been spotted in Puerto Rico and around the Lesser Antilles.

Strikes that sparked regional alarm





Who was on board

What drugs were seized

Whether the vessels were armed

The real game: Intimidation, pressure, regime cracks





Signalling, not invading





Why Trump, Why Now?





1. Migration Politics

2. Crime and the ‘Tren de Aragua’ factor

3. A new Monroe doctrine moment

4. Political messaging to the base

The Barrel behind the Barrel of the gun





The CIA factor: Covert operations on the table





Airstrips and ports linked to trafficking

Military officers allegedly involved in cocaine smuggling

Key figures in Maduro’s security apparatus

Or, in an extreme case, a “smash and grab” attempt to snatch Maduro or his associates

Inside Maduro’s circle and a $50 Million bounty





What if Maduro falls? A bigger mess awaits



Possibility 1: A military takeover

Possibility 2: Hardline Chavistas seize power

Possibility 3: Fragmentation and civil war

Can the opposition step in? Not without the US staying for years





Edmundo González, whom the US says won the 2024 election

María Corina Machado, now a Nobel laureate, operating underground in Venezuela

US security guarantees

Rebuilding of the army

Unfreezing of Venezuelan funds

Security sector reform

Protection from colectivos and criminal groups

Why allies are nervous: Russia, China, Cuba and a wider spiral





The risks Trump faces at home



His base opposes long overseas entanglements

Opposition leaders are fractured and unreliable

Any US-backed transition would require enormous long-term investment

A failed attempt could entrench Maduro further

If he escalates:

He risks alienating voters who backed him on promises to avoid foreign wars.

A drawn-out engagement with no clear endgame.

Could trigger a refugee surge from Venezuela.

Risks hitting Russian, Cuban or Chinese interests.

If he backs down:

He looks weak after mobilising an armada.

Maduro emerges stronger.

Regional rivals mock US impotence.

So why is Trump gunning for maduro?



Pressure Maduro into exile without invading.

A migration flow he can campaign against and a criminal network he can label a national-security threat.

A chance to reassert American dominance in the Western Hemisphere.

Use migration and crime as political fuel

Keep military options open without committing to war

A geopolitical arena where Russia, China, Iran and Cuba are already embedded.

Most importantly, a dictator whose removal would hand Trump a legacy-defining victory - if it works.





On most days, the Caribbean is a postcard - the blue of the water melting into the horizon, waves lapping lazily against fishing boats, the sky an unbroken canvas. But for the last two months, this tranquillity has been shattered by the steady drone of US warplanes, the silhouette of warships stalking the sea, and the uneasy whispers of fishermen who know that the wrong vessel, at the wrong time, can now end in an airstrike.Since early September, more than 83 people have died in 21 US strikes on what Washington calls Venezuelan “drug boats.” The US has offered no names, no evidence, no contraband details, and insists this is “a war on narco-terrorism.” Yet the scale of the deployment - the largest US military show of force in the Caribbean in decades - suggests something far bigger is unfolding.Why is the same Donald Trump, who blasted “forever wars” and questioned America’s military presence in Europe and Asia, now assembling an armada on Venezuela’s doorstep? Why has he authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in a country the US hasn’t invaded? Why are B-52 bombers performing “attack demonstrations” near Venezuelan shores?The short answer: the US wants Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro gone.The long answer is the story below.Behind the escalating confrontation sits a blunt political reality: Donald Trump now sees regime change in Caracas as both a strategic necessity and a political opportunity, even as he publicly denies pursuing it.When the Pentagon announced a strengthened anti-drug operation in the Caribbean, it cited threats from “narco-traffickers exploiting the Covid-era vulnerabilities.”But today, nearly five years later, the mission has morphed into something vastly more muscular.Washington maintains the operations are part of a counter-narcotics campaign. Trump has said that at least one vessel struck in October was “loaded up with mostly fentanyl.” But the numbers - and geography - don’t quite support that narrative.Fentanyl is overwhelmingly produced in Mexico, not South America. Venezuela is not a major cocaine producer either; the US DEA’s 2025 report attributes 84 per cent of cocaine seized in the US to Colombia, and does not list Venezuela as a significant source. Even the strike zones raise eyebrows: the early attacks came in the Caribbean, a comparatively minor trafficking corridor compared to Pacific routes.“It isn’t about drugs,” says Dr Christopher Sabatini, senior fellow at Chatham House, in comments to BBC. According to him, Trump has simply adopted the Venezuelan opposition’s description of Maduro’s government as a “criminal regime” to justify more aggressive action.The US Justice Department did accuse Maduro in 2020 of leading a “narco-terrorism organisation” - charges he denies. Known cases exist involving those close to him, such as the 2016 US conviction of two nephews of his wife for cocaine trafficking. But none of this fully explains the scale of the military build-up.Using satellite imagery, ship-tracking tools and open-source intelligence, BBC mapped out an American force that looks more like preparation for war than for drug interdiction. As of late October:Even former military analysts quoted by BBC admit: you don’t need an armada of this scale to catch drug boats.Since September, seven Venezuelan vessels have been destroyed by US firepower. Washington labels them “narco-boats,” yet hasn’t disclosed:Latin American governments - including Colombia - have criticised the US for “extrajudicial killings at sea.” Legal experts question whether America’s actions outside its waters meet international norms.But what troubles the region most is the unmistakable sense that something more than counternarcotics is underway.Experts largely agree on one assessment: the US escalation appears calculated to frighten Maduro’s inner circle, not trigger an outright invasion.“This is about regime change,” says Dr Sabatini. “They’re probably not going to invade - the hope is this is about signalling.”James B Story, former top US diplomat to Venezuela, told Politico Magazine that Washington now has “enough ‘exquisite assets’ on site that could overwhelm the air defenses of the country… potentially decapitate the government if that were a decision that he decided to take.”The strategy is, in essence, psychological warfare. The US hopes that generals and loyalists - many of whom face sanctions, indictments, or travel bans - will decide Maduro is no longer worth the risk.The timing is not accidental. Trump has consistently argued that Maduro’s “days are numbered,” and according to CNN, he has reviewed options for potential strikes inside Venezuela as part of “Operation Southern Spear,” which has deployed more than a dozen US warships.So why use the force now? There could be several motives convergence:Venezuela’s collapse has created one of the world’s largest refugee flows - nine million people. For Trump, migration is both a political rallying point and a justification for confronting the “root cause,” and as political ammunition.Trump routinely cites the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, calling it transnational. Washington alleges Maduro is tied to drug routes that channel Colombian cocaine through Venezuela into the Caribbean. While Venezuela isn’t a major producer, 5–15 per cent of Colombian cocaine moves through its territory, according to a former US diplomat under Trump’s first presidency. Though speaking to the Politico the experts caution, their interests only sometimes overlap.Some in Trump’s orbit openly frame Venezuela as a test of American supremacy in the hemisphere. In the US President's foreign policy universe, allowing a hostile authoritarian regime in the US backyard - one with ties to Russia, China, Cuba and Iran - is unacceptable. As former State Department official Elliott Abrams told CNN, if Trump backs down now, “there goes all the ‘new Monroe Doctrine’ talk.”Trump campaigned on ending “forever wars.” Now he faces the paradox of threatening a new one. That’s why the administration insists publicly that this is not about ousting Maduro - while simultaneously making moves that clearly suggest the opposite.Even analysts who support the mission concede that “intercepting narcotics at sea does not require a force as big as the current US one,” as cited by BBC.If the military buildup in the Caribbean has raised questions, Venezuela’s 303 billion barrels of proven oil reserves - the largest in the world - have supplied an answer many in Caracas believe is obvious. Both foreign minister Yván Gil Pinto at the UN and President Nicolás Maduro in his letter to OPEC, earlier in the year have repeated the same thing: Washington’s pressure campaign is not about drugs, but about oil.Speaking at the UNGA, Pinto accused the US of unleashing “an illegal and completely immoral military threat” to pave the way for “external powers to rob Venezuela’s immeasurable oil and gas wealth.” He warned that the escalating strikes were designed to soften the country for foreign control of its resources.Maduro in his letter wrote to OPEC and OPEC+ nations that he was facing “growing and illegal threats” from Donald Trump, whom he accused of trying to “seize” Venezuela’s reserves. He asked fellow oil producers for support to “stop this aggression,” insisting that it endangered “the balance of the international energy market.”Caracas described Trump’s rhetoric about closing Venezuelan airspace, as further evidence of what Maduro’s government calls a “colonialist threat.” They also argue that Trump’s revived “drill, baby drill” agenda, along with new US plans to expand offshore drilling in California and Florida, show that Washington is positioning itself for a global energy push - and that Venezuela, despite sanctions that have throttled its own exports to just $4.05 billion in 2023, remains the biggest prize in the hemisphere.For Maduro, every US destroyer in the Caribbean and every warplane over its waters is not a counternarcotics tool - it is a reminder of a resource bounty that he believes others are prepared to fight for.Trump has publicly said he authorised the CIA to carry out covert action in Venezuela, though when asked if the agency had been instructed to “take out Maduro,” he replied that answering would be “ridiculous.”Ned Price, former CIA senior analyst, told BBC that covert action can include “information operations… sabotage… funding opposition parties… [or] the overthrow of a regime.”Analysts believe CIA operations could target:Dr Sabatini warns there are no major narcotics labs to “take out” inside Venezuela - so any strikes would hit military or government sites, escalating tensions dramatically.If US strategy depends on Maduro’s insiders flipping, why hasn’t anyone taken the bait? Because Venezuelan elites have much more to lose than to gain.The US has raised the bounty on Maduro to $50 million, and even that hasn’t moved insiders. “It’s nothing for Venezuela’s elites,” says Venezuelan law professor Jose Ignacio Hernández.Venezuela’s corruption networks are vast and lucrative. Former treasury chief Alejandro Andrade walked away with $1 billion in bribes before his arrest. For such elites, a $50 million reward for Maduro’s capture, barely moves the needle.Many generals and ministers fear that removing Maduro would expose their own criminal records. As Hernández puts it: “They will think, in some way or another, I am involved in criminal activities too.”Political scientist Michael Albertus of the University of Chicago notes that dictatorships maintain loyalty through paranoia: “Authoritarian leaders… create mechanisms for monitoring their inner circle.” Defection is not just betrayal - it is suicide.He told the BBC that even $500 million might not persuade Maduro’s top brass because authoritarian leaders “create mechanisms for monitoring them and ensuring loyalty.”Should Maduro die, flee, or be captured, experts warn Venezuela could slip into total chaos. There could be three scenarios:John Bolton told CNN that if Maduro were ousted, Venezuela’s cohesive military would likely “follow their discipline, assert military control, and suppress anyone who goes into the streets.”Juan González told CNN: “Maduro is a moderate inside the Chavismo… someone else could usurp power.” This is the scenario that most worries foreign diplomats.A Western diplomat based in Venezuela told CNN: “Whether you like it or not, Maduro is the guarantor of the equilibrium.” Remove him, and “there’s nobody who can maintain the status quo.” Without him, rival factions - military, colectivos, criminal syndicates, Colombian insurgents - could carve up the country like a mineral-rich pie.Two main opposition figures stand in the wings:González, claims to have a “100-hour plan” to transition power. But experts say this is wishful at best. “The idea that a member of the opposition would be able to rule almost immediately is impossible,” warns Juan González. They would need:All of this implies 5-10 years of US commitment - politically toxic for Trump’s “no more wars” coalition.If US strikes were to hit assets connected to Russia, China, or Cuba, the conflict could widen quickly - even if none of these states would send troops. All three have deep investments, intelligence networks and advisers inside Venezuela.Meanwhile, Colombia - America’s closest regional ally - Its President Gustavo Petro has already accused the US of killing a Colombian citizen during one of the boat strikes. The diplomatic spat threatens intelligence sharing from Colombia - crucial for drug interdiction. This is significant because historically, Colombia has provided more actionable intel to the US than vice versa.Trump has hinted at the possibility of war with Venezuela, saying only: “I doubt it. I don’t think so.” But if he does escalate, the blowback could be severe:Yet Trump also faces a credibility dilemma. As Elliott Abrams warns: if he pulls back now, after building an “armada,” his tough-on-hemisphere rhetoric could ring hollow.Everything points to a multi-layered calculus. Because Venezuela sits at the intersection of every political, strategic and ideological battle that Trump wants to fight in his second term.Trump’s strategy is to create so much pressure - military, political, psychological - that someone within Chavismo concludes Maduro is too costly to keep.But whether this mix of deterrence and brinkmanship succeeds - or ends up dragging the US into an unwanted conflict - remains the defining question.","At least 10 US naval vessels patrolled the Caribbean, including guided-missile destroyers and amphibious assault ships.

HIRE Act explained: Indian-origin lawmaker proposes doubling H-1B visas — is it possible?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hire-act-explained-indian-origin-lawmaker-proposes-doubling-h-1b-visas-is-it-possible/articleshow/125720990.cms,"H-1B Controversy Erupts After US Economist Alleges Industrial-Scale Fraud Targeting Indian Visas

Could this bill pass — and is it plausible?

Political resistance: The H‑1B programme has been under heavy scrutiny recently. 'America First' citizens claim it is vulnerable to fraud, abuse, or that it unfairly competes with domestic workers and steals their jobs. The reintroduction of the HIRE Act comes even as there are fresh allegations of large‑scale fraud, especially in visa applications processed at Indian consulates. Legislative hurdles: Any change in immigration quota requires support from both houses of the US Congress, and agreement on immigration or labor reforms. Both party lines have deeply split opinions on immigration and it’s uncertain whether the amendment will even gather enough votes. Economic, labour‑market concerns: MAGA critics argue boosting the number of visas may suppress wages, hurt job opportunities for US‑born workers, and deepen dependence on foreign labour.

What it could mean for Indian applicants

The H1-B row





The HIRE Act seeks to raise the annual cap on H‑1B visas from the current 65,000 (plus 20,000 for advanced‑degree holders) to 130,000.The bill was reintroduced last month by Indian-origin Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi in response to growing demand for skilled workers in technology, research and other sectors.According to the proposal, the expansion would help American employers to fill talent gaps in crucial sectors like tech and defence. The bill also aims to invest in STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) education in US schools and increase the number of H-1B visas available each year.Support for the HIRE Act comes from major industry bodies such as the ITServe Alliance — the largest association of IT‑services firms. They say that the current H1-B cap is outdated and insufficient to meet demand from fast‑growing sectors like AI, cloud computing and advanced engineering.At face value, the HIRE Act offers a straightforward, numerical increase: double the cap. That simplicity works in its favour. But passing it into law isn’t guaranteed for several reasons:India has traditionally supplied a large share of H‑1B visa holders. Under the proposed 130,000‑visa cap, demand from Indian professionals could find more favourable headroom.The bill could reportedly open 45,000–50,000 additional visas each year. This will significantly increases the probability of selection under the H‑1B lottery or reduce dependence on the lottery altogether.For Indian students currently on F‑1 visas, or recent graduates seeking H‑1B status, the increased quota could ease competition. For IT professionals and engineers hoping to migrate to the US, the proposal might offer greater clarity and opportunity compared with the existing tight cap and lengthy backlogs.However, nothing guarantees that approved extra slots would go only to Indian applicants. Employers in many countries may compete for those visas.Last month Donald Trump stirred a row by saying that the United States lacks enough domestic talent and will need skilled workers from abroad to fill roles in its leading universities and industries. This was seen as a betrayal to the 'America First' agenda by the MAGA base.The fallout was swift. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene resigned from Congress, Nikki Haley’s son emerged as one of the leading voices of the America First stance","The HIRE Act seeks to raise the annual cap on H‑1B visas from the current 65,000 (plus 20,000 for advanced‑degree holders) to 130,000.

The Great Reset and why her comments are stirring debate





Nicole Shanahan, the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin and a major philanthropist who once wrote nine-figure checks, has accused Silicon Valley’s elite donor circles of unknowingly supporting what she describes as hidden agendas pushed by global networks of NGOs, Hollywood figures and Davos-linked institutions like the World Economic Forum . In a recently shared conversation, Shanahan said many wealthy tech wives, including herself, believed they were funding social good but were instead being steered toward broader ideological projects.Shanahan, who briefly served as RFK Jr.’s running mate in 2024, said these women were used to set the groundwork for what she associates with Klaus Schwab’s Great Reset, a post-pandemic economic and social vision promoted by the World Economic Forum. Klaus Schwab, the economist who founded the WEF in 1971, has long advocated for stronger public and private cooperation to reshape global systems. She claims the women’s philanthropic dollars and social influence were directed through advisory networks without them realising how their contributions were being utilised.According to Shanahan, tech-world philanthropists were plugged into a system of NGO advisors, Hollywood connections and Davos culture that guided donor decisions. She described Silicon Valley’s wealth ecosystem as a very small group of people who socialise together, serve on the same boards and make decisions that have outsized influence.Shanahan argues that these donors were not fully aware of how their philanthropic movements were being leveraged.She claims the women were used to fund groundwork that supported global policy frameworks rather than grassroots needs.Shanahan paints a picture of Silicon Valley spouses overwhelmed by the demands of extreme wealth. Many manage multiple homes, large staffs, strained relationships and high levels of stress. She says some are medicated for anxiety or depression and are too busy to question how their philanthropic guidance is shaped.She believes this emotional and logistical overload made these women more susceptible to being steered. As she describes it, they find meaning through philanthropic work. That was her identity as well, and she says she truly believed she was helping.Reflecting on her own giving, Shanahan says she once believed her donations were uplifting Black and Indigenous communities. But she now claims the opposite happened and argues that conditions deteriorated instead of improving.According to her:Her argument is that the philanthropic model itself is flawed because the structure reinforces problems instead of solving them.One of her strongest assertions is that two themes were repeatedly used to persuade Silicon Valley women to fund certain projects:Shanahan says these issues were emotionally compelling and therefore effective at steering donors toward programs that aligned with the interests of advisers and global institutions.She claims that any pushback was quickly dismissed with climate-related justifications, saying that whenever questioned, the answer was always some version of ""but climate change.""The Great Reset is a real initiative promoted by the World Economic Forum in 2020 as a framework for rethinking global systems after the pandemic. Supporters see it as a roadmap toward sustainability and economic reform. Critics argue that it centralises too much influence in the hands of global institutions.Shanahan positions Silicon Valley philanthropy as unintentionally feeding into this agenda, not through conspiracy but through unexamined donor pipelines and emotional messaging.Her comments are circulating widely because they come from someone who belonged to Silicon Valley’s highest social and financial circles, personally managed massive philanthropic budgets and now argues that the system is broken and has harmed the communities it claimed to help.","Nicole Shanahan, the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, has accused Silicon Valley’s elite donor circles of unknowingly supporting hidden agendas.

to Dawn,





NEW DELHI: Imran Khan’s sister on Tuesday said the former Pakistan prime minister is “completely fine” and in good health, after she was finally allowed to meet him inside Adiala Jail following weeks of restricted access that had fuelled protests and rumours about his condition.Authorities at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail permitted Imran’s sister Uzma Khanum to meet him on Tuesday, breaking a prolonged period during which family members and PTI leaders were repeatedly denied access. According to Pakistan news outlet Dawn, Uzma entered the prison as several PTI supporters gathered outside demanding transparency on Imran’s health.Following the meeting, PTI USA shared her remarks, quoting her as saying, “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he said that they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this.”AccordingUzma said that Imran Khan was kept in his room throughout the day, allowed only limited time outside, and had no communication with anyone. The meeting lasted around 30 minutes, she told the publication.Read more: Can Imran Khan meet visitors in jail? What rules say on 'political prisoner' access The meeting took place on a day when PTI had already planned demonstrations outside the Islamabad high court and Adiala Jail to protest what it called unjustified restrictions on Imran Khan’s visitation rights.Despite an Islamabad high court order allowing twice-weekly meetings, the family had not been granted access for several weeks.Earlier, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan had filed a contempt petition against the Adiala Jail superintendent and other senior officials, alleging repeated defiance of the court’s directions. The petition said jail authorities had blocked visits by family, lawyers and PTI leaders since March.

NEW DELHI: Authorities at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Tuesday allowed former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan’s sister, Uzma Khanum, to meet him, breaking weeks of restricted access that had prompted protests by PTI supporters and family members.According to Pakistan news website Dawn, Uzma entered the prison in the afternoon as several PTI workers gathered outside the jail premises demanding transparency about Imran’s condition.The meeting came on a day when PTI had already planned demonstrations outside the Islamabad High Court and Adiala Jail to protest what it called unjustified curbs on Imran Khan’s visitation rights. The family and party members had been denied meetings for several weeks despite an earlier Islamabad High Court order permitting twice-weekly visits.Earlier, Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan had filed a contempt petition against the Adiala Jail superintendent and senior officials for allegedly defying the court’s directions.

In a first, the Baloch Liberation Front (BLF) used a woman fidayeen operative to storm a heavily-guarded complex belonging to the Frontier Corps and housing a Chinese copper and gold mining project center located in Chagai, Balochistan. Six Pak personnel were reportedly killed in Sunday evening’s attack but there was no official word from the Pak authorities.The BLF also released the photo of the bomber, Zareena Rafiq aka Trang Mahoo, who detonated herself at the barrier to allow the rebel fighters to breach the main compound. The attack is significant because it is the first time the BLF has used a suicide bomber, a tactic exclusive to Majeed Brigade of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) which has carried out a series of attacks including the Jaffar Express hijack in the region.The fact that the complex was linked to the Saindak and Reko Diq projects, managed by Chinese companies and a Canadian firm, indicates the change in rebels’ strategy to strike high-value assets with geopolitical significance, sources said. In a statement released on Telegram, the BLF spokesperson Gwahram Baloch said that the Fidayeen operation was carried out by its ‘selfsacrifice’ unit, Saddo Operational Battalion (SOB), named after Martyred Commander Waja Sado aka Sadath Marri.Meanwhile the BLA released a statement on the wave of coordinated attacks carried out at multiple locations between Nov 28-29, claiming 27 Pak army personnel were killed in 29 attacks. The BLA also said it had taken control of motorways and seized weapons.BLA fighters struck the Pakistani army’s Coast Guard camp in the Pasni area of Gwadar with multiple grenade launchers. They targeted military intelligence personnel in the Jiwani area of Gwadar with a remote-controlled IED attack while they were returning after extorting money from vehicles, the BLA said. Another attack was on the residence of a Pakistani army major in Mastung city.Six blasts were reported at defence installations in Quetta as well.

Pakistan Rages At UN After Criticism Of Munir’s Immunity Amendment Amid Fears Of Deeper Militarism

Also Read |





Author and National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) member Tilak Devasher claimed that Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is “intentionally” staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).Created through the 27th amendment to Pakistan’s constitution, the post is set to be assumed by Field Marshal Asim Munir, potentially making him the most powerful army chief in the country’s history.Speaking to ANI, Devasher highlighted that Sharif left for Bahrain and then London, leading to speculation that he's ""deliberately"" staying away to avoid issuing the notification.“Very smartly, the Pakistan PM went to Bahrain and then to London. He clearly does not want to issue the notification giving Asim Munir five years as army chief and as Chief of Defence Forces. He seems to believe that by staying away and avoiding signing the notification, he can escape the consequences,” said Devasher, author of four books on Pakistan.The comment comes after Sharif’s government failed to issue the required notification appointing Munir as the first-ever CDF by the November 29 deadline—the day his original three-year term as army chief ended.With the creation of the CDF post, the office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee has formally been abolished.Devasher added that Pakistan is currently navigating a “very messy” situation.“If it turns out that he (Asim Munir) is no longer the army chief, then Pakistan finds itself without an army chief, and even the nuclear command authority—meant to fall under the new Strategic Forces Command—is effectively leaderless. It’s an extremely strange situation,” he remarked.Legal experts remain divided over whether the notification is necessary. Under the amended Constitution, the Chief of Army Staff’s term is meant to run concurrently with the CDF, lasting five years.Some analysts, however, argue that the issue may already be addressed by the Pakistan Army Act’s 2024 amendment, which extended the tenure of service chiefs to five years, according to Dawn. The amendment includes a “deeming” clause stating it “shall always be deemed to have been part of the Pakistan Army Act,” implying that Munir’s current term could automatically extend from three to five years without any additional notification.Devasher, however, called this interpretation “controversial,” questioning the view that a notification may not be required.“Some people argue that the Army Act was amended in 2004, setting the army chief’s tenure at five years. Since he has already served three, he supposedly has another two years remaining. From this perspective, no new notification would be required. This is controversial, and it’s unclear how the judiciary or the government will view it. But the fact remains that it makes his position very tenuous,” Devasher said.He also pointed to what he described as political manoeuvring within the military. “There are reports that other generals are now jostling for the position of army chief or for the two newly created four-star posts,” he stated.Devasher added that Prime Minister Sharif’s absence is only deepening the uncertainty. “But this situation cannot continue,” he warned. “A nuclear-armed country cannot function without a Chief of the Army Staff or someone in charge of the nuclear command authority.”","Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is ""intentionally"" staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces.

Fresh violence broke out in Pakistan after a suicide bomber detonated himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan, sparking an intense exchange of fire and a major security response, Dawn reported.The attack, claimed to be the work of militants described by officials as Fitna-al-Khawarij — the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — triggered a swift retaliatory operation in which three attackers were killed.According to FC Balochistan South, the assault began when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance, allowing several armed militants to force their way into the compound. Security personnel from the quick response force immediately engaged the attackers, with heavy gunfire reported from the area. Officials said at least six gunmen were believed to have entered the headquarters, prompting a full-scale clearance operation that continued through the day.In a statement, the FC spokesperson said troops were determined to neutralise the remaining threat, adding that the “last of the terrorists will also be” dealt with.Local reports described sustained firing inside the headquarters as forces worked room-to-room to secure the facility.The incident comes just days after a similar assault on an FC compound in the northwestern city of Peshawar, where gunmen and two suicide bombers stormed a paramilitary headquarters, killing three people. Police had said the first bomber detonated at the main entrance while the second entered the compound, forcing law enforcement to cordon off the busy FC Chowk area amid multiple explosions.These attacks form part of a broader escalation in militant violence this year. Earlier attacks in Quetta — including a deadly car bomb outside a paramilitary base and a suicide blast at a political rally — have added to growing instability in Balochistan. The province has endured a long-running insurgency, with hundreds of security personnel killed in 2024 alone, alongside attacks claimed by separatist groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army.","Suicide bomber detonates himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan.

Pakistan Army General Warns Of Hybrid-To-Full War As Pakistan Reshapes Military Power Under Munir





At least seven explosions were reported in Pakistan’s Balochistan province over the past 24 hours, with suspected insurgents targeting sites in Quetta and Dera Murad Jamali. No casualties were reported, although two security guards with a construction company were injured in the attacks.The incidents triggered fear and panic in the provincial capital.On Saturday, insurgents hurled hand grenades at a police checkpoint in Quetta, followed by the detonation of an IED near an Anti-Terrorism Department vehicle. Three additional explosions took place later in the evening, as cited by PTI.Senior Superintendent of Police Asif Khan said the blast near Lohr Karez, on the outskirts of Quetta, damaged the main line connecting the city with other parts of the country.SSP Khan said the attackers had planted IEDs on a railway track and detonated them as a train was scheduled to arrive at Quetta station. The blast damaged the track and forced the suspension of rail services.Khan added that armed men also attacked a construction company site on Quetta’s Sariab Road with hand grenades, damaging machinery and injuring two security guards. In another incident, motorcycle-borne insurgents hurled two hand grenades at the Manzoor Shaheed police station, one of which exploded while the other was defused by a bomb disposal squad.In Dera Murad Jamali, a patrolling police vehicle was targeted with hand grenades.Attackers also threw hand grenades in the Kech Beg area near a police patrol post in Quetta.No group immediately claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attacks, but insurgent activity resumed on Sunday morning.Earlier this year, at least ten people were killed and several others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside the paramilitary headquarters in Quetta.On September 3, a suicide bombing at a political rally in the city killed 11 people and wounded more than 40, targeting a stadium parking area where hundreds of Balochistan National Party supporters had gathered.Pakistani forces continue to battle a longstanding insurgency in Balochistan, which has claimed 782 lives in 2024. In March, the Baloch Liberation Army hijacked a train and killed off-duty troops. Since January, more than 430 people, most of them security personnel, have been killed in various attacks, including six soldiers in Bannu.","At least seven explosions reported in Pakistan's Balochistan province over the past 24 hours.

Brazening it out, Pakistan on Sunday dismissed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk’s concerns over the country’s recent 27th constitutional amendment, urging him to avoid remarks that reflect “political bias and misinformation. ”“Like all parliamentary democracies, all legislation as well as any amendment to the constitution remain the exclusive domain of the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan. While Pakistan gives due importance to the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the statement issued,” the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement.The FO added that Pakistan remains “fully committed to protecting, promoting and upholding human rights, human dignity, basic freedoms and the rule of law as enshrined in the constitution”.“It is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the remarks. We urge the High Commissioner to respect the sovereign decisions of Pakistan's parliament and avoid commentary that reflects political bias and misinformation,"" it stated.In a statement on Friday, Türk criticised Islamabad for adopting the amendment without “broad consultation” with legal experts and civil society, warning that the “hastily adopted” changes could undermine judicial independence and raise questions about military accountability.The 27th amendment has stirred intense political debate within the neighbouring nation. On November 12, a joint parliamentary committee of the Senate and National Assembly approved the bill , prompting the opposition to warn that the government was sounding “the death knell for the Supreme Court”.The amendment alters Article 243 by abolishing the post of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and replacing it with a new Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). It also proposes establishing a Federal Constitutional Court and reducing certain powers of the Supreme Court.The first CDF will be Asim Munir, the Pakistan Army chief who was “promoted” to the five-star Field Marshal rank following the conflict with India in May.According to Dawn, the Pakistan government is yet to notify the appointment of the CDF, even as the office of the CJCSC formally ended on Thursday.",Pakistan dismisses UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk's concerns over the country’s recent 27th constitutional amendment.

Imran Khan Isolation Sparks Fury As PTI Claims His Photo Could Transform Pak’s Political Reality

What the rules say about ‘political prisoner’ access





This raises a critical question: what does the jail manual actually say?

Meetings with five people per week, including lawyers and relatives

30 minutes of phone time weekly

Rules that are ‘subjective’





Family’s repeated requests denied









Former Pakistan prime minister and World Cup–winning captain Imran Khan has been in jail for over two years. In recent days, rumours about his health, and even claims that he may have died, have spread widely on social media. His family says they are worried because they have not been allowed to meet him for weeks.The anxiety deepened on Friday when Imran Khan’s son Kasim Khan publicly demanded that the government prove the 73-year-old PTI founder is alive.""We demand proof of Imran Khan's life,"" Kasim said in a social media post.For nearly a month, no family member, lawyer or party aide has been allowed to see the former cricketer-turned-politician, fuelling speculation that he may have been harmed inside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where he has been incarcerated for over two years.According to Dawn, while the government maintains that Imran Khan is being given all ""possible facilities"", a senior cabinet member on Friday claimed that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi was trying to meet Khan in violation of the jail manual.Information minister Atta Tarar’s remarks triggered a sharp response from the PTI, which insists its court-approved visiting schedule — Tuesdays and Thursdays — is not being honoured.Dawn reports that visitation and phone calls are tied to a prisoner’s ""good behaviour"", giving the jail superintendent wide discretion.As the newspaper notes: ""Visitation, phone calls allowed to prisoners are linked to their ‘good behaviour’, meaning the jail superintendent has the discretion to allow or disallow meetings.""Current and former prison officials told Dawn that prisoners in Punjab, including political detainees, are allowed:Even condemned prisoners can meet family and lawyers once a week and get the same phone allowance via public call offices inside Adiala Jail.Political prisoners, Dawn adds, are placed in special cells under strict security, with daily medical check-ups mandated to ensure they are healthy.But these rules are not absolute. Their implementation depends heavily on the inmate’s behaviour, making the process ""necessarily subjective"", according to Dawn.Serious charges -- including terrorism or anti-state activities -- can also restrict access.A retired senior prison department officer told Dawn that access to lawyers or relatives ultimately rests with the jail superintendent, who can block meetings or calls if an inmate’s behaviour is deemed ""not good"".Despite court orders and repeated attempts, Imran Khan’s three sisters, PTI members and CM Sohail Afridi have been camping outside Adiala Jail for days, demanding a meeting with him.Kasim Khan said the family has been kept completely in the dark: ""My father has been under arrest for 845 days. For the past six weeks, he has been kept in solitary confinement in a death cell with zero transparency. His sisters have been denied every visit, even with clear court orders allowing access. There have been no phone calls, no meetings and no proof of life. Me and my brother have had no contact with our father.""Calling the situation ""deliberate"", he added: ""This absolute blackout is not a security protocol. Rather it is a deliberate attempt to hide my father's condition and prevent our family from knowing whether he is safe… the Pakistani government and its handlers will be held fully accountable legally, morally and internationally for my father’s safety.""He also appealed to international organisations and human rights groups to intervene urgently.""We demand proof of his life, enforce court ordered access, end this inhumane isolation and call for the release of Pakistan’s most popular political leader who is being held solely for political reasons,"" Kasim said.","Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan has been in jail for over two years.

Former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan 's son Kasim Khan on Thursday claimed his father has been kept in a ""death cell with zero transparency"", despite Islamabad refuting rumours that the cricketer-turned-politician was “brutally” assaulted by police for seeking a meeting with their brother last week.Kasim Khan said there have been ""no phone calls, no meetings and no proof of life. Me and my brother have had no contact with our father.""He alleged that the former prime minister, who has been under arrest for 845 days, has been kept in solitary confinement for the past six weeks. He also said that Khan’s sisters have been denied permission to visit him despite court orders allowing access.Kasim further alleged that the Shehbaz Sharif-led government and “its handlers” will be held accountable “legally, morally and internationally”.He also urged the international community to “intervene urgently” and demand proof of life.Earlier, Imran Khan’s sister, Noreen Niazi, accused Pakistani authorities of keeping the former prime minister in harsh prison conditions and cutting off all family contact, claiming that “no one knows what’s happening inside the jail.”Speaking to ANI about her last meeting with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, she said, “...Heis going through a tough time alone. He is in isolation... As per the jail manual, one can't be placed in isolation for more than 4 days. But he was put in isolation for three weeks last year as well, during which electricity was switched off, and he wasn't even allowed to read books. The same has been done now.”Her allegations come against the backdrop of growing speculation about Khan’s health and the month-long blackout on family and legal visits. “We don't know anything. They are not telling us anything, nor are they letting anybody meet him,” she said, adding that even PTI members with approved meetings were prevented from entering.“We have not been allowed to meet him for the last four weeks... The Police have been ordered to stop us and, I believe, also given permission to do to us whatever they want. This has never happened in Pakistan before,” she said.Niazi described the treatment of supporters and family members outside Adiala Jail as unprecedented. “No one has ever disrespected women like this, nor has anyone been oppressed this way. This is the first time in Pakistan that these people have been allowed to beat up people like there won't be any consequences, without considering if it's a child, an elderly person, or a woman in front of them. The world is aware of what's happening in Pakistan. ”She called the current situation Pakistan’s “darkest period”, comparing it to “Hitler-era-like repression”, and alleged that people are being “killed, beaten, and jailed without accountability”. She argued that the continued ban on meeting Khan was intentional. “We have been going there for the last four weeks, and they are not letting us meet him. This is why such rumours are spreading.”Warning of growing frustration, she said public anger is nearing a tipping point. “I believe there will be a spark among people soon, and then they will see the level to which the people go... The oppression is too much.”Expressing no expectations from the global community, she said: ""... We have such support from outside that Trump called our dictator Asim Munir a very good friend of his... Shehbaz Sharif had lost his seat. Asim Munir helped him win, so he is the bigger force... Dictators have come before. Their fates were not good either.

Imran has been in prison since August 2023, serving a 14-year sentence in a corruption case.His family members and party activists have been staging protests outside Adiala Jail in recent days, demanding he be allowed visitors. A PTI delegation once again attempted to meet him on Thursday, but authorities refused permission.The UN's deputy spokesperson reaffirmed that the world body has urged Pakistani authorities to ensure the human rights and due-process rights of Imran Khan are respected.This follows his arrest and ongoing legal proceedings -- the UN has emphasized that in such politically sensitive cases, fair treatment under law and procedural fairness are essential.In a response to ANI, United Nations deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said, ""We have called for his human rights and due process rights to be respected.""","Kasim Khan claims his father has been kept in a 'death cell with zero transparency' Islamabad refutes rumours that the cricketer-turned-politician was 'brutally' assaulted by police for seeking a meeting with their brother.

‘Hitler-era repression’: Imran Khan’s sister slams jail treatment; family barred from meetings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/hitler-era-repression-imran-khans-sister-slams-jail-treatment-family-barred-from-meetings/articleshow/125623777.cms,"'Darkest Times': Imran Khan's Sister Calls Out Pakistan Govt, Compares Asim Munir To Adolf Hitler





Imran Khan’s sister, Noreen Niazi, has criticized Pakistani authorities over the treatment of the former prime minister in prison, warning that his family has been kept completely in the dark and that “no one knows what’s happening inside the jail. ”Speaking to ANI about her last meeting with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, she said, “...He is going through a tough time alone. He is in isolation... As per the jail manual, one can't be placed in isolation for more than 4 days. But he was put in isolation for three weeks last year as well, during which electricity was switched off, and he wasn't even allowed to read books. The same has been done now.”Her remarks come amid a surge of rumours about Khan’s health, fuelled by the month-long blackout on family and legal meetings. “We don't know anything. They are not telling us anything, nor are they letting anybody meet him,” she said, adding that even party members with a scheduled meeting had been blocked from entering.“We have not been allowed to meet him for the last four weeks... The Police have been ordered to stop us and, I believe, also given permission to do to us whatever they want. This has never happened in Pakistan before.”Niazi described the treatment of supporters and family members outside Adiala Jail as unprecedented.“No one has ever disrespected women like this, nor has anyone been oppressed this way. This is the first time in Pakistan that these people have been allowed to beat up people like there won't be any consequences, without considering if it's a child, an elderly person, or a woman in front of them. The world is aware of what's happening in Pakistan. ”She said Pakistan had entered its “darkest period”, comparing the situation to “Hitler-era-like repression”. According to her, people are being “killed, beaten, and jailed without accountability”. The continued ban on meetings, she argues, is deliberate. “We have been going there for the last four weeks, and they are not letting us meet him. This is why such rumours are spreading.”Public anger, she warned, is reaching a breaking point. “I believe there will be a spark among people soon, and then they will see the level to which the people go... The oppression is too much.”Her comments come as PTI leaders, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, continue to be denied access to Khan, who has been held since August 2023. While Adiala Jail officials insist he is in “completely good health”, the lack of transparency has only intensified demands for a clear and verifiable update on his condition.","Noreen Niazi says family has been kept in the dark about Imran Khan's condition.

As Pakistan Halts Afghan Transit, Kabul Boosts India Partnership And Fast-Tracks The Chabahar Route





The UAE has stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals and only narrowly held back from imposing a complete ban on the Pakistani passport, a senior Pakistani interior ministry official told a parliamentary panel on Thursday.Pakistan’s additional interior secretary Salman Chaudhry informed the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights that both the UAE and Saudi Arabia had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport,” as reported by Dawn.“If a ban is imposed, getting it removed would be difficult,” Chaudhry said.Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, who chairs the Senate human rights committee, confirmed the interior ministry official’s account in comments to the paper.She said the travel restrictions stemmed from concerns about individuals visiting the UAE and “getting involved in criminal activities”.According to her, the committee was informed that the UAE had largely stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals, and that only a limited number had been granted recently, and “after much difficulty”.A Pakistani blue passport is an official travel document reserved for government officials and other eligible personnel, distinguishing it from the standard green passport issued to ordinary citizens.Meanwhile, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Salem M Salem Al Bawab Al Zaabi briefed Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Thursday about “major UAE visa facilitation reforms for Pakistanis,” according to a statement from the minister’s office.The statement added that nearly 500 visas were being processed daily at the newly launched UAE Visa Centre in Pakistan, outlining the reforms highlighted by the envoy.Pakistan and the UAE maintain longstanding diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The Gulf nation is among Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the region and a key source of remittances, supported by a sizeable Pakistani workforce residing there.However, Pakistani nationals experienced a surge in visa rejections in early July, prompting interior minister Mohsin Naqvi to take up the matter with his UAE counterpart.","The UAE has stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals, a senior Pakistani interior ministry official told a parliamentary panel on Thursday.

IMF Applauds India’s Growth And Reforms, Bails Pakistan Again Out From Economic Burden

(With ANI inputs)





State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor Jameel Ahmad has warned that the country’s existing economic growth model “can no longer sustain” its population of 250 million (25 crore).“Our business cycles are shortening and as such, our current growth model simply cannot sustain a country of over 250 million people,” he remarked at the Pakistan Business Council’s Dialogue on the Economy on Wednesday, according to The Express Tribune.Ahmad, who has led the SBP since August 2022, noted that Pakistan’s growth trajectory had been “steadily weakening for decades” — slipping from an average of 3.9 per cent over the past 30 years, to 3.5 per cent in the last two decades, and further down to 3.4 per cent over the past five years.He added that Pakistan had been caught in a “prolonged phase of stabilisation,” during which, he said, citizens and businesses were burdened by steep taxes, high energy costs and unchecked government spending. He urged policymakers and private-sector leaders to move away from short-term fixes and adopt a long-term outlook.Calling the moment an “inflection point,” Ahmad pushed for a shift towards inclusive, sustainable growth, advocating structural reforms and urging businesses to expand their competitiveness by integrating into global value chains, modernising production, and avoiding “shortcuts” for quick profits.Ahmad also highlighted that Pakistan’s external debt nearly doubled from $55 billion to $100 billion between 2015 and 2022 without a corresponding rise in reserves. Since 2022, however, public external debt has remained broadly unchanged while SBP’s reserves have climbed from $2.9 billion to $14.5 billion, aided by $8.4 billion in market purchases during the last fiscal year.His remarks came a day after Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal blamed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Pakistan’s highest unemployment rate in 21 years. Unemployment has risen to 7.1 per cent, while the World Bank estimates 44.7 per cent of Pakistanis now live below the poverty line.","State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor Jameel Ahmad has warned that the country’s existing economic growth model “can no longer sustain” its population of 250 million (25 crore) “Our business cycles are shortening and as such, our current growth model simply cannot sustain a country of over 250 million people,” he remarked at the Pakistan Business Council's Dialogue on the Economy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125617122,imgsize-60374,width-400,resizemode-4/pakistan39s-current-growth-model-cannot-sustain-250-million-population-says-state-bank-governor.jpg"

A young Pakistani woman, missing for 17 years, has been reunited with her family with the help of facial recognition technology and AI.Kiran, now 27, went missing in 2008 when she stepped out to buy ice cream in her Islamabad neighbourhood and forgot her home address. “I was lost and crying. A kind woman took me to the Edhi Centre in Islamabad as I couldn’t remember anything,” she said, news agency PTI reported.A few days later, Bilquis Edhi, wife of the late Abdul Sattar Edhi, founder of the Edhi Foundation, brought Kiran to the Karachi shelter home, where she grew up under Bilquis’ care. Sabah Faisal Edhi, wife of the current chairperson Faisal Edhi, said repeated attempts to trace Kiran’s parents through visits to Islamabad had failed.Earlier this year, the foundation contacted Nabeel Ahmed, a cybersecurity specialist with the Punjab Safe City Project. Using Kiran’s recent photos and limited childhood details, Nabeel accessed a missing-person police report from 2008 and, with facial recognition and tracking software, successfully located her family.Kiran’s father, Abdul Majeed, a tailor, travelled to Karachi to bring her home. “We searched for years, even published her photo in newspapers, but never found her.We had lost hope,” he said.Kiran expressed mixed emotions on returning home. “I am sad to leave my family members here. I will always be grateful to Bilquis apa and everyone at the shelter for taking such good care of me,” she said.She is the fifth girl from the Edhi shelter whose family has been traced with the foundation now working closely with police and Safe City Projects across Pakistan.","Kiran, now 27, went missing in 2008 when she stepped out to buy ice cream in her Islamabad neighbourhood and forgot her home address.

Sheikh Hasina, UK MP Tulip Siddiq Convicted in Corruption Case, Raising Concerns Over Fair Trials





Bangladesh’s former prime minister Sheikh Hasina , her sister Sheikh Rehana and Hasina’s niece and British MP Tulip Siddiq were on Monday sentenced to different terms of imprisonment for ‘irregularities’ in allocation of plots under the Purbachal New Town project.Judge Rabiul Alam of Dhaka Special Judge Court-4 pronounced the verdict. Hasina, already sentenced to death for crimes against humanity, was handed five years’ imprisonment, while Rehana got seven years and Tulip Siddiq two years of jail.The court found Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, guilty of misusing her “special influence” as a British politician to coerce Hasina into giving valuable pieces of land to her mother and siblings.Bangladesh does not have an extradition treaty with the United Kingdom (UK), and it is unlikely Siddiq will serve the sentence. The Labour party said it was not recognising the corruption judgment against Siddiq because she was denied the opportunity to a fair legal process in the case.Siddiq had denied the charges, claiming that much of the evidence being presented by prosecutors was forged. She had been put on trial as a Bangladeshi citizen, with a passport and tax ID, even though she said she had not held a Bangladeshi passport since childhood and had never paid taxes there.Siddiq said, “This whole process has been flawed and farcical from the beginning to the end.” “The outcome of this kangaroo court is as predictable as it is unjustified. I hope this so-called ‘verdict’ will be treated with the contempt it deserves. My focus has always been my constituents in Hampstead and Highgate, and I refuse to be distracted by politics of Bangladesh,” the Guardian quoted her as saying.","Sheikh Hasina, UK MP Tulip Siddiq Convicted in Corruption Case, Raising Concerns Over Fair Trials.

WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump's first appearance at since returning to the White House was supposed to centre on how the US secured a historic military spending pledge from others in the defensive alliance - effectively bending it to its will.But in the spotlight instead now is Trump's decision to strike three nuclear enrichment facilities in Iran that the administration says eroded Tehran's nuclear ambitions as well as the president's sudden announcement that Israel and Iran had reached a ""complete and total ceasefire."" The sharp U-turn in hostilities just hours before he was set to depart for the summit is sure to dominate the discussions in The Hague, Netherlands.The impact of the strikes had already begun to shape the summit, with Secretary-General Mark Rutte dancing around the issue even as hundreds of people showed up in The Hague on Sunday to denounce the conflict in a protest that was supposed to be focused on defence spending.Still, other countries have become accustomed to the unpredictable when it comes to Trump, who has made no secret of his disdain for the alliance, which was created as a bulwark against threats from the former Soviet Union.Trump's debut on the stage at the 2017 summit was perhaps most remembered by his shove of Dusko Markovic, the prime minister of Montenegro, as the US president jostled toward the front of the pack of world leaders during a headquarters tour.And he began the 2018 summit by questioning the value of the decades-old military alliance and accusing its members of not contributing enough money for their defence - themes he has echoed since. In Brussels, Trump floated a 4 percent target of defense spending as a percentage of a country's gross domestic product, a figure that seemed unthinkable at the time.Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will also attend the summit this week. She said if Trump does anything to sow division within the alliance, it would benefit Xi Jinping of China, which countries have accused of enabling Russia as it invades Ukraine.""That does not help America, does not help our national security,"" Shaheen said in an interview. ""What it does is hand a victory to our adversaries, and for an administration that claims to be so concerned about the threat from (China), to behave in that way is hard to understand.""Trump heavily telegraphed his attitude toward global alliances during his presidential campaigns.As a candidate in 2016, Trump suggested that he as president would not necessarily heed the alliance's mutual defense guarantees outlined in Article 5 of the treaty. And during a campaign rally in 2024, Trump recounted a conversation with another leader during which Trump said he would ""encourage"" Russia ""to do whatever the hell they want"" to members who weren't meeting the alliance's military spending targets.In The Hague, Trump will want to tout - and take credit for - the pledge to hike military spending, which requires other countries to invest in their defense at an unprecedented scale.The president went as far as to argue that the US should not have to abide by the 5 percent spending pledge he wants imposed on the other countries.That 5 percent is effectively divided into two parts. The first, 3.5 percent, is meant to be made up of traditional military spending such as tanks, warplanes and air defence. What can comprise the remaining 1.5 percent is a bit fuzzier, but it can include things like roads and bridges that troops could use to travel. According to , the US was spending about 3.4 percent of its gross domestic product on defence as of 2024.Most countries - with Spain as the key holdout - are preparing to endorse the pledge, motivated not just by Russian President Vladimir Putin 's invasion of Ukraine to bolster their own defences but also perhaps appease the United States and its tempestuous leader.""He hasn't said this in a while, but there are still a lot of worries in Europe that maybe the United States will pull out of , maybe the United States won't honour Article 5,"" said Matthew Kroenig, vice president and senior director of the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Centre for Strategy and Security and a former Pentagon official. ""I think there is a real fear among Europeans that we need to deliver for Trump in order to keep the United States engaged in . ""Kroenig added: ""Like it or not, I do think Trump's tougher style does get more results.""European allies have taken note of potential signs of a broader US retreat. France and other countries have been concerned that the Trump administration is considering reducing troop levels in Europe and shift them over to the Indo-Pacific, which Cabinet officials have signaled is a higher priority.Still, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US Ambassador to Matt Whitaker have underscored the US' commitment and have said the Trump administration is only seeking a stronger alliance.""There's sort of - in some ways - not a coherent view coming from this administration, the Trump administration, about how it sees ,"" said Max Bergmann, the director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. ""And right now, Europeans can kind of see what they want from the United States.""The White House has not said which world leaders Trump will meet with at the World Forum in The Hague. It's unclear whether Trump's path will cross with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's; the two leaders were scheduled to meet at the Group of 7 summit in Kananaskis, Alberta, earlier this month before Trump abruptly cut his trip short and returned to Washington.Rutte has stressed before that Trump's tariff war has no impact on since the alliance doesn't deal with trade. But it will be hard to ignore the issue as the US and the European Union continue to negotiate a trade deal after the US president threatened 50 percent import taxes on all European goods.Trump has set a July 9 deadline for the US and the 27-country EU to strike a trade deal. But in recent days, he's said the EU had not offered a fair deal as he reiterated his threat to force Europe to ""just pay whatever we say they have to pay.""",President Donald Trump's first appearance at since returning to the White House was supposed to centre on how the US secured a historic military spending pledge from others.

Iran late Monday launched a retaliatory strike against US forces stationed at Qatar’s Al Udeid Airbase, America’s largest military installation in the Middle East, responding to a recent US attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.Loud explosions were reported across Doha and Lusail, with missiles seen streaking across the night sky. In the immediate aftermath, Qatar shut down its airspace as a precaution.A video from a Doha shopping mall showed scenes of panic, with people, including women and children, rushing to safety amid the chaos.Iran's Supreme National Security Council stated that its military used the same number of bombs as the US did in its strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Tehran claimed it deliberately targeted areas away from Qatar's urban centers, stressing that the operation posed no threat to its ""friendly and brotherly"" neighbour.The missile barrage, dubbed ""Annunciation of Victory"" by Iran’s Tasnim news agency, was part of a wider retaliation that also included strikes on US bases in Iraq, according to a security source cited by the Associated Press.The latest escalation followed Israeli strikes under Operation Rising Lion, which targeted Iran’s key nuclear facilities in Natanz. The US later joined the offensive, hitting three major sites: Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan.However, US President Donald Trump later announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran.","Iran launches missile barrage against US forces stationed at Qatar’s Al Udeid Airbase.

A powerful earthquake measuring 6.2 magnitude has jolted parts of southern Philippines on Tuesday.The shallow quake struck about 374 kilometres (232 miles) east of the island of Davao. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.In a post on X, the National Center for Seismology posted the details of earthquake on X. It said, ""EQ of M: 6.2, On: 24/06/2025 07:28:06 IST, Lat: 7.90 N, Long: 130.09 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: East of Philippine Islands.""T he Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, which reported the earthquake also cleared that no tsunami alert had been issued.Philippines is located on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.

In a fresh development in the Iran-Israel conflict, Iran on late Monday fired a barrage of missiles at the US-operated Al Udeid air base in Qatar. The attack was Tehran's retaliation to American strikes on it's three key nuclear facilities on Sunday.Residents in Doha and nearby Lusail reported hearing thunderous explosions as the night sky was pierced by projectile trails and interception flashes.Video captured the moment air defenses were deployed to intercept missiles in the skies above Doha. The footage showed the missiles illuminating the night as the air defense systems neutralised the threat.US President Donald Trump downplayed the Iranian attack, calling it a ‘weak response’.“Iran has officially responded to our Obliteration of their Nuclear Facilities with a very weak response, which we expected, and have very effectively countered,” he said. “There have been 14 missiles fired — 13 were knocked down, and 1 was ‘set free,’ because it was headed in a nonthreatening direction.”Amid the rising tension, Trump also made a surprise announcement declaring a 'complete and total ceasefire' between Israel and Iran.He gave out the details on the phased de-escalation over the next 24 hours.Calling the recent conflict the “12-day War,” Trump posted on Truth Social, ""CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE!

In a dramatic turn during the twelfth day of the Iran-Israel conflict, US President Donald Trump announced that a complete ceasefire had been agreed upon between the two warring nations. However, within minutes, Iran firmly denied any such deal and stated that there is no agreement as of now.Meanwhile, Israeli emergency service Magen David Adom (MDA) confirmed that three people were killed in an Iranian missile strike on southern Israel, marking the first reported deaths in Israel since Trump’s ceasefire announcement.Donald Trump took to Truth Social to declare an end to the conflict, stating that Israel and Iran had both agreed to a ceasefire. He described the 12-day war as one that could have “destroyed the entire Middle East” but was instead coming to a peaceful close.“There will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE (in approximately 6 hours from now, when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in progress, final missions!), for 12 hours, at which point the War will be considered, ENDED!”“God bless Israel, God bless Iran, God bless the Middle East, God bless the United States of America, and GOD BLESS THE WORLD!”Just after Trump’s post, Iran’s foreign minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi released a statement saying that no ceasefire had been agreed to.He maintained that Iran had been defending itself and set conditions for halting operations.“As Iran has repeatedly made clear: Israel launched war on Iran, not the other way around.”“As of now, there is NO ‘agreement’ on any ceasefire or cessation of military operations. However, provided that the Israeli regime stops its illegal aggression against the Iranian people no later than 4 am Tehran time, we have no intention to continue our response afterwards.”“The final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later.”A second post by Araghchi followed shortly, confirming that Iran’s military actions had stopped as of 4am, while praising the Iranian Armed Forces.“The military operations of our powerful Armed Forces to punish Israel for its aggression continued until the very last minute, at 4am.”“Together with all Iranians, I thank our brave Armed Forces who remain ready to defend our dear country until their last drop of blood, and who responded to any attack by the enemy until the very last minute.”Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei shared a strong message online, saying that Iran will not back down and showed that the country remains strong and determined.“Those who know the Iranian people and their history know that the Iranian nation isn’t a nation that surrenders.”Hours before the ceasefire talk, Iran launched missiles at the US-operated Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. Loud explosions were heard across Doha and Lusail. Iran said this was in retaliation for US bombing of its nuclear facilities. Qatar condemned the strike and claimed nearly all missiles were intercepted.Iranian media called it “a mighty and successful response by the armed forces of Iran to America’s aggression.”These strikes came in response to the US' Operation Midnight Hammer, which targeted Iran's three major nuclear sites: Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz. The US used B-2 bombers and 30,000-pound bunker-buster ammunition to carry out the operation.Also read: Iran launches missiles at US base in Qatar; explosions rock Doha, Indian embassy urges caution - top developments Trump downplayed Iran’s missile strike on the base in Qatar, saying most of the missiles were intercepted and that no Americans were hurt.

Regarding the attack today at the American Base in Qatar, I am pleased to report that, in addition to no Americans being killed or wounded, very importantly, there have also been no Qataris killed or wounded.”In another post, Trump criticised Russian former President Dmitry Medvedev for allegedly mentioning nuclear warheads being sent to Iran. Trump expressed alarm over the use of the word “nuclear.”“Did I hear Former President Medvedev, from Russia, casually throwing around the ‘N word’ (Nuclear!), and saying that he and other Countries would supply Nuclear Warheads to Iran? Did he really say that or, is it just a figment of my imagination? If he did say that, and, if confirmed, please let me know, IMMEDIATELY.”“I guess that’s why Putin’s ‘THE BOSS.’”The day before, Israel reportedly hit Iran’s Evin prison in Tehran with a drone strike.

Judge halts another Trump administration effort to block foreign students from attending Harvard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-halts-another-trump-administration-effort-to-block-foreign-students-from-attending-harvard/articleshow/122038224.cms,"AP image





WASHINGTON: A federal judge on Monday blocked another effort by the Trump administration to keep international students from attending Harvard University, saying officials' ""misplaced efforts to control a reputable academic institution"" threatened freedom of speech.The order from US District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston preserves the ability of foreign students to travel to the US for study at Harvard while the case is decided.President Donald Trump has sought to cut off Harvard's enrollment of foreign students as part of a pressure campaign seeking changes to governance and policies at the Ivy League school. Administration officials also have cut more than $2.6 billion in research grants, ended federal contracts and threatened to revoke the tax-exempt status for the school Trump has derided as a hotbed of liberalism.Harvard sued the department of homeland security in May after the agency withdrew the school's certification to host foreign students and issue paperwork for their visas. The action would have forced Harvard's roughly 7,000 foreign students to transfer or risk being in the US illegally.The university called it illegal retaliation for rejecting the White House's demands to overhaul Harvard policies around campus protests, admissions, hiring and other issues.Burroughs temporarily had halted the action hours after Harvard sued and then granted an initial injunction Friday.The latest injunction came Monday in response to another move from Trump, who cited a different legal justification when he issued a June 4 proclamation blocking foreign students from entering the US to attend Harvard.In her order, Burroughs said the case is about freedom of speech and freedom of thought.""Here, the government's misplaced efforts to control a reputable academic institution and squelch diverse viewpoints seemingly because they are, in some instances, opposed to this administration's own views, threaten these rights,"" she wrote.Trump has been warring with Harvard for months after it rejected a series of government demands meant to address conservative complaints that the school has become too liberal and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.On Friday, he said in a post on Truth Social that the administration has been working with Harvard to address ""their large-scale improprieties"" and that a deal with Harvard could be announced within the next week. ""They have acted extremely appropriately during these negotiations, and appear to be committed to doing what is right,"" Trump's post said.Foreign students, who account for a quarter of Harvard's enrollment, were brought into the battle in April when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanded Harvard turn over a trove of records related to any dangerous or illegal activity by foreign students.

China tightens fentanyl controls in goodwill gesture to US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/china-tightens-fentanyl-controls-in-goodwill-gesture-to-us/articleshow/122037588.cms,"



China moved to tighten controls over two chemicals that can be used to make fentanyl, in an apparent olive branch to the US that may help maintain their fragile trade truce.Authorities added two previously unclassified precursors to a list of Class Two chemicals, according to a joint statement by six govt departments on Monday.The label will subject the substances, 4-piperidone and 1-boc-4-piperidone, to tougher supervision starting July 20. One of the chemicals, 4-piperidone, is regulated in the US as a precursor to fentanyl. The other substance, 1-boc-4-piperidone, can be used to make a precursor for the narcotic.The announcement followed a meeting between China's minister of public security Wang Xiaohong and US Ambassador David Perdue in Beijing last week. Wang said China was ready to collaborate on law enforcement areas such as counter-narcotics, which has been a source of friction between the world's largest economies.Beijing's gesture comes after recent trade talks led to a suspension of drastic tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods. But 20% levies tied to fentanyl have remained, making products from China less competitive and contributing to a drop in exports to the US. Cracking down on precursors is one of the few obvious avenues China has that may reduce those charges.","Authorities added two previously unclassified precursors to a list of Class Two chemicals.

Implications for international students





A federal judge on Monday issued a second preliminary injunction against the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to prevent international students from attending Harvard University.US district judge Allison Burroughs in Boston ruled in favour of Harvard, allowing foreign students to continue traveling to the US for their studies while the case moves forward. This follows an earlier injunction issued last Friday, also in response to federal action against the university.“This case is about core constitutional rights that must be safeguarded: freedom of thought, freedom of expression, and freedom of speech, each of which is a pillar of a functioning democracy and an essential hedge against authoritarianism,” she said in a statement.US President Donald Trump has been pressuring Harvard to change its policies, criticising the institution as overly liberal. His administration has cut more than $2.6 billion in research funding, ended federal contracts, and threatened to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status.In a Truth Social post last week, Trump said the administration was negotiating with Harvard and hinted at a possible agreement, saying that the university had acted “appropriately” during the talks.However, Harvard president Alan Garber has said the school will not compromise its “core, legally-protected principles,” despite pressure from Washington.Despite the federal court's ruling in favor of Harvard, many international students continue to face difficulties entering the US. Students have reported issues at airports and consulates, where federal officers have followed outdated or inconsistent guidance, resulting in denied visas or entry refusals, even after the injunction was issued.Harvard, which has around 7,000 international students, said the federal actions had already caused “profound fear, concern, and confusion.” Many students have considered transferring due to the uncertainty surrounding their visa status.Maureen Martin, director of Harvard’s immigration services, confirmed that numerous students were left in limbo. The university argued that losing its international student body would harm its academic mission and global standing. “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” the lawsuit stated.In response, Harvard is developing contingency plans to ensure affected students can continue their education, regardless of ongoing legal or policy changes.For students making major life decisions, such as booking flights, signing leases, or leaving jobs in their home countries, the lack of clarity has been especially disruptive.The dispute began in May when the department of homeland security withdrew Harvard’s certification to host foreign students, which would have forced them to leave or remain in the US without legal status. Harvard sued, claiming the move was retaliation for rejecting federal demands to alter its policies on admissions, campus protests, and hiring.Monday’s injunction also blocks a separate proclamation issued by Trump on June 4, which attempted to use a different legal basis to bar international students. Judge Burroughs had first paused that action with a temporary restraining order before issuing this new ruling.","US district judge Allison Burroughs in Boston ruled in favour of Harvard, allowing foreign students to continue traveling to the US for their studies.

For all of the destruction the US Air Force visited on Iran's nuclear programme, satellite images show that military planners were careful not to hit reactors at a key research facility.Notably absent from the latest International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) damage report are three research reactors operating at the Isfahan Nuclear Technology and Research Center. One of the so-called miniature neutron source reactors, made by China in 1991, runs on 900 grams (2 pounds) of bomb-grade uranium.American officials said at the weekend that an assessment of the final damage from Trump's decision to join Israel in attacking Iran will take some time. But as more images emerge, the Isfahan sites appear to have been intentionally left untouched, according to four senior officials in Vienna. They asked not to be identified in exchange for discussing sensitive information.The IAEA's board of governors convened an emergency session on Monday in the Austrian capital to discuss the ongoing strikes against Iran's nuclear programme. Hitting an operational nuclear reactor, even if low powered like the ones at Isfahan, could set a grave precedent, the officials said.Agency inspectors demanded that Iran inform them about the current location of its highly enriched uranium stockpile. Iran warned the attacks have gravely damaged international diplomatic efforts to halt the spread of atomic weapons.","Satellite images show that military planners were careful not to hit reactors at a key research facility.

In a tense and unprecedented moment during a live broadcast, veteran CNN anchor Anderson Cooper , along with correspondents Clarissa Ward and Jeremy Diamond, were compelled to urgently evacuate their Tel Aviv hotel studio amid a missile alert triggered by an Iranian attackThey were discussing the escalating Israel‑Iran crisis around 3 a.m. local time when air‑raid sirens began sounding, accompanied by smartphone alerts warning of an impending missile strike. Ward informed viewers: “I should just say that we’re now hearing an alert.” Cooper explained, “These are the alerts… It’s a 10‑minute warning of incoming missiles or something incoming from Iran.”With less than ten minutes before impact, the team swiftly began moving guests and equipment into the hotel’s bomb shelter. Cooper, visibly rattled, reassured viewers of their intention to continue broadcasting, “even if we can, on the way down.” A brief technical glitch ensued as they descended, but the live feed resumed with distance shots and sirens blaring in the background.“It is a luxury to have a 10‑minute warning,” Cooper remarked once in the shelter, highlighting Israel’s early warning system.This incident unfolded amid an intense military exchange between Iran and Israel.

White House official says they were anticipating retaliation







After Iran launched an attack on the American air base in Qatar in what seemed to be a major escalation after US dropped bombs on Iran's three nuclear plants, a New York Times report said that Iran coordinated the attacks with Qatari officials and gave advanced notice that the attacks were coming to minimise casualties.""The officials said Irn symbolically needed to strike back at the US but at the same time carry it out in a way that allowed all sides an exit ramp,"" the NYT report said. ""They described it as a similar strategy to 2020 when Iran gave Iraq head up before firing ballistic missiles an American base in Iraq following the assassination of its top general,"" the report said.A senior White House official told CNN that the administration was anticipating retaliation. “We knew they’d retaliate. They had a similar response after Soleimani,” the official said, referring to Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian commander killed in a US airstrike in 2020.The official said initial assessments were that the missiles fired by the Iranians on Monday didn’t hit their intended targets. Qatar’s Defense Ministry said its air defenses intercepted an Iranian missile attack on the US air base in the country.Iran State TV reported that Iran began an operation against the US-run Al Udeid Air base in Qatar. A series of loud booms were heard in Doha, and some objects were seen falling to the earth.Iran said the attack in Qatar matched the number of bombs dropped by the United States on its nuclear sites over the weekend, signaling its likely desire to de-escalate. Iran also said it targeted the base because it was outside of populated areas.The Ain al-Assad base housing US troops in western Iraq was also targeted, an Iraqi security official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. But Iran did not claim credit for that attack, which could have been carried out by militias. It was not immediately clear if there was damage to the Iraq base or any injuries.Qatar’s Foreign Ministry said the attack by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards was “a flagrant violation of Qatar’s sovereignty, its airspace, and international law.”Al Udeid is also home to the Combined Air Operations Center, which provides command and control of air power across the region as well as the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing, the largest expeditionary wing in the world.Just before the explosions, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian wrote on the social platform X: “We neither initiated the war nor seeking it. But we will not leave invasion to the great Iran without answer.”","White House official says they were anticipating retaliation from Iran.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Monday extended its airspace ban on Indian aircraft for another month, citing ongoing tensions between the two countries following the Pahalgam terrorist attack and subsequent military operations.The ban, originally imposed on April 23, was first extended on May 23 after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7. The Indian military action targeted and reportedly dismantled several terror camps in Pakistan-administered territory, triggering four days of intense cross-border clashes that concluded with a ceasefire on May 10.A fresh Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) issued by the Pakistan Airports Authority now extends the restriction from June 23 to July 23. The notice states, “Pakistan airspace not available for Indian registered aircraft and aircraft operated/owned or leased by Indian airlines/operators including military flights.”The situation remains tense despite the end of direct hostilities. Diplomatic channels have yet to yield any breakthroughs in repairing the fractured bilateral relationship. Indian and Pakistani officials have not resumed formal dialogue since the flare-up.The initial ban followed the Pahalgam terrorist attack, which killed at least 26 people, further deepening mistrust and heightening military alertness on both sides.","The ban, originally imposed on April 23, was first extended on May 23 after India launched Operation Sindoor.

Pakistan Condemns U.S. Strikes On Iran A Day After Nobel Peace Prize Endorsement For Donald Trump





The Pakistani government and its powerful military establishment are facing a wave of public backlash after formally recommending US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, a move that drew widespread condemnation following the US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities.Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar sent a letter to the Nobel Committee in Norway, crediting Trump’s “decisive diplomatic intervention” during the recent India-Pakistan standoff. But the recommendation triggered a storm on social media after Trump ordered attacks on Iran’s Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear sites, an operation he called a “historic moment” and one that escalated regional tensions.On X (formerly Twitter), users accused the Pakistani government of appeasing its “master.” One user mocked, “Pakistanis, beware! After the attack on Iran, PM Shehbaz might not only award Trump the Nobel Peace Prize, but also Tamgha-e-Jurat, Tamgha-e-Shujaat, Tamgha-e-Basalat, Tamgha-e-Imtiaz, and perhaps even the Nishan-e-Haider!”Veteran journalist Ameer Abbas recalled that PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique had once likened Trump to Genghis Khan and Hitler.“Now, the same government nominates him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Who is orchestrating such shameful and cowardly decisions?” he asked.Raheeq Abbasi, political analyst and columnist, noted the irony, “Trump, who vetoed the Gaza ceasefire 8 times and is protested across the West for war crimes, is being nominated for a Nobel by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Is there no sense of honour left?”The backlash cut across ideological lines. Some users accused the military establishment of calling the shots. “The uncrowned kings are ready to sell out the nation whenever they please,” wrote Major (R) Asim.Another user, Jarjees Ahmad, called out the “supreme level of hypocrisy”, “We’re nominating someone involved in the massacre of Palestinians while claiming to stand with Iran.”Aamir Khan added, “What greater betrayal could there be to Muslims, our country, and the people of Pakistan?”The Pakistani government has yet to respond officially to the criticism.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar sent a letter to the Nobel Committee in Norway, crediting Trump’s “decisive diplomatic intervention” during the recent India-Pakistan standoff.

ISLAMABAD: In a move likely to stir diplomatic discussion across the region, the Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan govt announced on Saturday that it will formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, citing his diplomatic intervention during the recent India-Pakistan military crisis, reports Omer Farooq Khan.In an official statement shared on X, the Pakistan govt credited Trump's ""decisive intervention"" and ""pivotal leadership"" with helping de-escalate a rapidly intensifying standoff between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Islamabad said it responded with a calibrated military action - Operation Bunyanum Marsoos - described as a ""measured"" and ""precise"" strike intended to restore deterrence without targeting civilian areas.Pakistan's govt claimed Trump engaged both Islamabad and New Delhi through high-level diplomacy at a moment of heightened regional volatility, securing a ceasefire that averted a wider conflagration. ""President Trump demonstrated strategic foresight and statesmanship, preventing a broader conflict that could have had catastrophic consequences for the region,"" the statement read.The govt also praised Trump for his ""sincere"" willingness to assist in resolving the Kashmir dispute - an issue Pakistan maintains is central to lasting peace in South Asia.India, however, has consistently rejected third-party involvement in Kashmir, reiterating that the issue must be resolved bilaterally under the Simla Agreement.The Pakistani statement expressed hope that Trump's ""legacy of pragmatic diplomacy"" would continue to play a role in addressing global flashpoints, including the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and rising tensions involving Iran.Trump, who is yet to respond publicly, has previously highlighted his role in managing past India-Pakistan tensions, including in 2019 following the Pulwama-Balakot incident. His earlier offer to mediate on Kashmir was firmly rebuffed by New Delhi.The Nobel Peace Prize nomination process permits formal recommendations from heads of state, national lawmakers, and certain academic and diplomatic figures. The Norwegian Nobel Committee does not comment on individual nominations.If successful, Trump would join a select group of American leaders - US Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter, and Barack Obama - who have received the Nobel Peace Prize.","Pakistan to nominate US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.

'Could not Occur Without Money': FATF Condemns Pahalgam Attack; Pakistan's Return To Grey-List Soon?





A new report from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has cited a case involving Pakistan’s missile development programme, referencing a shipment seized by Indian customs officials in 2020 that was bound for Port Qasim in Karachi. The FATF case study outlines how dual-use goods, including equipment critical for ballistic missile technology, were mis-declared in export documents and linked directly to Pakistan’s National Development Complex, which is known to be involved in the development of long-range ballistic missiles.The FATF report reveals that Indian investigators intercepted a cargo ship falsely declaring autoclaves, equipment used for high-energy materials and missile motor components. “The Bill of Lading of the seized cargo provided evidence of the link between the importer and the National Development Complex,” the report noted.This latest disclosure comes as FATF increases its scrutiny of state-sponsored terrorism, particularly following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, which left 26 dead. In a public condemnation, FATF said: “This, and other recent attacks, could not occur without money and the means to move funds between terrorist supporters.”As per PTI sources, India is likely to use this FATF disclosure in its dossier to push for Pakistan’s return to the FATF grey list. The upcoming Asia Pacific Group meeting in August and the FATF plenary in October may see renewed calls for sanctions or monitoring. According to officials cited by PTI, the inclusion of “state-sponsored terrorism” in the FATF’s upcoming analysis marks a significant step in acknowledging Pakistan’s involvement in funding and facilitating terror operations.The incident flagged by FATF, which occurred in February 2020 at Kandla port, saw authorities act on intelligence regarding a suspicious Hong Kong-flagged ship, Da Cui Yun, that had departed from China’s Jiangyin port, TOI had reported. Officials seized a massive pressure chamber described as a pipe-like object, 35-40 feet in length, now confirmed to have potential ballistic missile applications. Experts from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) joined a high-level investigation into the cargo, amid tight-lipped responses from customs due to the national security implications.Also read: ‘Suspicious’ Chinese ship seized at Kandla, under strict scrutiny The FATF report also highlighted the growing global risk from proliferation financing (PF), especially concerning state and non-state actors acquiring dual-use technologies for weapons of mass destruction (WMD). “The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related financing represents a significant threat to global security and the integrity of the international financial system,” the report warns, adding that failure to implement effective controls could allow actors to exploit weaknesses in global export and financial systems.","A new report from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has cited a case involving Pakistan’s missile development programme.

His engagements underscored Islamabad’s renewed focus on international outreach amid a shifting geopolitical landscape in South Asia.The army chief reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to regional stability, counterterrorism, and a rules-based global order, pitching the country as a responsible actor in an increasingly multipolar world.Munir spoke at length about Pakistan’s counter-terrorism strategy, highlighting military operations such as Maarka-e-Haqa and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. He reminded his audience of Pakistan’s role as a frontline state in the global war on terror, citing the “immense sacrifices” borne by its security forces and civilians.Without naming India, Munir warned against “regional actors using terrorism as an instrument of hybrid warfare” – a familiar refrain in Pakistan’s diplomatic lexicon referring to its neighbour.While not new, the accusation resurfacing in the US capital, signalling Pakistan’s intent to shape the security discourse in South Asia.Munir also showcased Pakistan’s economic aspirations. He pitched the country’s untapped potential in IT, agriculture, and mineral wealth, calling on global stakeholders to invest in these “engines of shared prosperity”.From foreign policy to economic diplomacy, Munir portrayed Pakistan as a country pursuing dialogue, diplomacy, and international law — an image Islamabad has been keen to project as it seeks to distance itself from past reputational baggage.Discussing Pakistan-US relations, Munir called for transforming the historical security-centric engagement into a multidimensional partnership grounded in strategic convergence and mutual respect. He acknowledged past cooperation on counterterrorism and economic development but pushed for a broader framework of engagement.According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, participants appreciated the candid nature of the discussions and acknowledged Pakistan’s efforts to maintain regional stability. The meetings were seen as a trust-building exercise amid evolving US priorities in the Indo-Pacific region and growing scepticism over Islamabad’s commitments.The visit comes at a time when Pakistan is striving to reset ties with major powers, especially after its recent economic crises and shifting regional alignments. With India drawing closer to the US and Afghanistan remaining volatile, Islamabad is attempting to reposition itself as an indispensable — if complicated — regional player.","Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Friday issued a stern warning that he may dissolve the provincial assembly if the federal government attempts to destabilise the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-led coalition in the province.In a video message, Gandapur asserted that he holds the constitutional power to dissolve the assembly at any time. The warning comes amid increasing political friction between the federal and provincial governments.Gandapur suspended implementation of the recently passed provincial budget and instructed lawmakers not to submit any cut motions during Friday’s session. He added that a new strategy would be announced on Monday.“If we don’t pass the budget, the federal government could take control of the province under the pretext of a financial emergency,” Gandapur said, accusing Islamabad of conspiring to topple his government.He also lashed out at the federal authorities for what he described as “unjust treatment” of the province following the May 9, 2023, incidents. He alleged that the public mandate in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was stolen in the aftermath.“Our leader was unjustly jailed, and the way we were treated after May 9, followed by the theft of our mandate, is unacceptable.

Trump Hosts Pakistan Army Chief Munir Alone At White House, Faces Fierce Criticism From Pentagon Vet





ISLAMABAD: The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz, with whispers of backroom deals that could reshape the balance of power in South Asia and far beyond.What began as a one-hour lunch in the Cabinet Room turned into a two-hour marathon meeting that continued in the Oval Office, attended by US secretary of state Marco Rubio, special representative Steve Witkoff, and Pakistan NSA and Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Asim Malik.The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) handout flags counter-terrorism, trade, and peace, but the real stakes — against the backdrop of Iran-Israel airstrikes and India-Pakistan tensions — reveal a high-wire act with far-reaching implications.Trump, channeling his trademark deal-maker bravado, now sees Pakistan as a strategic prize. As Israel intensifies strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites and Washington edges closer to military escalation, Pakistan’s shared border with Iran becomes critical. Sources say Trump privately pressured Munir for airspace access and intelligence on Tehran — leveraging Pakistan’s backchannel role as the host of Iran’s interests section for the US.In return, he offered advanced weaponry and economic incentives, aiming to lure Islamabad away from China’s orbit and Russia’s Brics alliance.Trump’s push to expand trade in critical minerals, cryptocurrency, AI, and energy is part of a broader strategy to anchor Pakistan within US-led markets and curb China’s regional influence. He has also claimed credit for defusing the May 2025 crisis between India and Pakistan.As Pakistan’s power broker, Munir brings serious leverage. His military’s fight against Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) syncs with US aims in Afghanistan. With ties to Iran and a shared border, Munir can offer covert intelligence or logistical support, though Pakistan’s pro-Iran rhetoric caps public alignment. Economically, he can unlock Pakistan’s mineral and tech potential for US investors, but treading too far risks Beijing’s wrath.On India, Munir’s role in brokering the May ceasefire – praised by President Trump – has been framed in Islamabad as a direct rebuttal of New Delhi’s allegations of Pakistani involvement in cross-border terrorism. With the country facing severe economic challenges, Munir is believed to have sought US military and financial assistance to modernise Pakistan’s armed forces and stabilise its economy. Trump’s openness to providing drones or missile defence systems could significantly alter the military balance with India. Munir also reportedly urged Trump to de-escalate growing tensions between Iran and Israel, warning of broader regional instability and citing Pakistan’s vocal alignment with Tehran. In a bold diplomatic gesture, Munir extended an invitation for Trump to visit Pakistan, an effort seen as central to reshaping bilateral ties and enhancing Islamabad’s global relevance.Timed amid Middle East turmoil and South Asian friction, the Trump-Munir summit is a geopolitical pivot. It signals a fragile US-Pakistan thaw, driven by Washington’s ally hunt and Pakistan’s economic crunch. For India, it’s a call to counter a US strategy cosying up to both rivals while eyeing Iran. Trump’s deal-making and Munir’s strategic charm aim to reposition Pakistan as a US cornerstone, potentially redrawing South Asia’s power map at India’s expense. Wednesday’s White House talks weren’t just diplomacy, they were a bold move in a high-stakes regional chess game.","The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz.

UK Express reported that Yadav admitted his offences and escaped with a suspended prison sentence, while the university demanded that he move to different accommodation.""Following his conviction he now faces being kicked off his course by university chiefs and sent home in shame,"" the report said.The university administration said there was an administrative error in the key cards and that was quickly resolved.It was, however, through the key card data that Yadav was found as the culprit and his DNA matched with the white substance in the victim's room.Prosecutor Jennifer Coxon told the court that Yadav admitted that he was ""overcome with desire"" and he was aware that the gym cards were set up incorrectly giving access to all rooms.The victim said she had her photos on the wall and she was worried that an unknown man had committed a sex act in her room. The report said she went to stay with a friend.Yadav admitted to burglary with intent to cause criminal damage.The incident took place earlier this year when the victim went to her home for Christmas.The report said Yadav was sentenced to 14 months suspended for two years, with rehabilitation requirements, 200 hours unpaid work and £117 compensation for three Jellycat soft toys and bed covers.Yadav's lawyer Shada Mellor told the court that his father owns a construction business in India. “His behaviour on the day in question is wholly out of character,"" his lawyer argued saying that Yadav chose to study in the UK as he wants to succeed and leave a lasting impact on the world.","Udkarsh Yadav, an Indian student studying at Northumbria University, broke into a first-year female undergraduate's bedroom.

Data, Dreams and Dharma: Stanford GSB Commencement Speech 2025





In a rare joint address that felt more like a fireside conversation than a commencement speech, former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his wife, investor-philanthropist Akshata Murthy, took the stage at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business (GSB) to reflect on leadership, life, and the Eastern values that have guided them through power, politics, and parenthood.But it was one ancient Sanskrit word——that became the philosophical cornerstone of their address to the Class of 2025.“It’s a concept known in Sanskrit as Dharma,” Sunak explained. “The idea that we should gain our fulfilment from simply doing our personal duty, rather than from any rewards that may come with our efforts.”It was not just an abstract idea. Sunak revealed that Dharma was the principle that guided his decision to step into the chaos of British politics in 2022—after losing the Conservative Party leadership race, only to return weeks later as Prime Minister following Liz Truss’s resignation and a market meltdown.“At that point,” Sunak recalled, “a purely ambitious politician would have sat out the impossible situation. But Akshata reminded me: my Dharma was clear.”That invocation of duty over ambition—a far cry from the usual Machiavellian fare of Westminster—drew warm applause from the GSB audience. For a school known for producing Silicon Valley unicorns and global CEOs, the speech was a gentle, unexpected reorientation: success isn’t just about spreadsheets, scalability, and shareholder value.Sometimes, it’s about doing the right thing, even when it costs you.The speech was also deeply personal. Akshata and Rishi, both graduates of Stanford GSB’s Class of 2006, met during their time on campus. “This is literally where we met,” Murthy told the audience. “In the Schwab courtyard, to be precise.”Their anecdotes—him in “seriously uncool” cargo shorts, her dragging him along on runs—were a charming counterpoint to their more weighty themes. But even those early conversations, they said, were seeded with discussions about leadership, values, and Dharma.“We started talking about this idea without knowing it,” Murthy said. “At Arbuckle Café over breakfast… and whether 11am was too early for some ice cream for Rishi.”From Omicron to OmSunak drew on his COVID-era experience as Chancellor of the Exchequer to drive home a broader point: while data was critical, instinct—rooted in values—was what made the difference.“I used to find comfort in the idea that data could always provide a certain answer,” Sunak said. “But Akshata helped me see that data can’t look around corners. It can’t make the decision for you.”It was a lesson, he said, that helped him resist pressure for a second national lockdown in late 2021, when the Omicron variant emerged. While the experts were divided, Sunak trusted his intuition—and ultimately, his duty to protect not just lives, but livelihoods.The concept of Dharma wasn’t just for prime ministers. Murthy extended it to young people, particularly through initiatives like Lessons at 10 and The Richmond Project, both aimed at increasing youth numeracy and life skills across the UK. “Successes and failures are part of the package that comes with leadership,” she said. “Dharma isn’t just relevant in public service… it gives you the resilience and clarity to overcome whatever’s thrown at you without losing your way. ”The GSB audience—diverse, ambitious, and often torn between idealism and practicality—was urged to embrace the same principle. Not to obsess over outcomes, but to anchor themselves in purpose. “If you want to lead,” said Sunak, “it’s not a question of data or intuition. You’ve got to get comfortable with both.”That both Sunak and Murthy come from families steeped in Indian values added an additional layer to the message. As the daughter of Infosys founder Narayana Murthy, and as Britain’s first Indian-origin prime minister, they embodied a fusion of East and West, Silicon Valley and Westminster, tradition and modernity.In invoking Dharma, they weren’t just quoting a Sanskrit term—they were redefining global leadership with it.For a generation of graduates who will face climate breakdowns, AI disruption, political upheavals and moral dilemmas far more complex than case studies can capture, the message resonated:Don’t just optimise. Do your duty.Whether it’s in public service, entrepreneurship, or social impact, the world, they said, needs more leaders shaped not just by capital markets—but by Dharma.As the applause rang out and the tassels turned, Rishi and Akshata Murthy left the GSB stage not as power couple or policy wonks, but as philosopher-guides—reminding the next generation that greatness isn’t just built on ambition or data, but something older, deeper, and infinitely more enduring.A sense of duty.Or as the Bhagavad Gita would put it: “Karmanye vadhikaraste ma phaleshu kadachana” — “You have the right to perform your duty, but not to the fruits of your actions.”That, perhaps, is the ultimate graduation gift.","Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his wife, investor-philanthropist Akshata Murthy, took the stage at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business (GSB) to reflect on leadership, life, and the Eastern values that have guided them through power, politics, and parenthood.

'Historic step': UK MPs back assisted dying; bill heads to House of Lords,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/historic-step-uk-mps-back-assisted-dying-bill-heads-to-house-of-lords/articleshow/121977752.cms,"AP photo

'Heartbreaking stories'

Public support





Britain took a historic step toward legalising euthanasia on Friday as Members of Parliament (MPs) backed a controversial bill that would introduce assisted dying for terminally ill people.In the House of Commons, lawmakers voted 314 to 291 in favour of sending the proposal to the House of Lords for further consideration, following four hours of emotional debate.The outcome sparked celebrations among supporters gathered outside Parliament, who argued that legalising euthanasia would offer dignity and choice to people facing incurable illnesses at the end of their lives.At the same time, opponents at a nearby counter-protest voiced concerns that vulnerable individuals could be pressured into choosing death and called on lawmakers to instead prioritise improvements in palliative care.The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill would allow assisted suicide in England and Wales for adults diagnosed with less than six months to live. Under the proposed law, individuals would need to self-administer the life-ending medication, and their decision would require approval from two doctors and a panel of experts.If passed, the bill would bring Britain in line with several countries in Europe and elsewhere — such as Belgium and the Netherlands — that have already legalised some form of assisted dying.Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, who introduced the bill, told Friday’s third reading debate that changing the law would “offer a compassionate and safe choice” to terminally ill people.She argued that keeping the current ban in place would result in more “heartbreaking stories” of “pain and trauma, suicide attempts, PTSD, lonely trips to Switzerland, (and) police investigations.”However, Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft raised concerns that the bill did not include strong enough safeguards to protect disabled individuals.“We have to protect those people who are susceptible to coercion, who already feel like society doesn't value them, who often feel like a burden to the state, society and their family,” she said.Outside Parliament, demonstrators held placards with messages such as “Let us choose” and “Don’t make doctors killers.”David Walker, 82, shared his personal story of supporting the bill after witnessing his wife suffer for three years toward the end of her life.“That’s why I’m here, because I can’t help her anymore, but I can help other people who are going through the same thing, because if you have no quality of life, you have nothing,” he told AFP.But Elizabeth Burden, a 52-year-old doctor, warned that the legislation could lead to a “slippery slope” where eligibility for assisted dying might expand.“Once we allow this. Everything will slip down because dementia patients, all patients... are vulnerable,” she told AFP.MPs had initially backed an earlier version of the bill in November by 330 to 275 votes. Since then, several changes have been made, including a ban on advertising assisted dying and provisions allowing all healthcare workers to opt out of participating in the process.Lawmakers also added a safeguard to prevent eligibility “solely as a result of voluntarily stopping eating or drinking,” effectively ruling out cases such as people with anorexia.Britain’s medical community remains divided, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s cabinet is also split. His health and justice secretaries have publicly opposed the proposed law.However, public support appears strong. A YouGov poll of 2,003 adults, conducted last month and published on Thursday, found that 73 per cent of respondents supported the introduction of an assisted dying law.The bill now moves to the House of Lords, which must approve the legislation before the end of the current parliamentary year, likely in the autumn, or it will lapse.If passed and granted royal assent, the law would take approximately four years to implement before assisted dying services become available.A government impact assessment published this month estimated that between 160 and 640 assisted deaths could take place in the first year, potentially rising to 4,500 annually within a decade.Assisted suicide is currently illegal in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, carrying a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.Meanwhile, a separate assisted dying bill is progressing through the devolved Scottish Parliament. In March, the Isle of Man became the first British territory to pass an assisted dying bill.",MPs vote 314 to 291 in favour of sending the bill to the House of Lords for further consideration. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill would allow assisted suicide in England and Wales for adults diagnosed with less than six months to live. Opponents say vulnerable individuals could be pressured into choosing death.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121978028,imgsize-79176,width-400,resizemode-4/121978028.jpg"

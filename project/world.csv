ISLAMABAD: Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has been re-elected as Chairman of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) for the next four years after the party's intra-party elections held at the Central Secretariat in Islamabad, The Express Tribune reported.The elections were conducted according to the PPP's constitution and finalised key leadership positions for the next four years. In addition, Humayun Khan was chosen as PPP's Secretary General, and Nadeem Afzal Chan was elected Secretary of Information.Aamna Piracha has been chosen as Secretary Finance, completing the list of newly appointed senior officials, The Express Tribune reported. According to the PPP's internal electoral framework, all party officials were elected for a four-year term.Earlier on April 4, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that the PPP rejected the government's canal project, terming it ""unilateral"" and warning that it would harm farmers in Punjab, Dawn reported.On February 15, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and Chief of the Army Staff General Asim Munir inaugurated the Cholistan project to irrigate south Punjab's lands amid public outcry and strong reservations in Sindh.Meanwhile, in March, the Sindh Assembly unanimously passed a resolution against building six new canals on the Indus River. The resolution also demanded an immediate halt to any plans or work related to the project until an agreement with all provincial governments, especially Sindh, was reached to ensure that the province's rights were fully protected and respected.While addressing a PPP rally in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh on the anniversary of Pakistan's former Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's execution, Bhutto said that the PPP had always fought for peoples' rights to water, Dawn reported.He said, ""The workers of the PPP have grown old fighting for the fair distribution of water."" Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said, ""Be it Musharraf's unilateral canal proposal, or that of the PTI founder, there is no forum where we have not taken up our struggle."" He stated that the IRSA report shows there are water shortages in Punjab also, Dawn reported.He said, ""If we take water from here (Sindh), it'll harm farmers in South Punjab. These are reservations we have had for a very long time."" He stated that he was the first to raise his voice against the canal project.","Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has been re-elected as Chairman of the Pakistan People's Party.

"Alhurra, channel countering anti-US views in Middle East, ceases broadcast as Trump cuts funding",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/alhurra-channel-countering-anti-us-views-in-middle-east-ceases-broadcast-as-trump-cuts-funding/articleshow/120246093.cms,"AFP file photo

Alhurra , a US-funded Arabic-language news network created in 2004 to offer an American perspective in the middle east, will stop broadcasting and lay off most of its staff following the Trump administration's move to halt financial transfers to government-backed media outlets, including Alhurra’s parent company, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks (MBN).The network was launched in the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq to counter anti-American sentiment in Arabic media, especially that from Al-Jazeera, writes news agency AFP. Alhurra reached over 30 million viewers weekly across 22 countries but struggled to compete with well-established networks like Al-Jazeera, Al-Arabiya, and Sky News Arabia.Jeffrey Gedmin, MBN’s president and CEO, criticised the funding cut, saying it leaves the field open to extremist narratives. “It makes no sense to kill MBN as a sensible alternative,” Gedmin said. He added that the Trump administration, particularly Kari Lake—the official overseeing US international broadcasting—refused to meet with him or address concerns over what he calls “unlawfully” blocked funds.""I'm left to conclude that she is deliberately starving us of the money we need to pay you, our dedicated and hard-working staff,"" he wrote.Gedmin also said Alhurra would stop broadcasting but attempt to continue limited digital operations with a significantly reduced team.The shutdown is part of a broader budget reduction effort, reportedly influenced by Elon Musk, which has already affected other US-funded outlets like Voice of America and Radio Free Asia. Some organisations, such as Radio Free Europe, are now looking for support from foreign governments to survive.","Alhurra, a US-funded Arabic-language news network, will stop broadcasting and lay off most of its staff.

SAO PAULO: Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was transferred Saturday by medical aircraft from northeastern Brazil to the capital Brasilia after being hospitalized with abdominal pain a day earlier.Bolsonaro was hospitalized Friday morning while traveling in northeastern Brazil. The pain was caused by a bowel obstruction and was related to long-term effects of being stabb ed in the abdomen in September 2018, his doctors said.Bolsonaro has been in and out of hospitals since the attack at a campaign event before Brazil's 2018 presidential election. The conservative leader underwent several surgeries during his presidency from 2019-2022.""After so many similar episodes over the past few years, I had gotten used to the pain and discomfort. But this time, even the doctors were surprised,"" he said in a social media post Saturday, adding that a longtime physician told him it was ""the most serious case since the attack.""Bolsonaro also said he would likely undergo another surgery. Earlier on Saturday, doctors at Rio Grande Hospital in the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte told journalists he was stable and not in need of emergency surgery, said further procedures would depend on his recovery.Doctors also that the transfer to Brasilia was requested by his family and would happen Saturday afternoon.The far-right leader was admitted to a hospital in Santa Cruz, a small city in Rio Grande do Norte, and later transferred to a hospital in the state's capital, Natal. Bolsonaro was set to start a trip across the region to promote his party's right-wing agenda, eyeing next year's presidential election, though he himself is barred from running.

The US is seeking a nuclear accord quickly, according to Iran's statement following exceptional discussions on Saturday, whilst US President Donald Trump warns of potential military intervention if negotiations fail.The discussions were led by Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, a veteran diplomat who helped craft the 2015 agreement, and Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff. These talks represent the highest-level nuclear negotiations between Iran and the US since the previous agreement's termination.Araghchi engaged briefly with Witkoff, a property developer, during the otherwise indirect meeting in Oman, and announced that talks would continue next Saturday. ""The American side also said that a positive agreement was one that can be reached as soon as possible but that will not be easy and will require a willingness on both sides,"" Araghchi informed Iranian state television, as quoted by AFP.""I think we came very close to a basis for negotiation... Neither we nor the other party want fruitless negotiations, discussions for discussions' sake, time wasting or talks that drag on forever,"" he continued.Meanwhile, the White House described the discussions as ""very positive and constructive"". ""Special Envoy Witkoff's direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,"" their statement read. When questioned about the talks, Trump responded aboard Air Force One: ""I think they're going OK. Nothing matters until you get it done.""Earlier statements from both sides indicated their positions: Trump expressing desire for Iran's prosperity whilst preventing nuclear armament, and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's adviser Ali Shamkhani emphasising Iran's pursuit of ""a real and fair agreement"".This comes as US and Iran, without diplomatic ties for over four decades, are negotiating a fresh nuclear agreement after Trump withdrew from the previous one in 2018.The earlier nuclear agreement of 2015 was intended to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons while allowing it to maintain a civilian nuclear programme. Following the United States' unilateral withdrawal from the deal in 2018 under then-also President Donald Trump, Iran increased its nuclear activities.Recent reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) show that Iran has enriched uranium to significant levels. Under the original agreement, Iran was restricted to maintaining minimal quantities of uranium enriched to 3.67 per cent. Currently, however, its uranium reserves are sufficient to construct several nuclear weapons if desired, with some portions enriched up to 60 per cent—requiring only minor technical adjustments to reach weapons-grade levels. Based on discussions since the US withdrawal, Iran is expected to seek permission to continue uranium enrichment at a minimum of 20 per cent.The discussions occurred at a luxury Muscat hotel, the site of the 2015 agreement signed during Barack Obama 's presidency, though without visible indications of the high-level meeting.The Omani foreign minister facilitated this Muscat discussions, according to Iran. The American delegation had requested direct meetings. The diplomats spoke directly for ""a few minutes"", confirmed Iran's foreign ministry, noting the talks were held ""in a constructive and mutually respectful atmosphere"".The participants conducted negotiations from ""separate halls"", communicating through the Omani foreign minister, according to Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei's post on X. The Omani foreignmMinister Badr Albusaidi characterised the process as occurring in a ""friendly atmospere"".Iran is seeking sanctions relief whilst dealing with Israel's actions against its allies Hezbollah and Hamas. Despite Trump's stringent sanctions and military threats, Tehran agreed to participate while the US, aligned with Iran's adversary Israel, aims to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear capabilities.","Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi and Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff hold high stakes talks.

What will happen to Tuft student Rumeysa Ozturk as judge rules for deporting Columbia's Mahmoud Khalil?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-will-happen-to-tuft-student-rumeysa-ozturk-as-judge-rules-for-deporting-columbias-mahmoud-khalil/articleshow/120240798.cms,"Tuft University student Rumeysa Ozturk's plea is to be heard in Vermont Monday.

Good riddance: Trump admin reacts to Mahmoud Khalil order



What Mahmoud Khalil said after the ruling



The verdict of the Mahmoud Khalil case was crucial as several international students were detained by ICE after Khalil and are now waiting to be deported. An immigration judge, Jamee E Comans, on Friday ruled that Khalil can be deported as his presence in the US posed ""potentially serious foreign policy consequences"". The judge said the government established by clear and convincing evidence that he is removable.His lawyers said he would not be deported immediately as they would appeal the verdict. Previously, federal judges in New York and New Jersey ordered the government not to deport Khalil while his case remains in court.Tuft University doctoral student from Turkey Rumeysa Ozturkl who was detained by immigration officials near her Massachussets home has been demanding her release. She has filed an updated account of how she was surrounded by ICE officials who grabbed her phone.Rumeysa's case is like Khalil's, though Khalil is a US citizen through his marriage to a US citizen, Dr Noorr Abdallah who is going to be a mother next month.The petition to release her was filed in a Boston court and then it was moved top Vermont, which will be heard on Monday.Ozturk was one of four students who wrote an op-ed in the campus newspaper, The Tufts Daily, last year criticizing the university’s response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.DHS secretary Kristi Noem said it will be 'good riddance' once Khalil is deported. ""Mahmoud Khalil hates the United States and what we stand for—so his removal should come as welcome news,"" Noem posted.""It is a privilege to be granted a visa or green card to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence, glorify and support terrorists that relish the killing of Americans, and harass Jews, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country,"" Noem posted.""I would like to quote what you said last time that there's nothing that's more important to this court than due process rights and fundamental fairness. Clearly what we witnessed today, neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process. This is exactly why the Trump administration has sent me to this court, 1,000 miles away from my family. I just hope that the urgency that you deemed fit for me are afforded to the hundreds of others who have been here without hearing for months,"" Khalil said.","An immigration judge, Jamee E Comans, on Friday ruled that Khalil can be deported as his presence in the US posed ""potentially serious foreign policy consequences"" Rumeysa Ozturk who was detained by immigration officials near her Massachussets home has been demanding her release.

The Trump administration confirmed on Saturday that Kilmar Abrego Garcia , a Maryland resident mistakenly deported last month, remains confined in a notorious prison in El Salvador but did not provide the full scope of information demanded by a federal judge regarding efforts to bring him back.In a court filing submitted, US state department official Michael G Kozak said that Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador, reported news agency Associated Press.“He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador,” wrote Kozak, identified in the filing as a “Senior Bureau Official” in the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs.However, Kozak’s statement failed to address US district judge Paula Xinis’s additional directives. On Friday, the judge had ordered the administration to disclose not only Abrego Garcia’s “current physical location and custodial status” but also “what steps, if any, defendants have taken (and) will take, and when, to facilitate” his return.Xinis had expressed deep frustration over the government’s lack of transparency. “I’m not asking for state secrets. All I know is that he’s not here,” she said during a tense court hearing on Friday, adding, “The government was prohibited from sending him to El Salvador, and now I’m asking a very simple question: Where is he?”As per AP, Friday’s hearing exposed the administration’s failure to provide even basic information about Garcia's whereabouts or the plan for his return, prompting Xinis to demand daily updates from a US official with direct knowledge of the case.Garcia, 29, was deported in March despite a 2019 federal court ruling that prohibited his removal due to the likelihood he would face persecution in El Salvador. The deportation, which was later admitted by a US immigration official to be an “administrative error,” sent him to El Salvador’s CECOT prison , a high-security facility known for holding dangerous criminals.Garcia’s deportation occurred under a $6 million agreement between the Trump administration and the Salvadoran government. The deal allowed US authorities to detain and transfer migrants to Salvadoran custody.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident mistakenly deported last month, remains confined in a notorious prison in El Salvador.

News Wrap: Israel cuts off Rafah as it expands military activity in Gaza

Israel announced on Saturday that it would expand “rapidly” across much of Gazahad after completing building a new security corridor cutting off the southern city of Rafah from the rest of Gaza, reported news agency Associated Press.The corridor, called Morag, is named after a former Jewish settlement located between Rafah and Khan Younis. It has become a focal point since the Israeli army began mass evacuations in Rafah, hinting at plans for a large-scale assault.Rafah’s municipality has described the construction as a “flagrant breach of international legitimacy.” The corridors, coupled with a buffer zone that Israel has razed and expanded, give it more than 50% control of the territory.Israel says the military strategy is meant to pressure Hamas to release the remaining 59 hostages, of which 24 are believed to be alive. Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has also enforced a blockade of food, fuel, and aid, which aid agencies say has left over 2 million people in dire need.Israeli airstrikes continued across Gaza on Saturday, killing at least 21 people in the last 24 hours, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The ministry says most of the over 50,000 Palestinians killed since October have been women and children, although it does not separate combatant from civilian deaths. Israel claims to have killed 20,000 Hamas fighters but has not provided proof.On Saturday, evacuations were ordered east of Khan Younis, and later in parts of central Gaza, after rocket fire from those areas. Hamas has warned that ongoing bombardments risk the lives of hostages. A new video was released showing American hostage Edan Alexander speaking under duress. His family issued a statement urging support for a deal to bring hostages home.In a new development, Israel's defence minister Israel Katz said Palestinians would have the option to “voluntarily” relocate abroad under a US-backed proposal by president Donald Trump. Palestinians have strongly rejected the idea, calling it forced displacement. Human Rights Watch and other organisations have labelled the plan as ethnic cleansing.","Israel has completed building a new security corridor cutting off the southern city of Rafah from the rest of Gaza.

A twin-engine aircraft carrying two people crashed on Saturday in a muddy field in upstate New York, said Columbia County Undersheriff Jacqueline Salvatore, reported Associated Press. While she did not report any deaths, she said there was no damage to any structures.The federal aviation administration reported that the Mitsubishi MU-2B was en route to Columbia County Airport near Hudson but went down roughly 30 miles away, near Copake.Salvatore said that mud, weather conditions, and snow have made it hard for first responders to reach the crash site. The national transportation safety board said it has sent an investigation team, which is expected to reach New York by Saturday evening.According to New York Times, data from Flightradar24 shows a plane of the same model took off from Westchester County Airport in White Plains shortly after 11:30 a.m. It headed north before turning east near Hudson and disappearing from tracking near Copake minutes later.This comes a day after a sightseeing helicopter crashed into the Hudson river near the New Jersey shore on Thursday, killing all six people on board — including a Spanish family of five and the pilot, a US navy veteran.Recent months have seen multiple fatal crashes in US, including a midair collision and a medical plane crash.","A twin-engine aircraft carrying two people crashed on Saturday in a muddy field in upstate New York, said Columbia County Undersheriff Jacqueline Salvatore.

How much is Iran willing to concede?



US President Donald Trump announced on Monday, April 7, 2025, that Washington and Tehran would begin talks over Iran's nuclear programme in Oman. Oman has acted as a mediator between the West and Tehran in the past. The two countries met in Muscat on Saturday, April 12, to explore the possibility of a new nuclear agreement.Iranian state television said on Saturday that Iran and the United States will hold another round of talks next week regarding Tehran's nuclear program. This came at the end of their first meeting since Donald Trump returned as president. According to Iranian state TV, US Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi ""briefly spoke"" with each other — the first direct contact between the two sides since the Obama administration. Iranian state media mentioned the face-to-face conversation, indicating the talks were proceeding in a positive direction.The White House issued a statement on Saturday afternoon saying the discussions were ""very positive and constructive,"" but also noted that the issues involved ""are very complicated.""""Special Envoy Witkoff's direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,"" the White House said.Both the Iranian and American sides said the next round of talks will take place on Saturday, April 19.In 2018, President Trump withdrew the US from an earlier nuclear deal involving Iran and other world powers and reimposed economic sanctions. This move was strongly opposed by Iran.President Trump has also said that military action is possible if the talks do not lead to an agreement.Iran is not allowed to have nuclear weapons because it is a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which it signed along with most other countries. This agreement allows countries to use nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes, like energy, medicine, and agriculture. It strictly prohibits the development of nuclear weapons.Although Iran says its nuclear programme is only for civilian use, many countries and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are not fully convinced. Concerns grew in 2002 when Iran was discovered to have secret nuclear facilities, which violated the NPT. This led to suspicion that Iran might be working toward building nuclear weapons, even though it continues to deny those claims.Moreover, countries like Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United States worry that if Iran gets nuclear weapons, it could lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and, consequentially, more instability in the already turmoiled region.The US and its allies also see Iran as a threat because of its support for groups like Hezbollah and its opposition to Western influence in the region. Giving Iran access to nuclear weapons could make it harder to contain its regional power.The 2015 nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was an agreement between Iran and six world powers—the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, and Germany—aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons.Under the deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear programme by reducing its stockpile of enriched uranium, cutting the number of centrifuges, and allowing regular inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).In return, international sanctions on Iran were lifted, helping its economy and giving it access to global markets. However, in 2018, US President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal and reinstated sanctions, after which Iran began breaching some of the agreement’s terms.Since the United States left the nuclear agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018 and brought back sanctions, Iran has responded by not following key parts of the deal.It has set up thousands of advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium, which the JCPOA had banned. To make nuclear weapons, uranium needs to be enriched to 90 per cent purity. Under the JCPOA, Iran was only allowed to keep up to 300kg of uranium enriched to 3.67 per cent , which is suitable for peaceful uses like energy and research.However, by March 2025, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Iran had around 275kg of uranium enriched to 60 per cent. If enriched further, that amount could possibly be enough to make about six nuclear weapons. US officials believe Iran could produce enough material for one bomb in roughly a week, but actually making a usable weapon might take between one year and 18 months. Some experts believe Iran could put together a basic nuclear device in six months or even less.Before the 2015 nuclear deal, the UN, US, and EU had placed tough economic sanctions on Iran, suspecting it was trying to build a nuclear bomb. These sanctions blocked Iran from selling oil internationally and froze about $100 billion of its assets. This caused a deep recession and rising inflation in Iran.In 2015, Iran and six world powers (US, UK, France, China, Russia, and Germany) agreed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which limited Iran’s nuclear activities and allowed international inspections. In return, the sanctions were lifted. The deal was supposed to last up to 15 years.However, when Donald Trump became US president in 2018, he pulled the US out of the agreement. He called it a ""bad deal"" because it wasn’t permanent and didn’t cover Iran’s missile programme. He re-imposed US sanctions as part of a “maximum pressure” strategy to push Iran into a new deal. Trump’s move was also supported by US allies like Israel, which claimed Iran was secretly continuing its nuclear programme and could use the money from sanctions relief to boost its military.The US, under President Donald Trump, is aiming to reach a new deal with Iran that goes beyond the 2015 nuclear agreement. Trump wants to prove he can negotiate a “better” deal, one that not only limits Iran’s nuclear programme more strictly but also addresses issues like ballistic missiles and regional influence.The goal is to ease tensions in the Middle East, especially between Iran and Israel, and prevent a wider conflict. Israel, meanwhile, remains deeply suspicious of Iran and wants any future agreement to fully eliminate Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons. ""The deal with Iran is acceptable only if the nuclear sites are destroyed under US supervision,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said this week. ""Otherwise, the military option is the only choice.""Both sides are approaching talks cautiously, given the deep mistrust after the US pulled out of the original JCPOA and imposed harsh sanctions on Iran.But what’s at Stake?The future of the original 2015 nuclear deal is hanging by a thread, especially with its strictest limits set to expire soon. If the agreement collapses completely, Iran could move closer to developing a nuclear weapon—raising fears of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.This poses a direct threat to Israel and could destabilize the region further. There's also concern that Iran might share its nuclear know-how with militant or terrorist groups, intensifying global security risks. The outcome of ongoing talks could determine whether diplomacy prevails or tensions spiral toward conflict.While the US may offer sanctions relief to help revive Iran’s battered economy, Tehran is unlikely to give up its nuclear programme altogether. Since the US exit from the 2015 deal, Iran has expanded its uranium stockpile significantly, enriching some of it up to 60 per cent —just a short technical step from weapons-grade.One thing it won't do is give up its programme entirely. That makes the proposal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of a so-called Libyan solution - ""you go in, blow up the facilities, dismantle all the equipment, under American supervision, American execution"" - unworkable, the news agency Associated Press reported.Iranians including Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have held up what ultimately happened to the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi , who was killed with his own gun by rebels in the country's 2011 Arab Spring uprising, as a warning about what can happen when you trust the United States.","US President Donald Trump announced on Monday, April 7, 2025, that Washington and Tehran would begin talks over Iran's nuclear programme in Oman. Oman has acted as a mediator between the West and Tehran in the past. The two countries met in Muscat on Saturday, April 12, to explore the possibility of a new nuclear agreement.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120247990,imgsize-1543671,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-49.jpg"

After a series of delays earlier in the week, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket finally lifted off from Kennedy Space Center ’s Pad 39A at 8:53 pm on Saturday. The rocket was carrying 21 starlink satellites into orbit, with 13 of them equipped with direct to cell capabilities, which is designed to enhance mobile connectivity.While there was no official explanation for the delay, the liftoff was a thrilling sight for many viewers. Depending on their location, spectators watched as the rocket flew either over, under, or right in front of the full moon, which was visible in the eastern sky. It was a spectacular display for those in the Space Coast area, Florida.This particular launch marked the 10th flight for the Falcon 9's first-stage booster, which had already seen action in several previous missions, including four starlink missions, Nasa Crew-8, and others, reported Florida Today.Despite some expecting sonic booms in central Florida, the booster successfully landed on the drone ship ""A Shortfall of Gravitas"" about eight-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, as it made its way back to the Atlantic Ocean.Looking ahead, SpaceX is preparing for another launch from Cape Canaveral on Sunday, April 13, for another batch of Starlink satellites.","SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Kennedy Space Center at 8:53 pm.

Two faculty organisations at Harvard University filed a lawsuit on Friday against the Trump administration, claiming it is violating constitutional rights by threatening to cut billions in federal funding .The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and its Harvard chapter are challenging the administration’s decision to review nearly $9 billion in federal funds given to the university over alleged antisemitism on its campus, reported New York Times.The lawsuit, filed in the US district court in Massachusetts, argues that the move undermines free speech and academic freedom protected under the first amendment. The groups have also requested a temporary restraining order to prevent any immediate withdrawal of funds.“This is an unlawful misuse of federal authority,” the lawsuit says. The professors argue that the government is using funding as a tool to punish institutions that do not align with president Trump’s views.The White House has not responded to the lawsuit or given further comments. Earlier, the administration accused Harvard of not doing enough to stop antisemitic incidents on campus. It claimed that the university had failed to protect its students and faculty.Alan Garber, Harvard’s current president, has acknowledged the concern around antisemitism and said the university has worked hard to address it over the past 15 months. However, no official comment has been made by Harvard regarding the lawsuit.Andrew Manuel Crespo, a Harvard law professor and counsel for the faculty group, said that the government’s actions are an attempt to limit academic speech. ""Harvard faculty have the constitutional right to speak, teach and conduct research without fearing that the government will retaliate against their viewpoints by canceling grants,"" Crespo said.","American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and its Harvard chapter are challenging the administration’s decision to review nearly $9 billion in federal funds given to the university.

"FEMA: FEMA staff face lie detector tests amid DHS leak probe, fears of agency overhaul",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fema-staff-face-lie-detector-tests-amid-dhs-leak-probe-fears-of-agency-overhaul/articleshow/120242080.cms,"File photo: US homeland security secretary Kristi Noem (Picture credit: AP)

Dozens of staffers at the US Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ), including acting administrator Cameron Hamilton , have recently undergone lie detector tests as part of a widening department of homeland security ( DHS ) crackdown on alleged leaks of national security information, according to CNN.The polygraphs, roughly 50 administered in total, are part of a push by the Trump administration to trace leaks, some of which allegedly revealed internal discussions on plans to dismantle FEMA itself.According to CNN, Hamilton was tested just days after attending a high-level closed-door meeting with homeland security secretary Kristi Noem and Trump ally Corey Lewandowski about FEMA’s future, including options for scaling back or dissolving the disaster agency altogether.At least one FEMA official was reportedly placed on administrative leave and escorted out of agency offices following a failed polygraph, as per sources cited by CNN.However, the move has sparked alarm among federal employees and whistleblower advocates, who argue the polygraphs are being used to suppress dissent and target those not even involved with classified material.“These employees had no access to classified information,” one FEMA official was cited by CNN. “This is a witch hunt. They are trying to get rid of people and incite fear”, official added.As per The Mirror, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin defended the polygraphs, saying, “We are agnostic about your standing, tenure, political appointment, or status as a career civil servant, we will track down leakers and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law.”McLaughlin confirmed some employees failed the test and may face criminal referrals, but emphasized that Hamilton had cleared his exam and remains in his post.The use of polygraphs, particularly for those handling mostly non-classified material, has raised questions about legality and due process. Tom Devine of the Government Accountability Project was cited by CNN saying the number of tests was “alarming,” noting, “What used to be a sensitive, carefully considered high-risk decision is now a knee-jerk reaction.”The polygraph sweep comes amid a broader effort by the Trump administration to overhaul or possibly eliminate FEMA, with secretary Noem reportedly determined to gut the agency, according to The Mirror.Meetings last month involved discussions about reversing an executive order that created the FEMA Review Council, a move that could open the door to dismantling the agency entirely.Morale within FEMA is said to be collapsing. Multiple staffers are considering voluntary separation or early retirement following new hiring restrictions and a Deferred Resignation Program that offers buyouts. “You have the potential for a ton of institutional knowledge to walk out the door,” said one official. “And then you have a double whammy if you don’t have enough manpower to meet the mission”, official added.The reported turmoil comes just weeks before the hurricane season begins. According to CNN, critical preparations were delayed this year as DHS-imposed reviews disrupted planning timelines. “March is typically when we’re finalizing hurricane plans. A lot of that got paused,” one disaster response worker said.A DHS hiring memo outlined a new policy requiring most of FEMA’s temporary workforce, including CORE staff, Reservists, and Local Hires, to be reapproved by Noem’s team. These workers, many in two- to four-year terms, make up nearly three-quarters of FEMA’s operational force, per the Government Accountability Office.“They are the backbone of the response,” a FEMA official said. “Instead of prepping for storms, we’re checking renewal dates and justifying our jobs”, official added.With growing fears that FEMA could be sidelined ahead of a potentially destructive storm season, one official warned, “We won’t really feel the consequences until something big and bad happens.”","Dozens of staffers at the US Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) have recently undergone lie detector tests.

Nearly 300 Delta Air Lines passengers arriving from Mexico endured an ordeal that turned a routine journey into a 20-hour travel nightmare after bad weather forced two international flights to divert to an airport unequipped to handle customs processing.According to The New York Post, Delta flights from Mexico City and Cabo San Lucas were both rerouted late Thursday night to Montgomery Regional Airport in Alabama after severe storms triggered a ground stop at their original destination, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport .However, Montgomery lacks a Customs and Border Protection facility, leaving passengers stuck onboard the aircrafts overnight.“It was supposed to be three-and-a-half hours, it turned out to be almost 20 hours,” said passenger Alex Alvarez to 11Alive. “Bad weather, we understand that. But things just kept piling up”, Alvarez added.Both flights landed around 10:30 pm (local time) and passengers were not allowed to deplane until after 5 am Friday. Even then, they were confined to roped-off sections inside the terminal under guard, with no formal customs clearance, according to People.com.“You are literally stuck on that airplane,” said Boston-bound passenger Lauren Forbes, who had to rebook her connection to Boston after the hours-long delay.Delta stated that ongoing lightning and storms prevented them from redirecting to nearby Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport, which does have customs and also delayed any deplaning in Montgomery.According to the Independent, flight crews had also exceeded their maximum allowed working hours, adding to the complications.Passengers were served minimal refreshments like cookies and water during the ordeal and many, including Forbes, expressed frustration over the lack of contingency plans. “I think this is just an eye-opener for maybe more substantial protocols in place,” she told Boston 25.A Delta spokesperson apologised for the incident in a statement, saying, “We sincerely apologize to our customers for this experience. We fell short of how we aspire to serve and care for our customers amid thunderstorms in the Southeast US” The airline confirmed that it has contacted affected customers and is offering full refunds for their bookings.According to The New York Post, Delta acknowledged the planes’ doors remained open throughout the tarmac delay and that passengers were eventually allowed to disembark in small groups before finally continuing on to Atlanta hours later.","Delta flights from Mexico City and Cabo San Lucas were both rerouted late Thursday night to Montgomery Regional Airport in Alabama.

Victor Perez , a 17-year-old nonverbal autistic teen with cerebral palsy who was shot nine times by police in Pocatello, Idaho, has died after being removed from life support, his family confirmed on Saturday.The teenager had been in a coma since the April 5 incident and was declared clinically brain dead on Friday, according to news agency Associated Press.Perez’s aunt, Ana Vazquez, said that the teen underwent several surgeries after the shooting, including the removal of nine bullets and an amputation of one leg, but doctors ultimately found no brain activity.The shooting occurred after police responded to a 911 call reporting that an “intoxicated man” was chasing people with a knife. The man turned out to be Victor, who was not intoxicated but staggered due to his disabilities.According to his family, he had found a kitchen knife during a family gathering and relatives were trying to take it from him.As per NBC News, officers arrived at the home and opened fire within about 12 seconds of exiting their patrol vehicles.A video recorded by a neighbor shows Victor lying in the yard before attempting to stand and stumbling toward officers while holding the knife. A chain-link fence separated him from the police when they began shooting.“Everybody was trying to tell the police, no, no,” said Vazquez. “Those four officers didn’t care. They didn’t ask what was happening, what was the situation”, she added.“How’s he going to jump the fence when he can barely walk?” she further asked.Victor’s death has sparked outrage across the Pocatello community, with protests already underway and a vigil held Saturday morning outside the hospital where he was treated.Pocatello Police chief Roger Schei said the officers issued commands for Victor to drop the knife and described the situation as one where “officers had to make a split-second decision.”However, the rapid escalation and use of lethal force without apparent de-escalation efforts have drawn widespread criticism.Pocatello Mayor Brian Blad released a statement expressing condolences, stating, “We recognize the pain and grief this incident has caused in our community.” He also emphasized that “criminal, external, and internal investigations” are underway and that the city is treating the matter with “the seriousness and thoroughness it deserves”.The Eastern Idaho Critical Incident Task Force is conducting the external review, and Bannock County Prosecutor Ian Johnson confirmed that once the investigation is complete, the report will be reviewed by an agency outside the county to ensure objectivity.The four officers involved remain on administrative leave. Their names have not been released.Victor’s family and advocates are now calling for justice and a broader re-examination of police response tactics involving individuals with disabilities.","Victor Perez, 17, a nonverbal autistic teen with cerebral palsy who was shot nine times by police in Pocatello, Idaho, has died after being removed from life support.

Poll Do you believe that Pakistan is adequately prepared for earthquakes? No Yes

A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.Tremors were felt across many parts of the Valley, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or property damage. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometres, with coordinates of 33.63 degrees North latitude and 72.46 degrees East longitude.According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the recent earthquake struck at a shallow depth of 10km, increasing the likelihood of aftershocks.Shallow earthquakes are typically more dangerous than deeper ones because the seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface, causing stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and higher casualties.Pakistan, located on the boundary of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, is one of the most seismically active countries. The nation frequently experiences destructive earthquakes due to its position on major fault lines. Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and Gilgit-Baltistan lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir are on the north-western edge of the Indian plate. The collision of these plates makes the region highly susceptible to violent earthquakes.Earlier, Pakistan’s neighbor Tajikistan was also jolted by a 4.2 magnitude earthquake.","A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.

Poll Should the Pakistani military have a role in politics? No, it undermines democracy. Yes, they provide stability.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political landscape remains a battleground of competing forces, with the military, former prime minister Imran Khan, and the current govt under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif locked in a tense struggle.The interplay of US foreign policy and the Pakistani diaspora’s growing voice adds further complexity to a nation grappling with economic woes, security threats and democratic erosion.Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars. Convicted on corruption and state secret charges, the cricketer-turned-politician retains a fervent base, accusing the military and Sharif’s govt of colluding with the US to orchestrate his downfall.Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) alleges widespread rigging in the Feb 2024 elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secure power through a fragile coalition. PTI supporters, galvanised by Khan’s claims, have staged protests, clashing with the security forces and deepening the political divide.The military, longtime kingmaker in Pakistani politics, appears to have shifted allegiance. Once Khan’s backer in his 2018 rise, the army soured on him after policy disputes and his public criticisms of General Asim Munir, the current army chief.Analysts suggest the military now props up Sharif’s govt, a dynamic evident in legislative moves like the 2023 Pakistan Army Act amendment, which stifled dissent and empowered the armed forces. This hybrid regime – blending electoral democracy with military influence – has drawn scrutiny for undermining constitutional norms, yet the generals show no sign of relinquishing their grip.However, Shehbaz Sharif, re-elected in March 2024 as PM, faces a legitimacy crisis. His coalition, including the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and other smaller factions, struggles to address surging militant attacks, crumbling infrastructure, and an economy reliant on IMF bailouts.Sharif vows to mend ties with Washington but his govt’s dependence on military support raises questions about its autonomy. Khan’s call for an election audit, echoed in a letter to the IMF, threatens to derail these efforts as Pakistan awaits a critical loan installment.The US role remains contentious. Khan’s unproven claims of a Washington-led conspiracy resonate with a populace wary of foreign interference, a sentiment rooted in decades of strained relations. The Biden administration, while engaging Sharif’s govt, has maintained robust military ties with Pakistan, prioritising counter-terrorism over democratic concerns. This ambivalence has fuelled Khan’s narrative, even as US officials dismiss his allegations.Meanwhile, the Pakistani diaspora, particularly in the US, has emerged as a vocal force. Pro-democracy activists, many aligned with PTI, have lobbied Congress, securing bipartisan support for resolutions condemning elections irregularities and Khan’s detention. Over 100 lawmakers have urged his release, while some advocate sanctions against military leaders like Munir. This diaspora-driven pressure marks a shift, challenging the traditional US-Pakistan security nexus.As Pakistan teeters between chaos and stability, the military’s shadow looms large, Khan’s defiance endures, and Sharif’s govt navigates a treacherous path. With the US and Pakistani diaspora adding external weight, the nation’s democratic future hangs in the balance.","Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars.

Poll Do you support the call for a long march by Sardar Akhtar Mengal? No, I do not support it. Yes, I support it.

ISLAMABAD: A tense standoff unfolded across Balochistan on Monday as a shutter-down strike and widespread road blockades sparked by nationalist leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal ’s call for a “long march” from Lakpass to Quetta paralysed the Pakistani province.The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists, including women leaders of Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC), amid escalating clashes with authorities.Shops businesses and schools remained closed in cities like Quetta, Kalat, Mastung Khuzdar, and Gwadar. Mengal’s supporters blocked key highways, including the Quetta-Karachi national highway.The provincial govt’s deployment of containers, trenches, and police checkpoints at Lakpass, roughly 30 km from Quetta, stalled the march, forcing demonstrators onto rugged mountain routes.Reports of police using teargas and shelling BNP-M workers have intensified the unrest.Mengal, addressing a sit-in at Lakpass, accused the state of oppression and vowed to press forward. “The state may crush us, but we won’t bow,” he declared, signalling plans to escalate the march into province-wide resistance. The protest began March 28 in Wadh, Mengal’s hometown, following the arrest of BYC leaders, including Mahrang Baloch, during a crackdown on their Quetta sit-in. A suicide bombing near the rally on March 29 left Mengal unharmed but underscored the volatile stakes.Balochistan’s govt, led by chief minister Sarfraz Bugti, has taken a hard line. His spokesperson, Shahid Rind, warned Mengal of arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Act if the march entered Quetta’s Red Zone.Negotiations have faltered, with Mengal dismissing the provincial govt’s delegations as powerless to meet demands. BYC, however, rallied behind Mengal, urging highway blockades and strikes to amplify pressure.Analysts see it as a critical juncture for Balochistan, where grievances over state repression, enforced disappearances and resource exploitation fuel dissent.

Ice stupas

Harvest seasons multiply

HUSSAINABAD: At the foot of Pakistan's impossibly high mountains whitened by frost all year round, farmers grappling with a lack of water have created their own ice towers.Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan, a remote region home to K2, the world's second-highest peak.Farmers in the Skardu valley, at an altitude of up to 2,600 metres (8,200 feet) in the shadow of the Karakoram mountain range, searched online for help in how to irrigate their apple and apricot orchards.""We discovered artificial glaciers on YouTube,"" Ghulam Haider Hashmi told AFP.They watched the videos of Sonam Wangchuk , an environmental activist and engineer in the Indian region of Ladakh, less than 200 kilometres away across a heavily patrolled border, who developed the technique about 10 years ago.Water is piped from streams into the village, and sprayed into the air during the freezing winter temperatures.""The water must be propelled so that it freezes in the air when temperatures drop below zero, creating ice towers,"" said Zakir Hussain Zakir, a professor at the University of Baltistan.The ice forms in the shape of cones that resemble Buddhist stupas, and act as a storage system -- steadily melting throughout spring when temperatures rise.Gilgit-Baltistan has 13,000 glaciers -- more than any other country on Earth outside the polar regions.Their beauty has made the region one of the country's top tourist destinations -- towering peaks loom over the Old Silk Road, still visible from a highway transporting tourists between cherry orchards, glaciers and ice-blue lakes.Sher Muhammad, a specialist in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan mountain range that stretches from Afghanistan to Myanmar, however said most of the region's water supply comes from snow melt in spring, with a fraction from annual glacial melt in summers.""From late October until early April, we were receiving heavy snowfall. But in the past few years, it's quite dry,"" Muhammad, a researcher at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), told AFP.The first ""ice stupas"" in Gilgit-Baltistan were created in 2018.Now, more than 20 villages make them every winter, and ""more than 16,000 residents have access to water without having to build reservoirs or tanks"", said Rashid-ud-Din, provincial head of GLOF-2, a UN-Pakistan plan to adapt to the effects of climate change.Farmer Muhammad Raza told AFP that eight stupas were built in his village of Hussainabad this winter, trapping approximately 20 million litres of water in the ice.""We no longer have water shortages during planting,"" he said, since the open-air reservoirs appeared on the slopes of the valley.""Before, we had to wait for the glaciers to melt in June to get water, but the stupas saved our fields,"" said Ali Kazim, also a farmer in the valley.Before the stupas, ""we planted our crops in May"", said 26-year-old Bashir Ahmed who grows potatoes, wheat and barley in nearby Pari village which has also adopted the method.And ""we only had one growing season, whereas now we can plant two or three times"" a year.Temperatures in Pakistan rose twice as fast between 1981 and 2005 compared to the global average, putting the country on the front line of climate change impacts, including water scarcity.Its 240 million inhabitants live in a territory that is 80 percent arid or semi-arid and depends on rivers and streams originating in neighbouring countries for more than three-quarters of its water.Glaciers are melting rapidly in Pakistan and across the world, with a few exceptions including the Karakoram mountain range, increasing the risk of flooding and reducing water supply over the long term.""Faced with climate change, there are neither rich nor poor, neither urban nor rural; the whole world has become vulnerable,"" said 24-year-old Yasir Parvi.""In our village, with the ice stupas, we decided to take a chance.""","Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan. More than 20 villages make the ice stupas every winter, which provides 16,000 residents access to water. Water is piped from streams into the village and sprayed into the air during the freezing winter temperatures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120037712,imgsize-1455365,width-400,resizemode-4/article-15.jpg"

Poll Do you believe the rise in militant attacks in Pakistan is primarily due to the influence of groups based in Afghanistan? No, not at all Yes, definitely

Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim. It said that the Taliban provided support to the TTP and that some attacks were launched from Afghan territory.As a consequence, the Pakistani government has urged the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan to act against the allegedly responsible criminals. Kabul, on the other hand, denies that the militants are in Afghanistan.","Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.The operation, in Katlang, a remote hilltop area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was aimed at militant hideouts and resulted in the deaths of 12 suspected terrorists.

'Police have swiftly moved to take action,' says Yunus

At least 72 people were arrested across Bangladesh on Wednesday for their involvement in vandalism and looting during large-scale anti-Israel protests held earlier this week, reports Dhaka Tribune.Demonstrations erupted in multiple cities, including the capital Dhaka, on Monday as thousands took to the streets to condemn Israel’s continued military actions in Gaza. Protesters from various political, social, religious, cultural, and professional organisations joined forces in what organisers described as part of a global movement supporting Palestinians.However, the protests turned violent when, in cities like Bogra, Sylhet, Cox’s Bazar and others, mobs vandalised shops and businesses, with some targeting outlets perceived to have ties to Israel. Businesses such as Bata, KFC and Pizza Hut came under attack as demonstrators called for a boycott of Israeli-affiliated products.The rallies saw widespread student participation, with many skipping classes and exams to march in solidarity. Protesters waved Palestinian flags, held up placards, and set ablaze an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Chants denouncing American backing for Israel and frustration over the inaction of international bodies like the United Nations, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and Arab League echoed through the streets.However, while many gatherings remained peaceful, some turned violent, leading to incidents of property damage and theft.Bangladesh's interim chief advisor Muhammad Yunus addressed the unrest in a statement posted on X. “Bangladesh police have swiftly moved to take action over the violent and unlawful events that unfolded during the Pro-Gaza protests in several cities on Monday,” he wrote. “These attacks and acts of vandalism are an affront to public safety and the rule of law.”He further confirmed that at least 60 individuals had initially been arrested.In an earlier X post on Monday, Yunus strongly condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza: “The Government of Bangladesh expresses its strongest condemnation of the Israeli Occupying Forces’ continued mass killing and gross violations of human rights in the Gaza Strip.”He referred to the situation as a “human catastrophe,” noting that Israel’s breach of ceasefire agreements had led to the deaths of scores of Palestinians—many of them women and children—while also blocking humanitarian aid.According to Gaza’s health ministry, since October 7, 2023, over 50,000 people have been killed and at least 115,000 injured as a result of the ongoing conflict. Ceasefire efforts have repeatedly failed, with both sides accusing each other of violations despite mounting international pressure.","At least 72 people were arrested across Bangladesh on Wednesday for their involvement in vandalism and looting during large-scale anti-Israel protests.

Optimism laced with caution appears to be the prevailing sentiment across Bangladeshi news media following the landmark meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh , Muhammad Yunus. This comes at a time when there is no-real consensus about what exactly transpired in the meeting. The account provided by Yunus’s press secretary, Shafiqul Alam—particularly regarding Sheikh Hasina—has been contested by Indian sources.Significantly, this was the first summit-level meeting between the two nations since the coup of August 5, 2024, which ousted Sheikh Hasina ’s government. Tensions had escalated in recent months between the neighbours who are bounded by deep historical ties. Most prominent news outlets in Bangladesh described the meeting, held on the sidelines of Bimstec in Bangkok, as a much-needed ice-breaker.went a step further, declaring it a diplomatic victory for Bangladesh. The paper emphasized that for eight months India had avoided high-level interactions with Dhaka and insisted that any talks must exclude discussions on Hasina. Therefore, the fact that a 40-minute meeting occurred in a third country was, in their view, a breakthrough. Another daily,said that getting this meeting done only adds to the aura of Nobel winning economist Muhammad Yunus.The 'sources' in India particularly took exception to remarks made by Yunus' press secretary Alam in a Facebook post, describing the claims made about the Bangkok meeting as 'mischievous' and 'politically motivated'. Alam alleged that Yunus requested Hasina’s extradition and that Modi’s response was 'not negative'. He even claimed Modi said, 'Regardless of what was actually said, the idea that Yunus directly brought up Hasina’s extradition dominated headlines on Saturday and became a recurring theme in Sunday’s editorials. It earned Yunus praise across media outlets of various ideological stripes. However, a caveat was frequently added: Hasina remains a potential stumbling block in the normalization of Indo-Bangla relations.featured a detailed front-page story quoting various foreign policy voices. The article began with the assertion that no real improvement in ties was possible without Hasina’s extradition. Former Dhaka University professor Shahiduzzaman warned of a long-drawn process, predicting that India would not hand over Hasina, while Bangladesh would refuse to honor what he called 'biased treaties' signed by her. He advocated exploring new trade relationships, including with Pakistan.In contrast, former envoy Mashfee Shams struck a more measured tone, expressing hope that relations could move beyond the Hasina factor. M Jashim Uddin, Director of the Centre for Peace Studies at North South University, described the meeting as a diplomatic win, arguing that India was forced to acknowledge Yunus's legitimacy.asserted that India was waiting for the next election to take a definitive stance regarding Bangladesh and that was hampering the normal flow of relationship. Dubbing the meeting as a diplomatic win, it hoped that India treats Bangladesh as an equal and claimed Yunus had clearly conveyed this expectation., the most famous newspaper of the country in its editorial rued the fact that there was no real discussion about pending water agreement and said that constant engagement is the need of the hour and one or two meetings wouldn't break the deadlock. It urged India to prevent ousted PM Hasina , currently living in New Delhi from giving controversial remarks. Fairness, equality and brotherhood need to be the cornerstone of the relationship between two countries, the editorial underlined.On the issue of India’s demand for an 'inclusive election'—a veiled suggestion that Awami League should be part of the process—questioned India’s earlier silence when Hasina allegedly bulldozed the opposition to secure repeated victories. A front-page analysis on Sunday lamented that the visa issue—especially India’s drastic reduction in issuance to Bangladeshis—was overlooked. The article also noted that China had indirectly featured in the talks, with Modi reportedly indicating that he would not welcome a “third wheel” in the relationship.suggested that Yunus’s recent China visit may have paved the way for this summit. During that trip, Yunus reportedly described India’s North East as landlocked and dependent on Bangladesh, calling Bangladesh the “only guardian of the ocean”—remarks that sent shockwaves in India. Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma called the comments 'offensive' and warned against 'longstanding agendas,' emphasizing infrastructure development in the Chicken’s Neck region. In a thinly veiled statement before his Thailand departure, PM Modi described North East India as 'integral to BIMSTEC,' widely interpreted as a message to Yunus.Bangladeshi dailybelieves that India as the bigger partner had the responsibility of creating a working relationship but it was Bangladesh which took the lead. In a laudatory tone, it claims that Mohammad Younus has raised all the contentious issues and has made it clear to India that the days of flexing arm is over. Another newspaper,also harped on the theme of equality and fairness for lasting friendship between two countries.One tangible way to bolster friendship, according to Farid Hossain—former Minister (Press) at the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi—would be for India to resume regular visa services. Speaking to, Hossain said that the Modi-Yunus meeting had generated a positive media buzz and was welcomed by many politicians in Bangladesh. However, he noted that Hasina’s extradition was unlikely in the near term and not something the general public expected soon. Instead, progress on trade normalization and the Teesta water issue would help marginalize hardliners. Farid also played down the possibility of Bangladesh not obeying existing treaties.He concluded by saying that while social media may always lean toward extreme views, calm diplomacy and mutual respect were necessary to restore normalcy in bilateral ties. And in his view, the Modi-Yunus meeting—with its honest exchanges—was just the beginning.","First summit-level meeting between the two nations since the coup of August 5, 2024, which ousted Sheikh Hasina ’s government.

Man who fought with Maoists to end monarchy is now commander of people who want it back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/man-who-fought-with-maoists-to-end-monarchy-is-now-commander-of-people-who-want-it-back/articleshow/120066259.cms,"Durga Prasai, the healthcare baron.

Durga Prasai was once a Maoist ally.

KATHMANDU: The man who once smuggled armed Maoists in milk vans through Nepal’s eastern flatlands is now a fugitive “hiding in India” — his black SUV abandoned in a village ditch just 20-odd km from the border. Durga Prasai , the healthcare baron who financed rebels and established hospitals, is now broadcasting his fury from hiding, his voice ringing through TikTok videos, Instagram reels, and bootleg YouTube clips.Two decades ago, he backed a 10-year civil war that killed over 17,000 people and helped bring down the crown. Today, he’s the loudest voice calling for its return. Last month, a coalition of pro-royalist groups declared him their 'People’s Commander' — a symbolic title that capped his rapid rise from political outsider to the most visible face of Nepal’s monarchy revival. Overnight, the Maoist-turned-royalist became the de facto leader of a movement that had long lacked coherence or momentum.Born into a farming family in Terhathum in 1971, his family later migrated to Jhapa. He dropped out after Class 8 due to financial constraints. A failed buffalo-farming venture and mounting debt nudged him into politics. Initially aligning with the Nepali Congress , he later went underground with the Maoists. During the war, he provided refuge and logistics to fighters, becoming a trusted link between revolution and resources. His ties to Maoist supremo Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ deepened, and by 2017, he was influential enough to host a dinner with both Prachanda and PM K P Sharma Oli — helping unify warring factions.Then came the rupture. After being denied a parliamentary ticket and seeing his private medical college, B&C Medical College, embroiled in controversies, Prasai broke with the ruling UML. In 2022, he was expelled from the party. By early 2023, he was publicly denouncing secularism and federalism. The man who once worked to end the monarchy began to call for its restoration.“Prachanda betrayed the people, the revolution, and everything we fought for,” Prasai said recently. “He used the blood of thousands to build a personal empire. He’s the reason the country is where it is today — divided, looted, and leaderless. The politicians are corrupt. The king never looted the country. We want him back.”On March 28, he took that message to the streets. Under the banner of his ‘People’s Movement for Nation, Nationality, Religion and Culture’, Prasai led a massive pro-monarchy rally in central Kathmandu.What started as a peaceful protest devolved into chaos. Videos show Prasai’s SUV breaking through police barricades. Protesters clashed violently with security forces. Two people died. Govt offices were ransacked.By the next morning, Prasai had vanished.On Friday, his SUV was found abandoned in Jhapa, 35km by road from Panitanki, an Indian border town on Nepal’s east. Police suspect he switched vehicles and crossed into India. “He is either in the Tarai or in Indian territory,” a senior police official told myRepublica. “We’re monitoring all points.”But from hiding, Prasai has kept talking. In one video, standing beside a temple, he says: “Even a lion takes a step back before hunting — and then it pounces.” In another: “I am still in Nepal. I have no enmity with the police. I stepped back not out of fear, but to prepare for the next move.” Addressing the events at the March 28 protest, he said: “I broke through the security barricade for my own safety. It was not an act of hostility toward the police. I apologise for any harm caused to you.”He also claimed that snipers had been positioned to assassinate him. “This was not an ordinary operation,” he said. “After hearing that the PM has ordered to shoot me on sight, I took shelter in a safe place.” On Facebook, he dared the authorities: “If you have the courage, arrest me and King Gyanendra within 24 hours. Let’s see who the people stand with.”While Prasai presents himself as a moral insurgent, critics point to a chequered past. In Dec 2024, his case was transferred to the Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police for allegedly paying Rs 500,000 to hire criminal associates to issue threats to business rivals. The threats, investigators say, were made in the name of notorious Indian gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who remains incarcerated at Sabarmati Central Jail in Gujarat. Prasai denied any involvement, claiming the charges were politically motivated.Regardless, his influence has only grown. He has overshadowed traditional monarchist leaders, including those from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), spearheading the protests for years. Thousands now rally behind him, waving flags and amplifying his speeches on social media.Prachanda, leader of the opposition, has warned in parliament that the republic’s democratic gains are “under coordinated attack.” Oli — who replaced him as PM in July 2024 — has also distanced himself from his former ally. Dozens of Prasai’s aides have been arrested since the March 28 protest. A red-corner notice for his arrest is in preparation and there are rumours that he will be charged with sedition.Yet among many frustrated Nepalis, Prasai’s message lands hard. Fourteen govts in 17 years, rising prices, youth emigration, a failing healthcare system — all have left the republic discredited in the eyes of millions. Whether Prasai can ride that sentiment into real political change remains uncertain.","Durga Prasai once smuggled armed Maoists in milk vans through Nepal’s eastern flatlands.

UK Parliament meets on rare Saturday to rescue Scunthorpe steel plant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-parliament-meets-on-rare-saturday-to-rescue-scunthorpe-steel-plant/articleshow/120231788.cms,"This screen grab from PA video shows a view of the British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire.

The strategic importance of steel

The financial strain and international factors

The political response

Historical context and steel industry decline

A pivotal moment

In an extraordinary Saturday parliamentary debate, UK lawmakers discussed a government-backed emergency bill aimed at preventing the closure of the country's last steel plant that makes steel from scratch. The Scunthorpe plant, owned by Chinese firm Jingye , has been struggling financially and is at risk of shutting down, potentially decimating what remains of the UK’s steel industry.Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s administration is now poised to ""take control"" of the facility to keep the blast furnaces running. A vote later on Saturday was expected to pass the emergency legislation , which would allow the government to take over operations at the Scunthorpe plant, which employs around 2,700 workers and produces steel vital for industries like construction and rail transport.The government has framed the potential closure of the plant as a significant threat to the UK's long-term economic security, highlighting the importance of steel for both industrial strength and national security. Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, speaking in parliament, emphasized steel’s role in shaping the UK's global position:“Steel is fundamental to Britain's industrial strength, to our security and to our identity as a primary global power,” Reynolds told MPs. “Today's legislation will help ensure that we can retain that steel-making capability here in the UK, both now and for years to come.""In response to mounting concerns over the plant’s fate, Reynolds suggested that nationalization remains a ""likely option"" but clarified that the immediate aim of the legislation is not to transfer ownership. ""This bill does not transfer ownership to the government,"" Reynolds explained, noting that any discussions on full nationalization would come at a later stage.Jingye, which purchased British Steel in 2020, has invested over £1.2 billion into the plant but is losing approximately £700,000 per day. The company has stated that the Scunthorpe facility is no longer financially viable under its current operations. However, the Chinese owners are proposing to continue the plant’s operations by importing slab steel from China—an arrangement which the UK government has rejected, citing concerns over the loss of vital domestic steel production capabilities.Reynolds further criticized Jingye's handling of negotiations, revealing that the company had offered a counterproposal involving the transfer of hundreds of millions of pounds, without any safeguards that would ensure the future of the plant in the UK. ""They also refused a condition to keep the blast furnaces maintained and in good working order,"" Reynolds said, making it clear that the government’s priority was ensuring that British Steel remained operational on British soil.The government’s intervention has drawn mixed reactions. Labour MP Lucy Powell emphasized the urgency of the situation: “Members of parliament are meeting in these special circumstances because the government needs to act decisively.” Meanwhile, the opposition Conservative Party has criticized the handling of the issue, particularly the government's negotiations with Jingye. Some Labour MPs have called for the government to fully nationalize the plant to safeguard its future.In response to mounting pressure, Reynolds confirmed that the emergency legislation would include criminal sanctions for executives who fail to comply with government orders to maintain operations. The 10-page bill gives the government the authority to instruct steel companies to keep assets running and take over operations if necessary, while also establishing a compensation scheme for any costs incurred during this process.The Scunthorpe plant represents the last virgin steel facility in the UK, capable of producing steel from raw materials rather than recycled scrap. The decline of Britain’s steel industry has been years in the making, with major plants, including Tata Steel ’s Port Talbot, shutting down their blast furnaces in recent years. The Scunthorpe facility's troubles have been exacerbated by fierce competition from cheaper steel imports, particularly from Asia, and the US tariffs imposed during Donald Trump’s presidency, which British Steel has cited as a contributing factor.The UK steel industry has a storied history dating back to the Industrial Revolution but has seen significant contraction over the past few decades. At its peak in the 1960s, the industry employed nearly 270,000 people. After a series of privatisations and takeovers, the plant was eventually bought by Jingye in 2021. Its future now hangs in the balance as the government takes unprecedented steps to secure jobs and the strategic capability of steel production in the UK .Saturday’s emergency debate marked the first time in several years that Parliament has convened on a Saturday, underlining the gravity of the situation. The last Saturday sitting of Parliament occurred in October 2019 during the Brexit deal debate, and before that, MPs met on a Saturday only once during the Falklands War in 1982. The stakes are high, and with a key vote scheduled for later, the government’s handling of British Steel’s fate could shape the future of the UK’s industrial sector.As MPs debate the future of the Scunthorpe plant, the nation watches closely, with both political and economic implications of the decision stretching far beyond the factory gates.","UK lawmakers discuss emergency bill aimed at preventing closure of country's last steel plant.

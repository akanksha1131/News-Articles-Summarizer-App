Long before he said he would stop the Ukraine war within a day of becoming president, Trump said he would get Dr Shakil Afridi out of prison in two minutes: ""I would tell them, 'let him out,' and I'm sure they would let him out. ""But nine years and some months after Trump's boast, Afridi, the CIA eye who helped US hunt down Osama bin Laden , remains in a Pakistani jail. Did Trump forget to tell the Pakistanis, or did they refuse to humour him?The answer can shed some light on his baffling flip-flop relationship with Pakistan It's baffling because Trump's original attitude towards Pakistan left no room for a relationship at all. ""Get it straight: Pakistan is not our friend,"" he tweeted in December 2011. And again in Jan 2012, before asking in June that year, ""When will Pakistan apologise to us for providing safe sanctuary to Osama bin Laden for 6 years?! Some 'ally'.""Pakistan has never apologised, but within five months of Op Sindoor, PM Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir have wormed their way into Trump's good books by dangling before him goodies like a Nobel nomination, a rumour of oil, and a box of rocks.The latest from our neighbours is that they have delivered a batch of ""enriched rare earth elements and critical minerals"" to a firm in the Midwestern state of Missouri.They should have said ""sample"" because there's no way sea freight will reach Missouri from Pakistan in less than a month - the MoU was signed only on Sept 8. More than these, what's softened Trump to putty is fulsome praise. Munir recently claimed Trump saved ""millions and millions of lives"" through his alleged intervention in Op Sindoor.But go a long, long way back, like 40 years, when Trump wasn't 40 yet, and only once married.He already had a dim view of Pakistan as a prospective rogue nuclear state, and to pre-empt that, he told Ron Rosenbaum this in a 1985 interview: ""You start off telling them, 'Let's get rid of it.' If that doesn't work you then start cutting off aid. And more aid and then more. You do whatever is necessary so these people will have riots in the street, so they can't get water. So they can't get Band-Aids, so they can't get food. ""Yet, after railing for Decemberades, late in 2017 he had a change of heart: ""Starting to develop a much better relationship with Pakistan and its leaders.""But just two months later, he changed his mind: ""The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & Decembereit, thinking of our leaders as fools.""Also: ""We paid Pakistan Billions of Dollars & they never told us he (Osama) was living there...We no longer pay Pakistan the $Billions because they would take our money and do nothing for us, Bin Laden being a prime example, Afghanistan being another.""If the past five months are a sign, Trump seems to have got over his old mistrust of Pakistan completely. Heck, he's practically kissed them with a 19% tariff. Whether this relationship is of the blood-is-thicker-than-water type, or of the oil-is-thicker-than-blood type, time will tell, but with Afridi still in jail, it's a fair bet that Sharif-Munir is stringing Trump along.How's that? Maybe they take him for one of their own. There was that old conspiracy theory about him being a local boy, remember? According to Pakistani channel Neo News, Trump was born Dawood Ibrahim Khan in Waziristan, in 1946, and brought to US in 1955 after his parents' death in a car crash.If only it were true, it would explain so much. For instance, the liberties Pakistan takes with readouts of its Trump meetings. It claimed in December 2016 that Trump had told then PM Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz's elder brother: ""You have a very good reputation. You are a terrific guy"", and Pakistan is a ""fantastic country, fantastic place"", although the US version said nothing of the kind.After last week's closed-door meeting, on which US kept mum, Pakistan claimed Trump showed ""open support of Pakistan's role in counter-terrorism and emphasised the need to further increase security and intelligence cooperation"".But it might be that Trump himself has bought into the myth of his Pakistani origin. Which would explain why he hankers for Bagram, which is 50 minutes by air from Waziristan. And isn't Pakistan the model for what he wants US to be? Army out in cities, opponents in jail, no rights worth the name, and best of all, nobody to stop him from a third - and fourth and fifth - term in office!","Trump's original attitude towards Pakistan left no room for a relationship at all.

Three scientists win Physics Nobel for work that paved way for cellphones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/three-scientists-win-physics-nobel-for-work-that-paved-way-for-cellphones/articleshow/124375320.cms,"File photo: US scientists John Clarke, Michel Devoret and John Martinis





STOCKHOLM: US-based scientists John Clarke, Michel Devoret and John Martinis won the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics for ""experiments that revealed quantum physics in action"", paving the way for the development of the next generation of digital technologies. ""There is no advanced technology today that does not rely on quantum mechanics,"" Olle Eriksson, chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics, said during the announcement of the award. The laureates' discoveries, he added, paved the way for technologies such as the cellphone, cameras and fiber optic cables.It also helped lay the groundwork for current attempts to build a quantum computer, a device that could compute and process information at speeds that would not be possible with classical computers. The three scientists were recognised for a series of experiments conducted in 1984 and 1985. They proved the existence of two quantum phenomena on a system visible to the human eye.The principles of quantum mechanics describe the strange properties and behaviours of single or small collections of elementary particles. In one such behaviour, called quantum tunnelling, a particle can move through a barrier even if it does not have enough energy to do so.Another property of subatomic particles is that they can emit and absorb energy only in fixed, discrete amounts. This is known as the quantization of energy. With a large number of particles, however, these tiny quantum effects generally become insignificant.The laureates of this year's physics prize showed, for the first time, that quantum tunneling is observable in a system they called macroscopic because it was ""big enough to get one's grubby fingers on,"" according to their paper describing the discovery. They also showed that the energy of this system was quantised, or existed at fixed levels.They made these discoveries by studying a chip with a circuit that was superconducting, meaning it was capable of conducting current with no electrical resistance. As a result, the current was ""trapped"" in a state of flow without any voltage, because it did not have enough energy to escape, according to a summary posted by the Nobel committee, as if behind a barrier that it is unable to cross. The researchers observed the current go from a state of zero voltage to one of non-zero voltage, an observation of quantum tunneling. They also observed that the system only absorbed light of certain frequencies, suggesting that its energy was 'quantised'. The three laureates will share a prize of 11 million Swedish kroner (Rs 10.4 crore).British-born Clarke is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Devoret, who was born in France, is a professor at Yale University and the University of California, Santa Barbara, also in the US, where Martinis is also a professor.Two of the three have links with Google . Martinis headed Google's Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab until 2020. Devoret, besides his professorship, is also the chief scientist of Google Quantum AI. It is the second straight year that a Nobel has been won by scientists with Google ties. The 2024 chemistry prize was awarded to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper at Google DeepMind while Geoffrey Hinton, who worked for Google for over a decade, won for physics the same year.","US-based scientists John Clarke, Michel Devoret and John Martinis won the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Eiffel Tower was almost demolished! Here’s how it was saved and survived over a century,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/eiffel-tower-was-almost-demolished-heres-how-it-was-saved-and-survived-over-a-century/articleshow/124375034.cms,"Image: Pexels

Eiffel Tower’s controversial beginnings

Engineering marvel vs. artistic criticism

Science secures survival





When the Eiffel Tower was first erected for the 1889 World’s Fair in Paris, it faced harsh criticism. Prominent artists and writers labeled it “monstrous” and “useless,” and its creator, Gustave Eiffel, initially received only a 20-year permit to occupy the land. Despite its groundbreaking engineering, many Parisians disliked the structure, fearing it would scar the city’s beauty. Yet Eiffel found a clever way to secure its survival: he transformed the tower into a hub for scientific research and communication. By installing a station at its peak for experiments and radio transmissions, he proved its practical value and ensured it would remain standing long after the World’s Fair ended.The idea for the Eiffel Tower originated in 1884 when engineers Emile Nouguier and Maurice Koechlin, working for Eiffel, envisioned an iron lattice tower. They wanted to build a vertical spectacle that would demonstrate the possibilities of modern iron construction and celebrate France’s industrial and technological achievements. After securing a patent and winning a competition for the 1889 World’s Fair centerpiece, construction began in January 1887 and concluded in March 1889.Despite its rapid completion, the project faced public backlash. A letter signed by writers, artists, and architects—including Guy de Maupassant and Charles Garnier—called the tower a “tragic street lamp” and “Tower of Babel,” reflecting fears that it would ruin Paris’ aesthetic charm.The tower’s design sparked debate over whether it represented true architecture or pure engineering. Critics objected to its exposed iron frame and massive base, while Eiffel argued that elegance could exist within engineering. Initially adorned with decorative Gothic elements, many were later removed, leaving the stark lattice structure. Over time, public opinion shifted as visitors marveled at unprecedented panoramic views of Paris from its heights, demonstrating the tower’s unique attraction.Eiffel ensured the tower’s long-term survival by dedicating its top to scientific experimentation. Atmospheric studies and other research took place at the summit, giving the tower functional value beyond mere aesthetics. In 1898, it became a radio transmission site, and by 1908, experiments transmitted signals over thousands of miles. These scientific uses proved crucial in gaining a 70-year extension on Eiffel’s permit, effectively saving the structure from demolition.","The Eiffel Tower was built for the 1889 World’s Fair in Paris.

A massive blaze gutted the beachfront home of South Carolina Circuit Court Judge Diane Goodstein on Saturday morning, leaving her ex-senator husband, Arnold Goodstein, and two other family members hospitalized.Goodstein's four-bedroom, four-bath $1,155,200 home, stretching up a three-story property on Edisto Beach, was engulfed in flames around 11.30 am as stunned neighbors looked on. Authorities have launched an investigation into the cause, while dramatic drone footage captured the inferno consuming the residence.The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) is investigating the fire, a spokesperson confirmed. Although Goodstein was not present at the time, multiple family members, including her ex-senator husband Arnold Goodstein, were at home. South Carolina Chief Justice John Kittredge stated that the fire resulted from an ""apparent explosion,"" Daily Mail reported""Judge Goodstein was walking on the beach when the fire started. Her husband, Arnie, was in the house with children and perhaps grandchildren. The family had to escape by jumping from a window or balcony. I’m told there were injuries from the fall, such as broken legs,"" Kittredge said.Of the three family members hospitalised, Arnold Goodstein is reported to have leaped from the burning building after assisting other family members to escape.""Arnie’s injuries may have been the most serious, for he was airlifted to the hospital,"" Kittredge added.He sustained multiple broken bones in his hips, legs and feet, according to reports. Another hospitalised individual is reported to be Goodstein's son, Arnold Goodstein II.Their current condition remains unclear.Kittredge mentioned that SLED chief Mark Keel stated he would stay in touch and inform if there is any evidence of arson. ""At this time, we do not know whether the fire was accidental or arson.

""She's had multiple death threats over the years,"" a judge close to Goodstein told the outlet. In early September, she was involved in a controversial case regarding whether voters' personal information in South Carolina could be handed over to the government.Goodstein issued a temporary restraining order in early September, stemming from a lawsuit challenging the South Carolina Election Commission's ability to provide voters’ data to the Department of Justice, The Gazette reported.However, the order was later overturned after a six-page opinion from the Supreme Court criticised Goodstein's process in barring the state from complying. The Supreme Court, signed by all five justices, criticised Goodstein for not detailing the damage that would occur from the release of voters' personal information, specifically that of Calhoun County voter Anne Crook, who filed the suit to prevent her information from being disclosed to the federal govt.","A massive blaze gutted the beachfront home of South Carolina Circuit Court Judge Diane Goodstein on Saturday morning.

All about the Nobel prize in physiology/medicine

Alfred Nobel had an active interest in medical research and the Physiology/Medicine award was the third prize area the inventor mentioned in his will.

A total of 114 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded since 1901; over 227 individuals have received the award between 1901-2023.

Of the 227 individuals awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 13 are women.

The youngest recipient of the prize was 31-year old Frederick G. Banting in 1923. He was recognised for the discovery of insulin.

The oldest recipient was 87-year-old Peyton Rous in 1966 for his discovery of tumour-inducing viruses.

The Nobel Prize medal in physiology and medicine was designed by Swedish sculptor and engraver Erik Lindberg and represents the Genius of Medicine holding an open book in her lap, collecting the water pouring out from a rock in order to quench a sick girl’s thirst.

The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their groundbreaking ""discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance that prevents the immune system from harming the body. ""The Nobel Assembly at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute announced the award on Monday, recognising the trio for their pioneering work that laid the foundation for understanding autoimmune diseases and opened new avenues for cancer and immunotherapy research.Their discovery understood how the immune system is kept in check. They noted that, ""the body’s powerful immune system must be regulated, or it may attack our own organs.""The Nobel Prize laureates have reshaped modern immunology and identified ""the immune system’s security guards, regulatory T cells, thus laying the foundation for a new field of research. The discoveries have also led to the development of potential medical treatments that are now being evaluated in clinical trials,"" a release stated.Their research showed that when these cells fail to function properly, the body becomes vulnerable to autoimmune diseases, where the immune system turns against itself.""The hope is to be able to treat or cure autoimmune diseases, provide more effective cancer treatments and prevent serious complications after stem cell transplants,"" it noted.The work of Brunkow and Ramsdell gained prominence in 2001 when they uncovered the genetic cause behind a specific strain of mice known as “scurfy” that were highly susceptible to autoimmune diseases.Earlier in 2024 Nobel prize in Physiology/Medicine was awarded to Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for the discovery of microRNA and its role in post-transcriptional gene regulation.Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun's groundbreaking discovery revealed a completely new principle of gene regulation that turned out to be essential for multicellular organisms, including humans.The announcement marks the beginning of Nobel Prize week, with awards in physics, chemistry, literature, peace, and economic sciences to follow.","The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to Mary E.

H-1B Visa Shock Explained: $100K Annual Fee Announced by Donald Trump





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has assured employees that the company will continue sponsoring H-1B visas and cover all related expenses, despite US President Donald Trump’s recent executive order imposing a $100,000 fee per new application, Business Insider reported on Tuesday.Huang’s message reportedly sought to calm concerns among tech workers after the order sparked widespread anxiety and uncertainty, particularly among employees from India and China, who make up a significant portion of the H-1B workforce.""As one of many immigrants at Nvidia, I know that the opportunities we've found in America have profoundly shaped our lives,"" Huang said in a message to employees, as cited by Business Insider.""And the miracle of Nvidia — built by all of you, and by brilliant colleagues around the world — would not be possible without immigration,"" he added.Huang told employees that “legal immigration remains essential to ensuring the US continues to lead in technology and ideas,” adding that the Trump administration’s “recent changes reaffirm this.”Like much of the broader chip and tech industry, Nvidia employs a large number of international workers.Huang has frequently emphasized that roughly half of the world’s AI researchers are of Chinese origin.The H-1B visa program enables US companies to hire skilled foreign professionals for specialized roles.Under Trump’s recent order, new H-1B visa holders are prohibited from entering the United States unless their sponsoring employer pays an additional $100,000 fee. The administration clarified that the rule does not affect current H-1B holders or applicants who filed before September 21.Later that month, US lawmakers pressed major companies to justify hiring thousands of foreign workers under the H-1B program while simultaneously cutting domestic jobs, as reported bty Reuters.Huang has previously expressed support for Trump’s proposal to impose a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications. Speaking on the BG2 Pod last week, Huang described the measure as “a great start,” saying the fee hike could help reshape US immigration policy, even as critics warn it could trigger brain drain and weaken America’s technological leadership.Huang acknowledged that the $100,000 fee is “quite high,” but said he believes the increase will establish a meaningful benchmark. “Probably sets the bar a little too high, but as a first bar, it at least eliminates illegal immigration and that’s a good start,” he added.","CEO Jensen Huang has assured employees that the company will continue sponsoring H-1B visas and cover all related expenses.

California: Diwali becomes state holiday; Indian American community hails move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-diwali-becomes-state-holiday-indian-american-community-hails-move/articleshow/124371931.cms,"Representative image

Why this matters & how it works



The law does not make courts close on Diwali; the holiday is excluded from judicial holidays.

Public schools and community colleges are permitted (not mandated) to close, via agreements with employee unions.

State employees can elect to take the day off with pay in recognition of Diwali, per the new amendments.

Because AB 268 was signed during a regular legislative session, in the absence of a special effective date, it will likely take effect on January 1, 2026 under California’s default rules for new statutes.





California will officially recognise Diwali as a state holiday after governor Gavin Newsom signed a new bill on October 6, joined by celebrations among Indian American communities and recognition from legislators. The law allows public schools and community colleges to close on Diwali and lets state employees take paid time off for the festival. The new Diwali law in California is the result of bipartisan backing and grassroots advocacy. The bill was co‑sponsored by Assemblymembers Darshana Patel and Ash Kalra, and supported by advocacy groups such as the Coalition of Hindus of North America. Under AB 268, schools and colleges may choose to close for Diwali, and state employees can elect to observe it with paid time off.Ash Kalra, who chairs the Assembly Judiciary Committee, took to social media to celebrate Newsom’s approval of the Diwali bill, along with several others he had authored. Highlighting the progress made, Kalra noted that nine of his bills - four of which came from the Judiciary Committee - had been signed into law within a span of a few days.“Thank you so much @CAgovernor @GavinNewsom and to my Capitol and Judiciary Committee staff who worked tirelessly all year on these important policies that are now state law! More to come!” he wrote on X.California becomes the first state on the West Coast to adopt Diwali as a recognized holiday, joining states like Pennsylvania and Connecticut that have already taken similar steps. The move was hailed by several Hindu advocacy groups and community.Assemblymember Kalra, author of the bill, stated when it passed the legislature on September 23: “Designating Diwali as an official state holiday will uplift its message to the hundreds of thousands of Californians that celebrate and help introduce it to many throughout our diverse state. Diwali brings communities together with the message of goodwill, peace, and shared sense of renewal. California should embrace Diwali and its diversity, not keep it hidden in darkness. ”Kalra, the first Indian American elected to the California Legislature, represents San José’s 25th Assembly District and has long advocated for policies that celebrate cultural diversity and inclusion.","California becomes the first state on the West Coast to adopt Diwali as a recognized holiday.

US Government Shutdown Enters Second Week: Why It Happened & Who It Impacts





Republican leaders have long braced for trouble from House Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. But now she’s doing damage from their political left.On Monday, she handed Democrats an arrow they rarely get: openly siding with what they’ve demanded to reopen the government - extending enhanced Obamacare subsidies.Greene, in a post on X, didn’t mince words. She admitted she “disliked Obamacare and even the concept of insurance as a whole,” but warned of dire consequences: letting tax credits expire would make insurance “unaffordable to many Americans - including her own adult children.”“I’m carving my own lane. And I’m absolutely disgusted that health insurance premiums will DOUBLE if the tax credits expire this year,” she declared. “Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING!!!,” she added.Her tone was part grievance, part rebellion - and part look, I told you so. Although she hasn’t explicitly demanded that Republicans concede the subsidies during the shutdown, her timing presents a serious headache for GOP messaging. Traditionally, Republicans have steered clear of committing to that extension while the government is closed, preferring to kick it down the road once the shutdown ends.By raising the issue now and publicly accusing GOP leaders of neglect, Greene lends weight to Democratic arguments that “now” is exactly when the debate must happen.On Capitol Hill, Democrats didn’t waste time leaning in. “Hold on to your hats,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer quipped from the floor. “I think this is the first time I’ve said this: Representative Greene said it perfectly. Greene is absolutely right.”GOP leadership sought to contain the blow. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters that Greene simply hadn’t been included in internal talks: “Congresswoman Greene does not serve on the committees of jurisdiction … and she’s probably not read in on some of that.”He added, “It’s implied as if this has been some sort of ignored issue. It’s not been at all … Not everyone knows everything.”Still, Greene’s comments spotlight a deeper dilemma for Republicans. Normally, using a shutdown to extract policy concessions is political poison, because Americans disapprove of gambits that hold the government hostage. But here’s the twist: the subsidies issue is unusually popular.According to a recent KFF poll, 78 per cent of Americans, including 57 per cent of MAGA-aligned Republicans, support extending the subsidies. Now a MAGA Republican is publicly behind that demand - and that undermines the GOP’s already uneasy stance.Where Greene’s intervention is most damaging is in what it suggests about GOP leadership: their inaction, her insinuation, is that they’re merely paying lip service - not treating this issue seriously. Even if Democrats don’t win this battle, Greene has tilted the terms of engagement in their favour, making them look less like the underdogs and more like protagonists in this shutdown drama.","Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said she was 'disgusted' that Obamacare subsidies would expire. She said GOP leaders had not discussed the issue with her or given her a plan. Her timing presents a serious headache for GOP messaging. According to a recent poll, 78 per cent of Americans support extending the subsidies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124371712,imgsize-1089299,width-400,resizemode-4/marjorie-taylor-greene-file-ap.jpg"
'Put travel plans on hold': H-1B visa warning issued by University of Southern California; 'Until further guidance',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/put-travel-plans-on-hold-h-1b-visa-warning-issued-by-university-of-southern-california-until-further-guidance/articleshow/124371156.cms,"University of Southern California has issued a travel warning for H-1B faculty.

H-1B Visa Shock Explained: $100K Annual Fee Announced by Donald Trump





The University of Southern California has issued a travel warning urging its faculty and staff who are on H-1B visas to defer international travel until further guidance is available on the visa issue. The university's student newspaper reported about the advisory that also urged staff outside the US to come back to the country.“Out of an abundance of caution, all faculty and staff in H-1B status currently in the U.S. should put international travel plans on hold until they receive further guidance,” the statement obtained by the outlet reads. “If possible, any faculty and staff in H-1B status who are currently outside the US are strongly recommended to return to the US before the proclamation takes effect.”The proclamation took effect from September 21 two days after Trump signed it, requiring employers to pay $100,000 fee for each new H-1B petition filed after September 21. Tech companies were in a disarray initially but it was later clarified that there was no need to rush back staff outside the country, as it won't affect existing staff. Existing H‑1B holders, as well as renewals and amendments, are exempt from the fee, and certain additional exemptions are available.“One of the primary reasons why people come here as well is because of the international reputation of the American education system,” Aisling Kelliher, an associate professor of cinematic arts at USC who came to the US on H-1B said. “It’s a huge opportunity, both to come here as an immigrant and to receive an education, and then also to be able to continue as a researcher and as a teacher within the system that you’ve learned from. ”The H-1B visa fee is now being challenged in court, as a group comprising unions, employers, and religious organisations has filed a federal lawsuit aiming to prevent the implementation of a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas for highly skilled foreign workers.","University of Southern California has issued a travel warning for H-1B faculty.

Pam Bondi goes on offensive in senate hearing: Accuses senator Blumenthal of lying; dodges Epstein questions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pam-bondi-goes-on-the-offensive-in-senate-hearing-accuses-senator-blumenthal-of-lying-dodges-epstein-questions/articleshow/124369327.cms,"Pam Bondi at the senate hearing (AP)





US attorney general Pam Bondi came under fire Tuesday during a Senate judiciary committee oversight hearing, adopting a combative stance with Democratic senators and refusing to engage with questions about the Jeffrey Epstein files. She accused Senator Richard Blumenthal of lying about his military service while deflecting probes into her former lobbying firm and other controversies.Blumenthal pressed Bondi about lobbying connections, asking, “In the merger … involving American Express GBT … I understand that Brian Ballard, longtime backer and head of the law firm where you worked, was instrumental in lobbying the Justice Department to drop that lawsuit. … What conversations did you have with Mr. Ballard?” as quoted by The Hill.In response, Bondi pivoted angrily, saying: “Senator Blumenthal, I cannot believe that you would accuse me of impropriety when you lied about your military service. You lied, you admitted you lied to be elected a US senator,” she said.“How dare you? I’m a career prosecutor. Don’t you ever challenge my integrity … Do not question my ability to be fair and impartial as attorney general, and anything [about] my former firm Ballard Partners.”Blumenthal had acknowledged in 2010 that he “misspoke” about serving in Vietnam.When the topic shifted to Epstein, Bondi repeatedly stalled and refused to engage. Senator Dick Durbin asked who ordered a justice department statement that Trump’s name was in the Epstein files.Bondi replied, “I’m not going to discuss anything about that with you.” Durbin warned: “Eventually you’re going to have to answer for your conduct in this, you won’t do it today, but eventually you will,” according to Miami Herald.Bondi remained defiant, citing partisan claims and repeatedly attacking her interrogators rather than addressing substantive questions.Throughout the hearing, Bondi defended the justice department’s approach under the Trump administration, accusing Democrats of politicizing the department. She also shifted attention toward her critics, questioning why they had not previously released Epstein files when Democrats had held majorities.She specifically invoked Reid Hoffman, a tech billionaire linked in past fundraising to Epstein, asking Democrats why they failed to disclose associated flight logs or donor ties.When Democratic senator Sheldon Whitehouse raised a question about reports alleging that Epstein possessed photos of Donald Trump with “half-naked young women,” and whether those images were part of the justice department’s Epstein files, Bondi deflected by targeting the senator instead.“Senator Whitehouse, instead of making baseless insinuations about President Trump, perhaps you should address your own political ties - especially your connections to one of Epstein’s known associates,” Bondi shot back.She employed a similar tactic when Senator Dick Durbin questioned her about a July memo from the Justice Department stating that no new information had been uncovered in the Epstein files. “I’m not going to engage on that topic,” Bondi said, sidestepping the question.Bondi then cited a claim popular among Trump-aligned supporters - MAGA, suggesting Democrats had resisted calls to release the Epstein flight logs when they held a congressional majority because individuals linked to their party might be implicated.The attorney general was in fight mode throughout the hearing, pushing back against questions related to national guard deployments in US cities and allegations of politicising the justice department.The hearing’s tensions underline the growing scrutiny over Bondi’s handling of sensitive federal investigations and her role as chief law enforcement officer under Trump.","Pam Bondi accused Senator Richard Blumenthal of lying about his military service while deflecting probes into her former lobbying firm and other controversies.

'No Change in Policy': France Assures To Offer Student Visas To 30,000 Indians Amid US H-1B Shocker





Former president Joe Biden's ex-adviser Ajay Bhutoria, the Indian-American community leader on immigration policy, said there have been instances of rampant abuses of the H-1B visa program that resulted in the desperate measure of the Donald Trump administration to impose $100,000 fee on the program.In a podcast, Bhutoria said he happened to visit one of the biggest shoemakers' unit three years ago where one IT company of India had their resources working on a large project. Bhutoria revealed that most of the people there were on B-1 visa which is meant for visitors. They were brought in to the US as visitors, where they would work for three months, won't get any salary but receive a lump sum at the end of their stay. He said he told the authorities that it was illegal but they said they were training those people which is allowed in B-1 visa but Bhutoria added that there was no training going on and people were actually working.B-1 visa is a non-immigrant US visa for people traveling temporarily for business purposes and specifically not for employment. It accommodates attending meetings, conferences or negotiations, and attending training as well.The Indian-American community leader said that now L-1 visa will be abused as H-1B is off limits for many companies. The L-1 visa is a non-immigrant US work visa that allows a company to transfer employees from one of its foreign offices to a related office (branch, parent, subsidiary, or affiliate) in the United States.""L-1 visa is a company-to-company transfer and they can't work on the client site but they violate. And now that they can't do H-1B, they will use L-1 visas,"" he said.On the issue of visa abuse, Bhutoria added that consulting firms that hoodwink people and promise them a good life in America. And these people arrive in the US, end up in a one bedroom flat with 20 people, work in Uber -- far from the life that they were promised, Bhutoria said.","Indian-American community leader predicts that now L-1 visa will be abused as companies can't use H-1B without paying the hefty $100,000 fee.

India Won't Hold Back in Operation Sindoor 2.0: Army Chief Dwivedi Sends Clear Message To Pakistan





ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Army on Saturday criticised the recent remarks made by the Indian military officers and political leaders, warning that a future conflict between the two countries might lead to a ""cataclysmic devastation"".In a statement, it also said that these ""irresponsible statements"" indicate a renewed attempt at ""fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression"" - a prospect which might ""lead to serious consequences"" for peace and stability in South Asia.A day earlier, defence minister Rajnath Singh had said India can cross any border whenever necessary to protect citizens and safeguard India's unity and integrity. Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Friday issued a stern warning to Pakistan , saying the neighbouring country should stop sponsoring terrorism on its soil if it wants to retain its place on the world map.General Dwivedi also said the restraint shown by New Delhi during Operation Sindoor would not be repeated in case of a future military conflict and urged Indian soldiers to remain poised for action.Also, chief of air staff Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Friday said that at least a dozen Pakistani military aircraft, including US-origin F-16 jets, were destroyed or damaged in Indian strikes during Operation Sindoor.In its statement, the Pakistan Army said that it noted with ""grave concern"" the ""delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements"" coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment.""In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian Defence Minister and its Army and Air Chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,"" it said.The statement said that Pakistan has established a ""new normal of response"", which will be ""swift, decisive and destructive"".It added that the armed forces of Pakistan have the capability and resolve ""to take the fight to every nook and corner of the enemy's territory"".The statement also responded to the threat of ""erasing Pakistan from the map"", saying India ""must know that if a situation comes, the erasure will be mutual"".It also said that earlier this year, the Indian attack against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war. ""...India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation,"" it added.In response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in territories controlled by Pakistan.The strikes triggered four days of intense clashes that ended with an understanding on stopping the military actions on May 10.On Thursday, defence minister Singh said any misadventure by Islamabad in the Sir Creek sector will invite a ""decisive response"" that could be strong enough to change both ""history and geography"".Sir Creek is a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Gujarat's Rann of Kutch and Pakistan and is considered a disputed region due to varying interpretations of maritime boundary lines by both sides.

A day after Pakistan 's foreign minister Ishaq Dar said that Donald Trump 's Gaza peace plan was not endorsed by Pakistan, Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President's plan calling it a ""step towards ending bloodshed.""In a social media post on X, Shehbaz thanked Trump and leaders of Arab and Muslim states for their efforts to bring peace in Palestine.“Alhamdolillah, we are closer to a ceasefire than we have been since this genocide was launched on the Palestinian people. Pakistan has always stood by the Palestinian people and shall always do so,” Shehbaz said.""Gratitude is due to President Trump, as well as to leaderships of Qatar, Saudia Arabia, UAE, Turkiye, Jordan, Egypt, and Indonesia who, met with President Trump on the sidelines of #UNGA80 for the resolution of the Palestinian issue. The statement issued by Hamas creates a window for a ceasefire and ensuring peace that we must not allow to close again. InshaAllah, Pakistan will continue to work with all its partners and brotherly nations to everlasting peace in Palestine,"" he added.Shehbaz took a U-turn as his deputy Dar had claimed that Trump’s version of the peace plan was not the one proposed by the bloc of eight Muslim-majority nations that met the US president on September 22 on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.“I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record,” Dar said, emphasising that “there is no room for politicking” on the issue.Dar explained that the plan took shape during a meeting between Trump and foreign ministers of eight countries - Pakistan, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt - on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session. He said the group had prepared a counter-draft to the US proposal, focusing on an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and an end to the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza.Dar also reaffirmed that Pakistan will never recognise Israel and continues to back the two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al Sharif (Jerusalem) as the capital of a future Palestinian state. He stressed that Pakistan’s stance remains unchanged.Dar also confirmed that the plan envisions deploying an international peacekeeping force in Palestine, and said Pakistan’s leadership would soon decide on contributing troops.Under Donald Trump’s proposed plan, military operations in Gaza would be suspended, existing battle lines would remain in place, and a temporary “technocratic, non-political” Palestinian administration would be established. The plan also calls for creating a “Board of Peace,” chaired by Trump, with former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair reportedly serving as an adviser.On Friday, Trump said Hamas must accept the proposed Gaza peace plan by Sunday, warning that failure to do so would result in further attacks.This comes as Hamas accepted some elements of Trump's plan to end the nearly two-year war and return all the remaining hostages taken in the October 7, 2023, attack.Hamas said it was willing to release the hostages and hand over power to other Palestinians, but that other aspects of the plan require further consultations among Palestinians. Senior Hamas officials suggested there were still major disagreements that required further negotiations.","Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President's plan calling it a ""step towards ending bloodshed"" On Friday, Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar said that Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan was not endorsed by Pakistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124307060,imgsize-660599,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan, authorities said on Saturday.According to the school administration, a fourth-grade student picked up a “toy bomb” on his way to school in Jamrud tehsil, Khyber district, near the Afghan border and brought it into his classroom on Friday.Local authorities explained that “toy bombs” are actually abandoned mortar shells found in the province, especially near the Afghan border, which children often mistake for toys. The bomb exploded when the student dropped it on the classroom floor.The injured students were immediately taken to a hospital in Peshawar for treatment and were later discharged, news agency PTI reported.Security forces have blocked off the area and launched a search operation to locate and defuse any remaining unexploded shells to prevent further accidents. Police have also initiated an investigation into the incident.Incidents involving abandoned mortar shells are common in the region. Last year, on December 27, four boys were killed and two critically injured when an old mortar shell exploded in Bajaur district.Such devices continue to pose serious risks to local communities, particularly children, in heavily mined tribal areas along the Afghanistan border.","At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan.

PoJK protests at the core







Protests in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) continued for a sixth consecutive day on Friday, spilling into the country’s capital, triggering a shocking police raid on the Islamabad National Press Club (NPC) that left several journalists injured and equipment vandalised.The assault has sparked nationwide outrage, with journalist unions announcing a “Black Day” in protest against what they called an attack on press freedom, ANI reported.Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday, where members of the Lawyers’ Community of PoK were holding a peaceful demonstration in solidarity with ongoing protests in the region.Visuals widely shared on social media showed baton-wielding policemen dragging journalists, smashing cameras, and assaulting media staff inside the club premises. In one video, a photojournalist could be seen with a torn shirt and a broken camera.The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) strongly condemned the attack, calling it one of the “darkest days” in Pakistan’s history.PFUJ President Afzal Butt said black flags would be hoisted at press clubs across the country in solidarity. “This is not only the Islamabad press club's issue,” Butt said at a press conference.“Press clubs across Pakistan believe that if they ignore this worst incident, tomorrow it could be Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar or Quetta,” he added.Videos circulating on social media show Pakistani Rangers using tear gas shells and live ammunition to disperse crowds. Internet, mobile, and landline services have been shut down, cutting off residents from their families and worsening the crisis.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and ordered an inquiry into the raid. “Violence against the journalist community cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” Naqvi said, promising disciplinary action against those responsible.However, journalist unions rejected what they termed “mere promises.” They warned that if the government continued to use police action to suppress dissent, the protests would intensify.The Islamabad incident comes amid massive protests in PoK, which have entered their sixth consecutive day.The protests, which began two years ago, were initially sparked by demands for political reforms, subsidised wheat flour, reduced electricity tariffs, free education and healthcare, and an end to privileges for government officials.The unrest intensified after at least three civilians were killed during police firing in Muzaffarabad, ANI reported.Their funeral processions drew thousands, fuelling more anger. Reports suggest that over 10 people have died in the clashes so far, with many critically injured.","Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday.

Our second delegate Syed Uzair Nizami was sailing on the observer boat and shared the information regarding the interception of Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan’s ship.”Flotilla's several vessels were stopped and their passengers are being transferred to an Israeli port, the Israeli foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.“Already several vessels of the Hamas-Sumud flotilla have been safely stopped and their passengers are being transferred to an Israeli port.

Pak Parliamentarian Mocks Army Chief Munir As ‘Salesman’, PM Sharif As ‘Manager’ Over Trump Meeting





The Commonwealth Observer Group (COG) has officially released its report on Pakistan’s 2024 general elections, noting “conditions that appeared to impact one party’s ability to fairly contest the election” — namely the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), led by incarcerated former Prime Minister Imran Khan The report, which included a ""Letter of Transmittal"" by COG chairperson and former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, cited the denial to PTI of its election symbol, Khan’s consecutive convictions ahead of polling, and restrictions on freedom of association and assembly.Jonathan wrote: “When looked at in isolation, some – though not all – of the arguments advanced by key institutions in support of their actions appear somewhat justifiable. Yet, collectively, it could not go unnoticed that these decisions consistently limited one party's ability to contest the election on a level playing field.”The observers expressed particular concern over the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s revocation of PTI’s iconic “bat” symbol — linked to Khan’s cricketing past — on grounds that the party failed to hold intra-party elections. With the decision coming just weeks before polling, PTI candidates were forced to run as independents, depriving them of a unifying symbol.The group also flagged Khan’s multiple convictions shortly before polling day, along with restrictions on PTI’s rallies and gatherings. “There were also limitations on fundamental political rights, including freedom of association and assembly. These limitations were felt most acutely by PTI and its supporters,” the report said.The COG called for reforms to strengthen transparency and ensure a level playing field for all parties in future Pakistani elections.The report found that mainstream English-language media “broadly followed the principles of fair and accurate election reporting,” though PTI-affiliated independent candidates received ""less positive"" coverage.By contrast, state-owned PTV News lacked balance, focusing mainly on the ruling PML-N and PPP, and reportedly barred references to Khan by name. The group concluded that these factors may have “impinged on the credibility, transparency and inclusiveness of the electoral process.”The report had been controversial after media reports suggested the Commonwealth had “buried” it following widespread problems in the February 8 polls. Submitted to the Commonwealth secretary-general on November 20, 2024, the publication was delayed without explanation.The PTI had repeatedly demanded its release, arguing it confirmed “systemic rigging, institutional bias, and deliberate targeting” of the party and its founder.","Commonwealth Observer Group releases report on Pakistan's 2024 general elections.

Five-year-old Tod made his debut at the annual water buffalo racing and beauty festival held in Chonburi on Monday. Chonburi is a city in the province of Thailand, about an hour's drive from Bangkok.Tod, the prized stud of food vendor and farmer Thawatchai Daeng-Ngam, was one of the stars of the event, stealing the show. His bright red ears stood out against his sleek black fur.Once considered humble draft animals vital to Thai agriculture, water buffaloes have now become prized show animals. The festival, held at the end of the 11th lunar month to mark the start of the harvest season, celebrates these animals that once ploughed fields and transported heavy loads. Today, many buffaloes are raised for competitions or sold for meat.The Chonburi festival featured a parade of buffaloes adorned with flower crowns, pulling traditional wooden carriages with wheels over 2 metres tall, and carrying owners and women dressed in traditional Thai attire. The event also included a 100-metre sprint race, with jockeys riding the buffaloes at full speed.Pitun Rassamee competed with his three-year-old albino buffalo, Lookaew, which had already won several local pageants. “Although buffaloes can still work in the field, they cannot compete with machines,” said Thawatchai, whose family owns 30 buffaloes, including Tod. “Buffaloes are still important to me. It’s like what they said: ‘People raise buffaloes, and buffaloes raise people.’ They’re like family members,” he added, according to news agency AP The shift from farm labourers to show animals has come with the mechanization of farming and a decline in buffalo populations. Competitions have sparked renewed interest and a growing industry, supported by the government. Since 2017, Thailand has observed Thai Buffalo Conservation Day, and local authorities provide breeding assistance to farmers.Raising a show buffalo can be intensive. On larger farms, animals are bathed daily and fed a special diet of corn, soybeans, bran, and vitamins. At the festival, caretakers splashed water over the larger, prize-winning animals, which are judged on horn size, hoof smoothness, and overall physique.“Each year, it has become bigger and bigger,” said Papada Srisophon, assistant to a village chief near a livestock centre. “Without this activity, they won’t know what to do with their buffaloes, and they won’t be motivated to keep their buffaloes,” she told AP.For many owners, the competitions are more than just sport or show, they reflect a lifelong bond with the animals.","Chonburi is a city in the province of Thailand, about an hour's drive from Bangkok.

Israel Says Yes, Hamas Says No? Decoding Why Trump’s 20-Point Gaza Peace Is A Dud





Pakistan has formally distanced itself from the 20-point Gaza peace plan unveiled by US President Donald Trump, with country’s foreign minister and deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar telling the national assembly that the final proposal presented by the US was not endorsed by Pakistan or fully representative of the original draft prepared by a group of Muslim and Arab countries.“I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record,” Dar said, emphasising that “there is no room for politicking” on the issue.Dar explained that the plan took shape during a meeting between Trump and foreign ministers of eight countries - Pakistan, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt - on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session. He said the group had prepared a counter-draft to the US proposal, focusing on an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and an end to the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza.Also read: Who will govern Gaza? Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan — Explained While Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif initially welcomed the peace plan and reiterated support for a two-state solution, the endorsement drew sharp criticism at home. Many in Pakistan labelled it a “surrender” and questioned the absence of a clear roadmap to Palestinian statehood in the US version of the plan.Dar highlighted key differences between Pakistan’s draft and Trump’s final proposal, particularly regarding the extent of Israeli withdrawal and the disarmament of Hamas. Pakistan’s position called for a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, while the US proposal suggested a phased withdrawal linked to the release of hostages.“President Trump's committee also came and open talks were held on what they wanted. They gave us a 20-point proposal,” Dar said. Over the next 24 hours, the eight countries exchanged revised drafts informally. “We were exchanging hard copies in hotel rooms,” he recalled.Dar said while there was an initial effort to seek joint signatures from all foreign ministers, consensus on that point was not reached. After Trump's meeting with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu on September 29, the US publicly announced the 20-point plan. Dar later learned from the Saudi foreign minister that some of the urgent proposals by the eight countries had been accepted, while others were left for further dialogue.He reaffirmed Pakistan’s long-standing policy on Palestine. “Pakistan’s policy on Palestine remained the same as that of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. There has not been any change nor will there ever be,” Dar said, reiterating support for an independent Palestinian state with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.(with inputs from agencies)","Pakistan has formally distanced itself from the 20-point Gaza peace plan unveiled by US President Donald Trump.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban’s first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that “eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place “until further notice.”Just last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan’s fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide “to prevent immoral activities.” They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

Yes No





At least one student was killed, dozens were injured, and 65 were feared buried in the debris after Al Khoziny Islamic boarding school building collapsed in Indonesia.Rescue workers, police, and soldiers, who had been digging through the night, pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java. Additional bodies were spotted, suggesting the death toll could rise, AP reported.Families of the students gathered at hospitals and near the collapsed building, anxiously awaiting news of their children. Relatives wailed as they watched rescuers pull a dusty, injured student from the buried prayer hall.A notice board at the command post established in the boarding school complex listed 65 students as missing as of Tuesday morning. They were mostly boys in Class 7 to Class 11, aged between twelve and seventeen.“Oh my God... my son is still buried, oh my God please help!” a mother cried hysterically upon seeing her child's name on the board, followed by the cries of other parents facing similar losses.“Please, sir, please find my child immediately,” pleaded a father, holding the hand of one of the rescue team members. Heavy slabs of concrete, rubble, and unstable parts of the building hampered search and rescue efforts, said Nanang Sigit, a search and rescue officer leading the operation.Heavy equipment was available but not being used due to concerns it could cause further collapse. “We have been running oxygen and water to those still trapped under the debris and keeping them alive while we work hard to get them out,” Sigit said.He added that rescuers had seen several bodies under the rubble but were focused on saving those still alive. Several hundred rescuers participated in the effort, equipped with breathing apparatus, extrication tools, medical evacuation equipment, and other support devices.The students had been performing afternoon prayers in a building undergoing an unauthorised expansion when it suddenly collapsed on top of them, provincial police spokesperson Jules Abraham Abast said. Residents, teachers, and administrators assisted injured students, many with head injuries and broken bones.Female students were praying in another part of the building and managed to escape, survivors said. One male student, a thirteen-year-old boy, was killed, and ninety-nine other students were injured and taken to hospitals, some in critical condition, officials said. Authorities were investigating the cause of the collapse. Abast said the old prayer hall was two stories, but two additional floors were being added without a permit.“The old building's foundation was apparently unable to support two floors of concrete and collapsed during the pouring process,” Abast said.","Rescue workers, police, and soldiers pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java.

Nepal PM Oli ‘Planning To Flee To Dubai’, Gen Z Bring ‘Corrupt’ Govt To Its Knees | Watch





Nepal's former Prime Minister and CPN-UML chairman KP Sharma Oli has publicly dismissed speculation that he plans to leave the country, accusing the Sushila Karki-led government of attempting to strip him of his security and official entitlements amid ongoing political tension, reported news agency ANI.Addressing a gathering of Yuwa Sangh Nepal, the youth wing of his party, in Gundu, Bhaktapur, Oli declared, ""Do you think we will flee by handing over the nation to this groundless government?"" He said he remained committed to restoring “peace, good governance and constitutional order”, as quoted by the agency.Oli’s remarks come weeks after the fall of his government on September 9, which followed large-scale Gen Z-led protests. Since vacating the Prime Minister’s official residence in Baluwatar, Oli has relocated to a rented house in Gundu, following an arson attack on his private residence in Balkot by protestors.The CPN-UML chief alleged that the current administration lacked democratic legitimacy and was formed through “vandalism and arson”, not the people’s mandate.Challenging the government to disclose any communication he had with state authorities during the protests, Oli said, “Publish them with courage.Make public the instructions I gave.” He denied any wrongdoing and questioned the basis of efforts to link him to the violent unrest.He also raised concerns over reported threats to his safety and criticised the government for inaction. “On social media, there are open calls to attack my residence. What is the government doing? Just watching?” he asked.The former PM expressed strong objection to reports that the government was planning to withhold passports of several political leaders, including himself, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Arzu Rana Deuba, Ramesh Lekhak, and Deepak Khadka.Oli accused the ruling dispensation of creating a climate of insecurity and targeting opposition leaders. “This government is throwing the country into insecurity,” he alleged.Meanwhile, a recent monitoring report by Nepal’s national human rights commission (NHRC) blamed the previous government, led by Oli and then-home minister Ramesh Lekhak, for failing to anticipate the scale of the Gen Z protests. The NHRC said that while the initial demonstrations on September 8 were peaceful, the use of excessive force by security personnel on September 9 led to dozens of deaths and widespread violence.Rights groups have held Oli and Lekhak accountable for the crackdown, which played a key role in the fall of their administration. The NHRC report highlighted poor coordination, declining morale among security forces, and inadequate preparation as contributing factors to the high casualties.","KP Sharma Oli accuses Sushila Karki-led government of attempting to strip him of his security and official entitlements.

Farage ‘Exposes’ Starmer’s ‘Islamophobia Law In Britain’ Bid Amid Showdown In US House | Watch





LONDON: A British Sikh organisation has threatened to take legal action against the UK government over a potential new definition of Islamophobia and the decision to appoint a working group to develop one, pointing out that any government-backed definition risks discriminating against other faiths.The Network of Sikh organisations (NSO), an umbrella body for Sikhs in the UK, has sent a pre-action letter to communities secretary Steve Reed, raising concerns over the impact of any definition on Sikhs and on freedom of religion and speech in Britain.The anti-Muslim hatred/Islamophobia working group was set up in March 2025 to develop a non-statutory definition of Islamophobia to provide the UK government and other relevant bodies with a greater understanding of prejudice against Muslims. Ministers may opt not to accept the definition.The letter that the NSO is preparing to seek a judicial review.The NSO argues that any definition of Islamophobia will also interfere with the right of Sikhs and others to freely manifest their religion and beliefs, a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.Lord Singh of Wimbledon, director of NSO, wrote: “Sikhs are strictly forbidden to eat halal slaughtered meat because halal slaughter, especially non-stun slaughter, is inhumane.”Yet just asserting this would, by virtue of the 2018 definition of Islamophobia by the All-Party-Parliamentary-Group (APPG) on Muslims, be considered Islamophobic, he wrote.The ninth Sikh Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur, gave his life defending the freedom of belief of Hindus who were being forced to convert to Islam. “Simply recounting this historical truth would be deemed Islamophobic according to the APPG definition,” Singh wrote.“There are countless other examples of Sikh (and indeed other religious and philosophical) beliefs and practices which would offend people of the Islamic faith,” he wrote.His letter also criticises the consultation exercise, saying it was carried out privately with select groups and that NSO was not invited to provide evidence.Officials at the ministry of housing, communities and local govt (MHCLG) told TOI they had received the letter and would reply shortly. The working group received a response to the call for evidence from the NSO. “The concerns they raised have informed the work,” a source said. “Any proposed definition must be compatible with the right to freedom of speech. That includes the right to … insult religions.”A MHCLG spokesperson said, “No decisions on a definition have been made, and we will not accept any definition which damages freedom of speech or discriminates against religious communities.”","Network of Sikh organisations (NSO), an umbrella body for Sikhs in the UK, has sent a pre-action letter to communities secretary Steve Reed.

Police have dismantled an international organized crime gang believed to have smuggled up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China over the past year, worth millions of pounds.In what the Metropolitan Police describe as the UK’s largest operation targeting phone theft, 18 suspects were arrested and more than 2,000 stolen devices recovered.Two Afghan nationals were arrested last month on suspicion of operating a network believed to traffic up to 40% of all iPhones stolen in London. Authorities say the gang was moving devices to China on an ""industrial scale,"" where the latest models can fetch £3,700 each.“This is the largest crackdown on mobile phone theft and robbery in the UK in the most extraordinary set of operations of this kind that the Met has ever undertaken. We are talking about some serious criminality here,"" commander Andrew Featherstone was quoted as saying by the Mirror.Police estimate the group could be responsible for exporting as many as half of all stolen phones from London, the city where the majority of UK mobile thefts occur.The investigation was triggered after a victim traced a stolen phone last year.""It was actually on Christmas Eve and a victim electronically tracked their stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow Airport ,"" detective inspector Mark Gavin was quoted as saying by the BBC.""The security there was eager to help out and they found the phone was in a box, among another 894 phones.""Officers found that nearly all the phones were stolen and were being shipped to Hong Kong. Additional shipments were intercepted, and forensic analysis of the packages helped identify two suspects.As the investigation zeroed in on the suspects, police bodycam footage captured a dramatic mid-road interception, with some officers drawing Tasers.Dozens of phones were found in the vehicle, many wrapped in foil in an apparent attempt to conceal them, and roughly 2,000 additional devices were recovered from properties linked to the suspects.A third suspect, a 29-year-old Indian national, has also been charged with the same offences.Last week, police arrested an additional 15 individuals on suspicion of theft, handling stolen property, and conspiracy to commit theft.Most of the suspects are women, including a Bulgarian national, and around 30 devices were seized during early morning raids.The number of phones stolen in London has nearly tripled over the past four years, rising from 28,609 in 2020 to 80,588 in 2024. London now accounts for three-quarters of all mobile phone thefts in the UK, as cited by the BBC.""This is, without doubt, the largest operation of its kind in UK history, and it was humbling to see first-hand how the Met are going after the leaders of international smuggling gangs as well as the street robbers and snatchers fueling this industrial scale crime,"" Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said.","Gang believed to have smuggled up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China over the past year. 18 suspects arrested and more than 2,000 devices recovered in UK's largest operation targeting phone theft.

Layers of Roman life

Anglo-Saxon and medieval insights



A marketplace built over history





Beneath the bustling heart of Leicester, England, archaeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old prison hidden under the city’s historic Market Place. What began as a routine excavation for urban redevelopment has turned into one of the most significant discoveries in recent UK archaeology. The dig, led by the University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS), is part of a £7.5 million project by Leicester City Council to create a new market square. The team uncovered the long-lost Gainsborough Chamber—a medieval civic building first recorded in 1533, infamous for its “vile prison.” They also discovered layers of Roman and Anglo-Saxon life, artifacts, and even a Roman infant burial, offering an extraordinary window into centuries of human history lying silently beneath the modern marketplace.At the centre of the discovery is the Gainsborough Chamber, demolished around 1748 but now partially restored in the archaeological record. Historical texts describe it as a “most vile prison,” where harsh conditions likely made it infamous in medieval Leicester. Archaeologists uncovered its thick stone walls, a stone-lined well, and remnants of the dungeon, confirming the building’s architectural and civic importance.According to historian Charles Billson, a prisoner in 1533 described being chained, lying on hard planks, and receiving no comfort or company, highlighting the dungeon’s grim reputation. Gavin Speed, the lead archaeologist, emphasized that this area of Leicester had remained largely untouched until the current excavation, making the discovery even more remarkable.The excavation revealed a wealth of Roman-era remains, including a timber building later replaced by a stone structure. Artifacts such as Roman tesserae, pottery, coins, and jewellery help reconstruct daily life in ancient Leicester. A particularly poignant find was the burial of a Roman infant beneath the timber structure, likely around 1,900 years ago, providing a glimpse into family life and customs from nearly two millennia ago. The later stone building was constructed directly over the earlier timber house, showing how the city evolved over time. These findings underscore Leicester’s long-standing significance as a Roman settlement and trade hub.Beneath the medieval layers, archaeologists uncovered a thick Anglo-Saxon soil layer, shedding light on a little-understood period in Leicester’s history. Compacted pebbles, overlain by silts and successive resurfacing layers, revealed nearly 800 years of continuous market activity. Post-holes from medieval market stalls offer rare physical evidence of the city’s commercial past. Dr. Speed described the site as “like a slice through an archaeological cake,” showing how each layer represents a different generation of market activity and urban life. These discoveries reveal how Leicester’s central square continuously adapted to social and economic changes, blending Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and medieval influences across centuries.The dig confirms Leicester’s role as a historic trade centre, with layers of activity preserved beneath the modern square.

Here's what we know about attack

Al-Shamie, who was on bail in rape case, may have been 'influenced by extreme Islamist ideology'



Six people arrested in this case



How the attack unfolded



Witnesses recall chaos of attack







At least two Jewish were killed and three others critically injured in a car-ramming and stabbing attack outside Manchester’s Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue on Yom Kippur.Police identified the victims as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. Authorities confirmed that one victim was fatally hit by police gunfire during their response to the assailant, calling it a “tragic and unforeseen consequence.”The suspect, 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, a British national of Syrian descent, was shot dead on site. Investigators are treating the assault as a suspected terror attack.The suspect, a British citizen of Syrian descent who was living in Prestwitch, Manchester, entered the UK as a very young child and was granted British citizenship in 2006 as a minor.Greater Manchester Police said late on Friday that at this stage in its investigation it believes Al-Shamie ""may have been influenced by extreme Islamist ideology."" However, it said establishing the full circumstances of the attack will likely take some time.The suspect's name has not appeared in initial searches of police and security service counter-terrorism records. But Greater Manchester Police said he had a non-counter-terror criminal history, including ""a recent arrest for rape, which resulted in him being bailed.""His family said in a statement: ""We fully distance ourselves from this attack and express our deep shock and sorrow over what has happened. Our hearts and thoughts are with the victims and their families, and we pray for their strength and comfort.""In a statement, the UK police revealed that they have arrested six people in the Manchester synagogue attack. All the six were arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism.“We have now arrested three further people, one man and two women, aged between 18 and mid-40s. This brings the number of people in custody arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism to six,"" the police said in a statement.“We will be seeking warrants of further detention for all six individuals and will seek to issue an update on this later,"" it added.Police responded to reports of a car driving towards members of the public and a man stabbing at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue at 09.31 BST on Thursday.Officers declared a major incident and arrived at the scene in north Manchester within seven minutes, shooting dead the suspect at 09.38 BST, who police said had a bomb.A large number of people were worshipping at the synagogue at the time and were held inside while the surrounding area was made safe. Greater Manchester Police said worshippers and security staff demonstrated ""immediate bravery"" and helped stop the attacker from entering the building.In an update on Friday evening, police said witnesses had described seeing a man ""acting suspiciously"" outside the synagogue before the attack, who then walked away after being confronted by security. The police said they do not believe that incident was reported to them, but about 15 minutes later ""the individual returned in a vehicle and began his horrific attack"".""We have been told from witness accounts that a man was seen acting suspiciously outside the synagogue before he was confronted by security and walked away. Based on the information we have at this time, we don’t believe this was reported to Greater Manchester Police because the man had left the area. Around 15 minutes later, the individual returned in a vehicle and began his horrific attack,"" the police said in a statement.“There were a large number of worshippers in attendance but thanks to the bravery of security staff, worshippers and the fast action of the police, the attacker was prevented from gaining access,"" they added.Shah, a local resident, said she was driving past the synagogue when she saw a vehicle ""just sort of rushing past and driving straight for the members of the public"". She then saw a man ""jump out"" and start running towards the people ""with a knife and he just started going on a bit of a rampage"", she said, calling the scene ""traumatising"".Inside the synagogue, Rabbi Daniel Walker described running into the foyer and seeing ""a terrorist trying to batter his way into the synagogue"". He told the BBC the attacker was ""body-charging the doors, throwing heavy plant pots at the doors, doing everything he could to get in"", as he and others held the entrance doors shut.Outside, Tonge said once police arrived, ""they gave him [the attacker] a couple of warnings, he didn't listen so they opened fire,"" adding that the man holding the knife went down on the floor.The man then ""started getting back up and they [the police] shot him again"", Tonge added – describing it as ""nerve-racking"" to witness.A bomb disposal unit was deployed after ""suspicious items"" were spotted around the suspect's waist - police later confirmed the device was ""fake"".An SAS helicopter, dubbed ""Blue Thunder"", was seen flying above the area later. The aircraft, and the troops it carries, are part of a national airborne counter-terrorism response. The attack was later declared a terrorist incident.","Suspect, 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, a British national of Syrian descent, was shot dead on site.

LONDON: For the first time in the Church of England’s 491-year history, a woman has been appointed to lead it.On Friday Downing Street announced that Bishop of London Dame Sarah Mullally, 63, who became a Christian aged 16, would be the successor to Justin Welby who resigned in Jan over his handling of a child sex abuse scandal.Currently known as the Archbishop of Canterbury-designate, she will legally become the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury at her confirmation of election at St Paul’s Cathedral in Jan 2026, with a service of installation taking place at Canterbury Cathedral in March 2026.Mullally has been Bishop of London since 2018, the first woman appointed to that role too. Prior to her ordination in 2001, she was chief nursing officer for England — the youngest person ever to be appointed to that role at the age of 37 — having previously specialised as a cancer nurse.The Crown Nominations Commission (CNC) for Canterbury nominated Mullaly following a process of public consultation and prayerful discernment that began in Feb. The CNC was made up of representatives from the Church of England, global Anglican Communion and the Diocese of Canterbury.The most senior bishop in the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury’s ministry combines many roles, including serving as primus inter pares — or first among equals — of the Primates of the global Anglican Communion, which consists of around 85 million people, across 165 countries, including India.The Archbishop of Canterbury also sits in the House of Lords.Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, commended the appointment and called on the Roman Catholic Church to follow suit. Quoting Hindu scriptures, he said: “ Where women are honoured, there the Gods are pleased.”But Gafcon, a movement of Conservative global Anglicans, which is opposed to the ordination of women to holy orders, said it did not accept Mullaly as leader. “Since the newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury has failed to guard the faith and is complicit in introducing practices and beliefs that violate both the plain and canonical sense of Scripture and the Church’s historic and consensual interpretation of it, she cannot provide leadership to the Anglican Communion,” said Dr Laurent Mbanda, chairman, Gafcon Primates Council. “The majority of the Anglican Communion still believes that the Bible requires a male-only episcopacy.”","Dame Sarah Mullally, 63, became a Christian aged 16.

2 Killed in Yom Kippur Stabbing Near Manchester Synagogue, Suspect Shot by Police





One of the victims of the synagogue attack in Manchester may have been fatally shot by officers during their attempt to stop the assailant, police said on Friday.In a statement, police confirmed that the suspect, identified as Jihad Al Shamie, was not carrying a firearm. “The only shots fired were from GMP’s Authorised Firearms Officer,"" the Greater Manchester Police statement said.“It follows therefore, that subject to further forensic examination, this injury may sadly have been sustained as a tragic and unforeseen consequence of the urgently required action taken by my officers to bring this vicious attack to an end,” the statement added.The incident unfolded on Thursday outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue, where worshippers had gathered for Yom Kippur. Two people were killed and three others seriously wounded after a car was driven at a crowd, followed by a stabbing.Police had initially said the suspect was ""believed dead"" after being shot. A bomb squad was later deployed amid fears the attacker was carrying explosives.The two victims were identified as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. Three others remain in hospital in serious condition.The assault took place Thursday morning in Crumpsall, a Manchester suburb, as worshippers gathered for Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.Police said a suspect rammed a car into pedestrians outside the Orthodox synagogue before attacking them with a knife. He was shot dead by armed officers seven minutes later. The attacker was wearing what appeared to be an explosives belt, later confirmed to be fake.Police identified the suspect as Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, a British citizen of Syrian origin who moved to the UK as a child and obtained citizenship in 2006. Authorities are still verifying whether “Al-Shamie” is his birth name. The case is being investigated as a terrorist incident, though the motive remains unclear.Three people – two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s – have been arrested on suspicion of preparing or assisting acts of terrorism. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the attacker had not previously been known to police or to Prevent, the UK’s counter-radicalisation programme. “It’s too early to say whether he acted alone or as part of a wider network,” she said.Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis condemned the attack as the product of “an unrelenting wave of Jew hatred.” Writing on social media, he said: “This is the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come.”Political and religious leaders have pledged reassurance to Britain’s 300,000-strong Jewish community following the attack.","One of the victims of the synagogue attack in Manchester may have been fatally shot by officers.

Who is Sarah Mullally?



Why the role matters







The Church of England, founded in 1554, will be led by a woman for the first time, as Sarah Mullally, the Bishop of London, was announced on Friday as the next Archbishop of Canterbury, the highest-ranking bishop in the Church.Mullally, 63, succeeds 105 men to become the first woman to lead the Anglican Communion, which comprises 85 million (8.5 crore) members worldwide.She will succeed former Archbishop Justin Welby, who announced his resignation in November last year following an independent investigation. The probe found that he had failed to report to the police instances of serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps, despite being aware of them.According to the BBC, Mullally is a former National Health Service (NHS) nurse who became a priest in 2006. In 2018, she was appointed as the first female Bishop of London, making her the third most senior member of clergy in the Church of England.She spent over 35 years in the NHS, and in 1999, became the youngest-ever Chief Nursing Officer for England. A few years later, she decided to pursue the priesthood.In 2012, Mullally became canon treasurer at Salisbury Cathedral, and three years later, she was appointed Bishop of Crediton in the Diocese of Exeter.Mullally will not formally assume her new role until a confirmation of election in January, followed by an enthronement service after paying homage to King Charles III, the head of state.Women were first ordained as priests in the Church of England in 1994, with the first female bishops appointed two decades later, in 2014.Although the monarch—King Charles III in this case—is the formal head of the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury is its most senior bishop and serves as the spiritual leader of both the Church and the worldwide Anglican Communion, which includes numerous national churches.The Archbishop carries the title “Primate of All England,” reflecting their seniority as the “first bishop” in England.","Sarah Mullally, the Bishop of London, was announced on Friday as the next Archbishop of Canterbury.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed that the attack outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Manchester was a targeted terrorist act against Jews. Speaking after chairing an emergency meeting in London, cutting short his trip to a European summit in Denmark. Starmer described the incident as “a vile terrorist attack” motivated by antisemitism.Two Jewish men were killed and three others seriously injured in the Thursday attack. Police confirmed the victims were targeted specifically because of their faith.Starmer also addressed the public on X (formerly Twitter), writing: “This was a vile terrorist attack that attacked Jews, because they are Jews. Antisemitism is a hatred that is rising, once again. Britain must defeat it, once again. To every Jewish person in this country: I promise that I will do everything in my power to guarantee you the security you deserve.”The attack is being treated as a suspected antisemitic terror attack , with authorities alleging that the assailant deliberately targeted and killed Jewish people.Police identified the attacker as a UK citizen of Syrian origin, who was shot dead by armed officers within minutes of the first emergency call.Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the man was wearing a vest resembling an explosive device, which was later confirmed to be fake. He has been named by the police as Jihad Al-Shamie.Within hours of the attack, three other people, two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s, were arrested on suspicion of terror-related offenses, as reported by AFP.The incident unfolded on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, and was declared a terrorist incident by counter-terror officers. Many Orthodox Jewish worshippers, observing Yom Kippur without phones or computers, only learned of the attack after sundown.The attacker reportedly drove into a crowd gathered outside the Synagogue before launching a stabbing spree, leaving multiple victims seriously wounded, according to AFP. A woman who also identified as a Jew and lives next door to the synagogue said that as soon as the suspect got out of the car, he ""started stabbing anyone near him,"" reported BBC.Chief Constable Stephen Watson said the attacker first rammed a car into people gathered outside the synagogue before stabbing victims with a knife. Officers opened fire after issuing warnings, preventing the suspect from entering the building. “They gave him a couple of warnings, he didn't listen until they opened fire,"" the witness told AFP.GMP said they received an alert shortly after 9:30 AM (0830 GMT) that a car had driven into people outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue and that a security guard had been attacked with a knife. They praised the residents for alerting them swiftly, saying the response prevented an even greater tragedy.Two prominent Jewish organizations in the UK told CNN that the attack at the synagogue was sadly something they feared was coming. “As we emerge from the fast of Yom Kippur, the holiest day in our calendar, many in our community will only now be learning of the horrific attack on Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation in Manchester,” a joint statement from the Jewish Leadership Council and Board of Deputies of British Jews said. They called on those in positions of power and influence to take strong action to combat hatred against the Jewish community and reiterated their support for the authorities in protecting their people.The attack has drawn global condemnation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it a “barbaric attack,” while Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar accused British authorities of failing to curb antisemitic and anti-Israel incitement. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the targeting of a synagogue on Yom Kippur as “particularly heinous,” and King Charles III and Queen Camilla said they were “deeply shocked and saddened”, reported AFP.The incident comes just days before the second anniversary of Hamas’s October 7 assault on Israel, which triggered the ongoing Gaza war. Analysts noted it was among the worst antisemitic attacks in Europe since then.Manchester, home to more than 28,000 Jews according to 2021 data, has faced grievously deadly terror attacks before, strikingly the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing that killed 22 people.",UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the attack was a targeted terrorist act against Jews.

Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Saar condemned the deadly terrorist attack that targeted a Manchester synagogue on Thursday, criticising UK authorities for what he described as their “failure to address this toxic wave of antisemitism.”“I am appalled by the murderous attack near Heaton Park Synagogue on the morning of Yom Kippur, the holiest day for the Jewish people. My deepest condolences go to the families who have lost loved ones, and I wish a swift recovery to the injured,” Saar said on X.He called for the “truth” to be told, adding: “Blatant and rampant antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement, as well as support for terror, have recently become widespread in London, other UK cities, and on campuses.”Saar further said Israel expects “more than words” from the Keir Starmer-led government, demanding “effective action and enforcement against antisemitic and anti-Israeli sentiment in Britain.”The attack, carried out with a car and a knife, left two people dead and four injured. Police neutralised the suspect and arrested two others.The incident comes ahead of the second anniversary of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel, after which Israel - a Jewish state - launched a military offensive in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.

Could France's political turmoil spark eurozone debt crisis?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/could-frances-political-turmoil-spark-eurozone-debt-crisis/articleshow/124369556.cms,".

France: Europe's debt king

European Commission and ECB under pressure

Stalled reforms

Bad timing for a political crisis





The common European currency, the euro , fell against main rivals and French borrowing costs spiked as Sebastien Lecornu, who had been France's prime minister for less than a month, resigned on Monday (October 6) — just 14 hours after naming a largely unchanged cabinet.However, shortly after quitting, Lecornu accepted a request from French President Emmanuel Macron to work on a plan for the ""stability for the country"" by Wednesday evening.That unexpected twist capped a day of political upheaval which saw stocks fall sharply on the Paris exchange amid concerns over the political parties' ability to tackle the country's economic woes.While it’s unclear what will happen if Lecornu fails, one option would be for Macron to call fresh legislative elections.French politicians are divided on how to tackle the nation's huge sovereign debt pile. As a result, the yield on France's benchmark OATS government bonds rose far more than other eurozone bond yields.Further indication that investor confidence in Europe's second-largest economy is shaken is the fact that OATS now trade at a slightly higher spread than the BTP government bonds of highly indebted Italy for the first time since the launch of the euro in 1999.Unsettled by the recurrent political instability, investors have shunned French stocks, with the country's bluechip CAC 40 index lagging the rest of Europe by some 14 % since the beginning of last year.In absolute terms, no EU country holds more consolidated national debt than France. Sovereign debt has climbed to around €3.35 trillion ($3.9 trillion) — about 113% of gross domestic product (GDP), with the figure expected to rise further to 125% by 2030.France's debt-to-GDP ratio is so high that within the European Unionthat only Greece and Italy surpass it. With a budget deficit of 5.4% to 5.8% this year, Paris also runs the largest budget shortfall in the 27-nation EU.To meet the EU's target of reducing the deficit to 3%, drastic savings are unavoidable.However, since cuts are currently politically untenable, financial markets have responded with higher risk premiums on French bonds. While German bonds carry an interest rate of about 2.7%, the French government needs to pay close to 3.5% interest for its debt.So should we worry about the stability of the single European currency, the euro, if France's finances slip out of control?""Yes, we should be worried. The eurozone is not stable at this point,"" says Friedrich Heinemann, an economist with the ZEW Leibniz Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim, Germany, even though he is ""not concerned"" about a new short-term debt crisis in the coming months.""But we have to ask where this is heading if a big country like France, which has seen a steadily rising debt ratio in recent years, now also faces further political destabilization,"" he told DW.Other major economies are also racking up historically high debt and must raise billions on capital markets. This fall, for example, Germany, Japan, and the US will need to issue new government bonds to finance their spending — a key reason global bond markets remain under pressure.The only reason the markets aren't even more nervous — meaning the spreads on French bonds aren't rising further — is the hope that the European Central Bank (ECB) will step in and buy French bonds to stabilize the market, Heinemann thinks. ""But that hope could be misplaced, because the ECB has to be careful not to undermine its credibility.""It's been a long-standing political dilemma for successive French governments that whenever they propose austerity measures or economic reforms, parties on both the left and right cry foul and mobilize their supporters.France now spends €67 billion annually just on interest payments. And it is under pressure because it has committed to gradually reducing its deficit in line with EU rules.But Heinemann also lays part of the blame on the steps of the European Commission because it ""helped create this mess.""""It kept turning a blind eye, even both eyes, when it came to France. Those were political compromises driven by fear of strengthening populists,"" he said. ""France has already used up much of its fiscal space. Germany is in a much better position, with plenty of room for maneuver.""According to Heinemann, France, like Germany, urgently needs major welfare reforms and spending cuts. The alternative would be higher taxes in a country that already imposes heavy tax burdens on both citizens and businesses.Therefore, Heinemann is skeptical that French politics can deliver a cross-party consensus on debt reduction. ""With populists on both the left and right gaining ground, I don't see that happening. The center is shrinking. That's why I'm pessimistic about France and don't see a solution.""For Andrew Kenningham, chief European economist at London-based Capital Economics, the risks to other European markets remain manageable for now.""So far, the problems seem largely confined to France itself, as long as the scale of the French issue doesn't grow too big,"" he said in a note to clients.But he warned of scenarios where France's crisis could escalate significantly, raising the risk of contagion.""After all, France is the eurozone's second-largest economy, with deep trade and financial ties to its neighbors, and it is also a leading EU political power,"" Kenningham noted, saying a crisis in France could therefore call into question the very viability of the European project.""We don't expect a crisis of that magnitude in the next one to two years. But if it were to happen, contagion could become a much bigger risk — one the ECB would have to address,"" he said.France's turmoil comes at a time when the EU is locked in conflict with the United States over trade policy, including higher taxes on US tech giants proposed by France.It's poor timing for the EU to appear weakened by the political deadlock in France.For Heinemann, many political actors in France are ""Trumpists at heart,"" especially on the left and right of the political spectrum.""They could increase pressure on the European Commission to retaliate against Trump's tariffs with European tariffs,"" the economist warned, which would ""raise the risk of a real trade war"" and worsen the country's debt crisis even further.","France's debt-to-GDP ratio is so high that only Greece and Italy surpass it. With a budget deficit of 5.4% to 5.8% this year, Paris also runs the largest budget shortfall in the EU. To meet the EU's target of reducing the deficit to 3%, drastic savings are unavoidable.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124369677,imgsize-373913,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-10-07-232134.jpg"

'PUTIN'S FRIENDS IN EUROPE...': EU Chief Ursula's Shocking Russia Plot Claim As Ouster Threat Grows

Why doesn't the German military shoot down the drones?







The German government is holding a meeting on Wednesday to discuss defense against drones, after flights were suspended at the Munich airport twice in two days over reported drone sightings.A debate has emerged within Germany's CDU/CSU conservative bloc about which division of the country's political structure is chiefly responsible for protecting key installations from drones: the regional states, ""Länder,"" or the federal government, ""Bund,"" in Berlin?""We have to admit that certain divisions of powers between the Bund and the Länder don't really match up when it comes to threats to internal security,"" said Steffen Bilger, a senior figure in the CDU/CSU parliamentary bloc.Bilger said police in southern states such as Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg had greater powers to respond to drone threats than police in other states. ""I certainly think it could be possible to reach an agreement with the Länder to allow the Bund to take on greater responsibility,"" he said,His colleague Alexander Hoffmann, the head of the Bavarian CSU fraction in parliament, said individual Länder were better equipped to deal with localized drone threats because of their regional familiarity.""Every state is called upon to do its homework,"" he said. ""Ultimately, drone defenses must be present everywhere.""In Germany, regional police forces, ""Landespolizei,"" are generally responsible for dealing with drone threats, with the exception of airports and train stations, which fall under the jurisdiction of the federal police ""Bundespolizei.""The problem, however, is that the police don't have fighter jets or surface-to-air missile systems, and that the German military, ""the Bundeswehr,"" is not permitted to shoot down drones inside Germany.According to the German constitution, the role of the military is explicitly to defend the country against external military attack.As such, the army could only shoot down drones in a scenario comparable to that experienced for the past three years by Ukraine, which is targeted by Russian attack drones on a nightly basis.""The shooting down of drones domestically with military means such as missiles would not be legally possible,"" Verena Jackson, a lawyer at the University of the Bundeswehr in Munich, told public television news service Tagesschau last week after Munich Airport twice suspended operations due to drone activity.""This would only be possible in scenarios comparable to a full-scale war. The constitution is very clear: the armed forces may only be deployed when the constitution explicitly allows it,"" she said.",The German government is holding a meeting on Wednesday to discuss defense against drones.

Kentucky State University shooting: Parent charged with murder after on-campus attack kills student,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kentucky-state-university-shooting-parent-charged-with-murder-after-on-campus-attack-kills-student/articleshow/125900474.cms,"



A parent of a Kentucky State University student was charged with murder and first-degree assault after an on-campus shooting at the school’s Frankfort campus on Tuesday that killed one student and critically injured another.Jacob Lee Bard, 48, was at the campus and fired shots at victims in Whitney M. Young Jr. Hall, police said in a statement. The shooting killed 19-year-old De’Jon Fox of Indianapolis. A second student remains in critical condition; his name was not released, CNN reported.Police said Bard is from Evansville, Indiana, which is about 150 miles west of Frankfort. He was booked into the Franklin County Jail on charges of murder and first-degree assault. Bard is represented by a public defender at the Franklin County Department of Public Advocacy, which declined to comment on the case.University police officers who were near the scene of the altercation arrested Bard immediately, investigators said. Surveillance footage and videos taken by others at the scene have been reviewed.When asked about reports that videos show a fight involving Bard’s sons before the shooting, or whether Bard came to campus to speak to administrators about his sons’ safety, Frankfort Assistant Police Chief Scott Tracy said: “It’s really too early in the investigation right now to really give any details that led up to it.A lot of it would be speculation.”This was the second shooting in four months near the student residence. On August 17 someone fired multiple shots from a vehicle, striking two people who were not students. One victim was treated for minor injuries and the other sustained serious injuries. The dorm and at least one vehicle were damaged by gunfire.University President Koffi C. Akakpo said at a news conference: “The campus is a safe place.” He added that the school had increased the number of police officers after the first shooting and would decide whether further measures were needed once the investigation into the latest incident was complete.Kentucky State University, a public historically Black university with about 2,200 students, was created in 1886. It is located about 2 miles east of the Capitol building in Frankfort.","Jacob Lee Bard, 48, was at the campus and fired shots at victims in Whitney M. Young Jr. Hall.

Planning your year around UAE holidays





Local authorities may add extra holidays

Public holidays are not carried forward if they fall on weekends or overlap with another holiday

Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, so slight adjustments are possible





Residents of the UAE have much to look forward to in 2026, with several public holidays promising opportunities for long weekends and family time. From Eid celebrations to the National Day, a mix of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar holidays will shape the holiday calendar. Here is a detailed guide to all predicted public holidays, how they are determined, and tips to plan your time off.UAE public holidays are a combination of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar calendar dates. Gregorian holidays, such as New Year’s Day and National Day, occur on the same date each year. Islamic holidays, including Eid Al Fitr, Eid Al Adha, Islamic New Year, and Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday (PBUH), shift each year based on moon sightings.The UAE Public Holiday Law, established in April 2024 and implemented from January 2025, allows certain holidays to be shifted to the start or end of the week to create long weekends, except for Eid holidays. Cabinet Resolution No. 27 of 2024 also permits local governments to declare additional holidays for special occasions.Holidays that fall on weekends or coincide with another public holiday are not carried forward, but 2026 predictions indicate no overlap between Islamic holidays and Gregorian holidays.Residents in the UAE can expect at least 12 public holidays in 2026. While final dates depend on moon sightings and government announcements, current predictions give a clear picture of the likely schedule:Transferable holidays: Islamic holidays such as Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al Adha are not transferable. Other holidays, including the Islamic New Year, Prophet’s Birthday, and National Day, may be moved to create long weekends based on Cabinet resolutions.2026 promises several opportunities for extended breaks:Residents are advised to plan ahead, as Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, which may adjust official dates.Public and private schools in the UAE align their breaks with national holidays, though exact dates differ by curriculum and school authority:This schedule helps families coordinate holidays and make the most of predicted long weekends.Understanding the mix of fixed and lunar-based holidays allows UAE residents to strategically plan their annual leave. For example, taking just a few days off around Eid or National Day can significantly maximize time away from work. While the UAE government confirms official dates closer to each holiday, these early predictions serve as a reliable guide for 2026.Residents should note:With this guide, UAE residents can look forward to a year of well timed breaks, long weekends, and ample family and leisure time.","UAE residents in 2026 can enjoy 12 public holidays, including Eid, National Day, and school breaks.

Who is Oscar Solorzano? Twice deported illegal immigrant charged in Charlotte light rail stabbing case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/oscar-solorzano-twice-deported-charged-in-charlotte-light-rail-stabbing-case/articleshow/125812245.cms,"



An illegal immigrant, who is identified as Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia, was taken into custody in connection with a stabbing on a light rail in Charlotte, North Carolina.While investigating the case, the police discovered that the 33-year-old suspect was actually deported twice back to his country.Solorzano-Garcia was issued a final deportation order in 2018 and was removed from the United States on March 9 of that year, DHS said. He was arrested crossing the border illegally again in 2021 and removed a second time. DHS said he apparently re-entered the US a third time at an unknown date and location.DHS Secretary Kristi Noem condemned the alleged stabbing, saying the incident “should have never happened.“This heinous stabbing by this twice removed illegal alien should have NEVER happened. ICE lodged an arrest detainer to ensure Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia is not released back into North Carolina neighborhoods. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the county will honor the detainer since they have a history of not cooperating with ICE,” said Secretary Noem in a press statement released by DHS.“Under President Trump, ICE is being unleashed to ensure public safety for all Americans. Make no mistake: We will not rest until every depraved criminal illegal alien is removed from our communities,"" she added.What are the charges against him?Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia has been charged with first-degree murder after allegedly attacking a male passenger with a large knife, according to DHS. ICE said Solorzano-Garcia is in the country illegally.Authorities said Solorzano-Garcia has a criminal history that includes prior arrests for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, destroying evidence, resisting arrest and using a false ID, as well as convictions for robbery and illegal reentry.","Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia, 33, has been charged with first-degree murder after allegedly attacking a male passenger with a large knife.

‘Whole thing just disgusts...’: CEO Brian Thompson’s colleague slams fans of his killer Luigi Mangione,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/whole-thing-just-disgusts-ceo-brian-thompsons-colleague-slams-fans-of-his-killer-luigi-mangione/articleshow/125809962.cms,"Luigi Mangione Gets 200+ Letters A Day; Some Too Explicit To Read Out Loud





A former colleague of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson , who was killed by Luigi Mangione , is not happy with the fans who give attention to the shooter.It has been one year since the executive was shot dead in Manhattan, but the case of Mangione is still ongoing.“It was the Luigi show,” said Terrie Martin, an independent Medicare broker from Texas who met Thompson at a conference months before his death, reports the New York Post.She described how Brian was an innocent family guy: “The whole thing just disgusts me — the way it was handled, the way it was portrayed, the way everybody jumped to celebrate when they weren’t even thinking this guy was a father, a husband, a boss or anything. That was just appalling.”50-year-old Thompson was fatally shot outside the Hilton Hotel in New York on December 4, 2024. The assassination was caught on camera.26-year-old Mangione managed to flee New York but was arrested after a five-day manhunt at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania. Federal prosecutors ruled that Mangione was hostile towards the healthcare industry.Thompson's accomplice said he bore no resemblance to the “caricature” painted by Mangione’s supporters.“He really and truly wanted to know how to make it better, nuts and bolts from people who are working on the ground in the trenches. What’s beneficial, what’s lacking, how can we make it better? He was really, really set on that very sincerely. He was actually trying to make a difference. That’s what made me so sad.”She recalled Thompson’s humility: “The one thing that I noticed from the very beginning was that everyone called him BT. They didn’t call him Brian or Mr. Thompson… I’ve never seen a dynamic like that before in corporate America.”Martin also remembered an awkward moment when she realised she had been speaking to the CEO. “He just laughed. He was so gracious about it. If you had met him anywhere like in line at a grocery store or a sporting event, you would never have guessed he was a CEO. Never. He was just such a really nice, humble, everyday kinda guy.”Earlier this week, a Manhattan judge reviewed key evidence in Mangione’s murder case, including a 911 call from the Altoona McDonald’s where he was arrested days after the killing. Prosecutors played surveillance footage of a masked gunman shooting Thompson. Mangione's defence seeks to suppress evidence from his arrest, including a handgun, a magazine, and a notebook.Meanwhile, supporters gathered outside the court in costume, holding “Free Luigi” signs.","Former colleague of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is not happy with the fans who give attention to Luigi Mangione.

Zelensky’s ‘Difficult Call’ With US Envoys As Territory Talks Hit Wall | 3-day Miami Talks Conclude

Who is Eileen Higgins ?









Miami voters have elected Democrat Eileen Higgins as the city’s first female mayor and the first Democrat to hold the office in nearly three decades.In Tuesday’s runoff, Higgins, a former county commissioner, defeated Republican Emilio González, a former city manager backed by former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.“Together, we turned the page on years of chaos and corruption and opened the door to a new era for our city, one defined by ethical, accountable leadership that delivers real results for the people,"" Higgins said in a statement after the voivtory, promising to lead a government “that finally earns the public’s trust,” as cited by NYT.Although Miami’s elections are officially nonpartisan, both major parties played an active role in the campaign. US President Donald Trump endorsed González, while the Democratic National Committee backed Higgins. In the days leading up to the vote, several prominent national Democrats traveled to Miami to campaign alongside her, an unusual show of support for a low-turnout, off-year local election.Higgins secured victory the victory after topping the first round of voting on November 4, where she received 35 per cent of the vote compared to González’s 19 per cent.Higgins will make history as Miami’s first female mayor and its first non-Hispanic mayor since the 1990s, breaking a three-decade dominance of Cuban American Republicans in city politics.Higgins, a trained mechanical engineer and former Peace Corps director in Belize, previously represented what she described as a Republican-leaning district on the county commission.She also holds a Master of Business Administration from Cornell University’s Johnson Graduate School of Management.On the campaign trail, she pledged to focus on addressing residents’ everyday concerns if elected, as cited by Politico.Higgins had served as a well-known county commissioner for eight years, representing a district that included Miami’s downtown. In the November 4 election, she also secured the top spot across all five of the city’s commission districts.She received a social media endorsement from former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, who is a former mayor and was a 2020 presidential candidate.She also led in all five of the city’s commission districts and will succeed outgoing Mayor Francis Suarez, who had briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination, as cited by the NYT.Miami, home to roughly half a million residents, is Florida’s second-largest city after Jacksonville. While the city, like the state, has trended Republican in recent election cycles, Higgins’ Democratic victory stands out as particularly notable.","Eileen Higgins, a former county commissioner, defeated Republican Emilio González in Tuesday's runoff.

Biggest ever US travel ban in the works?

The United States is planning to expand the number of countries that were covered by its travel ban - and the new list may include over 30 countries.US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, on Thursday, during an interview on Fox News’ The Ingraham Angle, when asked whether President Donald Trump’s administration would increase the number to 32, she said “I won’t be specific on the number, but it’s over 30, and the president is continuing to evaluate countries. ""In June, Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats, Reuters reported.The bans applied to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travellers.Noem did not specify which countries would be added to the list. “If they don’t have a stable government there, if they don’t have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” she said.Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was considering banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable.An expansion of the list would mark a further escalation of migration measures the administration had taken since the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week.Investigators said the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement programme under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting. Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” although he did not identify any by name or define “third-world countries.”Prior to that, officials from the Department of Homeland Security said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the administration of his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, and Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries. Since returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border. His administration has frequently highlighted the deportation push, but until now it has put less emphasis on efforts to reshape legal immigration.","US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the president is 'continuing to evaluate countries' In June, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States.

Survivors were in 'clear distress'

Survivors were trying to 'stay in the fight'

Trump says Pete 'didn't know what people were talking about'





Two people who survived the September 2nd US strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean were seen waving before they were killed in a second follow-up strike, sources familiar with a video shown to lawmakers revealed.One source said the gestures could be interpreted as the survivors either calling for help or surrendering to avoid another strike.The operation was the first of more than 20 US attacks on suspected drug-carrying vessels under the Trump administration. The GOP leader has defended the campaign as a necessary way to curb narcotics trafficking. However, the premise remains legally questionable. The Pentagon has reported that more than 80 people have died in these strikes, including 11 in the initial September 2 attack.Members of Congress were shown video of the strikes, including the follow-up attack that killed the two survivors, during a closed-door briefing with the operation's commander, Adm. Mitch Bradley, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, according to CBS News.Democratic Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut described the scene as one of the most difficult things hes ever seen in his life. He said the survivors appeared “in clear distress without any means of locomotion.”Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas defended the strikes. He said the survivors were “trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight” and clarified that the strikes were “entirely lawful and needful.”US President Donald Trump hinted he would support releasing the video to the public, but denied knowledge of any order given to target survivors. “I don't know that that happened. And Pete said he did not want that — he didn't even know what people were talking about. We'll look into it. But no, I wouldn't have wanted that. Not a second strike,” he said.Trump has also said that Venezuela’s airspace should now be considered “closed” amid rising tensions.Defensed department officials have defended the operations as legal and necessary. Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told The Washington Post that “ongoing operations to dismantle narcoterrorism and to protect the Homeland from deadly drugs have been a resounding success.”Defense secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes were “lethal, kinetic strikes” aimed at stopping drug trafficking and destroying vessels affiliated with “Designated Terrorist Organisations.”Legal experts and lawmakers have expressed concern that targeting survivors could constitute a war crime.","Survivors seen waving before they were killed in a second follow-up strike.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday evening hosted the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees in the Oval Office for a medal-presentation ceremony.“This is a great evening, it’s a great honour,” Trump said. “And I’m delighted to welcome to the Oval Office – the world-famous, most famous office in the world, most powerful office in the world – our truly exceptional 2025 Kennedy Center honorees. ”Trump said the honorees “inspired, uplifted and unified millions and millions of Americans”, calling them “the most accomplished and renowned class of Kennedy Center honorees ever assembled”.Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell stood behind Trump as the President presented the medals. Grenell, who was appointed by Trump in February this year to head the centre, is also a special envoy to Latin America for the administration.This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone , singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford , Guardian reported.The medallions to the honorees were “re-designed” by Tiffany and Co, Trump said. “They have done a fantastic job, they’re wonderful people – I know them very well because they’re right next to Trump Tower, I’ve lived with them many years,” he said.Trump never visited the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in his first term, and did not take part in its annual awards programme.But he has taken a keen interest in his second. Since taking office, he has ousted the Kennedy Center’s board of trustees and replaced them with supporters. He has promised to “fully renovate” the Kennedy Center’s infrastructure, and make it a “crown jewel” of arts and culture in the US.It was unclear how this year’s honorees were chosen, but Trump said in August when presenting the list that he had been “about 98% involved”.The Kennedy Center Honors programme and its series of tribute performances for each recipient is set to be taped on Sunday, and will be broadcast later in December.The President said in August that he would host the show, and Trump on Saturday set expectations high: “I believe – and I’m going to make a prediction: this will be the highest-rated show that they’ve ever done,” Trump said about Sunday’s event during the medal ceremony. “And they’ve gotten some pretty good ratings. But there’s nothing like what’s going to happen tomorrow night.”Presidents traditionally attend the programme, but none has ever presented the show, a fact Trump appeared aware of as well. “We never had a president hosting the awards before, this is a first. I’m sure they’ll give me great reviews, right?” Trump quipped. “No, we’ll do fine. I’ve watched some of the people that host. Jimmy Kimmel was horrible.”“If I can’t beat out Jimmy Kimmel in terms of talent, then I don’t think I should be President,” Trump added.","US President Donald Trump hosted the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees in the Oval Office for a medal-presentation ceremony.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled his long-anticipated “gold card,” a high-priced immigration offering designed to grant legal status, and eventually US citizenship, to individuals and companies willing to pay significant sums.Framed as a replacement for the three-decade-old EB-5 investor visa, the new programme opens the door to permanent residency for foreign nationals ready to invest $1 million personally or $2 million through their employers. Trump has cast the gold card as a way to attract the world’s “best people,” pitching it not only as a magnet for elite graduates from US universities but also as a revenue generator for the federal government.The rollout comes against the backdrop of Trump’s strict immigration crackdowns. Even as his government has pursued mass deportations and tightened border controls, Trump has repeatedly argued that exceptional foreign-born talent should be allowed to stay.""THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT’S TRUMP GOLD CARD IS HERE TODAY!

Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Despite its branding, the “gold card” is essentially a revamped green card, but one that Trump touts as “much better” and offering a “stronger path.”Holders receive permanent legal residency, meaning they can live and work in the United States indefinitely and, over time, pursue US citizenship.Unlike the EB-5 programme, which hinges on job-creation requirements, the new card’s criteria appear streamlined: payment of the required fee and completion of background vetting.Green Cards are accessible via multiple routes including sponsorship, lotteries, or EB-5 investments starting at $800,000 with job creation requirements. Gold Cards require a $5 million direct payment (or sometimes cited as $1 million for a base version), bypassing traditional processes for faster approval aimed at economic benefit.Under the Gold Card program, a successful applicant would receive lawful permanent resident status under the EB-1 or EB-2 visa categories, as determined by the US department of homeland security and subject to availability.One of Trump’s central arguments for the programme is its ability to retain highly skilled graduates from US universities, particularly those from China, India, and France.Businesses, he has said, routinely lose world-class candidates because their visa status is uncertain. The gold card aims to remove that barrier, offering companies the opportunity to secure permanent residency for prized recruits, with each card tied to a single individual.""Tremendous people won't have to say they graduated from college and have to go back to India, China, France; we're taking care of that,"" Trump said as he launched the card.""You can't hire people from the best colleges because you don't know whether or not you can keep the person,"" the US president said.Every application includes a $15,000 vetting fee to fund thorough background checks, according to commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.The administration has framed this level of scrutiny as ensuring only top-qualifying individuals obtain residency.Meanwhile, Trump emphasized the programme’s fiscal upside, promising all proceeds will go directly to the US government to fund “positive” national initiatives.Unlike the EB-5 system it replaces, the gold card comes with no stated requirements for job creation by investors or employers.Trump’s announcement also omitted any reference to annual caps or limitations on the number of cards available.This leaves questions about oversight, scalability, and how the programme fits into broader immigration policy frameworks.While corporations can purchase multiple cards, each one applies to only one employee, meaning costs scale directly with the number of hires.Companies seeking to retain multiple foreign-born graduates could find themselves paying millions, a model that favors well-capitalized employers and wealthy individuals but may not help smaller firms struggling with talent shortages.Despite Trump’s hardline stance on immigration elsewhere, the gold card neither resolves nor escapes the political tensions within his base.Critics within the MAGA movement have objected to policies that increase legal immigration, even in selective forms.Although framed as “bringing in the best people,” the programme does not address broader concerns around fairness, accessibility, or the treatment of immigrants without wealth or elite credentials.","US President Donald Trump unveiled his long-anticipated ‘gold card’ The programme is designed to grant legal status, and eventually US citizenship, to individuals and companies willing to pay significant sums. Trump has cast the gold card as a way to attract the world’s “best people,” pitching it not only as a magnet for elite graduates from US universities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125901082,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
"Republicans plan to let Obamacare subsidies lapse, threatening coverage for 24 million Americans",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/republicans-plan-to-let-obamacare-subsidies-lapse-threatening-coverage-for-24-million-americans/articleshow/125900554.cms,"



US House Speaker Mike Johnson said the House of Representatives would not vote to extend the enhanced tax credits for Obamacare, leaving more than 22 million Americans at risk of losing their health insurance.He added that instead the GOP planned to introduce its own health care legislation, as Senate Republicans prepared to vote on their own plan on Thursday.Johnson told reporters, “In the coming days, what you’re going to see is the other party, the Republican Party, continuing to do the important work that we’ve already begun to actually lower the cost of health care and reduce fraud.” He went on, “Democrats won’t, remember, they don’t actually want to fix this problem,” and said, “But you’re going to see a package come together that’ll be on the floor next week.”Anywhere between 22 million and 24 million Americans receive their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance marketplace. In 2021, the Biden administration expanded tax credits for the marketplace during the Covid-19 pandemic. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act extended the subsidies for an additional three years until the end of this month.On Thursday, Senate Republicans were set to vote on legislation by Senators Bill Cassidy (R-La.)and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho).The bill would transfer some of the subsidy money into health savings accounts to purchase bronze or catastrophic health care plans and would ban the funds from being used for abortions or gender transition care.It would also prevent transition care from being deemed an essential health benefit for plans sold on the ACA marketplace and bar Medicaid from covering either service. Republican leaders had previously attempted to insert similar language in the One Big, Beautiful Bill, but it failed.The plan faced significant opposition in the Senate, where Democrats almost uniformly opposed the legislation and 60 votes would be required to advance it. “I mean, if the Senate can’t move something with 60 votes, I mean, that seems to be an even bigger problem,” Representative Dusty Johnson of South Dakota told The Independent.Senator Susan Collins said she was still examining the specifics of the Cassidy-Crapo proposal, and Senator Lisa Murkowski added, “A lot of us still have questions about implementation of some of it, but I think it's important that the Republicans are hopefully going to be putting a plan out You need one.”Meanwhile, many House Republicans, including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, criticised Johnson for not producing a plan to prevent premiums from doubling or even tripling for their constituents. Health care was one of a number of pressing items for the GOP, which controls both the House and the Senate. Congress must also pass its annual defence bill, the National Defence Authorisation Act, before the end of the year, and will again vote on legislation to keep the govt open at the end of January.","US House Speaker Mike Johnson said the House of Representatives would not vote to extend the enhanced tax credits for Obamacare.

Southeast Asia On Edge: Thailand Conducts Airstrikes On Cambodia; Trump Brokered Peace Deal In Peril





Renewed border fighting between Thailand and Cambodia showed no signs of abating Wednesday, with hundreds of thousands of displaced people in strained conditions as more flooded into temporary shelters. The fighting triggered by longstanding territorial disputes followed a skirmish Sunday that derailed a ceasefire pushed by US President Donald Trump that ended five days of combat in July. Trump late Tuesday said he would use his sway to end the fighting. “I’ll have to make a phone call,” he said.Thailand PM Anutin Charnvirakul said Wednesday that the US had not contacted Thailand. He did not seem to rule out talks with Cambodia, but said he would not do so simply at the request of Trump, to whom he first wants to explain Thailand’s position.","Thailand PM Anutin Charnvirakul said Wednesday that the US had not contacted Thailand.

And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars,” Musk said on the podcast. “We were a little bit successful. We were somewhat successful. We stopped a lot of funding that really just made no sense, that was entirely wasteful,” Musk said. Asked if he would go back and lead DOGE again, Musk said: “No, I don’t think so.”Musk’s work for DOGE also sparked concerns among investors that he was not paying enough attention to Tesla as it faced slowing sales.

WASHINGTON:





A US trade agreement reached with Indonesia in July is at risk of collapsing because Jakarta has backtracked on several commitments it made as part of the deal, a US official said on Tuesday.“They’re reneging on what we agreed to in July,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, giving no details about which specific commitments Indonesia was now questioning. Asked about the comments, Indonesian officials said on Wednesday that the talks between two sides are still ongoing, with no specific issues arising during negotiations.“Dynamics in the negotiation process are normal.The Indonesian govt hopes that an agreement can be reached soon that is beneficial to both parties,” said Haryo Limanseto, a spokesperson for Indonesia’s ministry for economic affairs.The two countries in July said Indonesia agreed to eliminate tariffs on more than 99% of US goods and scrap all non-tariff barriers facing American firms, while the US will drop threatened tariffs on Indonesian products to 19% from 32%. But Indonesian officials have told US trade representative Jamieson Greer that Jakarta cannot agree to some binding commitments and wants to reframe them, the US official said.","Jakarta has backtracked on several commitments it made as part of the deal, a US official said.

CIA pressure tactics revisited amid renewed scrutiny

Social media reactions

“Couple of agents who couldn’t be blackmailed are spilling the beans on Brennan.”

“Epstein and Brennan – bread and butter.”

“This guy and all like him belong in prison.”

“I don’t understand this story, because blackmailing people seems like his favorite thing to do based on his actions.”

“The semantic restructuring of ‘blackmail’ into ‘national security’ is a clear example of linguistic compartmentalization used to justify non-ethical control mechanisms.”

“If you quit spying for them, then they use the evidence that you spied for them to put you in prison.”

“Anybody ever watch American Made? Seems to confirm these sorts of tactics. And they hung Barry Seals out to dry.”

“CIA blackmail? John Brennan says it’s ‘national security,’ not blackmail.”

“Shouldn’t the CIA be abolished after the abhorrences and illegal activities it has done?”

“That dude is the best blackmailer of all, right up there with Epstein… no doubt!”





A resurfaced interview with former CIA Director John Brennan has gone viral after he described how CIA instructors used financial leverage to pressure foreign agents into continued espionage. Brennan recalled being told during training that reminding agents of money they had accepted from the agency, often at the point of recruitment, could be used to “scare” them into continuing their work. Instructors defended the tactic as essential to national security rather than a form of blackmail.The viral clip features Brennan recounting how he questioned the ethics of such methods, only to be told that “it’s not blackmail” because the tactics served the security interests of the United States. He explained that agents often sign documents acknowledging CIA payments, and instructors said this acknowledgement could later be used to keep them cooperating if they hesitated or attempted to leave.The approach Brennan described resembles methods discussed in declassified CIA training materials, such as the 1983 Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual, which outlines how financial and other dependencies can influence agent compliance without overt coercion. This serves as a contextual comparison, not a documented link between Brennan’s specific training scenario and that manual. The manual is no longer in use but remains central to debates about intelligence-agency conduct and the ethical boundaries of recruitment and control.",A resurfaced interview with former CIA Director John Brennan has gone viral after he described how CIA instructors used financial leverage to pressure foreign agents into continued espionage.

Erika Kirk was seen furious as she addressed the unrelenting rumors going on about Charlie Kirk 's assassination.

'Please do not...': Stranded Indian H-1B's request on Reddit goes viral amid visa chaos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/please-do-not-stranded-indian-h-1bs-request-on-reddit-goes-viral-amid-visa-chaos/articleshow/125896961.cms,"Major fallout of visa appointment cancelations in India

Social media vetting of H-1B candidates will begin on December 15. Consular offices in Hyderabad and Chennai process hundreds of visa appointments every day.

The administration announced that they need to reduce the number per day as officers will now have to vet the social media accounts of every candidate and so it will take time.

Appointments of mid-December were canceled and rescheduled to March 2026, at the earliest.

Visa stamping is done in the home country, according to a new rule. So a number of H-1B candidates took their appointments in India and flew home, coinciding with the holiday season in the US.

Days before their scheduled appointments, they got to know that those dates have been deferred to March, April, May etc.

Many H-1B visa holders won't be able to enter the US without the stamping. So they have no other option than to remain stuck in India waiting for their appointment date in 2026.

H-1B candidates, according to lawyers, can be allowed to work from India but that also depends on their employers. And many are scared that they will lose their jobs.

Lawyers have advised that those who are in the US and thinking of taking an appointment for visa stamping should not leave the country as the situation is volatile, and leaving the country now means they would not be able to be back for at least six months.

A Reddit post went viral as the Redditor urged Indians in the US who have their appointments in India in January, February to cancel those appointments so that some dates free up and those who are stuck in India can possibly get an early chance.

Many H-1B candidates in the US responded to the post saying that this could become the only solution to the visa mess now in India and many said they already canceled their dates in December, January and February.

As hundreds of H-1B visa holders have been left with no other option other than biding their time in India as the US State Department canceled maximum visa appointments of December and rescheduled them to March 2026, a request from a Redditor has gone viral. The Redditor urged fellow Indians who are in the US to cancel their appointments for January or February so that those who are stuck in India get an early chance for their visa appointments. The request resonated with many on social media as the unprecedented decision from the US administration even left immigration attorneys confused as they don't know what should be done in the present situation.",Social media vetting of H-1B candidates will begin on December 15.

Calls To ‘Send Usha Back’ Erupt After JD Vance’s Immigration Remark Sparks Fierce National Outrage

Why the rumour spread so quickly

The couple’s response

Verdict





A photo circulating online recently ignited rumours that US Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, had a public argument in a restaurant. The image appeared to show a tense exchange between a man resembling Vance and a woman with her head turned away. Within hours, social platforms filled with speculation about the couple’s marriage, but the vice president himself shut the rumour down.JD Vance addressed the photo directly, dismissing it with sarcasm. “I always wear an undershirt when I go out in public to have a fight loudly with my wife,” he wrote on X, mocking the idea that the image represented a real incident. His remark emphasised that the picture, which circulated widely over the weekend, does not depict an actual argument between him and Usha.The photo had been shared by Thomas Clay Jr., an online political influencer, who claimed it showed the couple in a heated exchange. Clay later said he did not create the image. Independent AI image detection tools flagged the picture as likely fabricated, and no witness accounts or verifiable evidence place JD and Usha Vance in such a confrontation.Speculation about the couple had been simmering for months. In October, JD Vance drew attention after expressing his hope that Usha, who is Hindu, would eventually share his Christian faith.The remark sparked debate and fuelled scrutiny of their relationship. Shortly afterwards, Usha was photographed without her wedding ring, prompting further online chatter.Vance has said the couple is unbothered by the speculation and even finds some of it amusing. He explained that Usha simply forgot her ring in the rush of leaving for the White House, adding that they expected online rumours to erupt but chose not to let it disrupt their routine.According to Vance, he and Usha are focused on their young family, three children aged 3, 5 and 8, and have no interest in entertaining baseless gossip. He noted that the viral cycle surrounding the supposed restaurant incident was “kind of funny” to them, reinforcing his stance that the photo is not real and that the marriage remains stable.There is no credible evidence that JD and Usha Vance had a public argument in a restaurant. The image fueling the rumour appears to be AI generated, and JD Vance himself has clearly denied the incident. With no verifiable footage, witnesses or reliable details to support the claim, the story remains nothing more than an online fabrication amplified by pre-existing speculation about the couple.","US Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, have been the subject of rumours about their marriage.

Pakistan Army Spokesperson Faces Backlash for Winking at Reporter in Viral Video





Pakistan’s military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has come under widespread criticism after he appeared to wink at a journalist following her question about imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan In the video, the reporter questions Chaudhry about the allegations against Khan, referring to him as a “national security threat” and “anti-state.”""How is it different from the past, or should we expect any development in the future?"" the journalist added.To this, the Chaudhary replied, ""and add a fourth point that you are missing: he is also a 'zehni mareez' (mental patient)."" Chaudhary then proceeded to smile and wink at the journalist.The video, now circulating widely on social media, has sparked widespread criticism, with users calling the gesture “shameless.”""This is how corrupt Pakistani military officers treats women... shameless!!"" a user on X said.Last week, Chaudhry criticised the imprisoned former prime minister, calling him “a mentally ill person,” “a narcissist,” and “a security risk,” while noting that it was for the government to determine how to deal with him, as cited by Dawn.During an hour-long media briefing, Chaudhry acknowledged that the military had never before taken such a clear public stance on a political leader, calling the move “unprecedented.”Chaudhry’s strongly worded press briefing came in response to Khan’s latest remarks against the military leadership, conveyed earlier this week through his sister, Uzma Khan, during a jail visit after weeks of limited access. The comments were later shared on Khan’s X account. Uzma told reporters that her brother was in good health but “very angry.”Imran Khan is currently lodged in Adiala Jail, where he was first sentenced to three years in prison in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Subsequent corruption convictions have extended his total jail term to 14 years, the longest imposed on him to date.Meanwhile, Pakistani government officials have dismissed rumours of Khan’s death in custody or a secret transfer from Adiala Jail, maintaining that he remains in the Rawalpindi facility and is in stable condition.","Pakistan Army Spokesperson Faces Backlash for Winking at Reporter in Viral Video.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





Pakistan’s defence ministry on Friday officially notified the appointment of Field Marshal Asim Munir as the country’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).The ""president, on the advice of the prime minister, is pleased to appoint Field Marshal Asim Munir (NI) M as the chief of army staff, concurrently the chief of defence forces for a tenure of five years,” the notification read, news agency PTI reported citing Dawn.This comes a day after President Asif Ali Zardari approved his appointment on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.According to the notification issued under Article 243 of Pakistan’s Constitution and the amended Pakistan Army Act, Munir will serve concurrently as Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces for a tenure of five years. The notification marks the most significant restructuring of Pakistan’s military command since the 1970s.The appointment follows the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment last month, which created the new CDF post to establish a unified command structure and enable faster decision-making in critical situations.The amendment also abolished the office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which had coordinated the tri-services since 1976. The CJCSC post formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.With the restructuring, operational, administrative and strategic authority of the armed forces has been consolidated into a single office headed by the CDF. The revised Article 243 provides that the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, will appoint the army chief, who will concurrently serve as the CDF.Munir was first appointed Army Chief in November 2022 for three years. His tenure was extended to five years in 2024 after amendments to the Pakistan Army Act.He was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal days after the four-day conflict with India in May, becoming only the second officer in Pakistan’s history to hold the rank after Field Marshal Ayub Khan.Alongside Munir’s notification, the defence ministry also confirmed a two-year extension for Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu. His extended tenure as Chief of the Air Staff will begin in March 2026 and continue till March 2028.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Munir on his “historic” appointment, saying his leadership had been pivotal in guiding Pakistan’s armed forces. He also praised the air chief for his command during recent operations. defence minister Khawaja Asif and other senior leaders also extended their congratulations, according to Dawn.Information minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan’s defence had strengthened with the establishment of a unified command. Dismissing speculation over the delay in the notification, he said rumours circulating on social and electronic media had proven baseless.Earlier uncertainty had followed the abolition of the CJCSC post and the end of Munir’s original three-year term in late November, leading to political speculation over upcoming four-star appointments. Government officials maintained that the delay was procedural and linked to the prime minister’s travel schedule.Explaining the significance of the new post, army spokesman Lt General Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry said the CDF headquarters would improve coordination across modern, multi-domain warfare involving land, sea, air, cyber, space and intelligence operations. He added that many countries already operate under similar unified command structures.Under the amended military laws, the five-year tenure of the first COAS-plus-CDF is deemed to begin from the date of notification, effectively resetting Munir’s term. The law also allows future reappointments or extensions of up to five years, creating the legal framework for continuity in leadership.The next major step under the new structure will be the appointment of the Commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), a four-star position responsible for strategic assets. The NSC commander will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the CDF.Meanwhile, law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the defence ministry is finalising a new organogram for the CDF to clearly define command flows between the CDF, the service chiefs and the newly created strategic command.Politically, the 27th Constitutional Amendment has drawn mixed reactions. While the ruling coalition hailed it as a step towards efficiency and national security, opposition leaders warned that it concentrates excessive power in the military and could weaken democratic and provincial autonomy.",Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions

Why Imran Khan still remains a threat to Asim Munir





PTI without Imran: Still a major force





PTI was barred from contesting the 2024 general elections.

Dozens of PTI leaders were detained.

PTI-backed independents still won more seats than any other group.

Popularity that has not faded





A 2023 Gallup Pakistan survey showed 61% of Pakistanis had a “good opinion” of him -- the highest rating among all national leaders as reported by Dawn.

Arab News quoted analysts saying Khan remains ""too politically relevant to sideline.""

Televised appearances that trigger unrest





Nationwide protests

Arson and clashes

Attacks on military installations, including the Corps Commander’s residence in Lahore

Nationwide mobile shutdowns and troop deployment

Why Pak army cannot 'eliminate' Imran Khan





Key factors keeping Khan politically alive:





Victimhood narrative: Solitary confinement and restricted access cast him as a political prisoner, a powerful image in Pakistan’s grievance-driven politics.

Mobilisation without presence: PTI’s digital machinery enables mass mobilisation even without Khan physically present.

Diaspora and social media influence: Global PTI networks amplify every statement, intensifying scrutiny on Pakistan’s military.

High-risk optics: Every court appearance or televised moment risks sparking unrest.

The state vs sentiment





The jail sentence - not the silence





Constitutional shift and expanding military power





Munir's foreign outreach and US engagement





Imran's strength: Mobilisation without access





Why the military needs more than power









Is Imran Khan still a threat to Asim Munir ? The question looms over Pakistan ’s power structure. Former Prime Minister and cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, now over two years into imprisonment, remains a potent challenge to army chief Asim Munir — whose rapid ascent and consolidation of authority have made him Pakistan’s de facto ruler.With Munir now elevated as the Pakistan's first chief of defence forces, commanding the army, navy and air force, his institutional power is at its strongest — yet the confrontation with Khan, even from behind bars, continues to shadow that authority. The two have been locked in a prolonged, deeply personal confrontation.Despite being confined, Khan has transformed from a jailed political leader into a symbolic and political counterweight to Munir’s expanding military-political dominance.Far from fading, the rivalry between the two men has only sharpened. Munir commands the state; Khan commands sentiment. And as the events of the last two years show, sentiment can be far harder to control.Imran Khan's incarceration has fuelled a narrative of persecution and martyrdom among supporters. Long spells of isolation, restrictions on visits, and recurring allegations of mistreatment have strengthened this perception, with some analysts warning that these measures risk backfiring.Imtiaz Gul, executive director of the Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), told Al Jazeera: ""The primary objective of blocking access and keeping Khan in solitary confinement is apparently meant to break him into (agreeing to) a compromise and neutralise the groundswell of anti-government sentiment.”Increasingly, barring visits to Khan is viewed not merely as a security decision, but as a political strategy that may harm the governing PML-N and reinforce Khan’s narrative of institutional overreach.Even without its leader on the ballot, PTI remains one of Pakistan's strongest political forces.PTI claims widespread rigging, accusing the government and military of manipulating the results, allegations echoed by several independent observers. The establishment denies all wrongdoing, but the perception of electoral injustice has only strengthened PTI’s street momentum.For perspective, Imran Khan’s PTI had won 151 seats in the 2018 elections, defeating Nawaz Sharif’s PML-N (81 seats) and PPP (54). That victory was hailed by PTI as ""the end of an era,"" breaking the decades-long political monopoly of the PML-N, PPP and the military establishment.Despite his imprisonment, Khan remains Pakistan’s most popular political figure.This enduring popularity, even at a time of complete political inability, poses a direct challenge to Munir's authority.Even brief, controlled public appearances continue to spark major political reactions.During the May 2023 unrest, Imran Khan's court appearance -- after his dramatic arrest by paramilitary forces -- showed him flashing a victory sign. The televised images spread instantly and triggered:These scenes were unprecedented not only for their scale but because the anger erupted in Punjab, the heart of Pakistan's military recruitment and administrative base.More recently, when false rumours about Khan’s death spread, PTI supporters mobilised across Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, again forcing an immediate government response.A leader who provokes unrest without speaking remains difficult to contain.An analysis in The Diplomat warns that the army ""cannot afford to eliminate"" a leader with deep political roots in Punjab.Such an act, the report cautions, could ""unleash one that the state may not survive.""Khan is ethnically Pashtun but politically anchored in Punjab, with support stretching across Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the diaspora. His arrest in 2023 showed that anger against the military establishment now emerges in Punjab.Eliminating him would not neutralise his influence; it would likely create a ""martyr"" of unprecedented scale.Munir commands the state apparatus. Khan commands sentiment.And in Pakistan, sentiment has repeatedly proved more enduring than power.No prime minister has survived a confrontation with the military, but no army chief has faced a jailed leader with such widespread support and political resilience.Since August 2023, Khan has faced a series of corruption and security-related cases. In January 2025, he received a 14-year sentence in a land-graft case, a verdict his supporters claim was engineered to keep him out of politics.Khan’s public statements from jail fuel the perception of political persecution. He has directly accused Munir of ""moral bankruptcy,"" and called him ""mentally unstable man"" claiming Pakistan's constitution and rule of law have collapsed under him: ""I have been kept in complete solitary confinement, locked inside a cell with no contact with a single human being for four weeks… even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been taken away from us. ""His family members have echoed concerns about his treatment. His sister, after visiting him, said he told her they were subjecting him to ""mental torture"" and held Asim Munir responsible.The recent 27th amendment -- widely called a ""constitutional coup"" -- has entrenched military dominance further. Munir's elevation as chief of defence forces gives him command over all three services.Mahmood Khan Achakzai, head of Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan, warned: ""There is no constitution in Pakistan now. No judiciary. No social contract. They have made one man into a king above all.""Months ago, Munir's increasing visibility included multiple meetings with Donald Trump. Munir even nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, crediting him with easing India–Pakistan high military tensions, a move driven by a desire for US recognition. Trump later referred to him as his ""favourite field marshal.""It is often assumed that political power requires physical presence. Imran's continuing influence disproves that assumption.His followers still speak of him not as a convicted convict, but as a leader wronged. The slogans, the sense of injustice, the personal stories -- all add up to mobilisation potential. And that potential doesn’t require Khan’s freedom; it only requires people’s belief.Statements from his family amplify this -- for instance, the anguish voiced by his son over not knowing whether his father is safe in jail. Such public airing of fear and trauma becomes a magnet for sympathy and solidarity.""Not knowing whether your father is safe, injured or even alive is a form of psychological torture,"" he had said in written remarks.However, Imran Khan's sister was eventually allowed to meet the former prime minister. After the visit, she said, ""Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he told me they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this.""For the military leadership under Asim Munir, the calculus is not just about brute strength, it is about legitimacy. Pakistan’s power dynamics have long relied on a veneer of neutrality: the idea that the army guards the system while politics handles politics. Overplaying that role risks shattering the illusion.From Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan to Zia-ul-Haq and Pervez Musharraf , every era of military rule reinforced the pattern: the army positioned itself not merely as a defender of borders, but as the ultimate arbiter of Pakistan's politics and identity.Each takeover was justified through narratives of chaos, corruption, or national security, allowing the establishment to retain dominance even during civilian periods. Today, under Asim Munir, this pattern continues in a more sophisticated form: instead of overt coups, power is exercised through constitutional engineering, judicial pressure, and political sidelining, most visibly in the dismantling of Imran Khan’s political career. The military’s quest is not only to command the state but to remain indispensable to its very definition.As long as Imran Khan remains a contested figure, not just legally, but symbolically, the army's claim to neutrality becomes harder to maintain.International pressure, media scrutiny, and internal dissent all rise with every heavy-handed move.Hence, the challenge for Munir may be deeper than suppressing one man, it is about managing optics, institutional trust and political fallout.",Is Imran Khan still a threat to Asim Munir? The question looms over Pakistan ’s power structure. Khan has transformed from a jailed political leader into a symbolic and political counterweight to Munir’s expanding military-political dominance.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125789753,imgsize-1800195,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-62.jpg"

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday formally appointed Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir as Pakistan’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) for a period of five years.The move follows the recent passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment on November 12, which created the post of CDF to unify command across the armed forces and streamline decision-making during critical situations.The newly created CDF replaces the abolished office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.President Zardari approved the recommendation submitted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for Munir’s appointment. A press release from the President’s office extended best wishes to Munir in his new role.The same release also announced a two-year extension in the service of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu, Chief of Air Staff, effective from the completion of his current tenure in March 2026.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the reforms “bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while maintaining military honour and tradition” and confirmed there were no legal or political obstacles to Munir’s appointment. He also stated that the Defence Ministry was preparing a new organogram for the CDF to reflect the changes.Field Marshal Munir, who was initially appointed as COAS in November 2022 for three years, had his tenure extended to five years in 2024.With this appointment, he assumes a historic dual role, serving simultaneously as Chief of Army Staff and the first Chief of Defence Forces, marking a significant shift in Pakistan’s military hierarchy and institutional structure.The 27th Constitutional Amendment elevates the army chief to the role of CDF with constitutional authority over all three branches of the military: army, navy and air force.It also introduces judicial reforms, including the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) to handle constitutional matters, allowing the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the amendment as a demonstration of national unity, highlighting the role of law enforcement in recent counterterrorism efforts.While the ruling coalition including PPP, PML-N, and MQM-P, supported the amendment, opposition parties criticized it as unconstitutional, warning it could concentrate excessive power in the military.PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan described it as the “Baku Amendments,” accusing the government of undermining democracy. PPP Senator Raza Rabbani warned the changes could damage provincial autonomy and roll back powers devolved under the 18th Amendment, according to Dawn.Following Munir’s appointment, the next key step will be appointing the commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), a four-star position previously under the CJCSC. The NSC commander will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the CDF.","President Asif Ali Zardari formally appointed Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir as Pakistan’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) for a period of five years.

Parallel governance, ‘parchi’ systems and water mafias





Several informal systems operated during this period:

The ‘Parchi’ System: Residents, businesses and even small schools were required to obtain a stamped permission slip or parchi from PAC offices to build, renovate, operate stalls or open new ventures. What looked like a routine approval process effectively served as taxation, a tool of surveillance and a means to regulate economic activity.

Water and Tanker Control: Amid persistent water shortages across Karachi, PAC factions captured key pipeline points and operated illegal hydrants. Water was sold through tankers at inflated rates, turning a basic utility into one of the most profitable sources of revenue for the gangs. Control over water distribution also gave PAC leverage over entire neighbourhoods.

Welfare Patronage and ‘Robin Hood’ Politics: A share of illicit earnings was used to sponsor madrassas, support religious events, organise football tournaments, fund community funerals and assist poor families. This welfare strategy deepened PAC’s influence and aligned it with PPP’s political base, reinforcing the perception of gang leaders as protectors rather than mere criminals.

PPP, the Bhuttos and the contested 'protector' narrative





A factual account of the events surrounding Benazir’s return and death underscores this point:

Karsaz bombing (18 October 2007): Benazir was in an open truck surrounded by PPP volunteers, not in a car. Her protection was largely handled by party workers and an informal crowd, not gang networks.

Assassination in Rawalpindi December, 27, 2007: At the time she was targeted, she was travelling in a white Toyota Land Cruiser driven by Javed Rehman, a trained PPP driver, not Rehman Dakait. No credible evidence links the gangster to her security detail.

Post-war Lyari: Quiet streets, unresolved questions









NEW DELHI: Karachi’s Lyari has long been associated with a dual identity. To its residents, it is the “mother of Karachi” – one of the city’s oldest settlements powered by dockworkers, truck drivers, boxers and footballers. To the rest of Pakistan, especially through the 1990s and 2000s, it came to signify something very different: a “mini Brazil” of football-obsessed alleys, heavily armed gangs, and extortion rackets, long branded as Karachi’s “wild west.”It is this layered, contradictory Lyari that Aditya Dhar’s recent 'Dhurandhar' turns into cinema. The film revolves around characters that seem to be inspired by gangster Rehman Dakait, police officer Chaudhry Aslam and a shadowy military-intelligence player resembling Ilyas Kashmiri (fictionalised as Major Iqbal). Alongside Pakistani security figures, the narrative hints at a foreign intelligence angle featuring an unnamed “Indian spy chief” — a character with echoes of a former top security official who, in real life, has been involved in covert roles in regional conflicts in Pakistan. These references remain ambiguous on screen, but they mirror real allegations that have circulated for years through local press conferences, dossiers and counterclaims on both sides of the border.Reacting to the controversy around Dhurandhar and the a case file in Delhi high court, Major Mohit Sharma’s brother, Madhur Sharma, said the petition was filed due to ongoing speculation that the film was inspired by the Ashok Chakra awardee’s life without any transparency from the makers. Madhur clarified that the family is not opposed to a film based on Major Sharma, but objected to the possibility of using his story without consent. “We would be proud if a film is made on him. Even in 2021, a film was announced and we supported the producers. He has left a legacy, and it should live on,” he said. The family maintains that they are only seeking clarity and dignity for the officer: “There is no benefit the parents are looking for… If the film is based on him, just say, ‘Sorry ma’am, we didn’t inform you.’ If not, say the hype is untrue.”The Delhi high court heard the plea filed by Major Sharma’s parents seeking a review before the film’s release. While the court did not stay the December 5 release of Dhurandhar, it acknowledged the legitimacy of the family’s concerns regarding similarities to a real-life officer without consent. The court referred the matter to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) for examination, noting the need for regulatory scrutiny before the film proceeds.Following the controversy, director Aditya Dhar issued a clarification on X addressed to the family. He wrote: “Hi, sir - our film Dhurandhar is not based on the life of braveheart Major Mohit Sharma AC(P) SM. This is an official clarification. I assure you, if we do make a biopic on Mohit sir in the future, we will do it with full consent and in complete consultation with the family, and in a way that truly honors his sacrifice for the nation and the legacy it has left for all of us. Jai Hind.”This blurred mix of fact, rumour and state narrative reflects Lyari’s history itself. For more than six decades, the neighbourhood has moved on two parallel tracks. One is a working-class community that powered Karachi’s docks, produced champion boxers and footballers, and remained a loyal base of the Pakistan People's Party ( PPP ). The other is a network of gangs and protection rackets that emerged from the hashish trade of the 1960s and later expanded into narcotics trafficking, extortion, land capture and control of water tankers.Successive governments, including PPP administrations, did not simply fight these groups; at various points they bargained with them, funded them or turned a blind eye. Leaders like Rehman Dakait, and later Uzair Baloch, acted not only as crime bosses but as political intermediaries who ran parallel governance under the banner of the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC), often brandishing PPP flags at their offices. As Taliban networks poured into Karachi in the 2000s and regional intelligence rivalries spilled into the city, Lyari’s gangs were no longer seen merely as enforcers protecting a vote bank — they were gradually treated as potential pieces in a wider security chessboard.With Dhurandhar reigniting attention, this story revisits how Lyari transformed from a labour colony to PPP stronghold to a battleground shaped by gang wars, state patronage, counter-terror operations and allegations of espionage. What emerges is not simply the tale of feared men, but the story of a neighbourhood where poverty, politics and competing security agendas turned everyday life into a prolonged and violent conflict.a long, violent war.Lyari is among the oldest continuously inhabited parts of Karachi and holds a foundational place in the city’s history. Long before Karachi became Pakistan’s financial hub, Lyari evolved as a working-class settlement dominated by Baloch communities who migrated from coastal and interior regions in search of livelihoods. During the 18th and 19th centuries, as the port emerged as the centre of colonial trade, Baloch labourers became indispensable to loading cargo, building roads and supporting maritime activities. This early dependence on manual workers gradually transformed Lyari into a labour colony closely interlinked with Karachi’s industrial and infrastructural growth.Despite its importance in sustaining the city’s economy, the locality remained neglected in terms of urban development. Narrow lanes, dense housing clusters, unreliable utilities and limited state services came to define its daily reality. Yet, Lyari’s social fabric remained strong: sports, community centres and local cultural traditions created a sense of belonging that distinguished it from other Karachi neighbourhoods.In politics, Lyari’s identity further crystallised with the rise of the Pakistan People's Party. Since the 1970s, the PPP’s populist messaging—centred on economic justice and empowerment of marginalised groups—found deep resonance in Lyari. During decades of shifting political power in Karachi, the locality consistently returned PPP candidates to provincial and national assemblies. This loyalty turned Lyari into the party’s most dependable urban stronghold, a constituency where electoral victories were seldom in doubt.Over time, however, this relationship between Lyari and the PPP took a complex turn. As Karachi’s security landscape deteriorated in the 1980s and 1990s, the party increasingly relied on local strongmen, community leaders and later armed groups to maintain influence and protect its vote bank. Patronage networks developed, blurring the lines between politics, street authority and organised crime. What began as a working-class community with a vibrant political identity would eventually become the focal point of Karachi’s most violent gang conflict—one in which loyalty, power and criminality became deeply entangled.The roots of the Lyari gang war go back to the 1960s, when the area emerged as a key node in the local hashish trade. According to both journalistic and academic accounts, early figures like Dad Muhammad (“Dadal”) and his brother Sheru moved into the hashish business in the mid-1960s, challenging the dominance of an older drug boss known as “Kala Nag”.Kala Nag was eventually killed in what was officially described as a police encounter, and the hashish economy fragmented into rival factions. Violence at this stage largely revolved around knives and small arms, with public killings used to send messages and enforce territorial control.In the 1990s, a more educated generation of criminals appeared. One of the most prominent was Iqbal, known locally as “Babu Dacoit”, who reportedly held a Master’s degree in physics. Operating across a wider network, he ran drugs and other rackets while remaining largely beyond the reach of the police. His later arrest, when he was already paralysed, symbolised a shift from small-scale street crime to more organised, networked operations.A major shift in Lyari’s politics and crime landscape came with the ascent of Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch, widely known as Rehman Dakait. Born into a family already linked to smuggling networks, Rehman entered the criminal world at a young age. By the mid-1990s, he had developed a reputation for extreme violence, with local accounts even alleging that he murdered his own mother during a domestic dispute—an unverified but persistent story that reinforced his notoriety.By the early 2000s, Rehman had consolidated control over large parts of Lyari’s illicit economy, including drug trafficking, extortion and gambling rackets. Yet, he also cultivated an image as a benefactor. Oral histories, media reporting and academic studies describe how he funded small clinics, madrassas, football tournaments, neighbourhood parks and schools, using criminal proceeds to build patronage. This dual identity—provider and predator—helped him secure legitimacy among segments of the local population who felt abandoned by the state.Rehman’s rise coincided with Lyari’s continued loyalty to the PPP. As political competition intensified in Karachi, PPP leaders increasingly saw strategic value in a local armed actor who could protect the party’s dominance and mobilise votes. Political alignment, according to multiple accounts, allowed Rehman to operate with greater impunity and helped formalise gang influence under a new name: the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC).Formed around 2008, the PAC presented itself as a community “peace” organisation but functioned as an institutionalised version of Rehman’s operations. It opened offices, appointed local commanders, mediated disputes, collected protection money and distributed welfare. In a context of chronic state neglect, many residents began to rely on the PAC as a parallel administration, making it one of the most powerful non-state authorities Karachi had ever seen.The roots of Lyari’s modern gang war lie in an older conflict shaped by ransom kidnappings, shifting alliances and internal betrayals. In the 1980s and 1990s, parts of Lyari’s criminal economy were dominated by a figure known as Haji Lalu, with another notorious operator, Dadal, working as one of his trusted aides. Disputes over ransom money extorted from wealthy businessmen gradually fractured this relationship. The split laid the foundation for two rival blocs: one centred on Lalu and his son, Arshad Pappu, and the other aligned with Dadal’s family, including his son, Rehman Dakait.The rivalry intensified through the 1990s. Dadal’s murder—widely believed to have been carried out by a competing gang—created a vacuum that Rehman moved to fill, initially with Lalu’s support. But a later dispute over a substantial ransom sum allegedly taken behind Rehman’s back marked the end of that partnership. The fallout turned the former allies into adversaries, cementing a bitter feud between Rehman’s camp and that of Haji Lalu and Arshad Pappu.A separate event subsequently brought an important new actor onto the scene: Uzair Jan Baloch, the son of a transport businessman, Faiz Muhammad, known locally as Mama Faizu. According to both police records and local accounts, Faizu was kidnapped and killed in 2003 by men linked to Arshad Pappu. Uzair initially attempted to seek justice through legal channels but reportedly faced threats and obstruction. Sharing a common enemy in Pappu, he turned instead toward his cousin, Rehman Dakait, joining his organisation.Over the following years, the Rehman–Uzair alliance fought a sustained war against the Pappu–Lalu network. What began as a dispute over illicit profits evolved into a violent cycle of killings, reprisals and territorial battles. By the mid-2000s, the feud had escalated into one of the deadliest urban conflicts in Karachi, with casualties running into the hundreds and paving the way for a new era of militarised gang politics.With the rise of Rehman Dakait and, later, Uzair Baloch, the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC) grew beyond a criminal network and evolved into a parallel governance structure in Lyari. Between roughly 2008 and 2013, researchers describe Lyari as effectively under PAC’s informal administration, with neighbourhood “commanders’’ exercising authority over small jurisdictions. These commanders managed disputes, issued permissions and collected funds in a manner that closely resembled state functions.These overlapping spheres blurred boundaries between state actors and non-state power. PAC offices routinely displayed both their own banners and PPP flags, while police operations in Lyari were often delayed, curtailed or influenced by political pressure. For a period, the PAC did not simply challenge state authority—it partially replaced it.Within Lyari, Rehman Dakait was widely viewed as being closely aligned with senior leaders of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP). Journalistic reporting and local accounts repeatedly describe him as someone who maintained proximity to the Bhutto leadership and attended major PPP political events.A popular narrative in Lyari claims that Rehman “saved” former prime minister Benazir Bhutto during the 18 October 2007 Karsaz attack in Karachi, when two explosions targeted her homecoming procession. In these accounts, Rehman is portrayed as part of an informal security circle that helped her escape following the blast. The story has fuelled his “protector” image and contributed to his Robin Hood-style mystique.However, despite the narrative’s frequency in oral history, there is no independent, verifiable evidence confirming that Rehman personally rescued Benazir or served as her driver or official security guard at any point. What is more clearly documented is the broader political relationship: Lyari’s gangs and the PPP operated in a framework of mutual benefit for years, with the party relying on armed control of the constituency and the gangs receiving political space to operate.After the PPP returned to power in 2008, Rehman publicly rebranded himself as Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch, presenting the Peoples’ Aman Committee as a community organisation rather than a gang body. His growing political visibility, and reported sympathies with certain Baloch nationalist circles, are believed by some analysts and residents to have contributed to his killing in a controversial police “encounter” in 2009.As media scrutiny of Lyari intensified and gang violence spread to other parts of Karachi, state pressure began to mount. At the centre of this response was SSP Chaudhry Aslam Khan, an officer in the Crime Investigation Department (CID) known for aggressive policing tactics. Aslam cultivated a reputation as an “encounter specialist,” targeting both militant groups and organised crime. His public stance against Lyari gangs put him in direct confrontation with Rehman Dakait, who by the mid-2000s had become one of the most influential figures in Karachi’s underworld.Law enforcement records and press reports from the period describe a tense cat-and-mouse dynamic between the two men. Rehman repeatedly evaded capture; in at least two documented incidents, he escaped custody after allegedly bribing police officers. According to local media accounts and later investigations, Rehman paid select CID and jail officials to secure temporary releases or avoid charges, a practice facilitated by weak internal oversight and political protection. These incidents contributed to Aslam’s personal resolve. Journalists covering Karachi’s crime beat recall that Aslam increasingly framed the pursuit of Rehman as a matter of professional and personal credibility for the police force.On 9 August 2009, police announced that Rehman had been killed in a shootout near Steel Town, on Karachi’s outskirts. Officials claimed that Rehman and three accomplices opened fire on police and were killed in retaliatory fire. However, from the outset, rights groups and local residents questioned the official account. Activists, lawyers and researchers later described the killing as a likely extrajudicial execution, consistent with a broader pattern of “encounters” used in Karachi to bypass a slow judicial system and fragile witness protections.With Rehman removed, the gang landscape did not stabilise. Instead, the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC), which he had informally led, underwent a leadership transition. Within weeks, Uzair Jan Baloch was positioned as Rehman’s successor, assuming both the criminal networks and the political connections tied to PPP support. Unlike Rehman, whose authority rested heavily on personality and charisma, Uzair’s tenure was marked by greater bureaucratisation—defined commanders, more formalised extortion systems and deeper conflict with the state. This period would set the stage for some of the bloodiest episodes of the Lyari gang war.After Rehman Dakait’s killing in 2009, leadership of the Lyari network did not pass smoothly to a single successor. Uzair Jan Baloch projected himself as the political head of the organisation: educated, relatively well-spoken, and comfortable appearing alongside PPP leaders. His image contrasted sharply with the operational commander Noor Muhammad, better known as “Baba Ladla”, who had a reputation for ruthlessness built over years as an enforcer in neighbourhood turf battles.Initially, the two worked side by side under the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC) banner. But disagreements over extortion routes, neighbourhood control and access to political patrons gradually turned into open rivalry. Within Lyari, some commanders gravitated toward Uzair’s political authority and alleged links to provincial leadership; others aligned with Baba Ladla’s street power. This divide transformed PAC from a single entity into competing armed factions.The conflict reached its most infamous moment in March 2013, with the killing of rival gangster Arshad Pappu. According to court filings and media reporting, Pappu and his brother Yasir Arafat were abducted from Karachi’s Defence neighbourhood and taken to Lyari. Both were tortured, killed and later mutilated. Their remains were reportedly burned and dumped—widely interpreted as Uzair’s retaliation for the killing of his father, Faiz Muhammad. Some later accounts, including police dossiers and local testimonies, alleged that gang members kicked or played football with severed heads, turning the murders into a grim public spectacle that circulated in local narratives.By this stage, the greatest toll fell on ordinary residents. Prolonged firefights between splinter factions left neighbourhoods barricaded for days. Homes and small businesses were commandeered as torture rooms or lookout posts. Young men were coerced into gang recruitment, teachers and shopkeepers were forced to pay “taxes,” and ambulance workers trying to retrieve bodies were threatened by both sides. In response, the state increasingly turned to large-scale fires, sieges and heavy weaponry, culminating in the militarised crackdowns that would soon follow.In April–May 2012, the Sindh government initiated one of Karachi’s largest security actions against gang networks, later known as Operation Lyari. The police deployed thousands of personnel, armoured carriers and specialised units with the stated goal of clearing the area and arresting key commanders linked to the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC). For the first time, a formal state crackdown directly targeted the network that had operated for years through political patronage and parallel governance.The operation, however, quickly encountered intense resistance. Armed groups used heavy weaponry, including rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), to attack the advancing police. Several armoured personnel carriers were damaged or destroyed, and police units struggled to push through Lyari’s dense alleyways, where snipers and lookout positions gave gang members a tactical advantage. After several days of fighting, rising casualties, and growing criticism from political circles, the operation stalled. It ended without major arrests and was widely perceived as a failure that exposed both the state’s limitations and PAC’s entrenched power.For residents, the consequences were immediate and severe. Lyari was effectively sealed off for about a week, with restricted movement in and out of the neighbourhood. Power and water supplies were disrupted, markets were shut, and families already living under economic strain faced shortages of food and basic essentials. Humanitarian groups and ambulance services reported being blocked or delayed from providing aid, amid police suspicions that relief efforts could serve as a cover to transport weapons or militants.The failed siege deepened mistrust between civilians, gangs and the state. Many residents had already endured years of coercive “taxes” and violence under PAC rule; the security operation then subjected them to collective punishment, indiscriminate fire and deprivation. Instead of restoring confidence, the crackdown reinforced the perception that both the state and the gangs were willing to sacrifice ordinary people to protect their own interests.Even as Lyari’s gang networks fought prolonged turf wars, Karachi was simultaneously becoming a logistical base for militant organisations, particularly factions of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). As security operations intensified in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt, militants sought anonymity in large urban centres. Pashtun-majority neighbourhoods such as Sohrab Goth, Manghopir and SITE became key sanctuaries and transit corridors where fighters, explosives and finances could be moved with relative ease.The turning point came on 8 June 2014, when ten militants launched an armed assault on Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, using automatic weapons, grenades and a rocket launcher. The attack triggered an overnight battle that left at least 36 people dead, including all ten assailants. The incident severely embarrassed federal authorities and exposed vulnerabilities in Karachi’s security infrastructure. The scale of the attack underscored that the city’s violence was no longer just about gangs—it was also linked to national insurgency networks.In the aftermath, the state expanded its response. The federal and provincial governments granted Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) extensive policing and detention powers to target both militants and criminal networks. These operations aligned with ongoing national counterinsurgency campaigns, including Operation Zarb-e-Azb and later Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad, which aimed to dismantle militant networks and disrupt their finances and recruitment pipelines.In Karachi, this translated into a sustained, multi-year crackdown led by the Rangers. Tactical raids, mass arrests, prolonged detentions under special legal provisions and high-profile encounters became common features of urban policing. In Lyari, the result was a shrinking space for gangs to openly control territory. The Peoples’ Aman Committee and splinter factions still operated, but their public influence diminished as armed checkpoints, displays of heavy weaponry and enforced taxation became more difficult to sustain. Although pockets of violence persisted, the crackdown marked the beginning of the end of large, overt gang administrations in the city.One of the most high-profile casualties in the post-2014 security phase was SSP Chaudhry Aslam Khan, the police officer who had led major operations against both Lyari gangs and militant networks. On 9 January 2014, a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into Aslam’s convoy in Karachi, killing him and at least three others. The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility, calling the attack revenge for police operations against its fighters and financiers. Aslam’s death was widely perceived as a serious setback to the city’s counter-terror and anti-gang efforts, though operations continued under other police officers and with greater reliance on Pakistan Rangers (Sindh).For Lyari’s armed groups, the most decisive blow came three years later. Acting on intelligence reports, Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) launched a pre-dawn raid on 2 February 2017 in Phool Patti Lane, Lyari, targeting Noor Muhammad, better known as “Baba Ladla.” According to Rangers’ statements, a gun battle lasting over 30 minutes ensued, during which gang members used automatic weapons and grenades. By the end of the raid, Rangers announced that Baba Ladla and two close associates had been killed.Listed for years among Pakistan’s “most wanted” criminals, Baba Ladla faced cases ranging from murder and extortion to armed attacks on police and suspected collaborations with extremist groups. His death effectively dismantled a key pillar of the Uzair-era structure, removing the most prominent operational commander who had challenged both rivals inside Lyari and the security forces sent to eliminate them.By the mid-2010s, as state pressure intensified and gang structures were fractured by successive operations, Uzair Jan Baloch left Pakistan. In December 2015, Interpol arrested him at Dubai International Airport, reportedly while he was travelling from Muscat. He was subsequently handed over to Pakistani authorities and brought back to Karachi.From 2016 onward, Uzair was charged in dozens of criminal cases, ranging from murder and attempted murder to extortion, kidnapping and terrorism. Many of these cases have since resulted in acquittals due to lack of evidence, hostile witnesses or procedural weaknesses—a pattern that has long characterised Karachi’s organised crime trials, where intimidation makes witness testimony difficult.In April 2017, a new dimension emerged when the Pakistan Army took custody of Uzair to try him under military law. He was accused of espionage and leaking sensitive information to a foreign intelligence agency, reportedly linked to Iran. In April 2020, a military court sentenced him to 12 years in prison on espionage charges, marking a significant shift in how the state officially characterized him—not merely as a gang leader, but as a potential national security threat.Pakistani officials and segments of local media have occasionally linked Uzair’s alleged intelligence connections to the controversial case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Indian national sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court in 2017. One strand of narrative suggests that Uzair’s alleged contacts in Iran overlapped with networks also linked to Jadhav. However, India has rejected Pakistan’s claims in the Jadhav case as coerced and unsubstantiated, and publicly verifiable evidence connecting Uzair directly to operational support for Jadhav remains limited.What is clearer is that, from the perspective of the Pakistani state, Uzair Baloch’s profile evolved from that of a gang leader embedded in local politics to an alleged cross-border security risk—reshaping the narrative around Lyari’s gangs and their significance.As violence worsened and Lyari began drawing national and even international scrutiny, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) gradually shifted its stance on the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC). Between 2012 and 2013, amid pressure from rival parties, security agencies and media coverage, the PPP formally disowned the PAC, despite years of visible proximity.Senior party leaders later framed PAC figures as rogue actors or products of state neglect, arguing that they were not part of a deliberate political strategy. Critics, however—including journalists, residents and some researchers—contend that the PPP benefitted for years from PAC’s armed control of Lyari, only distancing itself once the political and reputational costs became unsustainable.This distancing reflected a broader shift: as the state redefined Lyari’s gangs from political intermediaries to security liabilities, political actors recalibrated their alliances. What had once been an informal partnership built on patronage and vote control became a liability in the age of counterterrorism and international scrutiny.Security indicators suggest that overt gang violence in Lyari has dropped sharply since the mid-2010s. Rangers-led operations, the removal or incarceration of key gang leaders such as Rehman, Uzair and Baba Ladla, and broader counter-terror campaigns have reduced the frequency of armed clashes and targeted killings in the area.The legacy of the Lyari gang war remains unfinished. For many families, the years of kidnappings, torture, blockades and forced recruitment left deep social and economic scars. Questions continue to surround extrajudicial killings, disappearances and the conduct of both the gangs and state agencies tasked with fighting them. Although large armed networks have been dismantled, traces of informal control and low-level criminality persist in new forms.At the same time, Lyari’s cultural and political identity is evolving again. The football grounds, community schools and cultural centres that once defined the neighbourhood are re-emerging, even as residents remain wary of new power brokers. In popular culture, recent portrayals such as Dhurandhar and other planned projects reflect an enduring public fascination with Lyari—its blurred boundaries between criminal groups, political actors and state security agencies, and the unanswered questions they leave behind.Seen in retrospect, the gang war was not merely the story of violent figures in a marginalised settlement. It grew out of structural inequality, weak state institutions and a political party’s reliance on armed intermediaries to protect its vote bank. As militancy and regional intelligence rivalries later intersected with local crime networks, a neighbourhood built from labour and sport became entangled in national security narratives.Lyari today is quieter, but its past continues to shape how residents understand politics, policing and protection. The names of Rehman Dakait, Uzair Baloch, Baba Ladla and Arshad Pappu remain part of local memory—sometimes condemned as criminals, sometimes recalled as flawed protectors, always as evidence of how quickly a working-class community can become a battleground when crime, politics and security policy converge.","Karachi’s Lyari has long been associated with a dual identity. To its residents, it is the ‘mother of Karachi’ – powered by dockworkers, truck drivers, boxers and footballers. To the rest of Pakistan, especially through the 1990s and 2000s, it came to signify something very different: a “mini Brazil” of football- obsessed alleys, heavily armed gangs, and extortion rackets. It is this layered, contradictory Lyari that Aditya Dhar's recent 'Dhurandhar' turns into cinema.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125768364,imgsize-87724,width-400,resizemode-4/lyari-gang-war.jpg"

'Munir Is A Mentally Unstable Man': Ex-Pakistan PM Imran Khan Blames Army Chief of Fueling Terrorism





Pakistan’s jailed former prime minister Imran Khan on Wednesday launched a sharp attack on the country’s army chief and de-facto ruler Asim Munir , calling him a ""mentally unstable man."" He also claimed that field marshal Munir’s policies were ""disastrous"" for Pakistan and accused him of intentionally ""igniting tensions"" with Afghanistan.The 73-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician shared these remarks on social media a day after his sister, Dr Uzma Khan, met him in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail. The meeting took place after more than a month, following “special permission” from Shehbaz Sharif ’s government, amid widespread rumours on social media about Imran’s health and safety after he was placed in solitary confinement.In a post on X written in Urdu, Khan said, “Asim Munir’s policies are disastrous for Pakistan. Because of his policies, terrorism has spiralled out of control that grieves me deeply.”He further alleged, “Asim Munir has no concern for Pakistan’s national interests. He is doing all this merely to please Western powers. He deliberately ignited tensions with Afghanistan so that he could be seen internationally as a so-called 'mujahid'.”The PTI founder said he had always opposed “drone attacks and military operations against own people in the country which he said would only fuel more terrorism.”He claimed, “Munir first threatened Afghans, then expelled refugees from Pakistan and carried out drone strikes whose consequences we now face in the form of rising terrorism.”Calling Munir a “mentally unstable man,” Khan alleged that the army chief’s “moral bankruptcy has led to the complete collapse of the Constitution and rule of law in Pakistan.”He also accused Munir of being behind the cases against him and his wife, saying they had been “imprisoned in fabricated cases and subjected to the worst form of psychological torture.”Khan described his prison conditions, saying, “I have been kept in complete solitary confinement, locked inside a cell with no contact with a single human being for four weeks. I was kept entirely cut off from the outside world, and even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been taken away from us.”He added that despite court orders, his meetings with political colleagues were stopped, and now even his access to lawyers and family had been cut off. “Pick up any human rights charter, psychological torture is considered 'torture' and is deemed even more severe than physical torture. My sister Noreen Niazi was dragged on the road simply for demanding her legitimate right to meet me,” he said.Khan praised Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi for showing courage during what he called an “environment of repression.” He wrote, “I ask him to continue to play on the front foot. There is no law or Constitution in this country. The law is enforced only against PTI as everyone else is exempt. Those threatening governor’s rule in KP should impose it today rather than tomorrow and then watch what happens to them. ”Speculation about Khan’s health had grown after an undeclared ban was imposed on meeting him. Uzma, after seeing her brother, said his health was “perfectly fine” but he was being subjected to “mental torture in solitary confinement.”“Praise be to Allah! His health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture,” she said.","Imran Khan says Asim Munir's policies are ""disastrous"" for Pakistan.

Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), state media reported on Wednesday.The loss-making airline is being privatised as part of a $7 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) program , which requires the federal government to reform or divest struggling state enterprises. A previous attempt to offload PIA last year was scrapped after the government failed to receive a sufficiently attractive offer.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with corporate entities and company representatives involved in the process, according to a press release shared by state broadcaster PTV News. “PIA’s bidding will take place on December 23, which will be broadcast live on all media. We are ensuring transparency and merit in the privatisation process,” the statement quoted him as saying.Sharif said the process was proceeding “smoothly” and argued that privatisation would help restore the airline’s “lost prestige,” align it with modern aviation requirements and facilitate the restoration of PIA’s global flight operations — a step he said was crucial for overseas Pakistanis.If completed, the transaction would mark Pakistan’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.Founded in October 1946, PIA is based at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, the country’s second-busiest airport and its largest city’s main aviation hub.","Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines.

Why is the protest happening?

Son demands proof of life

Imran Khan's sister filed a contempt of court in the IHC

What has the administration said?

In jail since August 2023





There has been absolutely no contact with Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan , which has intensified speculation about his possible death. Demanding access to the PTI founder, party members have decided to stage a protest despite the restrictions imposed by the Pakistan government.Following the PTI workers' announcement of protests outside the Islamabad High Court and Adiala Jail, Section 144 was enforced in both cities. However, the order has not deterred Imran Khan’s supporters. They declared their protest plans even as restrictions have been in place since November 18 for two months.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday declared that the party would stage a major protest outside the Islamabad High Court on Monday, followed by another demonstration outside Adiala Jail on Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference at the CM House, Afridi claimed that Imran Khan, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, has been held in “complete isolation” since November 4, with no one granted access to him.He said that Khan’s sisters, senior party leaders, lawyers, and even doctors have all been barred from meeting him, effectively placing him in total solitary confinement—a situation he described as “extremely alarming.”PTI leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan. After KP CM Afridi ordered the party members to immediately move to Islamabad, the party has also asked the supporters to gather outside the Adiala Jail later.Talking to reporters, Afridi said that on Tuesday, all parliamentarians would first gather at the IHC to stage a strong protest before the court’s chief justice, noting that despite judicial orders, he himself was not allowed to meet Khan.“This is blatant contempt of court. We will hold a protest at the IHC,” Afridi asserted.He said the parliamentarians would then move to Adiala Jail to attempt to meet Khan and to express solidarity with his sisters.Following the announcement of protests, the Rawalpindi deputy commissioner's office issued the notice on Monday that Section 144 shall be imposed in the city from December 1 to December 3. According to the notice, the order has been enforced on the basis of “imminent threats” identified by the district intelligence committee (DIC), particularly in and around sensitive installations, major roads and other critical infrastructure. The committee’s assessment underpinned the local government’s decision to restrict public gatherings during this period.The Rawalpindi notification prohibits all kinds of gatherings of more than five people. As per the statement, ""All kinds of Assemblies, Gatherings, Sits-in, Rallies, Processions, Demonstrations, Jalsas, Dharnas, Protests and such like other activities, i.e gathering of 05 or more persons.""""Carrying of weapons, spikes, laden batons, gaulails, ball bearings, petrol bombs, improvised explosives or any other instrument that could potentially be used for violence,"" is also listed as one of the restrictions in the notice.Along with these, pillion riding and the use of loudspeakers or display of ""arms and hatred speeches"" are also prohibited.The Islamabad district magistrate’s office issued the order after what it described as “certain segments of society … planning to organise unlawful assemblies … within the jurisdiction of Islamabad Capital Territory,” according to a report in Dawn. The announcement in Rawalpindi came through a notification from the deputy commissioner’s office, which cited security concerns due to potential large gatherings.In Islamabad, the order did not define what would constitute an “unlawful assembly” but noted that authorities deemed it “necessary to control such types of illegal activities which present a threat to public peace, tranquillity and maintenance of law & order.”Pakistan’s former Prime Minister has remained completely out of sight for more than six weeks, with neither his party members nor his family able to establish any direct contact during this period. His prolonged absence from public view has intensified anxiety across the country, fuelling widespread speculation and deepening fears about his safety.The lack of verified updates or appearances has further heightened concerns, with many questioning whether the politician-turned-cricketer may have become the target of a possible assassination attempt or is otherwise being kept in undisclosed conditions.Khan’s sons fear authorities may be hiding “something irreversible” about his condition. His son, Kasim Khan, told Reuters that the family has had no direct or verifiable contact with the jailed former Prime Minister, despite a court order allowing weekly meetings.“Not knowing whether your father is safe, harmed, or even alive is psychological torture,” he said, noting that there has been no independently confirmed communication for months.“We have no reliable information about his condition,” he added. “Our deepest fear is that something irreversible is being kept from us.”Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, filed a contempt of court petition in the IHC on November 28 against the Adiala Jail superintendent and other officials, alleging they prevented her from meeting her brother.Submitting the petition in the presence of Chief Minister Afridi, she cited the IHC’s March 24 order, which had restored a twice-weekly visitation schedule for the 73-year-old former prime minister.Pakistan government officials have rejected rumours that Imran Khan has died in custody or been quietly moved out of Adiala Jail, insisting he remains inside the Rawalpindi facility and is in stable condition.“There is no truth to claims of his transfer from Adiala Jail. He is in good health and receiving full medical care,” Geo News quoted Rawalpindi prison officials as saying.Imran Khan is currently being held in Adiala Jail, where a court first handed him a three-year prison term in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Since then, successive corruption convictions have pushed his total sentence to 14 years, the longest jail term imposed on him so far.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi claimed that Imran Khan has been held in “complete isolation” since November 4. Khan’s sisters, senior party leaders, lawyers, and even doctors have all been barred from meeting him.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125710838,imgsize-1508415,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

In a first, the Baloch Liberation Front (BLF) used a woman fidayeen operative to storm a heavily-guarded complex belonging to the Frontier Corps and housing a Chinese copper and gold mining project center located in Chagai, Balochistan. Six Pak personnel were reportedly killed in Sunday evening’s attack but there was no official word from the Pak authorities.The BLF also released the photo of the bomber, Zareena Rafiq aka Trang Mahoo, who detonated herself at the barrier to allow the rebel fighters to breach the main compound. The attack is significant because it is the first time the BLF has used a suicide bomber, a tactic exclusive to Majeed Brigade of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) which has carried out a series of attacks including the Jaffar Express hijack in the region.The fact that the complex was linked to the Saindak and Reko Diq projects, managed by Chinese companies and a Canadian firm, indicates the change in rebels’ strategy to strike high-value assets with geopolitical significance, sources said. In a statement released on Telegram, the BLF spokesperson Gwahram Baloch said that the Fidayeen operation was carried out by its ‘selfsacrifice’ unit, Saddo Operational Battalion (SOB), named after Martyred Commander Waja Sado aka Sadath Marri.Meanwhile the BLA released a statement on the wave of coordinated attacks carried out at multiple locations between Nov 28-29, claiming 27 Pak army personnel were killed in 29 attacks. The BLA also said it had taken control of motorways and seized weapons.BLA fighters struck the Pakistani army’s Coast Guard camp in the Pasni area of Gwadar with multiple grenade launchers. They targeted military intelligence personnel in the Jiwani area of Gwadar with a remote-controlled IED attack while they were returning after extorting money from vehicles, the BLA said. Another attack was on the residence of a Pakistani army major in Mastung city.Six blasts were reported at defence installations in Quetta as well.

Connectivity and the Northeast: Bangladesh provides the only viable transit route, via road, rail, and inland waterways, to India's landlocked Northeast region, bypassing the narrow and vulnerable Siliguri Corridor (or ""Chicken's Neck""). Cooperation is essential for India's economic integration and security in states like Tripura and Assam.

Security and Counter-Insurgency: The security cooperation under Sheikh Hasina (2009-2024) was monumental, resulting in a crackdown on separatist groups like ULFA and NDFB, which had previously used Bangladeshi soil as a sanctuary. The reversal of this cooperation would immediately reignite security threats across India's eastern border.

Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)

Jamaat-e-Islami (JI)

National Citizen Party (NCP)

The New Electoral Landscape: A Volatile Three-Way Race





Party Stance Stated Vote Intention (IRI Survey) Key Takeaway Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Center-Right, Anti-AL 30% - 33% Currently the frontrunner, but its lead is narrow and potentially vulnerable due to internal leadership issues (Khaleda Zia's health, Tarique Rahman's exile). Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) Hardline Islamist 26% - 29% Experiencing a major resurgence. Its share is surprisingly close to the BNP's, reflecting strong grassroots organization and a shift in anti-incumbency sentiment. National Citizens' Party (NCP) Student-Led Reformist ~6% The youth-led party that spearheaded the uprising is struggling to translate street power into electoral support, primarily due to weak organization and lack of resources. Awami League (AL) Banned Not polled as a direct option The ban removes the largest political force, fundamentally reshaping the contest.

Conclusion — a bilateral relationship at an inflection point









The February 2026 Bangladeshi general election is no ordinary democratic exercise; it is a vote on the country’s political future and a crucial deciding point for India's regional security.The street-led ""Monsoon Revolution"" of August 2024, which ended the 15-year rule of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, created a political vacuum that has fundamentally altered the domestic power structure and, by extension, the strategic equation with New Delhi.This vacuum, marked by the unprecedented exclusion of the country's most dominant party, leaves the field open to forces historically critical of India, signalling the end of the cosy, pro-India era and demanding a rapid re-evaluation of New Delhi’s policy towards its eastern neighbour.Bangladesh is not merely a neighbour; it is a geostrategic imperative for India, acting as the key bridge, market and security partner for the entire eastern subcontinent. The stability of Dhaka directly translates into the security of New Delhi.The strategic importance of the relationship is deeply understood by the public.As Dr Rehan, a physician and cultural activist, told TOI, ""People of Bangladesh follow the India-Bangladesh relationship from political, economic and cultural aspects.""This constant public scrutiny means any future government must prioritise visibly equitable outcomes in the bilateral relationship.The ousting of Sheikh Hasina was not merely a regime change in Dhaka but a collapse of a government sensitive to New Delhi’s concerns.A student movement that began in mid-2024 rapidly escalated into nationwide unrest. The protests, sparked by demands over quotas in public jobs and expanding to broader grievances, culminated in Hasina’s resignation on August 5, 2024 and her departure from the country amid violent clashes that left hundreds dead and thousands injured.Amid the accusations of foreign interference, the mass upheaval opened the door for an interim administration tasked with restoring order and arranging new elections, headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who emerged as a saviour amidst the political chaos.He became the ‘chief adviser’ of the interim government and started running the administration with the support of student leaders and advisers who emerged out of the revolution that ousted Hasina.Eventually, the unelected Yunus-led interim government decided to hold elections in February 2026 and to pursue legal and institutional reforms intended to reset Bangladesh’s political institutions.But in the months that followed, an administration headed by a personality that had the apparent support of democracy-loving and liberal countries, cancelled the Awami League’s registration — effectively barring it from contesting the next national vote.Citing the need for accountability for alleged crimes against humanity, the interim government—following amendments to the country's anti-terrorism laws—suspended the AL's registration and barred it from all political activities.“The ban on activities of this party is necessary to protect national security and sovereignty, ensure the safety of July Movement activists, and safeguard plaintiffs and witnesses of International Crimes Tribunal,” Shafiqul Alam, press secretary to chief adviser Muhammad Yunus, had said.Meanwhile, AL rejected the ban as ""illegal and unconstitutional"" and described the prosecution as politically motivated. “To ban the activities of the Awami League in Bangladesh means to exile the spirit, ideals, and core values of the Liberation War, and to empower the vulgar resurgence of anti-independence elements”, it said in a statement.The single most defining factor of the 2026 election is the ban on the Awami League (AL).This action removed the only consistently pro-India secular force, forcing its base to become the largest ""swing"" vote in the upcoming polls and fundamentally reshaping the electoral contest.Following Hasina’s convictionfor crimes against humanity and the death sentence handed down by the International Crimes Tribunal in November 2025, the matter of her continued exile in India has become the principal irritant in bilateral ties.AL, led for decades by Sheikh Hasina, had pursued a generally India-friendly foreign policy marked by cooperation on connectivity projects, cross-border security, trade liberalisation, and river and water-management dialogues.With the AL sidelined for now, three political forces have emerged as the most consequential contestants or kingmakers for the 2026 elections: the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), and the National Citizen Party (NCP), the political vehicle that coalesced from the 2024 student movement.The BNP, long the principal opposition to the Awami League and which had boycotted the 2024 elections, has been rebuilding organisationally and publicly announcing candidate slates for large numbers of constituencies in 2025.Led by the family of Khaleda Zia and the returning Tarique Rahman, the BNP frames the election as a return to multi-party democracy and its core philosophy of ""Bangladeshi Nationalism.""The party is heavily capitalising on the popular ""India Out"" sentiment, positioning itself as the defender of national sovereignty against perceived external interference.As per the Dhaka Tribune, BNP nominated candidates for 237 seats on December 3. This indicates the party is preparing to contest the election vigorously after years of marginalisation.Its political rhetoric tends to emphasise national sovereignty and a tougher posture on perceived external interference — language that has historically produced a more cautious view of India than AL’s cooperative stance — while remaining capable of pragmatic engagement on trade and security where it sees mutual benefit.In a notable recent development, PM Modi publicly expressed concern and offered India's support for the critically ill BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia.The BNP leadership formally responded with sincere gratitude for the gesture of goodwill, marking a rare and significant instance of political warmth between the historically adversarial forces, hinting at a potential for pragmatic diplomacy if the BNP wins.JI, Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party, was legally constrained for years but saw a major political reopening in 2025 when the Supreme Court removed bans that had kept it out of formal politics.That judicial change has allowed JI to prepare for electoral participation. Politically, JI’s worldview and historical memory of 1971 make it more likely to temper Dhaka’s closeness to New Delhi.There’s a possibility that a JI-influenced government could diversify Bangladesh’s external partnerships and be more open to Chinese or Pakistani outreach on infrastructure and defence.The ideological core of the religious right, Jamaat's comeback, is New Delhi's greatest immediate security concern.Its organisational strength, evidenced by its student wing, Islamic Chatra Shibir’s, surprising victory in the Dhaka University union polls in September 2025, makes it a potent force.Its public rhetoric attempts a diplomatic balance, but its hardline ideological base remains fundamentally anti-secular and historically anti-India.The NCP emerged from the 2024 student movement and positions itself as a reformist, youth-led alternative to Bangladesh’s old party duopoly.It is led by figures like Nahid Islam, who represent a quest for structural reform and an end to dynastic politics. He was in central role against the movement against Hasina. When an interim government took over under the leadership of Dr Muhammad Yunus after Hasina’s ouster, Nahid joined it as an adviser.In his inaugural speech as convener, Nahid clearly stated the party's guiding principle, asserting that there would be “no room for pro-India and Pakistan politics in Bangladesh,” signalling an unambiguous focus on ""Bangladesh First.""In the past, he has been sharply critical of New Delhi’s policy under the Awami League era, publicly accusing India of maintaining relations only with the ruling elite and ignoring the people of Bangladesh.With the AL neutralised, the battle for the 300-seat Jatiya Sangsad has boiled down to a contest between two established forces and one emergent youth movement.Recent surveys underscore the volatility of the new political environment.A nationwide poll conducted by the International Republican Institute (IRI) between September and October 2025 shows a remarkably tight contest among the remaining major players:The data points to two critical features: first, the BNP is the narrow frontrunner, galvanised by the return and political acquittal of its leadership, including former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and her son Tarique Rahman.Second, the resurgence of Jamaat-e-Islami is significant; despite securing only 4.28% of the vote in the last free election in 2008, its support has surged following the lifting of the Hasina-era ban, reflecting a strong organisational structure and a rising tide of identity politics.Crucially, the margin separating the BNP and Jamaat is a mere four percentage points, a difference dwarfed by the 18% of voters who remain either undecided or unwilling to state their preference.This ambiguity means the election is highly prone to a major swing, potentially favouring the extremely well-organised Jamaat network.The greatest impact of the 2026 election is the looming rupture in bilateral ties with India. The long era of security-centric cooperation under Sheikh Hasina, which saw a crackdown on Indian separatist groups and immense growth in connectivity projects, is over.Under Hasina, the AL managed a pragmatic, cooperative relationship with India — enabling cross-border railway and road links, trade expansion, and security cooperation.AL’s suspension removes a known quantity from the table and raises uncertainty about continuity.The likely new power brokers have past records that raise red flags in New Delhi.The BNP-Jamaat Coalition (2001-2006) period was a security low point.The Khaleda Zia government was widely accused of sheltering anti-India terrorist groups, notably the ULFA and NDFB, reportedly allowing Bangladeshi soil to be used as a staging ground.The infamous 2004 Chittagong arms haul, in which a massive consignment of arms destined for Indian insurgents was intercepted, remains the clearest evidence of this policy.The party has often openly embraced the popular sentiment of the ""India Out"" campaign, which emerged from the belief that New Delhi actively supported Hasina's authoritarian rule.This sentiment runs deep among the youth, as validated by Tonmoy Saha Joy, who is a lecturer at Islamic University, Kushtia and has studied at ICCR, Dhaka, and told TOI that ""Most young Bangladeshis now feel that India is not a good neighbour for them. There are some religious and geopolitical issues behind this.""For BNP, the core foreign policy principle being promoted is ""Bangladesh first,"" which means such as prioritising Dhaka’s interests in water sharing (Teesta River) and refusing to tolerate any ""assault on our sovereignty"" or ""interference in our internal affairs.""“In foreign policy, BNP’s guiding philosophy is ‘Bangladesh first.’ My people, my country, my sovereignty — everything else comes after safeguarding these interests,” BNP’s acting chairman and Zia’s son, Tarique Rahman, had said in an interview with BBC Bangla.He went further and said India had become ""unpopular among the people of Bangladesh"" for sheltering the ousted Hasina, adding that he must stand by his countrymen in this situation.Historically, Jamaat has been the most ideologically anti-India force in Bangladesh, primarily due to its religious and historical roots.Jamaat vehemently opposed Bangladesh's independence during the 1971 Liberation War, siding with the Pakistani military. Many of its top leaders were later executed for war crimes by the Hasina government's International Crimes Tribunal. This history makes the party fundamentally opposed to the secular, pro-India narrative of Bangladesh's founding.During the 2001-2006 coalition, Jamaat leaders in cabinet positions allegedly facilitated the growth of indigenous militant groups like Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI) and Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), many of which had explicit anti-India agendas.However, since being unbanned and surging in popularity, Jamaat has attempted to soften its international image while its grassroots remain radicalised.In 2024, Jamaat Chief Shafiqur Rahman made efforts to call for a harmonious relations with India, claiming the party is not inherently anti-India and its focus is solely on Bangladesh's interests.“We view India as a close neighbour and believe in the importance of good relations with those who live near us”, he had said.He also advocated for a balanced foreign policy that engages all major global powers, including China and the US.Despite hinting at diplomatic language, Jamaat’s deep ideological roots are Islamist and fiercely nationalistic, raising concerns about the potential for renewed support for extremist elements.On many occasions, both the BNP, Jamaat have strongly urged New Delhi to reassess its approach to bilateral ties and refrain from interfering in Bangladesh's domestic affairs, a thinly veiled critique of India's past support for the Awami League.Below are three broad post-election scenarios and their likely implications for New Delhi.If BNP forms a government or leads a coalition without a dominant Islamist partner, expect a transactional relationship: cooperation on trade and security where interests align, but more insistence from Dhaka on sovereignty clauses, renegotiation of certain deals, and a more public-facing nationalist narrative.For India, this will require renewed diplomacy, quicker confidence-building measures, and clearer incentives for joint infrastructure projects.A government with strong JI influence could recalibrate Dhaka toward alternative partners. India could face slower progress on connectivity projects, a chill in high-level political warmth, and the need to guard against strategic encroachment by other powers.Delhi would need contingency plans for northeastern connectivity, expand people-to-people engagement, and strengthen defence and intelligence cooperation with like-minded regional partners.Although there’s a lower possibility for NCP or any other coalition to come to power this time. However, if this improbable forecast does come true, then a reformist, youth-led government could open new pathways for India-Bangladesh cooperation if it prioritises institutional stability, economic growth and connectivity.However, political inexperience and a crowded coalition could slow decision-making.Here, India can gain by offering capacity-building, development finance with clear transparency, and quick-win projects that visibly benefit ordinary citizens. Direct engagement with the Bangladeshi public, especially the youth, can help New Delhi to foster a trusting partnership.The 2026 election is not only a domestic contest for Bangladesh; it is a regional inflection that will influence trade corridors, security architectures and the balance of great-power influence in South Asia.This election will not merely install a new government; it will formalise Dhaka’s geopolitical pivot.The removal of the Awami League has eliminated India's reliable anchor in Dhaka, replacing it with a volatile political environment where the next government, whether led by the BNP or dominated by the influence of Jamaat, will operate from a position of strategic distance.Joy succinctly summarised the political outlook, who believed, ""Relations between the governments of Bangladesh and India will not improve anytime soon for various reasons.""India’s policy response should combine active diplomacy, calibrated development engagement, rapid contingency planning for connectivity, and deeper investments in people-to-people ties — especially among students and youth who will shape Bangladesh’s political future.It must rapidly recalibrate its foreign policy, moving beyond its decades-long reliance on the AL to engage constructively with the new nationalist and religious forces.A failure to adapt risks the unravelling of security gains in India's Northeast and the opening of a significant security vacuum in South Asia, allowing regional rivals like China and Pakistan to increase their influence over a nation that is both a strategic partner and a critical border state.Also, it is interesting to note that the sheer unpredictability of the 18% undecided vote means the political pendulum could swing toward a moderate-nationalist government or one with a powerful Islamist core, but in either case, the relationship with New Delhi will be more transactional, more challenging, and far less secure than at any point in the last fifteen years.Despite the political storms, Dr Rehan noted that a large number of people remain “always grateful to India for independence support,” and recognise that for “business, tourism, medical tourism, education, cultural exchanges, etc., there is no best option other than India-Bangladesh friendly relationship.”This enduring logic is rooted in a shared cultural DNA, which celebrates common heroes like ‘Gurudev’ Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam, whose works remain foundational to both nations.He added that ‘India-Bangladesh relationships should be very friendly and supportive... continual cultural and educational ties are very important positive factor between two countries to balance political change.”This enduring cultural and economic logic offers the strongest hope for New Delhi to rebuild trust in a post-Hasina era.Joy also echoed this optimism, adding that with large populations of young people in both nations, ""Cultural and historical ties can create a beautiful future for both nations. Instead of being distracted by online influencers, young people should study and explore our historical connections and engagements.”If Delhi wants continuity, it must help deliver stability and visible benefits that ordinary Bangladeshis can recognise as mutual gains; if Dhaka chooses a different path, India will have to adapt — fast and smart — to preserve its strategic and economic interests in a rapidly changing neighbourhood.","Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, with bilateral trade exceeding $15 billion. It is a massive market for Indian exports, machinery, and raw materials, and a critical source of revenue through services and medical tourism.

Chinese cartels protected in the Golden Triangle

Meth production spurred by civil war

Drug-related crisis 'rapidly expanding'

Farmers and fighters dependent on drug sales

Myanmar heroin found in Africa, Europe





New data on opium and methamphetamine production in Myanmar from the United Nations puts the war-torn country at the epicenter of Asia's multi-billion-dollar illicit drug trade.Opium poppy cultivation rose 17% to over 53,000 hectares (131,000 acres) over the past year, the most in a decade, according to the latest opium survey of Myanmar by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC), published this week.Most notably, Myanmar is still the world's top opium producer. The country claimed that spot from Afghanistan in 2023, two years after the Taliban seized control of the country and eradicated the vast majority of its poppy fields.Data published by the UNODC earlier this year also show methamphetamine seizures across East and Southeast Asia in 2024 hitting a record 236 tons.Most of the drug is believed to be produced in Myanmar. According to the UN, the combination of rising seizures and falling street prices suggest that production inside Myanmar continues to grow.""I wouldn't really say Myanmar as a country is a supplier, but there [are] criminal groups that are engaging in producing and trafficking this meth and heroin,"" Inshik Sim, the UNODC's illicit drugs research officer for the Asia Pacific region, told DW.Myanmar has been a major drug producer for decades, partly due to its geography. The nation, once known as Burma, incorporates one corner of the infamous Golden Triangle, where its rugged, crime-infested borderlands in the east meet Laos and Thailand.In Myanmar's Shan state, criminal cartels have set up under the protection of warlords who rule over enclaves where the government has little to no sway. Most of the drug cartels now based there have moved in from China.The chaotic civil war triggered by a 2021 military coup has created favorable conditions for the growth of Myanmar's drug trade, according to the UN. The country's official economy has collapsed, law enforcement has deteriorated, and warlords needed more money to fund their private armies.""Because of the conflict, there is some need for people to raise money, whether it's armed groups or farmers, because the conflict disrupts the economy…. And I think opium poppy cultivation is one area that we can see,"" said Sim.Methamphetamine production was on the rise well before the coup, but, according to Sim, the civil war has likely boosted this trend as well.Thailand has borne the brunt of drug boom happening across its border with Myanmar. Last year, Thai officials seized massive amounts of Myanmar methamphetamine, including a record 1 billion meth tablets.""These numbers are a clear warning that the drug problem is not only ongoing but expanding now rapidly,"" said Thanapon Thanikkun, head of intelligence at Thailand's Office of the Narcotics Control Board.He warned that the traffickers are exploiting Thailand's well-developed transport network to ship their product on land, air and sea, while also leaving a growing drug use problem in their wake.The UNODC confirms meth use in on the rise in Thailand and much of Southeast Asia.For the armed groups supplying this regional demand from Myanmar, selling drugs is a quick way of arming up, said Khun Oo, vice chair of the Pa-O Youth Organization, a non-government group tackling social issues across the Shan state. The Pa-O are one of the state's main ethnic groups.""They [armed groups] need guns, they need … human resources and money, so this is the way that they can get it, from the drug trafficking,"" he said.Unlike methamphetamine, which can be churned out of small labs in huge volumes by a few people, opium production also puts many farmers to work.Poppy has long been a go-to cash crop in Myanmar during hard times. Khun Oo says the civil war has made it much harder for farmers to get their usual crops to market, whereas the drug traffickers who buy opium come to them.""In the past, they still could do farming [of] other crops,"" he said, but now, ""they have no options"" except growing opium.Khun Oo said the traffickers are also paying farmers up to $500 (€429) for about a kilogram of raw opium in some areas, at least twice what they paid before the coup, making poppy all the more attractive.Products from Myanmar's poppy fields and meth labs travel far and wide across the region and the world.After pouring out of Myanmar into Laos and Thailand, they cascade across the rest of Southeast Asia, and from there may be sold at premium prices in countries like Japan and Australia.Last year, the Australian Federal Police estimated that as much as 70% of the crystal methamphetamine consumed the country came from Myanmar.Sim said China is probably still the main market for Myanmar's heroin. The latest drug seizures, however, suggest the traffickers are now looking westward as well.The UNODC notes a spate of recent meth and heroin seizures over in northeastern India, which also shares a border with Myanmar.Additionally, a string of relatively small but unusual seizures of Myanmar heroin in Nigeria and parts of Europe, by way of Thailand, may indicate that Myanmar cartels are seeking to expand their markets onto new continents.""We didn't really see this kind of heroin trafficking flow from this region to others, because the traditional markets of heroin coming out of the Golden Triangle is basically East and Southeast Asia and parts of Oceania.

IMD Issues Red Alert as Cyclone Ditwah Approaches TN; Sri Lanka Deaths Exceed 80





Sri Lankan authorities on Sunday issued fresh landslide warnings as persistent rains battered regions already devastated by Cyclone Ditwah, intensifying what officials describe as the island’s worst natural disaster in decades. At least 618 people are reported dead, with many still missing as rescue teams struggle to reach isolated communities.A chain of tropical storms and monsoonal downpours has cut a destructive path across Southeast and South Asia over the past two weeks. The storms have triggered landslides, flooded wide stretches of land, and severed access to remote settlements from Sumatra’s rainforests to Sri Lanka’s hill country. Across Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, at least 1,812 people have died in the unfolding regional crisis, AFP reported.In Sri Lanka alone, more than two million people nearly 10 per cent of the population have been affected. The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) warned that continuing monsoon storms were making hillsides increasingly unstable, particularly in the central mountains and north-western midlands.Helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft were deployed to supply communities cut off by landslides, while the Sri Lanka Air Force confirmed it had received a planeload of relief supplies from Myanmar.Authorities have reported 618 deaths and 209 people unaccounted for, with the central tea-growing region suffering the highest number of casualties. The count of people in state-run shelters has fallen to 100,000 from a peak of 225,000 as waters recede. According to the DMC, nearly 75,000 homes were damaged, including almost 5,000 completely destroyed.The Sri Lankan government on Friday announced a major compensation plan enabling survivors to purchase land in safer zones and rebuild homes. Additional assistance will cover school supplies, household essentials and rent for families not accommodated by the state. AFP reported that a compensation of one million rupees will be offered for each person killed or permanently disabled.According to the UN news, Cyclone Ditwah made landfall on November 28 before looping back over the Bay of Bengal, unleashing some of the worst flooding Sri Lanka has experienced since the early 2000s. The worst-affected districts include Gampaha, Colombo, Puttalam and Mannar, along with Trincomalee and Batticaloa, while lethal landslides in the central hill country have ravaged Kandy, Badulla and Matale.","Sri Lankan authorities issue fresh landslide warnings as persistent rains battered regions already devastated by Cyclone Ditwah.

Afghanistan FM Muttaqi Defends India Ties, Slams Pakistan Over Deoband Row And Shifting Accusations





Four civilians and a soldier were killed in overnight shelling and gunfire along the Pakistan–Afghanistan border, Afghan officials said on Saturday, marking the latest outbreak of violence between the two countries despite a ceasefire agreement reached after deadly clashes in October.Five other civilians were wounded on the Afghan side, government spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat said in a video statement. A hospital in the Pakistani town of Chaman reported three people with minor injuries following the exchange.Both sides accused each other of firing first near the busy Chaman–Spin Boldak crossing in southern Afghanistan. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on X that Pakistan “started attacking Afghanistan in Kandahar, Spin Boldak district, and the forces of the Islamic Emirate were forced to respond.” Pakistan prime minister’s spokesman Mosharraf Zaidi alleged that “the Afghan Taliban regime resorted to unprovoked firing” along the border.Local Afghan officials said “light and heavy artillery” was used, with mortar shells striking civilian homes. Residents told AFP that firing began around 10:30 pm and escalated rapidly. One resident described mortars hitting houses after tank fire, while another said his brother was killed when trying to reach a different room during the shelling.People on the Pakistan side said families took shelter indoors as mortar rounds landed near homes.Tensions have surged since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, with Islamabad accusing Kabul of harbouring militant groups, including the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), responsible for attacks inside Pakistan. Kabul denies the allegations. More than 70 people were killed in October clashes before Qatar and Turkey brokered a ceasefire. Talks in Doha and Istanbul since then have failed to produce a lasting settlement, and the border remains closed.Pakistan recently announced it would partially reopen the frontier at Chaman for United Nations aid deliveries. Pakistan’s spokesman Zaidi told AFP the latest clash would “have no impact on that decision,” adding that humanitarian access would continue separately.","Four civilians and a soldier were killed in overnight shelling and gunfire along the Pakistan–Afghanistan border.

Khaleda Zia to be flown to London: Air ambulance approved for critically ill ex-Bangladesh PM; transfer likely by Friday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/khaleda-zia-to-be-flown-to-london-air-ambulance-approved-for-critically-ill-ex-bangladesh-pm-transfer-likely-by-friday/articleshow/125771576.cms,"Ex-Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia (File photo)





A medical board overseeing critically ill former Bangladesh prime minister Khaleda Zia has determined to send her to London for specialist treatment, according to her personal physician AZM Zahid Hossain.According to PTI, Zia, aged 80 and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson, is scheduled for transfer via air ambulance to London either late Thursday night or early Friday. Her elder son and acting BNP chief Tarique Rahman resides in London.Following a chest infection affecting her heart and lungs, Zia was hospitalised on November 23. She was moved to the coronary care unit (CCU) four days later due to deteriorating health complications.""The medical board has unanimously decided that she will be taken to London via the Qatar Royal Air Ambulance, either after midnight tonight or early tomorrow morning,"" Hossain announced outside the hospital.Whilst Hossain, a BNP standing committee member, refrained from detailed comments about Zia's current condition.At Tuesday's briefing, he had noted her positive response to treatment. The decision for urgent transfer was made by an expanded medical board, including recently arrived specialists from China and the United Kingdom.The BNP released a list of 14 accompanying individuals, including Syeda Shameela Rahman, widow of Zia's younger son Arafat Rahman, six doctors, party adviser Enamul Haque Chowdhury, two Special Security Force (SSF) agents from Muhammad Yunus' interim government, and personal assistants.Qatar offered their air ambulance service whilst military and air force helicopters conducted rooftop landing tests at the hospital. A helicopter transfer is expected from hospital to airport.A Chinese medical team of four specialists arrived Wednesday night, joining a UK medical group led by Dr Richard Buell. This marked the second Chinese delegation, following an advance team's arrival on December 1.Interim government leader Muhammad Yunus visited Wednesday, following visits from military service chiefs. Family members present include her younger brother Shamim Iskandar, his wife Kaniz Fatema, and Sharmila Rahman.Tarique Rahman wrote on Facebook: ""In this time of crisis, like any child, I too long for the comforting touch of my mother.""""But unlike others, to make a unilateral decision in this regard is not in my hands alone nor solely within my control. The sensitivity of this matter also limits the scope for detailed explanation,"" he stated.Rahman has resided in London since 2008, previously facing various legal charges. In 2024, Yunus' government withdrew these cases, with courts issuing revised acquittals.Government advisers have assured his safe return. Foreign adviser Touhid Hossain confirmed readiness to process travel documents, though no requests had been received through Wednesday evening.Nationwide prayer gatherings are being held across Bangladesh, including Dhaka, Jhenaidah, Sunamganj, Bagerhat, Cumilla, Chuadanga and Munshiganj, for Zia's recovery.","Former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia to be flown to London for specialist treatment.

IMD Issues Red Alert as Cyclone Ditwah Approaches TN; Sri Lanka Deaths Exceed 80

Thousands trapped, isolated

Early warnings wasted

Rescue teams stretched 'beyond capacity'



Opposition blames government for loss of life



Too few alerts in Tamil language







Days after Cyclone Ditwah tore through Sri Lanka, over 1.46 million people across all 25 of the nation's districts remain affected by the island's worst flooding disaster in two decades.According to the government's Disaster Management Center, the official death toll stands at 410, with 336 people still missing. More than 64,000 people from 407,000 affected families are sheltering in nearly 1,450 government-run safety centers across the country.Multiple countries have responded to Sri Lanka's appeal for assistance with India leading the charge, followed by pledges from the UK, China, Australia, and Nepal. Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has also declared a state of emergency to deal with the aftermath of the cyclone.Despite his declaration and the promise of international aid, however, the Sri Lankan public seems increasingly frustrated with the state's response. Authorities appear to be overwhelmed with rescue demands and are struggling to communicate in a timely manner as critics point out the absence of a unified relief-and-rescue system.Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Colombo-based Centre for Policy Alternatives, accuses the Sri Lankan government of failing to heed warning signals and allowing the calamity to spiral beyond human control.""The government has not come off well in its handling of the crisis and should have called Parliament to convene urgently to review and strengthen disaster management policies,"" Saravanamuttu told DW.According to Saravanamuttu, ""this disaster reveals significant gaps in preparedness and response mechanisms"" and the existing frameworks need to be evaluated to ""prevent future failures.""While Ditwah made landfall in Sri Lanka on November 28, some voices point out that warning signals were present as early as two weeks before. Experts say that the loss of life was exacerbated by the government's failure to act in a timely manner.""Unlike tsunamis, hydrometeorological hazards like cyclones arrive with sufficient notice of several days to take precautions. As early as November 12, Sri Lanka's department of meteorology had publicly flagged the prospect of extreme rainfall later in the month. That should have triggered a process of preparations across the government at central, provincial, and local levels,"" Nalaka Gunawardene, a science writer from Colombo, told DW.""Apparently, that did not happen, and an official response has mostly been reactive when Cyclone Ditwah was imminent or after it made landfall,"" added Gunawardene.""The entire disaster management structure – from policymakers to state officials – should be held accountable for cascading failures that made a bad disaster much worse.""Kishali Pinto-Jayawardena, a public interest advocate and legal columnist, agrees that the aftermath is ""particularly horrendous as the deadly impact of the cyclone was not realized until it was far too late.""She told DW that the governments should have ""the ability and the competence to take critical decisions"" in times of emergency.""Sentimental outpouring by politicians lauding the people for 'coming together' in times of crisis does not substitute for that duty,"" she added.Sivanathan Navindra, a former Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) member, who has been involved in political activities post-conflict, said the cyclone has damaged roads and communication lines in northern Sri Lanka.""The situation in northern Mannar, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya, and Kilinochchi districts is extremely severe. Mullaitivu has experienced a total power outage with telecommunication towers down, leaving residents without phone or internet access,"" Navindra told DW from Jaffna.""Road closures have effectively cut off the northern province, with travel between Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi and Jaffna impossible,"" he said.Chathuranga Abeysinghe, deputy minister of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development, warned that rising water levels will make evacuation ""extremely difficult."" He urged residents along the Kelaniya River and flood-prone areas to leave.""There have been immense hardships caused by Cyclone Ditwah, but the president has constituted task forces to study the impact and organize relief. It will take a while for rebuilding,"" Abeysinghe told DW.""We had initial difficulty in predicting the cyclone's course"" Abeysinghe said, noting that significant rainfall expected was many different areas which ""stretched rescue teams beyond capacity to reach everyone in need.""Abeysinghe also pointed out that the government was working on a war-footing to reach vulnerable populations that had been cut off.Government critics, however, remain unconvinced by the official narrative. Opposition party Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) recently pledged to launch legal action against the government.SJB lawmaker and spokesperson S M Marikkar compared the severity of the disaster to the Easter Sunday suicide attacks which killed nearly 270 people in 2019, and the more recent economic collapse under the powerful Rajapaksa family.""Similar to the criminal case filed against the Rajapaksas for bankrupting the nation, we will file a case against the current government, as they are responsible for every citizen that died in the disaster,"" Marikkar told the media on Monday.Despite some relief materials being delivered and emergency teams arriving to certain affected locations, many communities still lack clarity on when full help will arrive and when normalcy can be restored. A notable communication obstacle, according to Colombo-based disinformation expert and analyst Sanjana Hattotuwa, is the choice of languages officials use for disaster communications.The nation recognizes both the majority language of Sinhala and the smaller Tamil language as official, with English — a remnant of the British colonial period — also spoken to varying degrees by nearly a quarter of its population.""My research showed key updates were in Sinhala only, and sometimes mirrored in English, but rarely, if ever in Tamil. State television and radio did not communicate the risks, and threats, mirroring what was evident on social media,"" Hattotuwa told DW.""This contributed to [an] information vacuum in critical hours, impacting preparedness and community responses,"" he said. ""If information was available in a more effective and timely manner, lives now lost may have been saved.""","Cyclone Ditwah has left over 1.46 million people in Sri Lanka affected by flooding. The official death toll stands at 410, with 336 people still missing. More than 64,000 people from 407,000 affected families are sheltering in nearly 1,450 government-run safety centers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125759053,imgsize-1689988,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

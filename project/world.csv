'The road was not easy': Joe Biden hails Gaza peace deal; lauds Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-road-was-not-easy-joe-biden-on-gaza-peace-deal-lauds-donald-trump/articleshow/124540928.cms,"Joe Biden; Donald Trump





Former US President Joe Biden on Monday (local time) said the path to a peace deal in Gaza was “not easy” and praised his successor, Donald Trump , for achieving a successful and “renewed” ceasefire agreement.“The road to this deal was not easy. My administration worked relentlessly to bring hostages home, provide relief to Palestinian civilians, and end the war. I commend President Trump and his team for getting a renewed ceasefire over the finish line,” Biden wrote on X.The Gaza war erupted following Hamas attacks in Israel in October 2023, during Biden’s presidency.He added, “Now, with the backing of the United States and the world, the Middle East is on a path to peace that I hope endures, offering a future for Israelis and Palestinians alike marked by equal measures of peace, dignity, and safety.”The Democrat also expressed relief after Hamas, under Trump’s peace plan, released the last 20 remaining Israeli hostages from the Palestinian enclave.“I am deeply grateful and relieved that this day has come — for the last 20 hostages who have endured unimaginable suffering and are finally reunited with their families and loved ones, and for the civilians in Gaza who have faced immense loss and will finally have the chance to rebuild their lives,” Biden said.On Monday, Trump, who was also Biden’s predecessor in the White House, made a trip to Israel and Egypt to finalise the agreement. In Israel, he addressed the Knesset (parliament) while the two sides carried out a swap of hostages and prisoners. In Egypt, he signed the historic peace pact alongside several world leaders.The summit took place in Sharm el-Sheikh, just three days after a ceasefire went into effect and Israeli forces withdrew to a pre-determined line.","Former US President Joe Biden said the path to a peace deal in Gaza was ‘not easy’ He praised his successor, Donald Trump, for achieving a successful and ‘renewed’ ceasefire agreement.

Venezuela on Monday announced the closure of its Norwegian embassy in Oslo, just days after Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, a vocal critic of President Nicolas Maduro, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.The Venezuelan government, which has not commented on Machado’s win, described the move as part of a “restructuring” of its foreign service.As part of the changes, Caracas also closed its embassy in Australia while opening diplomatic missions in Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso, which it considers “strategic partners in the fight” against “hegemonic pressures,” according to an official statement.Norway’s foreign ministry expressed disappointment over the embassy closure.“It is regrettable. Despite our differences on several issues, Norway wishes to keep the dialogue open with Venezuela and will continue to work in this direction. The Nobel Prize is independent of the Norwegian government,” spokeswoman Cecilie Roang told AFP.The Nobel Peace Prize committee, which awarded Machado, is based in Oslo and is appointed by the Norwegian parliament.Machado, 58, who has been living in hiding in Venezuela, was barred from running in the 2024 presidential election, which Maduro won amid opposition protests.Several countries, including the United States, do not recognize Maduro’s government.On Sunday, without mentioning Machado’s Nobel win, Maduro referred to her as a “witch,” a term frequently used by his administration.Machado was honoured “for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,” said Jorgen Watne Frydnes, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.She dedicated her award to the “suffering people of Venezuela” and to US President Donald Trump , praising his “decisive support of our cause.”",Venezuela announces closure of its Norwegian embassy in Oslo.

As the middle peace deal is holding up for the fourth day, Hamas is set to release all the surviving hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.This comes as US President Donald Trump is making a flash visit to the region for the peace summit and to celebrate his role in brokering last week's ceasefire and hostage release deal.As per Trump's deal, Israel will begin releasing around 2,000 Gaza detainees after Hamas have handed over surviving 20 hostages. According to a spokesperson for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, Israel expects all 20 living hostages to be released to the Red Cross ""early Monday morning.""Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump brushed off concerns about whether the ceasefire would endure.""I think it's going to hold. I think people are tired of it. It's been centuries,"" Trump said.""The war is over. Okay? You understand that?"" he added.In his four hour visit to Israel, Trump is due to meet the families of the hostages seized by Hamas in the deadly cross-border attack two years ago that sparked the war. He will also deliver an address at the Knesset.Prior to his speech, Trump will meet with Netanyahu in the premier’s Knesset office. The two leaders will then meet with families of hostages in the Knesset’s Chagall HallThe timeline is limited by the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, which begins on Monday evening, and marks the second anniversary, on the Hebrew calendar, of the Hamas invasion and massacre that launched the war on October 7, 2023.After visiting Israel, Trump will head to Egypt where he and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will co-host a summit of more than 20 world leaders to back his plan to end the Gaza war and promote Middle East peace.Trump will be looking to resolve some of the huge uncertainty around the next phases of the peace plan -- including Hamas's refusal to disarm and Israel's failure to pledge a full withdrawal from the devastated territory.Trump insisted he had ""guarantees"" from both sides and other key regional players about the initial phase of the deal, and the future stages.""I don't think they're going to want to disappoint me,"" he said.Trump also said he would be ""proud"" to visit Gaza itself, but did not say when such a difficult security challenge would be possible.A new governing body for devastated Gaza -- which Trump himself would head under his own plan -- would be established ""very quickly,"" he added.Under the plan, as Israel conducts a partial withdrawal from Gaza, it will be replaced by a multi-national force coordinated by a US-led command centre in Israel.","Hamas is set to release all the surviving hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.

About the yacht photo



'Katy is very interested in him'







Canada's former prime minister Justin Trudeau faced vicious trolling after Daily Mail published a zoomed-in photo of a shirtless Trudeau kissing Katy Perry on board Katy Perry's 24-metre yacht, the Caravelle, off the coast of Santa Barbara, California. Social media users questioned whether Trudeau has left Canada like he left his family and spends most of the time in the US now, as he has been said to be dating Katy Perry for months now.""What kind of guy @JustinTrudeau is? He is not sincere to his wife and kids even. Leave the country which he left in tatters. Shameless,"" one wrote.""Justin Trudeau and Katy Perry. One pretended to be an astronaut. One pretended to be a Prime Minister,"" another wrote, taking a swipe at Katy Perry's space tour on Blue Origin.""To all of you who voted the liberals in, how ya feeling now? He doesn’t give a sh** about Canada,"" one commented about Trudeau.Trudeau stepped down earlier this year and has been far from politics since then. In 2023, Trudeau split with his wife Sophie ending their 18 years of marriage. They have two sons , Xavier, 18, and Hadrien, 11, and a daughter, Ella-Grace, 16.Trudeau, 53, and Katy Perry, 40, were earlier spotted together in Montreal in July when they were having an intimate dinner at Le Violon restaurant.Katie Perry has a five-year-old daughter, Daisy Dove Bloom, with Pirates of the Caribbean star Orlando Bloom. She was married to comedian Russell Brand from 2010 until 2012.Daily Mail reported that the photos they exclusively published were taken by a passenger on a passing tourist boat in September when Katy Perry was enjoying a brief break from her Lifetimes world tour. The witness said: ""She pulled up her boat next to a small public whale-watching boat, then they started making out. I didn't realise who she was with until I saw the tattoo on the guy's arm and I immediately realised it was Justin Trudeau""Trudeau has a 'Haida raven' tattoo on his upper left arm. The distinctive tattoo is a tribute to an indigenous Canadian people famed for their seamanship and artistry.Neither Katy Perry nor Justin Trudeau commented openly on their relationship after their much-discussed restaurant photo. However, people in their close circle apparently suggested that their relationship at that time was in the very early stages of exploring romance. ""Katy is very, very interested in him. She says he's a real catch, a high-quality guy. She clearly likes him a lot.

SHARM AL SHEIKH: Egyptian president told a summit of world leaders on Monday that US President Trump’s Mideast proposal represents the “last chance” for peace in the region and reiterated his call for a two-state solution, saying Palestinians have the right to an independent state.The summit in Egypt’s Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh was aimed at supporting the ceasefire reached in Gaza, ending the Israel-Hamas war and developing a long-term vision for governing and rebuilding the devastated Palestinian territory.Trump’s plan holds out the possibility of a Palestinian state, but only after a lengthy transition period in Gaza and a reform process by the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu opposes Palestinian independence.In his speech, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah El-Sissi also also awarded Trump the Order of the Nile, the country’s highest civilian honor. El-Sissi’s office said the summit aimed to “end the war” in Gaza and “usher in a new page of peace and regional stability” in line with Trump’s vision.The peace summit unfolded soon after Hamas released 20 remaining living Israeli hostages and Israel started to free hundreds of Palestinians from its prisons, crucial steps under the ceasefire agreement.More than 20 world leaders attended the summit, including King Abdullah of Jordan, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the French president and the UK prime minister.","Egyptian president Abdel Fattah El-Sissi also also awarded Trump the Order of the Nile, the country's highest civilian honor.

Sophie Grégoire, ex-wife of Justin Trudeau , posted an uncanny message on Instagram on Monday, day after photos surfaced online showing the former Canadian Prime Minister kissing pop singer Katy Perry aboard her yacht.The post hinted at moving on, with Grégoire postin: “The people, the places, even the moments that once felt, I don’t know, infinite—time asks us to not cling to them. And yet we do, I do, because to hold on feels safer than to let go.”Grégoire continued, “Love was never about possession. It was always about presence, the present moment. And when we release what we cannot keep, we make space for the truth of connection, intimacy, the memory, you know, for the lesson, for the way a single smile can echo across a lifetime.” She added, “Sometimes we forget that nothing we love was ever meant to be kept.”The couple shares three children—Xavier, Ella-Grace, and Hadrien. They announced their separation in August 2023 after 18 years of marriage.Trudeau, 53, has faced months of rumours linking him romantically with Katy Perry, 40, who split from actor Orlando Bloom in June.The rumours grew on Sunday after the Daily Mail shared photos of Trudeau and Perry kissing on her luxury yacht near Santa Barbara, California.“Maybe love’s deepest teaching is this—to stand open-hearted in the face of impermanence, to honour what has been and to trust that letting go is also a form of keeping inside us where no loss can erase it,” Grégoire said in the Instagram video. “That is love’s endurance.

President Donald Trump, in a speech to Israel’s parliament, spotlighted mega-donor Miriam Adelson’s outsized influence on US policy toward Israel, recalling her frequent White House visits with her late husband, casino mogul Sheldon Adelson.Sheldon Adelson, who died in 2021, assembled the world's largest casino empire as head of Las Vegas Sands Corp (LVS.N), opens new tab and put much of his fortune into nurturing conservative politicians and policies in the United States and Israel, Reuters reported.Both Adelsons have been known for their philanthropy and business ventures in Israel and donations to Jewish causes. “She loves Israel,” Trump told the Knesset on Monday, crediting the couple with shaping decisions like his 2017 recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, his 2018 move of the US embassy to the holy city, and his 2019 endorsement of Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights.Gesturing to Adelson, an Israeli-born physician and a major donor to his presidential campaigns, Trump said, “Stand up, Miriam,” before recounting how the Adelsons would regularly call and visit him in the Oval Office.He joked that her husband was so persistent he’d “come in through the window,” underscoring the couple’s extraordinary access and impact on his administration. With a grin, Trump said, “She’s got $60 billion in the bank,” then added, “I think she is saying, ‘No, more,’” drawing laughter.He praised her as a wonderful woman whose devotion was so deep, she once refused to say which she loved more – Israel or the United States.Miriam Adelson assumed majority control of Las Vegas Sands in 2021 following the death of her husband, casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson.

In 2022, the family sold their iconic Las Vegas Strip properties, including the Venetian resort, for $6.25bn. The following year, in 2023, Miriam Adelson also acquired majority ownership of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team.Born in Tel Aviv in 1945 after her parents immigrated from Poland, Adelson trained as a physician specialising in addiction treatment.

As his case is set to be heard on October 14, his family told the BBC that the authorities are now citing an offence dating back to 2008, which does not exist. ""Paramjit Singh is not getting the medical help he needs.

Retaliatory Strike by Afghan Forces Kills 15 Pakistani Soldiers; Qatar Calls for Dialogue





NEW DELHI: Former Indian diplomat KP Fabian on Sunday described Pakistan’s foreign policy as a “failure” following its recent confrontation with Afghanistan, where Islamabad has been accused of carrying out strikes on Afghan territory.Speaking to news agency ANI, Fabian said Pakistan had acted as an aggressor and “played its hand badly,” resulting in deteriorating relations with Kabul.“This has happened when, maybe coincidentally, the Afghanistan Emirate foreign minister is in Delhi,” Fabian said, as per ANI.“The bad relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan cannot entirely be explained on the basis of the Durand Line. I think Pakistan played its hand badly, probably was overbearing. The proud Afghans resisted, and now the relationship is very bad,” he said.Fabian noted that Pakistan had carried out strikes on Kabul, prompting Afghanistan’s retaliation.“On the whole, Pakistani policy has been, more or less, a failure... It is abundantly clear that Afghanistan is keen on developing relations with India, which is the case with India too, and Pakistan is naturally upset,” he added.The Afghan ministry of defence has recently said that the armed forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan conducted “successful retaliatory operations” against Pakistani military positions along the Durand Line late Saturday night.In a statement cited by ANI, the ministry said the strikes were “in response to repeated violations of Afghanistan’s sovereignty by the Pakistani military and airstrikes on its territory.”According to news agency Associated Press (AP), Afghanistan claimed on Sunday that its forces had killed 58 Pakistani soldiers and captured 25 military posts in overnight operations along the border.Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Afghan forces were in control of the “official borders and de facto lines,” though Pakistan has not confirmed any casualties.Both the Torkham and Chaman border crossings remained closed on Sunday following the escalation. Pakistan, for its part, accused Afghan authorities of harbouring militants of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a charge Kabul has denied.Tensions between the two countries have worsened in recent months, with frequent border skirmishes and airstrikes deepening distrust. Saudi Arabia has called for “restraint and dialogue” to prevent further escalation in the region.","Former Indian diplomat KP Fabian on Sunday described Pakistan’s foreign policy as a “failure” following its recent confrontation with Afghanistan.

PESHAWAR: Seven policemen were killed and 13 others injured in a terrorist attack at a police training centre in Pakistan 's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the army said on Saturday.The attack took place late Friday night when seven to eight terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) launched a coordinated assault using heavy weapons on the Dera Ismail Khan Police Training Centre in the DI Khan district, near the South Waziristan border.On the intervening night of October 10-11, terrorists attempted to breach the perimeter of the police training school by ramming an explosives-laden truck into its main gate, triggering a massive explosion, the army said in a statement.While one policeman was killed in the attack, six others died in the retaliatory exchange of fire between the security personnel and the terrorists.After the intense five-hour engagement, six terrorists were also eliminated, the army said.During the exchange of fire, the militants continued throwing hand grenades.A mosque inside the institute complex was targeted by the terrorists. The Imam of the mosque was killed in the attack.Around 200 trainees, instructors, and staff members were present at the training school during the attack, police said.Thirteen people, including police personnel, were also injured in the attack, they said.According to officials, all trainee recruits and staff members were safely evacuated to secure locations.Earlier in the day, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) in a statement said the office of the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) near the training centre was also burnt down by terrorists.Inspector General of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Zulfiqar Hameed, confirmed that the area has been completely cleared.Pakistan continues to reel under terrorism with overall violence surging by 46 per cent in the third quarter of 2025, a media report said last week.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was the worst-hit region, suffering nearly 71 per cent (638) of the total violence-linked fatalities, and over 67 per cent (221) of the incidents of violence, followed by Balochistan, with over 25 per cent of fatalities (230) and incidents (85).Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies' personnel, and security forces.",Seven policemen were killed and 13 others injured in a terrorist attack at a police training centre in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Pakistan Panics After Taliban Issues Warning, Accuses India of Using Afghanistan Soil for Terror





Pakistan has lodged formal objections with Afghanistan’s Ambassador in Islamabad over several ‘elements of the India‑Afghanistan joint statement’, particularly the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as 'part of India'.It also rejected remarks by Afghan foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi that “terrorism is an internal problem of Pakistan,” the Pakistani ministry of foreign affairs (MOFA) said.The foreign office said: “It was conveyed that the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as part of India is in clear violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the legal status of Jammu and Kashmir. The Joint Statement is highly insensitive to the sacrifices and sentiments of the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their just struggle for the right to self‑determination.”In addition, Islamabad strongly rebutted Muttaqi’s claim, saying: “Pakistan has repeatedly shared details regarding the presence of Fitna‑e‑Khawarij and Fitna‑e‑Hindustan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil against Pakistan with support from elements within Afghanistan.”The Pakistani statement added that deflecting responsibility by branding terrorism in Pakistan as an ""internal matter"" does not relieve Afghanistan’s interim government of its duty to ensure regional peace and security.It also urged that “unauthorised Afghan nationals residing in Pakistan” return to their country.These protests follow a joint statement issued on October 10 during Muttaqi’s visit to India, where both nations reiterated condemnation of terrorism emanating from regional countries, affirmed respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and affirmed that the Afghan government would not permit any group or individual to use Afghan territory against India.In that statement, external affairs minister S Jaishankar expressed gratitude for Afghanistan’s condemnation of the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir, while Afghanistan reaffirmed its support in counterterrorism.""Both sides emphasised respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The external affairs minister appreciated the Afghan side's understanding of India's security concerns.

Strategic hedging, not endorsement







NEW DELHI: In a diplomatic manoeuvre that could reshape regional equations, India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy. The decision was announced during Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s high-profile visit to New Delhi. On the same day, the Afghan foreign minister, from Indian soil, condemned Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, Afghanistan — the first of its kind that came against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Kabul and Islamabad.During the meetings, external affairs minister S Jaishankar underlined that India’s engagement “contributes to Afghanistan’s national development, as well as regional stability and resilience,” while announcing a fresh round of development projects across Afghan provinces. The upgrade of India’s technical mission to a full-fledged embassy signals a significant deepening of diplomatic ties without extending formal recognition to the Taliban regime.Later the same day, Muttaqi held a press briefing in New Delhi, sharply condemning Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, calling it a “provocative act” and a violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty. “Such issues cannot be resolved by strength.Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he said, stressing the widening rift between Kabul and Islamabad.India had shut its Kabul embassy in August 2021 after the Taliban’s return to power, maintaining only a skeletal presence through a technical team since June 2022 to oversee humanitarian aid. The embassy upgrade marks the deepest level of engagement between India and the Taliban since the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government. This move stops short of formal recognition but signals a decisive shift in India’s Afghanistan strategy.The timing of the announcement was significant. It came just hours after Afghanistan’s defence ministry accused Pakistan of bombing civilian areas in Paktika near the Durand Line. “Pakistan violated Afghanistan’s airspace, bombing a civilian market in the Marghi area of Paktika near the Durand Line and also violating Kabul’s sovereign territory,” the ministry said in a post on social media. Calling it “an unprecedented, violent, and provocative act”, Kabul warned that defending its territory is its right.From Indian soil, Muttaqi chose to respond sharply. “I think it’s a wrong step by the Pakistan government. Such issues cannot be resolved by strength. Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he told reporters in Delhi. “Some attacks happened in border areas, and we condemn them. We have opened doors for dialogue and diplomacy.”The unusually strong language stressed the widening rift between the Taliban and Pakistan, their uneasy patron for decades. Relations have deteriorated over Islamabad’s military operations against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters allegedly sheltering in Afghanistan. In March 2024, Pakistani airstrikes in Khost and Paktika killed several civilians, triggering warnings from Kabul of “consequences”. This fracture, analysts say, has created a new strategic opening for India.India has historically had a fraught relationship with the Taliban. During the 1990s, New Delhi backed the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance while Islamabad openly supported the Taliban regime. After 2001, India became one of Afghanistan’s largest regional donors, pledging over USD 3 billion for development projects. But the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 disrupted India’s presence and leverage in the country. New Delhi maintained limited contact, focusing on humanitarian assistance and regional coordination with Iran and Central Asian partners.Now, with Pakistan–Taliban ties fraying, India is recalibrating. By reopening its embassy, hosting Muttaqi, and accepting Taliban-appointed diplomats (though not at the ambassadorial level), India is signalling a willingness to engage without granting formal recognition. Strategic analysts describe this as “hedging” — positioning itself to gain influence should Pakistan’s grip weaken further, while safeguarding its own security concerns.Professor Rajan Kumar of the School of International Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University says this evolving situation presents India with a rare diplomatic opening.“The ongoing conflict with Afghanistan and Pakistan certainly offers an opportunity for India can be a stabilising factor even in the ongoing conflict with Pakistan. India’s presence matters a lot to Afghanistan because it will provide some kind of legitimacy to the Taliban government, even though India is unlikely to recognise the regime as such,” he says.The engagement carried clear economic undertones as well. Muttaqi invited Indian companies to invest in Afghanistan’s mining sector and called for the opening of the Attari–Wagah border for direct India–Afghanistan trade. “Pakistan and India should open the Wagah border to facilitate trade between Afghanistan and India. It will benefit the people of all three countries,” he said.Currently, India trades with Afghanistan primarily via Iran’s Chabahar port due to Pakistan’s denial of overland access. But the route faces uncertainty after the United States revoked India’s sanctions waiver for Chabahar in September 2024, complicating transit. While Chabahar remains a strategic hedge, its operational limitations make direct India–Afghanistan connectivity via Pakistan attractive in theory — though politically fraught.India also announced a new slate of development projects: a Thalassemia Centre and 30-bed hospital in Bagrami district, oncology and trauma centres in Kabul, maternity clinics across Paktika, Khost and Paktia, and donations of ambulances, medical equipment and vaccines. These announcements draw on India’s legacy of over 500 development projects across all 34 Afghan provinces, including the Parliament building and the Salma Dam.Security remains at the core of India’s engagement. Without naming Pakistan, both sides “unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from regional countries” in their joint statement. Jaishankar said, “We have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity. However, these are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.” Muttaqi, meanwhile, pledged that Afghanistan “won’t allow any group to use the country against others”, identifying Daesh (ISIS) as the main regional threat.For India, the key is ensuring Afghan soil is not used for anti-India activities — a core concern since the IC-814 hijacking in 1999. Prof. Kumar explains this strategic bottom line:“What can happen, and what India is probably thinking, is that the land of Afghanistan may not be used for terrorist activities against India. That would be a huge achievement from the Indian perspective,” he says.India has so far avoided pressing the Taliban hard on human rights. Muttaqi remained vague when asked about women’s rights, saying, “All countries have their own customs and traditions and these should be respected.” While India has consistently raised rights issues at multilateral forums, officials have avoided making them a precondition for engagement.Perhaps the most consequential element of India’s strategy is its decision to reopen its embassy in Kabul without formally recognising the Taliban regime — a nuanced diplomatic line that gives New Delhi both flexibility and leverage. By restoring a physical diplomatic presence, India can deepen engagement on the ground and signal its relevance in Afghanistan’s evolving power dynamics, without extending official legitimacy to a government that remains internationally unrecognised and controversial for its human rights record.This approach reflects a clear distinction between establishing an embassy and granting diplomatic recognition. India has previously maintained similar diplomatic arrangements, such as with Palestine, where the presence of an embassy does not automatically translate into full diplomatic recognition of a government. In the Afghan context, this allows India to engage pragmatically while aligning its policy with the broader stance of the United Nations, the European Union and Western countries, most of which have opted for functional engagement without recognition.By doing so, New Delhi positions itself strategically. It can build channels of communication, potentially shape outcomes on critical security and connectivity issues, and apply pressure on regional actors like Pakistan and China, both of which are wary of India expanding its influence in Afghanistan. At the same time, India avoids prematurely endorsing a regime whose policies on women’s rights and governance remain at odds with international norms.India’s outreach is also informed by broader regional considerations. Russia and China have already established working relationships with the Taliban. Western governments are engaged in dialogue on counterterrorism and aid. New Delhi, analysts say, does not want to be the outlier.As Prof. Kumar notes, “Since Russia is talking, China is already there, and American and Western governments are also talking, India should not be left out. We may have ideological differences with the Taliban regime, but since other countries are talking to the Taliban in different forms, we should also try to moderate our policy and engage on several issues.”This balancing act is not without challenges. The Taliban regime remains ideologically rigid, especially on women’s rights and governance. Connectivity through Chabahar faces geopolitical headwinds. And there is no guarantee that the Taliban will limit anti-India groups indefinitely. Yet, by opening formal diplomatic channels, India aims to secure a seat at the table rather than watch from the sidelines as others shape Afghanistan’s future.Muttaqi’s visit to Delhi, marked by strong rhetoric against Pakistan, overtures for trade, and assurances on terrorism, reflects Kabul’s attempt to diversify its diplomatic bets. For India, the outreach is less about endorsing the Taliban regime and more about strategic positioning: insulating itself against security risks, reasserting influence in a region long dominated by Pakistan, and adapting to a shifting geopolitical landscape.New Delhi’s approach remains cautious but deliberate. It is engaging the Taliban to pursue its security and strategic objectives, without abandoning its normative concerns or rushing into recognition. In the complex triangle of India–Afghanistan–Pakistan, this marks the beginning of a new phase — one where India is no longer merely reacting to developments in Kabul, but actively shaping them.","India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy.

Government response and TLP’s history





Massive protests by the hardline Islamist groupescalated into violent clashes across multiple cities on Friday and Saturday, leaving at least 11 people dead and dozens injured. Demonstrators marched towards Islamabad in what they called a “Gaza March” to express solidarity with Palestinians and planned to stage a protest outside the United States embassy.TLP launched its protests in Lahore on Thursday, announcing plans to march to the US embassy in Islamabad to oppose the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas following two years of conflict in Gaza. While the demonstrations were initially organised to challenge the ceasefire, the party said the focus had shifted to expressing solidarity with Palestinians.“We have no demands other than showing solidarity with the people of Gaza,” senior TLP member Allama Muhammad Irfan told AFP as the protesters set off for Islamabad.The rally, led by TLP chief Saad Rizvi, began after Friday prayers from the party’s base on Multan Road in Lahore. Thousands joined, chanting religious slogans and carrying sticks and rods. Police set up barricades and used tear gas at key junctions — including Yateem Khana Chowk, Chauburji, Azadi Chowk, and Shahdara — but protesters broke through, clashing with security forces and pelting stones.Videos on social media showed demonstrators seizing government vehicles and damaging public property.Violence soon spread to Islamabad and Rawalpindi, where authorities placed shipping containers to block roads and fired tear gas to disperse crowds. In return, protesters hurled stones at police. Public life in the twin cities was severely disrupted, with schools shut, the Metro bus service suspended, and mobile internet blocked for a second consecutive day.According to Arab News, TLP claimed that 11 of its supporters had been killed and 50 injured since Thursday, though officials have not commented on the claim. Lahore police confirmed multiple injuries among officers and said more than 100 TLP activists had been arrested for attacking law enforcement and damaging property.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi warned that no group would be allowed to march on Islamabad “under any circumstances,” while State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry accused the TLP of “political blackmail” and misusing religious sentiments. “Peaceful protest is a democratic right,” Chaudhry said, “but there is no room for violence or mob pressure.”Founded in 2015, the TLP has a history of staging disruptive protests on religious and political issues. Since its rise in 2017, the group has repeatedly brought parts of Pakistan to a standstill through mass marches and sit-ins that have paralyzed the capital and major highways for days.",Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) launched protests in Lahore on Thursday.

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





The Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), claimed responsibility for a series of deadly attacks on Friday across northwestern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 20 security personnel and three civilians.As per news agency AFP, the coordinated assaults included a suicide bombing at a police training school in Dera Ismail Khan district, along with clashes in other districts bordering Afghanistan.Eleven paramilitary troops were killed in the Khyber district, while seven policemen died when a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into the gate of the Dera Ismail Khan police training school, followed by an armed assault.“Seven police personnel were martyred and 13 were injured in the attack, while six terrorists were also killed,” Muhammad Hussain, a senior local police official, was quoted as saying by AFP.In Bajaur district, five people—including three civilians—were killed during clashes between militants and paramilitary forces, AFP reported.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the attacks, saying, “Such cowardly acts by terrorists cannot shake our resolve against terrorism.We are determined to completely eliminate terrorism from the country.”Islamabad has accused Afghanistan of allowing militants to operate from its territory, a claim denied by Kabul. Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif warned, “Everyone will have to bear the consequences, including those providing the hideouts. Enough is enough”, adding that any response could cause collateral damage.Friday’s attacks reflect a surge in militancy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since the US-led troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.As per news agency AP , the assault on the police training school in Ratta Kulachi on Friday involved heavy weapons and lasted nearly six hours.Around 200 recruits and trainers were inside during the attack, and officers returned fire, preventing mass casualties. Six militants were killed in the operation, along with the seizure of suicide vests, explosives, and weapons.Security forces have faced rising threats this year, with over 500 people, including 311 troops and 73 police officers, killed in militant attacks from January to mid-September, according to AFP.The TTP, though allied with the Afghan Taliban, operates independently and remains a major threat along Pakistan’s northwestern border.","The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for a series of deadly attacks across northwestern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

LAHORE: Violent clashes erupted Friday between police and Islamists in Pakistan 's eastern city of Lahore after security forces tried to stop thousands of demonstrators from leaving for the capital, Islamabad, where they planned to stage a pro-Palestinian rally outside the US Embassy, officials said.The clashes in the capital of Punjab province began Thursday but intensified Friday after police baton-charged the demonstrators and fired tear gas to disperse them at multiple locations. Protesters hurled stones at officers in response.In a statement, the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan party, or TLP, claimed that two of its supporters had been killed and 50 others injured since Thursday. There was no immediate comment from the Punjab provincial government, which is headed by Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, the niece of the prime minister.The protest comes after Hamas and Israel agreed to a ceasefire plan brokered by US President Donald Trump.Speaking to thousands of worshippers in Lahore at Friday prayers, TLP chief Saad Rizvi announced the march, saying, ""We will now march from Lahore to the US Embassy"" in Islamabad.He said: ""I will walk at the head of the long march. Arrest is not a problem, bullets are not a problem, shells are not a problem - martyrdom is our destiny.""Police officers were swinging batons and firing tear gas to disperse demonstrators near the main TLP office, according to witnesses, who said residents also faced severe difficulties because of the tear gas.The violence has disrupted daily life in parts of Lahore, as residents struggled to reach home because of road closures and continued clashes.On Friday, authorities shut schools, colleges and universities in Lahore, a city of more than 14 million people.The government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has suspended mobile internet service in Islamabad and nearby Rawalpindi as part of measures aimed at preventing demonstrators from reaching the national capital.Authorities have also placed shipping containers along the main motorway, the main highways and roads leading to Islamabad to block protesters.Lahore is about 350 kilometers (210 miles) from Islamabad.The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad issued a security alert ahead of the march, warning of possible disruptions and urging American citizens to exercise caution.""Large crowds and traffic congestion are expected, along with a precautionary security presence, an increased number of checkpoints, and associated disruptions to local mobile and internet networks in the region,"" the embassy said, adding that the duration of the protests is unknown.It advised U.S. citizens to avoid large gatherings, remain aware of their surroundings and keep a low profile.Deputy Interior Minister Talal Chaudhry said Thursday that the TLP had not submitted a request for permission to hold the rally. The group denied the claim, saying it had applied for permission for a peaceful march to express solidarity with Palestinians.The TLP, known for staging disruptive and sometimes violent protests, has drawn criticism online. But many users have accused the government of overreacting by blocking roads even before the demonstrators began their march.""Why are these demonstrators coming to Islamabad for the rally when the peace process has already started in Palestine?"" asked Mohammad Ashfaq, 35, as he turned back from a road block in Islamabad.He said he tried using longer routes to reach the city, but police had also blocked those roads with shipping containers.

How Trump’s self-promotion cost him







Opposition leader María Corina Machado of Venezuela has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize , beating a crowded field of nominees that included US President Donald Trump , whose campaign for the honour had drawn international attention. The Nobel Committee said it was honouring Machado “for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy. ”The decision dealt a personal blow to Trump, who had publicly lobbied for the award, calling himself the “president of peace” and repeatedly claiming to have “ended six or seven wars.” But it is also a diplomatic setback for Pakistan , one of the countries that had formally nominated Trump for the prize, portraying him as a “champion of peace.”Pakistan had gone all in on Trump this year. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and Field Marshall Asim Munir made a visit to the White House in August, where they met Trump in a rare Oval Office engagement. Islamabad hailed the meeting as a breakthrough moment in US-Pakistan ties, saying the two sides had discussed cooperation on counter-terrorism, regional security, and new economic ventures. This was Munir’s third trip to the oval office just this year alone.Sharif, speaking later at the United Nations, described Trump as “a champion of peace” and said nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize was “the least we could do.” Pakistan’s nomination cited Trump’s claimed role in “de-escalating” tensions between India and Pakistan, a claim New Delhi has consistently rejected.In recent months, the Trump administration has pushed to deepen economic ties with Islamabad even as trade talks with India remain stalled. The US government announced its intent to collaborate with Pakistan on critical minerals and hydrocarbons, while Trump himself unveiled a plan to help Pakistan develop its “massive oil reserves.”On his Truth Social platform, Trump said, “We have finalised a deal with Pakistan, where both countries will collaborate on developing Pakistan’s extensive oil reserves… Perhaps, in the future, they might sell oil to India!”The boast turned out to be wildly optimistic. According to energy data, Pakistan has just 0.02% of the world’s crude oil reserves, less than a tenth of India’s production. Yet Islamabad’s enthusiasm for Trump reflected both economic desperation and the hope of finding a patron in Washington amid regional isolation.For Islamabad, Trump’s loss is more than symbolic. Pakistan’s government had staked diplomatic capital on its public embrace of the US president, even as India-Pakistan tensions simmered. By nominating Trump and describing him as a “friend of peace,” Sharif’s administration had hoped to reset relations with Washington, a move seen as a pivot away from Beijing.Instead, Pakistan now faces embarrassment on two fronts: Trump’s failure to win the Nobel Prize and the exposure of Islamabad’s overreach. The White House never released an official readout of the Trump–Sharif–Munir meeting, and Washington’s silence contrasted sharply with Islamabad’s exuberant press releases and photos of a smiling Trump flashing his signature thumbs-up.The loss also weakens Pakistan’s argument that Trump’s mediation ended the brief but intense India–Pakistan conflict earlier this year, a claim denied by India’s military, which maintains that the ceasefire was negotiated directly between the two countries’ commanders.For now, the Nobel Peace Prize has gone to a woman fighting for democracy in Venezuela. But for Donald Trump and his unlikely backers in Islamabad the snub serves as a reminder that peace cannot be won through press releases or self-congratulation. It must be earned.For Trump, the Nobel campaign was intensely personal. Over the past year, he has repeatedly told reporters that he “should have gotten [the prize] four or five times” and that “everyone says” he deserves it. He even reminded UN delegates in September that his “peace record” was unmatched, claiming to have ended wars between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan, and “even Thailand and Cambodia.”But this relentless self-promotion likely backfired. Members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee have long avoided appearing to reward leaders who lobby openly for recognition. “We base our decision only on the work and the will of Alfred Nobel,” Committee Chair Jørgen Watne Frydnes said, adding that lobbying or political pressure had “no bearing” on their choice.Moreover, Trump’s record remains divisive. While he claims credit for brokering ceasefires, critics point out that many conflicts he boasts of ending were never formally resolved, and others, such as the war in Ukraine, continue to rage. His domestic policies including mass deportations, expanded war powers, and withdrawal from global climate pacts have also undercut his image as a peacemaker.As one expert told the Associated Press, the Nobel Committee prefers to honour the “durability of peace and the quiet work of institutions”, not the “rhetoric of power.”","María Corina Machado of Venezuela has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize.

Tremors were strong enough to rattle nearby homes, prompting some residents and foreigners to seek shelter in secure areas as sirens echoed across parts of the city, The Frontier Post reported.A reporter from China’s Xinhua News Agency confirmed that shockwaves from the explosions were felt inside their residence. Social media quickly filled with posts from Kabul residents describing the sudden and loud booms.However, there has been no official confirmation that explosions in Kabul were part of the Pakistani military operation.The official spokesman of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, Zabihullah Mujahid, confirmed that an explosion had occurred but urged the public to remain calm.“The sound of an explosion was heard in Kabul. However, no one should worry, it is all well and good.

The Pakistan armed force’s media and public relations wing, ISPR, alleged India’s involvement in the attack, a claim that has become a recurring narrative in such incidents.“Terrorists belonging to the Indian proxy, so called Baloch Liberation Army, targeted security forces’ vehicles with an improvised explosive device in the general area Mach-Kachhi district. Resultantly, seven personnel embraced shahadat,” ISPR said.The army vehicle was hit between the Amir Post and the Ali Khan base in the Gestri area, according to local enforcement officers.The attack was the latest in a series of strikes against the Pakistan army in Balochistan, highlighting the ongoing tensions in the region.","Two powerful explosions shook downtown Kabul late Thursday night, causing panic among residents.

India Spreading False Narratives About Hindu Attacks in Bangladesh: Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus





DHAKA: Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus has said India will probably continue hosting former PM Sheikh Hasina if given a ""free choice"", while claiming that ""some external forces"" want her to come back, days after New Delhi asserted that matters related to the Awami League leader are ""legal"" in nature and require ""consultations"" between both nations.The Nobel laureate also stressed that the interim govt - formed after Hasina's ouster last year following massive protests - is ""very alert"" about communal harmony, as he dismissed as ""fake news"" reports of attacks against the minority Hindu community in his country. Yunus said that his message to them, when he meets the community's leaders, ""is don't go back and say, 'I'm a Hindu, so protect me'... always say, 'I'm a citizen of this country. I'm entitled to all the protection the state is supposed to give me"".Talking on the issues related to Hasina and his conversations with PM Narendra Modi in an interview with Mehdi Hassan of online media outlet Zeteo, Yunus said, ""Two things: first, I said you want to keep her, I can't tell you what to do with her but make sure she doesn't talk about us. She doesn't talk about the Bangladeshi people.""Dhaka had sought Hasina's extradition in Dec last year and there has been no development yet.""Probably they (India) will keep her. If some legal obligation is there that they cannot avoid, then the situation will be different,"" he said. They have been supporting her all along, Yunus said. The chief adviser added that those who are behind her hope that she will come back in Bangladesh, ""with full glory of returning as a victorious leader"", claiming that ""some external forces are supporting her to come back"".When Mehdi noted that ""last Nov, around 30,000 Hindus in Bangladesh gathered to protest against your govt, claiming there have been thousands of attacks on their community. (US President) Donald Trump called the violence in Bangladesh 'barbaric',"" Yunus said, ""One of the specialities about India right now is fake news, a barrage of fake news."" ""This is fake news. You can't go by this fake news,"" he said.Asked if he was saying the reports were exaggerated, or if there's no anti-Hindu violence, Yunus said there is ""some conflict sometimes, some family problem, land problem and something"". ""You happen to be my neighbour. You are a Hindu neighbour. I am a Muslim neighbour. We have a problem with our land demarcation, just like two neighbours. So you said this is Hindu-Muslim. That's not it,"" he said.","Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus says India will probably continue hosting former PM Sheikh Hasina if given a ""free choice"" Yunus claims that ""some external forces"" want her to come back, days after New Delhi asserted that matters related to the Awami League leader are ""legal""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124511935,imgsize-380223,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-7.jpg"

The TTP’s deadly resurgence



What next for Pakistan and the Taliban?



(With inputs from agencies)





Afghanistan and Pakistan have once again found themselves on the brink of open conflict after days of deadly cross-border fighting that exposed the fragility of their long and volatile frontier. Afghan officials said their forces killed 58 Pakistani soldiers in overnight “retaliatory operations,” while Islamabad gave a far lower death toll of 23, describing the attacks as “unprovoked” adding that it killed 200 Taliban fighters.The exchanges, centred along the 2,600-kilometre Durand Line (which Afghanistan has never recognised), follow accusations by Kabul that Pakistan bombed Afghan territory including: Strikes on Kabul and a market in the country’s east. Pakistan has neither confirmed nor denied involvement, but Afghan Defence Ministry spokesman Enayatullah Khwarazmi said, “Our armed forces are fully prepared to defend the nation’s borders and will deliver a strong response. ”The border tension has disrupted the Torkham crossing, a vital trade route, and triggered alarm in the Gulf. Saudi Arabia and Qatar have urged restraint, calling for dialogue to “maintain the security and stability of the region.”Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, currently in India, denied Islamabad’s accusations that the Taliban harbour members of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ), a banned militant group behind recent deadly attacks inside Pakistan.“There is no presence of TTP in Afghanistan now,” he told reporters. “They are Pakistani people from displaced areas and are allowed to live in the country as refugees. The border is more than 2,400 km long—it could neither be controlled by ‘Changez’ nor ‘Angrez’. Strength alone cannot control it. This fight is inside Pakistan.”Muttaqi accused Islamabad of failing to “take its people into confidence” and of “endangering its own people to please a few.” But he warned that Kabul would act if provoked further: “We want a peaceful resolution of the situation, but if the peace efforts don’t succeed, we have other options.”For decades, Pakistan was considered a patron of the Taliban, providing shelter and support since the group’s emergence in the 1990s.Pakistan has supported the Taliban since their inception, initially backing the anti-Soviet mujahideen who later formed the group. In the 1990s, Islamabad was one of only three nations to recognise the Taliban regime and was the last to cut ties in 2001. After the US invasion, Pakistan helped the Taliban regroup, offering safe havens and medical aid, which allowed the movement to endure despite heavy battlefield losses.Islamabad hoped that the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 would secure its western flank and curb cross-border militancy. Instead, it has seen a resurgence of attacks.However, with the war over, the Taliban no longer relies on Pakistan for sanctuaries or wartime support. Now, it focuses on gaining legitimacy at home, where distrust of Pakistan runs deep. “By lashing out at Pakistan, the Taliban hopes to buy some goodwill from the Afghan public,” Michael Kugelman, the director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, told Time.comAnalysts say Pakistan’s influence over the Taliban has eroded sharply. “Taliban leaders no longer need refuge across the border or Pakistani assistance,” wrote Foreign Policy, noting that the leverage Islamabad once enjoyed “is at risk of being lost.” The Taliban’s reluctance to act against the TTP reflects not just ideological affinity but also domestic priorities: distancing themselves from Pakistani control helps their pursuit of legitimacy at home.“Pakistan finds itself in a predicament largely of its own making—the Taliban leadership that it supported throughout much of the 20-year insurgency in Afghanistan is now sheltering militant groups targeting Islamabad,” Joshua White, a professor in international affairs at Johns Hopkins University, told Time.com in July last year.The TTP, listed by the United Nations as an al-Qaeda-linked terrorist organisation since 2011, aims to overthrow Pakistan’s government and impose its own strict interpretation of Islamic law. With an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 members, the group has waged a bloody campaign for nearly two decades, killing hundreds of soldiers, police, and civilians.Pakistan’s military campaigns including: Operations Zarb-e-Azb and Radd-ul-Fasaad. once splintered the group, pushing its leaders into Afghanistan. But the Taliban’s victory in Kabul re-energised the TTP, which has since reunited its factions and ramped up attacks. According to the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), violence in Pakistan in 2024 returned to levels last seen in 2015.A UN report in July 2025 claimed the TTP enjoys “logistical and operational support” from Taliban authorities, a claim Kabul denies. Islamabad, under pressure from growing domestic insecurity, has launched cross-border airstrikes on suspected TTP hideouts and expelled over a million Afghan refugees since last year.“The inability of the Taliban administration to take concrete action against the TTP has significantly strained relations,” Islamabad-based analyst Tahir Khan told Deutsche Welle. “Unless the issue of the TTP is effectively addressed, meaningful improvement in bilateral ties will remain elusive.”The violence along the Durand Line has once again shown how Pakistan’s decades-long strategy of nurturing militant proxies for influence in Afghanistan has backfired. The very groups it once supported are now undermining its internal security.Pakistan’s interior minister Mohsin Naqvi has accused Afghan forces of firing on civilians, warning that “no provocation will be tolerated.” Islamabad’s retaliatory strikes have reportedly destroyed multiple Afghan border posts and militant camps, though the Taliban claim to have seized several Pakistani outposts in return.Both sides remain locked in a dangerous cycle of provocation and denial. Kabul insists the TTP problem is “a fight inside Pakistan,” while Islamabad continues to demand action. Yet neither seems willing to take the political or military risks required for a lasting peace.Until that reckoning comes, the Durand Line will remain what it has always been: not a border of control, but a fault line of crisis.","Afghanistan and Pakistan have once again found themselves on the brink of open conflict after days of deadly cross-border fighting.

Pakistan Security sources said that the firing was aimed at facilitating the illegal entry of Khwarij -- the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) -- into Pakistani territory, as reported by The Express Tribune.4, ""The counteroffensive effectively targeted and destroyed multiple Afghan posts at border. Dozens of Afghan soldiers and Khwarij were killed in retaliatory fire,"" news agency ANI reported, citing Express Tribune.5.

Pakistan did not acknowledge carrying out Thursday's attacks but urged Kabul ""to stop harbouring the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) on its soil.""10. The TTP, which has received combat training in Afghanistan and shares the Afghan Taliban’s ideology, is accused by Pakistan of killing hundreds of its soldiers since 2021.The heightened tensions from Pakistan come as Afghanistan’s foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, is on a week-long visit to India, marking the first high-level trip from Kabul since the Taliban took power in August 2021.","Fifteen Pakistani soldiers were killed in a ""retaliatory"" operation by Afghan forces in Helmand province on Saturday night.

A 5.0-magnitude earthquake struck Pakistan on Saturday evening, according to the national centre for seismology (NCS). The quake occurred at a shallow depth of 10 km, making the region susceptible to aftershocks.In a post on X, the NCS stated: “EQ of M: 5.0, On: 11/10/2025 20:23:57 IST, Lat: 31.19 N, Long: 71.04 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Pakistan.”No casualties or damage have been officially reported yet. However, shallow earthquakes - defined as those occurring at depths less than 70 km - can result in stronger ground shaking and are generally considered more hazardous due to their proximity to the Earth's surface.This is the second tremor reported in Pakistan in October. On October 5, an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 was recorded at a depth of 10 km.“EQ of M: 4.6, On: 05/10/2025 18:59:30 IST, Lat: 30.33 N, Long: 66.43 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Pakistan.”Pakistan is located in one of the world’s most seismically active regions, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide. This geological setting contributes to frequent seismic activity, especially in provinces like Balochistan , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Gilgit-Baltistan.Balochistan, in particular, lies near the Arabian-Eurasian plate boundary, increasing its vulnerability.Even regions like Punjab and Sindh, while less prone, remain at risk due to their tectonic positioning.One of the most powerful earthquakes in the region’s history was the 1945 Balochistan earthquake, which measured 8.1 in magnitude - the strongest ever recorded in Pakistan.Further updates are awaited as local authorities assess the impact and monitor aftershock activity.","5.0-magnitude earthquake struck Pakistan on Saturday evening.

Why Jeremy Clarkson changed his mind about the NHS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-jeremy-clarkson-changed-his-mind-about-the-nhs/articleshow/124500694.cms,"Driving the news



Why it matters



The big picture



No private escape hatch: Having ditched private insurance decades ago over payment disputes, Clarkson maintains a self-funded medical pot — but in an emergency, the nearest private facility was two hours away.

Expecting resentment from staff, Clarkson instead found kindness, efficiency and unexpectedly good hospital food. The treatment, though painful, worked — and he left deeply appreciative.

Clarkson still believes the NHS needs reform but concedes he “couldn’t find anything to moan about” during his stay, a rare admission from one of its harshest critics. A national paradox laid bare: Britons may grumble about long waits and systemic flaws, yet trust in the NHS remains strong — a sentiment Clarkson now shares firsthand.

Bottom line:





For a man who’s made a career out of roaring engines and roaring opinions, Jeremy Clarkson has always reserved a special kind of scorn for the NHS. He’s called it bloated, broken and outdated — a “creaking monster” swallowing Britain’s money and happiness whole. But fate, with its impeccable comedic timing, decided to put his rhetoric to the test. Just nine hours after his latest tirade against the health service hit breakfast tables, Clarkson was racing to an NHS hospital himself, clutching more than just his pride. And there, lying in a gown that left his backside exposed to the world, Britain’s most bombastic motoring mouthpiece was forced to admit a humbling truth: for all its flaws, the NHS still works when you need it most.In his Sunday Times column, Clarkson once again attacked the NHS as an outdated, cash-devouring institution in need of a total rethink. But later that same day, a sudden medical emergency meant the broadcaster had no choice but to rely on the very system he had just ridiculed. With private treatment hours away, he checked into an NHS hospital in Oxford, bracing himself for hostile nurses and bitter tea. What he got instead was professional care, spotless facilities, and a recovery that left him quietly — if reluctantly — grateful.Clarkson’s abrupt change of circumstances mirrors the conflicted relationship many Britons have with the NHS: it’s easy to criticise when you’re healthy, but when illness strikes, there’s no substitute for it. His experience serves as a reminder of the health service’s enduring value — not as a perfect system, but as a vital public institution that delivers when it counts.A swift dose of irony: Hours after deriding the NHS as a “bottomless abyss”, Clarkson became a patient, forced to trust the system he had just dismissed.Jeremy Clarkson hasn’t turned into an NHS evangelist, but his hospital dash has quieted his trademark complaints. It’s hard to sneer at a “creaking monster” when it’s the very thing that put you back on your feet.","Clarkson still believes the NHS needs reform but concedes he “couldn’t find anything to moan about’ during his stay, a rare admission from one of its harshest critics.

"'Smashed windows, graffiti and intimidation': Feminist conference venue in Brighton vandalised by trans activists",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/smashed-windows-graffiti-and-intimidation-feminist-conference-venue-in-brighton-vandalised-by-trans-activists-watch/articleshow/124470679.cms,"



A feminist conference in Brighton was left without legal protection on Thursday after trans activists vandalised its venue, sparking concern among organisers.Filia, which is hosting the three-day event aimed at defending women’s rights and challenging sex-based injustices, had applied to Brighton and Hove city council for a public spaces protection order to prevent disruptions.The incident occurred near the Brighton Centre, when masked activists from a group calling themselves “Bash Back” smashed the glass frontage of the venue. They later posted a video online, saying the conference would be attended by “hate groups” including the LGB Alliance and Transgender Trend.The activists also mentioned the conference alumni, including JK Rowling, and the director of Scottish Lesbians, one of the groups involved in the Supreme Court ruling on the definition of a woman.Filia submitted the security request on Monday, citing fears of disruption. The application said the order would prevent noise such as shouting, chanting, banging objects, or playing loud music in a marked area around the venue. “Many attendees and speakers have experienced sexual and/or domestic violence perpetrated by men, and a number have experienced such violence in warzones,” the application added.On Friday morning, the council refused the order, stating in a letter shared with The Times: “Having reviewed the proposal for a protection order the council did not consider it met the relevant legal test and was [a] disproportionate approach which would be highly unlikely to be granted.”The council said the police would continue to monitor the situation to keep protests peaceful.Lisa-Marie Taylor, Filia’s chief executive, criticised the decision: “We have heard today that Brighton and Hove council has rejected Filia’s public spaces protection order which we submitted in advance to pre-empt behaviour and aggression of this sort. We call on the council to condemn last night’s antics and to acknowledge that to protest against Filia is to protest against women gathering to discuss their lives. It is shocking and saddening that a conference for women to discuss domestic abuse, sexual violence and lesbian safety, has been met with smashed windows, graffiti and intimidation.”The conference will run until Sunday and includes sessions on sexual violence, domestic abuse, and ending violence against women and girls. Filia said it worked with the police and security to keep the event safe, while the council said the PSPO request did not meet legal requirements or deadlines.","Filia, which is hosting the three-day event aimed at defending women’s rights, had applied to Brighton and Hove city council for a public spaces protection order to prevent disruptions. masked activists from a group calling themselves ‘Bash Back’ smashed the glass frontage of the venue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124471091,imgsize-37810,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

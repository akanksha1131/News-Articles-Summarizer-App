Global rap superstar Travis Scott is set to make a big comeback to Saudi Arabia in March 2026, this time not just for a concert but as the headline performer at the inaugural Fanatics Flag Football Classic, a first-of-its-kind global sports-entertainment event scheduled for March 21, 2026 in Riyadh. The announcement has electrified fans of both music and sports, blending Travis’s electrifying stage presence with a major new chapter for American football-style events in the Middle East.The news was confirmed by Turki Alalshikh, Chairman of the Saudi General Entertainment Authority (GEA), who revealed the line-up and event details via his social platforms, sharing a behind-the-scenes video featuring NFL legend Tom Brady and highlighting Travis Scott’s role in the halftime show during the Fanatics Flag Football Classic.Part of Riyadh Season 2025–26, the Fanatics Flag Football Classic is shaping up to be a groundbreaking global sporting event that blends elite competition with entertainment. Set to take place at the Kingdom Arena in Riyadh, the Classic will be a three-team round-robin flag football tournament, featuring world-class athletes, current and former NFL stars and celebrity appearances including Travis Scott’s headline performance and hosting by famed entertainer Kevin Hart.Flag football, a variant of American football played without tackles, is one of the fastest-growing sports globally, with more than 20 million players worldwide and a planned debut at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. The Classic is expected to tap into this momentum and introduce the discipline to a broader international audience from the Kingdom.The event is not just about football, it is about star power. Tom Brady will make his first official on-field return since retiring in 2023, suiting up alongside NFL legends and elite players like Saquon Barkley, Christian McCaffrey, Tyreek Hill, CeeDee Lamb, Sauce Gardner, Myles Garrett, Brock Bowers, Maxx Crosby and Odell Beckham Jr, with teams coached by NFL greats like Pete Carroll, Sean Payton and Kyle Shanahan.The Classic will follow Olympic-style flag football rules, played on a 50-yard field with five-on-five teams and two 20-minute halves, providing fans with fast-paced, high-energy action. FOX Sports and the streaming platform Tubi are set to broadcast the event live, amplifying its global reach.Travis Scott’s performance at the halftime show is already being cited as one of the event’s biggest draws. The rap icon, who previously performed in Saudi Arabia, including headlining at events like the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, will bring his signature high-octane stage energy to Riyadh, ensuring that the Classic is as much a cultural spectacle as a sporting event.Tickets for the Fanatics Flag Football Classic recently went on sale with a wide range of pricing tiers, from SAR 60 for general seats to SAR 2000 for premium Diamond experiences, highlighting huge demand from fans eager to attend both the football action and the halftime show.The Fanatics Flag Football Classic underscores Saudi Arabia’s ongoing ambition to establish Riyadh and the Kingdom as a global hub for major international events. By seamlessly integrating elite sport with top-tier entertainment, from NFL stars and Olympic-bound disciplines to headline musical acts, the event reflects the Kingdom’s strategy of using cultural programming to attract global audiences and diversify its event portfolio.For Travis Scott, this marks another major return to the Saudi stage and a chance to perform in front of an international crowd that’s increasingly tuned into Riyadh Season’s expanding calendar of world-class experiences. For fans of sports and pop culture alike, March 21, 2026 promises to be a landmark day in the Kingdom’s entertainment calendar, where gridiron meets global stars and halftime becomes as unforgettable as the game itself.The convergence of sports icons, global streaming and one of the biggest names in music positions the Fanatics Flag Football Classic as one of the most anticipated events of 2026 and Travis Scott’s performance is set to be its cultural centerpiece.","The Fanatics Flag Football Classic is a first-of-its-kind global sports- entertainment event scheduled for March 21, 2026 in Riyadh.

$1 billion entry fee? Trump wants countries to pay to stay in his 'board of peace' — what we know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/1-billion-entry-fee-trump-wants-countries-to-pay-to-stay-in-his-board-of-peace-what-we-know/articleshow/126636784.cms,"US President Donald Trump (AP photo)





US President Donald Trump wants nations to pay a king’s ransom of $1 billion to remain in harmony with the US and retain a seat on his proposed “peace board”, or as many critics claimed as an ""alternative to the United Nations,"" Bloomberg reported, citing a draft charter.According to the draft, Trump would serve as the inaugural chairman, with each member state granted a term of no more than three years from the charter’s entry into force, subject to renewal at the chairman’s discretion.The draft also says that Trump would decide who is invited as members. Decisions would be made by a majority, with each member state getting one vote, but all decisions would still require the chairman’s approval.“Each Member State shall serve a term of no more than three years from this Charter’s entry into force, subject to renewal by the Chairman. The three-year membership term shall not apply to Member States that contribute more than $1,000,000,000 in cash funds to the Board of Peace within the first year of the Charter’s entry into force,” the draft says.Some critics worry that Trump may be trying to create an alternative to the United Nations, which he has long criticised.The board is described in the draft as “an international organization that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.” It would become official once three member states agree to the charter.However, the White House called the report “misleading” and said there is no minimum membership fee to join the Board of Peace.“This simply offers permanent membership to partner countries who demonstrate deep commitment to peace, security, and prosperity,” the White House said on X.The US state department, when asked by Reuters, referred to previous social media posts about the board by Trump and his special envoy Steve Witkoff, which did not mention the $1 billion figure.",US President Donald Trump wants nations to pay a king’s ransom of $1 billion to remain in harmony with the US and retain a seat on his proposed ‘peace board’ Some critics worry that Trump may be trying to create an alternative to the United Nations.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126636766,imgsize-938831,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Forrest “KreekCraft” Barnes says TikTok AI wrongly flagged his age, fans and creators react online







Forrest “KreekCraft” Barnes, one of the most well-known Roblox streamers, shocked his fans when he shared that TikTok had banned his account again. The ban happened on January 16, 2026, and it came at a time when KreekCraft was still active and posting regularly. The reason, according to him, was not rule breaking or bad content. Instead, TikTok’s AI system believed he was under 18 years old.KreekCraft shared the news himself on X, where he posted that TikTok’s automated age system had made a mistake. He explained that he is almost 29 years old and nowhere close to being underage. Many fans were quick to react, as this was not the first time the creator faced the same problem. The incident once again raised questions about how TikTok’s AI moderation works and how often real people review these decisions.According to KreekCraft, the ban also stopped him from going live on the platform, which is a key part of his content. TikTok’s message clearly stated that creators must be 18 or older to use LIVE features, and his access would only return years later unless fixed.KreekCraft explained his side clearly in his X post. He wrote,“TikTok just banned me again because their AI thinks I’m under 18 years old. I turn 29 in two weeks.AI age verification is a joke.”He also shared a screenshot from TikTok that read,“From 2022-11-13, creators must be 18 or older to go LIVE. The Virtual Items Policy and Community Guidelines will also be updated accordingly. LIVE access suspended. You can go LIVE and join a LIVE as a guest starting from January 15, 2031 18:59.”The post quickly gained attention, with more than 280 users replying. One user, @JeseMartinez, said,“I got banned because I promoted my business on a TikTok business account. They are a joke.”Another user, @SadCustomers, shared their frustration and wrote,“Yep, another awful AI-led process with almost no human intervention. They banned me for posting satirical content even though it wasn’t against their own terms and conditions.”This is not the first time KreekCraft faced this issue. On October 13, 2025, he posted a YouTube Shorts video explaining that TikTok ended his livestream while he was playing Roblox. He said,“So, I got banned on TikTok, and you’re never going to guess why. The TikTok AI thought I was a kid. I’m 28 years old. This is actually the second time it’s happened.”KreekCraft remains one of the biggest Roblox creators, with over 311,000 followers on Twitch and more than 16.1 million subscribers on YouTube.","Forrest “KreekCraft” Barnes, one of the most well-known Roblox streamers, shocked his fans when he shared that TikTok had banned his account again.

‘Escaped Somalia To Be Killed In US?’: Ilhan Omar TRASHES Trump In Fiery ‘ICE Kidnapping’ Hearing





A US federal judge on Friday barred immigration officers in Minnesota from detaining or using force against peaceful protesters.The ruling comes amid rising tensions between federal agents and demonstrators over a large federal immigration enforcement operation in the Minneapolis area, reported AP.In an 83-page order issued on Friday, US District Judge Katherine Menendez restricted how federal immigration agents may interact with protesters, barring them from arresting or detaining individuals engaged in “peaceful and unobstructive protest activity” or from retaliating against protected speech through the use of tear gas, pepper spray, or other crowd-dispersal tools.Judge Menendez ruled that officers may not arrest individuals without probable cause or reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed or that officers are being obstructed. She also barred agents from stopping vehicles when there is no reasonable suspicion, noting that “safely following agents at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion,” AP reported.The ruling grants a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed in December on behalf of six Minnesota activists represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The case alleges that federal agents violated protesters’ constitutional rights during immigration enforcement actions.The order gives the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 72 hours to bring its immigration operation in the Minneapolis–St Paul area into compliance.The order follows a series of violent encounters involving federal agents this month. On January 7, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer fatally shot 37-year-old American woman Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis during a federal immigration enforcement action, officials said the officer fired after Good’s vehicle approached him, though video evidence and local accounts have raised questions about the circumstances of the encounter.Later this week, on January 14, a federal officer shot a Venezuelan man in the leg during a targeted traffic stop in North Minneapolis. DHS said the man, identified as a Venezuelan national, fled and then engaged in a struggle with officers before the shot was fired, and he was hospitalised and is expected to recover.In a separate incident, DHS confirmed that Heber Sanchez Dominguez, a 34-year-old Mexican national, died while in ICE custody, bringing the number of deaths in ICE detention so far this year to at least four.The Justice Department is investigating Walz and Frey for allegedly impeding federal officers, CBS News reported, a move that could further inflame tensions. The department did not respond to requests for comment. Responding to the ruling, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the agency was taking “appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters,” AP reported, adding that obstructing or assaulting law enforcement remained a serious crime.Protests intensified after Good’s killing, with crowds clashing with immigration officers and counter-protesters. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz accused federal agents of carrying out “a campaign of organised brutality against the people of Minnesota,” in a video posted on X, AFP said. Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have called for peaceful protests against immigration sweeps.US President Donald Trump, who earlier threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy the military, said on Friday that there was no immediate need to do so. “If I needed it, I would use it. I don’t think there is any reason right now to use it,” he told reporters at the White House, according to AFP.BBC notes that the Insurrection Act, a 19th-century law, allows a US president to deploy active-duty military forces to carry out law-enforcement duties within the United States. Presidents may invoke the statute if they determine that “unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion” make it impracticable to enforce federal law through ordinary judicial proceedings.Once invoked, the law permits troops, including the National Guard, which is typically used for domestic emergencies and disaster response — to perform a wide range of functions, from quelling civil unrest and enforcing court orders to arresting and detaining migrants.","A US federal judge on Friday barred immigration officers in Minnesota from detaining or using force against peaceful protesters.

Kuwait Airways is shaking up global air travel in 2026 with the announcement of five exciting new direct international routes, strengthening its connectivity between the Gulf, Europe and Asia. The carrier, already serving more than 60 destinations worldwide, is expanding its line-up to include dream leisure spots and strategic business hubs. This move signals both confidence in post-pandemic travel demand and an ambitious bid to make Kuwait a more significant global aviation hub.The new direct services were confirmed in a report by Kuwait Times and while exact start dates for some destinations will be announced closer to mid-2026, a standout launch is already capturing attention. Flights from Kuwait to Mykonos, Greece, are set to resume with a twice-weekly service beginning June 14, 2026. Mykonos is one of Europe’s most popular sun-soaked holiday islands, making it a major draw for both Gulf residents and visitors.Here’s a look at the destinations Kuwait Airways is adding in its 2026 expansion:While Mykonos already has a firm launch date, the exact flight schedules for Beijing, Maldives and Phuket are expected to be published closer to their respective take-off times later in 2026.

This trend is also visible in other carriers in the region. For example, Etihad Airways expanded flight options to Europe and Asia in recent seasons, adding year-round and seasonal destinations to its Abu Dhabi network.Kuwait Airways’ network boost is part of a larger regional picture in which Gulf carriers are aggressively expanding routes to connect the Middle East with fast-growing markets in Europe and Asia. Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad and flydubai have similarly broadened their international reach in recent years, responding to robust demand from both leisure explorers and business travellers.For Kuwait, these new flights represent more than just tourism opportunities. They are strategic steps toward enhancing the country’s role as a global transit and tourism hub. With direct flights to top holiday destinations and major capitals alike, Kuwait Airways is positioning itself as a competitive choice for travellers throughout the Gulf and beyond.Kuwait Airways’ 2026 expansion marks a bold chapter in the airline’s global strategy, positioning the Gulf carrier as a key bridge between continents and cultures, with direct flights to sun-soaked beaches, island paradises and vital world capitals.","Kuwait Airways opens five new destinations for business and leisure travel in 2026.

Reza Pahlavi Highlights India As Key Partner For A Democratic Iran In Energy Technology And Trade





Reza Pahlavi, Iran’s exiled crown prince , on Friday spoke about India–Iran ties and future cooperation, while speaking about the ongoing protests against Iran’s clerical leadership.Speaking at a news conference, Pahlavi said India and Iran shared a relationship that went back decades. Recalling earlier ties, he said former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had visited Iran when he was very young.“I remember those days,” he said, adding that the connection between the two countries has long been cultural and historical.Pahalvi said the relationship has remained strong even in modern times. “In modern history, we have had a very, very good relationship,” he said.The exiled crown prince further said that a democratic Iran would naturally seek close ties with countries that respect sovereignty and liberty. “A democratic Iran is committed to having the best possible relationship with countries that share the same values,” he said.Pahlavi said India’s history and heritage made it a natural partner for deeper cooperation. “There is a rich history that I observe in India,” he said, adding that this could form the basis of a strong bond between the two nations.Pahalvi further described India as a leader in technology and expertise, particularly in renewable energy and information technology. “India is one of the leading countries when it comes to tech and expertise,” he said, expressing hope that experts from both sides could work closely in the future.He said a new phase of ties could begin once Iran was free. “Hopefully, once we are freed, we can start a new chapter,” he said.Reza Pahlavi is the eldest son of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Iran’s last shah, who was overthrown during the 1979 Islamic Revolution. He has lived in exile since the fall of the monarchy. He has been a prominent voice calling for protests to continue in the country.Iran has been witnessing widespread anti-government protests for over two weeks. What began as demonstrations over economic distress has expanded into broader calls for political change and an end to the country’s theocratic system. Protests have spread across several cities despite heavy security deployment, internet restrictions and mass arrests.","Reza Pahlavi, Iran’s exiled crown prince, spoke about India–Iran ties and future cooperation, while speaking about the ongoing protests.

Trump's Brutal ISIS Revenge: US Military Air-drops 90 Bombs On Arab Nation After Venezuela





US forces have killed a senior Al-Qaeda-affiliated operative in northwest Syria during a retaliatory strike linked to last month’s ambush that claimed the lives of two American soldiers and a civilian interpreter, US officials said.The strike, confirmed by US Central Command on Friday, targeted Bilal Hasan al-Jasim, whom officials described as “an experienced terrorist leader who plotted attacks and was directly connected” to the December 13 assault. The ambush killed Sergeant Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard and interpreter Ayad Mansoor Sakat.CENTCOM commander Admiral Brad Cooper said the operation underscored Washington’s determination to pursue those responsible for attacks on US personnel. “The death of a terrorist operative linked to the deaths of three Americans demonstrates our resolve in pursuing terrorists who attack our forces,” he said. “There is no safe place for those who conduct, plot, or inspire attacks on American citizens and our warfighters. We will find you.”The strike marked the third wave of US retaliation ordered by American President Donald Trump following the attack, forming part of a wider campaign aimed at “ISIS thugs” attempting to reorganise after the fall of former Syrian leader Bashar Assad a year ago.The Republican president has said Syrian forces were fighting alongside US troops as cooperation expands under the anti-ISIS coalition, and noted that Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa was “extremely angry and disturbed by this attack.""According to CENTCOM, the ongoing operation, codenamed “Hawkeye Strike,” has seen the US and allied forces, including Jordan and Syria, hit more than 100 Islamic State infrastructure and weapons targets.","US forces have killed a senior Al-Qaeda-affiliated operative in northwest Syria during a retaliatory strike linked to last month’s ambush that claimed the lives of two American soldiers and a civilian interpreter.

Greenland Explodes, Protesters Storm US Embassy As Trump Vows Takeover By June 1 | ‘Hands Off!’

Trump announces tariffs

Why Trump wants Greenland

Rising international tensions





Thousands of Greenlanders marched through snow- and ice-covered streets on Saturday in what is being described as the largest coordinated protests the Arctic island has seen. The mass rally was aimed at rejecting renewed pressure from US President Donald Trump to take control of the territory and voicing support for Greenland’s self-rule.In Nuuk, the capital, demonstrators waved their national flag, carried hand-painted signs reading “Greenland is not for sale” and chanted in Greenlandic as they walked from the city center to the US Consulate, which was sealed off by police. According to police and organizers, the march drew nearly a quarter of Nuuk’s population, making it unprecedented for a city of fewer than 20,000 people. Similar protests and solidarity rallies were held in other Greenlandic towns, as well as in Copenhagen and other Danish cities, news agency AP reported.Greenland prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen joined the march in Nuuk, at one point climbing onto a snowbank to raise a flag as the crowd cheered. “We said it last year, and we will keep saying it: We are not for sale,” Isak Berthelsen, a 43-year-old electrician was quoted by the New York Times as saying, adding that repeating the message was “energizing” because it showed Greenlanders had “our own voice.”Many protesters said they had reached a breaking point after repeated statements by Trump suggesting the United States would take Greenland “one way or the other.”“Every new statement makes it worse,” said Kristian Johansen, a retired carpenter who helped organize the demonstration. ""I hope it can show him that we stand together in Europe,’ Nuuk police officer Tom Olsen was quoted by AP as saying. 'We are not going down without a fight. ""As the protest in Nuuk concluded, news broke that Trump had announced a 10% import tax, starting in February, on goods from Denmark and several other European countries that oppose US control of Greenland. “I thought this day couldn’t get any worse but it just did,” said Malik Dollerup-Scheibel, a 21-year-old protester, after learning of the announcement, news agency AP reported.Despite concerns about the economic impact of tariffs, several demonstrators said Greenland’s autonomy mattered more. “This is a fight for freedom,” said former Greenland lawmaker Tillie Martinussen.Also read: Trump's Greenland push- Atlantic alliance cracks over Arctic US President Donald Trump has repeatedly argued that the United States needs to acquire Greenland for national security reasons, citing growing global competition in the Arctic. The White House reiterated this position last week, even as protests spread across Greenland and Denmark.“The President has made his priority quite clear. He wants the United States to acquire Greenland. He thinks it is in our best national security to do that,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a media briefing. She added that the deployment of European Nato troops to Greenland would not affect Trump’s plans, saying it did not “impact his goal of the acquisition of Greenland at all.”Trump has warned that if the United States does not take control of Greenland, rival powers would. He has said that “China or Russia will” otherwise gain influence over the strategically located Arctic island, comments that have heightened tensions within Nato and alarmed many Greenlanders.The renewed push has come alongside increased military activity in the Arctic. European Nato countries, including France, Germany, Sweden and Norway, have announced troop deployments to Greenland as part of Danish-led security exercises. Germany’s defense ministry said the mission was intended to examine ways to ensure Arctic security in response to what it described as “Russian and Chinese threats,” while France confirmed its first personnel were already en route, news agency AFP reported.The protests followed a week of heightened diplomatic and military activity. France, Germany, Sweden and Norway have announced the deployment of military personnel to Greenland as part of Danish-led exercises, a move Danish officials say is aimed at strengthening Arctic security. Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said a working group would be set up on security issues but stressed that “the American ambition to take over Greenland remains intact,” calling the situation “a serious matter. ”Greenland’s deputy prime minister, Mute Egede, said Nato forces would have a greater presence in coming days, while Russia has criticized the deployments. For many protesters, however, the message remained simple. “We are not American, and we will never be American,” said Maria Meier Brun at a rally in Copenhagen.","Thousands of Greenlanders march through snow- and ice-covered streets on Saturday.

In both ‘Embers of War’ and ‘

JFK

: Coming of Age in the American Century’, you emphasise the concept of “contingency” — the idea that critical junctures presented real choices for leaders. Comparing the early 1960s to the post-9/11 period, do you see a similar failure of American political culture to genuinely debate alternative paths, or were the structural pressures in each era fundamentally different?

Your biography of JFK details his evolution on Vietnam. Given the evidence of his private scepticism, if he had lived and won re-election in 1964, would a full-scale Americanisation of the war have been avoidable?

Your work shows JFK as a complex figure — both a committed Cold Warrior and a pragmatic internationalist who sought engagement with the non-aligned movement. In today’s era of renewed great-power competition, which aspect of his worldview do you find relevant or instructive?

In ‘Embers of War’, you establish the deep roots of the Vietnam conflict in the colonial period. When US policymakers later spoke of “learning from the French mistake”, what was the fundamental lesson they refused to learn?

How does focusing on a figure like JFK change your view of the

Cold War

? Can the Great Man Theory, which suggests that history is basically shaped by the actions of extraordinary men, and structuralist history coexist?

As a historian, you have done a lot to bridge the distance between academia and the public square. As you look at current global crises, what is the most urgent lesson from the early Cold War and Vietnam for today’s policymakers?





Harvard professor Fredrik Logevall is best known for his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ‘Embers of War’, which is a powerful account of the French conflict in Vietnam and the lessons America failed to learn from it. He is currently executive-producing the Netflix adaptation of his biography of John F Kennedy, starring Michael Fassbender as Joe Kennedy Sr.In this interview with Tina Shashikanth on the sidelines of the Jaipur Literature Festival, Logevall speaks about why history’s most enduring lesson may be humilityThere are differences and similarities. After 9/11, the threat felt immediate and acute to all Americans. In the early 1960s, Vietnam was a slow build-up that most ignored. The key similarity is how leaders in both eras boxed themselves in. By repeatedly declaring publicly that victory in Vietnam or Afghanistan was essential to American security, they made it politically excruciating to later change course. This points to how perceived domestic political imperatives, perhaps especially potent in a geographically powerful and secure nation like the US, can drive foreign policy.We can’t know for sure, but his doubts about a military solution were deeper than Lyndon Johnson’s. Crucially, Kennedy’s key decision would have come in his second term, liberating him from re-election politics. He was also more secure, actively encouraging dissenting voices in his administration, unlike Johnson, who demanded consensus. The change in leadership mattered.His internationalism and understanding of limits. He grasped that American power, however great, is finite. In the fall of 1961, in his first year as president, he said America cannot solve every world problem. While opposed to Soviet communism, he was deeply interested in arms control and preventing nuclear war. His inaugural address was, in my view, less aggressive and belligerent than often remembered. This sensibility — recognising the need to engage the world, not dominate it — is critical.They refused to learn that they were repeating French mistakes. Studying both the French and the American wars produces déjà vu: the problems of counterinsurgency, telling friend from foe, insufficient troops, and an apathetic or hostile local population were identical. However, Americans believed they were different because they were not colonialists but ‘liberators’, and more powerful. They failed to see that for most Vietnamese, both were large western powers imposing their will at gunpoint.Biography forces you to confront structure versus agency. There is this idea that the history of the world is, at least in part, the history of decisions made by powerful people. I believe both structure and agency matter. Leaders, especially American presidents during the Cold War, possessed significant agency — their decisions shaped history. Even today, Donald Trump can affect so much of what happens in the world. So, in a way, it’s a kind of affirmation of the so-called Great Man Theory of history. Yet, they also faced immense constraints, both internationally and domestically. It is a constant question for me as a biographer — what’s the role of individual agency versus the role played by the deep state? Sometimes people ask me, ‘Is biography different from history?’ The research is similar to general history, but biography keeps the individual constantly at the centre. If the subject disappears from the narrative for too long, the reader asks for them to be reintroduced.The most urgent thing that my reading of modern history teaches is the critical importance of considering unintended consequences. Leaders as well as ordinary people often fail to anticipate how things can go wrong. Related to this is the necessity for empathy — the capacity to see the world through others’ eyes, which I fear we are losing. Finally, a historical sensibility brings humility — about the limits of power, the importance of working with allies and even adversaries, and what can be achieved when we understand our constraints. It’s both a cautionary and a hopeful message.","Harvard professor Fredrik Logevall is best known for his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ‘Embers of War’ He is currently executive-producing the Netflix adaptation of his biography of John F Kennedy, starring Michael Fassbender as Joe Kennedy Sr. In this interview with Tina Shashikanth on the sidelines of the Jaipur Literature Festival, he speaks about why history's most enduring lesson may be humility.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126614548,imgsize-21920,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-1.jpg"

Trump's Health Back In Question As RFK Jr Talks On Podcast & Leavitt Steps In

FDA quietly removes older guidance

Can cellphone radiations cause cancer?





For years, fears about cellphone radiation have lived mostly on the fringes of the internet. This week, they moved straight into the federal government. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has publicly raised alarms about 5G towers and cellphone radiation, saying he believes electromagnetic radiation poses serious health risks, including cancer and DNA damage.His comments came just as his department launched a new study into cellphone radiation, reigniting a debate scientists say has already been studied extensively.In an exclusive interview with USA TODAY, Kennedy said concerns over 5G and cellphone radiation are not hypothetical to him.“Generally speaking, electromagnetic radiation is a major health concern,” Kennedy said when asked specifically about 5G towers. “I’m very concerned about it.”Speaking for USA TODAY’s “Extremely Normal” series, Kennedy went further, claiming there is extensive scientific backing for his position.He said there are “more than 10,000 studies” documenting harmful effects from electromagnetic radiation, including cancer, tumor growth and DNA damage.“EMFs are bad depending on the pulse rates and the wave lengths,” Kennedy said. “Some of them are very bad.”Earlier the Department of Health and Human Services has highlighted cellphone restrictions in schools as part of the administration’s “Make America Healthy Again” movement. According to the department, 22 states have limited cellphone use in schools to protect children’s health.But those policies are largely aimed at reducing the mental health impacts of social media, curbing cyberbullying, and limiting constant online engagement, not exposure to electromagnetic radiation. Since 2022, K–12 schools across the US have increasingly moved to ban phones in classrooms for behavioral and psychological reasons, not radiation concerns.The interview comes at a time when the federal agencies are also signaling a shift in tone. The Food and Drug Administration, which operates under Kennedy’s leadership, has removed older webpages that stated cellphones are not dangerous.Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for HHS, explained the move in a statement: “The FDA removed webpages with old conclusions about cell phone radiation while HHS undertakes a study on electromagnetic radiation and health research to identify gaps in knowledge, including on new technologies, to ensure safety and efficacy,” Nixon said.According to The Wall Street Journal, HHS now plans to research the possible health effects of radiation emitted by cell phones. The administration has not released new scientific evidence prompting the change.That raises a key question: what does existing science actually say?arge-scale international research has repeatedly found no clear link between cellphone use and cancer.In September 2024, the World Health Organization published a comprehensive review in the journal Environmental International. Experts from nine countries analyzed 63 studies on cellphone use and cancer conducted between 1994 and 2022.“The researchers found no connection between cellphone use and brain cancer,” the WHO said.That conclusion aligns with earlier global assessments. In 2011, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is part of the WHO, classified radiofrequency waves as “possibly carcinogenic to humans.” However, the agency did not identify a causal link, placing cellphone radiation in the same broad category as items like pickled vegetables and coffee at the time.Some laboratory studies in rats have suggested a possible association between radiofrequency radiation and cancer. But scientists have consistently cautioned that those findings do not easily translate to humans. Human studies remain limited, inconsistent, and difficult to replicate at meaningful exposure levels.","HHS Secretary Robert F.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday called for an end to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s 37-year reign, saying, “It’s time to look for new leadership in Iran,” in comments to POLITICO.Trump made the remarks as widespread protests calling for an end to the regime appeared to have waned, after thousands of protesters across the country were killed over the last three weeks. The killings prompted Trump to repeatedly threaten military intervention.On Tuesday, Trump called on Iranians to keep protesting and “take over institutions,” saying that “help is on its way.” The next day, the president abruptly changed course, saying he had been informed that the killings had stopped.“The best decision he ever made was not hanging more than 800 people two days ago,” Trump said Saturday, when asked about the size of a possible US military operation in Iran.Trump’s comments came shortly after Khamenei’s X account posted a series of hostile messages aimed at Trump, accusing the US president of being responsible for deadly violence and unrest in Iran.“We find the US President guilty due to the casualties, damages and slander he inflicted upon the Iranian nation,” Khamenei wrote.In another post, he said Trump had mischaracterised violent groups as representing the Iranian people, calling it “an appalling slander.”Trump, after being read the posts, said Tehran’s rulers rely on repression and violence to govern. “What he is guilty of, as the leader of a country, is the complete destruction of the country and the use of violence at levels never seen before,” Trump said. “In order to keep the country functioning — even though that function is a very low level — the leadership should focus on running his country properly, like I do with the United States, and not killing people by the thousands in order to keep control. ”“Leadership is about respect, not fear and death,” Trump added.The exchange underscored a sharpening rhetoric between Washington and Tehran at a volatile moment for the region, and as Khamenei recently made a public address in which he claimed that “the Iranian nation has defeated America.”Trump went further in personal terms, denouncing Khamenei and the Iranian system of governance.“The man is a sick man who should run his country properly and stop killing people,” Trump said. “His country is the worst place to live anywhere in the world because of poor leadership.”",US President Donald Trump called for an end to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s 37-year reign.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly criticised the US administration over the composition of a newly announced Gaza governing body, marking a rare open disagreement with President Donald Trump’s White House.In a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, Netanyahu said the announcement on the “Gaza Executive Board” was made without coordination with Israel and runs counter to Israeli policy.As per the Times of Israel, the statement said that “the announcement regarding the composition of the Gaza Executive Board, which is subordinate to the Board of Peace, was not coordinated with Israel and contradicts its policy”.The White House had earlier named both an “Executive Board” and a separate “Gaza Executive Board” as part of its Gaza ceasefire and governance plan.The inclusion of figures such as Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan in the Gaza Executive Board is believed to be one of the main reasons behind Netanyahu’s decision to issue the statement.Turkey has strained relations with Israel, despite maintaining contacts with Hamas.The Prime Minister’s Office said Netanyahu has instructed foreign minister Gideon Sa’ar to raise Israel’s concerns directly with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.This is notable as Sa’ar has largely been kept away from handling Israel-US relations in recent months, which have instead been managed through Netanyahu’s office and his close advisers.The US administration has said the Gaza governance plan will be overseen by a “Board of Peace” led by President Trump, with an executive committee of international figures supervising the process.The executive committee includes US secretary of state and national security adviser Marco Rubio, White House Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, former British prime minister Tony Blair, World Bank president Ajay Banga and Apollo Global Management chief Marc Rowan.Regional representatives named include Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan, Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi, Egypt’s intelligence chief Gen Hassan Rashad, and UAE Cabinet minister Reem Al-Hashimy.Other members include Maj Gen Jasper Jeffers, appointed to lead an international stabilisation force, former UN Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov as high representative for Gaza, UN humanitarian coordinator Sigrid Kaag, and Israeli businessman Yakir Gabay, who provides Israel with an unofficial presence on the board, according to news agency AP.Ali Shaath has been named head of the new Palestinian committee to run Gaza’s daily affairs.The White House says the plan has entered its second phase, which includes international security deployment, disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction of Gaza.Netanyahu’s statement, however, signals Israeli discomfort with key elements of the plan being advanced without prior coordination with Jerusalem.",Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly criticised the US administration over the composition of a newly announced Gaza governing body.

'Don't take up part-time jobs': Fresh warning on social media amid reports of ICE detaining two Indians from a Minnesota restaurant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dont-take-up-part-time-jobs-fresh-warning-on-social-media-amid-reports-of-ice-detaining-two-indians-from-a-minnesota-restaurant/articleshow/126622012.cms,"Working at restaurants on student visa





Amid the ongoing ICE crackdown in Minnesota, primarily targeting Somali migrants, a video of two students being detained by the ICE went viral, claiming that they are Indian students. Several NRI groups circulated the video with a warning message asking Indian students to stay away from part-time restaurant jobs, as the visa does not permit this and they can be arrested for breaking the law.Going by the viral claim, the incident took place at an Indian restaurant at St. Louis Park, Minnesota. There has been no official confirmation about the raid at an Indian restaurant or the arrest of two Indian students working there who were believed to be released later after questioning, but the ICE crackdown is going on in St Louis Park.ICE agents are storming establishments in the area, including day cares, elementary schools, as photos and videos of their confrontation with the locals, who allege that their daily life is being disrupted because of the heavy presence of the ICE agents, go viral. Democrats have condemned the intense trauma and terror caused by the enforcement surge in Minnesota.Minnesota has been targeted because of the alleged welfare fraud linked to Somali migrants.But the ICE agents are raiding any establishment, picking up anyone obstructing their work, and questioning people about their citizenship.The crackdown goes on even after the shooting of Minneapolis woman Renee Good, a US citizen, triggered a major controversy and the ICE agent Jonathan Ross is still in hiding because of public outrage. The administration defended Ross and said he fired at the woman because the woman was coming at him with her car.As NRI channels are openly alerting students not to engage in part-time employment at restaurants, it came to the surface how Indian students are openly breaking visa rules as F-1 visa in the US does not allow students to work outside the campus. They are allowed on-campus jobs only up to 20 hours per week during semesters. But many local Indian restaurants employ them without any legal basis with a cash-in-hand arrangement which is a serious violation of the visa status that may qualify for loss of F-1 status, visa cancellation and future visa problems in the US.","Video of two students being detained by the ICE went viral, claiming that they are Indian students.

US had months of quiet talks with Venezuela’s Diosdado Cabello before and after Maduro raid — is Delcy Rodriguez’s position at risk?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-had-months-of-quiet-talks-with-venezuelas-diosdado-cabello-before-and-after-maduro-raid-is-delcy-rodriguezs-position-at-risk/articleshow/126619610.cms,"Trump ‘STEALS’ Machado's Nobel Medal, Brands It Reward for ‘Work Done’; Move Seals New Caracas Plan?





In the 12 days since the US seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, interim President Delcy Rodriguez worked to consolidate her power by installing loyalists in key positions to protect herself from internal threats, and one of them is interior minister Diosdado Cabello.A new Reuters report revealed a lot about Diosdado Cabello and his connection with the US authorities and also about Rodriguez, who is very firm to secure her position.Rodriguez, 56, a quiet but rigorous technocrat who was vice president and oil minister, named a central banker to help run the economy, a presidential chief of staff and a new head of Venezuela’s feared DGCIM, the military counterintelligence agency built over decades with Cuban assistance.Major General Gustavo Gonzalez, 65, will now head the agency, a move three sources with knowledge of the govt described as an early gambit by Rodriguez to counter what many in Venezuela said was the biggest threat to her leadership: Diosdado Cabello, Venezuela's hardline interior minister with close ties to the security services and the dreaded “colectivos” motorcycle gangs which have killed opposition supporters.""She is very clear that she doesn't have the capacity to survive without the consent of the Americans,"" said one source close to the govt. ""She's already reforming the armed forces, removing people and naming new officials.""Interviews with seven sources in Venezuela, including diplomats, business people and politicians, revealed in previously unreported detail the fault line at the heart of Venezuela's govt and the risks it posed to Rodriguez as she tried to consolidate internal control while meeting Trump administration dictates on oil sales. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.The tightrope Rodriguez was attempting to walk was evident in her first major speech since taking office. Addressing parliament in a national annual address on Thursday, she called for unity, stressed her bona fides as Maduro’s loyal deputy, and vowed to forge a new chapter in Venezuela’s politics with increased oil investment.Venezuela’s communications ministry, which handles all press inquiries for the govt and individual officials, did not respond to a request for comment for this story.The White House responded to emailed questions from Reuters by referring the news agency to recent comments made by Trump. In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Trump said Rodriguez ""has been very good to deal with"" and that he expected her to visit Washington at some point.Rodriguez, nicknamed ""the tsarina"" for her business connections, had broad influence over the country's civilian levers of power, including the crucial oil industry, and now also enjoyed the backing of the United States. That backing appeared to be reemphasised on Thursday when Rodriguez met with CIA director John Ratcliffe in Caracas.The other main faction was led by Cabello. Cabello, who also heads the ruling PSUV socialist party, is a former soldier with a weekly four-hour show on state television, which has run for 12 years. His first public act after Maduro's capture was to appear on screen dressed in a flak jacket and surrounded by armed guards as he led a chant of, ""To doubt is to betray.”Officials in the Trump administration had contact with Cabello months before the operation to seize Maduro and have also been in communication with him since, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, warning him against using the security services or colectivos to target the opposition.Cabello, who was jailed in Venezuela for backing eventual socialist President Hugo Chavez in a failed 1992 coup, is under indictment in the US and has a $25 million reward for his capture.So far Cabello has been conciliatory towards Rodriguez, saying they are “very united” and he arrived at Thursday's national address alongside Rodriguez and her brother Jorge, the head of the national assembly. But sources with knowledge of their relationship told Reuters that Cabello remained the biggest threat to her ability to govern.In Caracas, security forces were skittish. A few hours after Rodriguez was sworn in, there was a brief burst of anti-aircraft fire outside the presidential palace that some feared could be another US attack. Instead, reports suggested it was a miscommunication between police and the presidential guard, which shot down police drones. The govt said the craft were spy drones, without explaining who they belonged to.Across the country, people were reeling from the shock of Maduro’s capture and unsure whether to be hopeful or scared. In some places, local socialist party branches asked members to spy on their neighbours and report anyone celebrating Maduro’s downfall, according to three party members who spoke on condition of anonymity.In this tense environment, Rodriguez had to persuade party loyalists that she was not a US puppet who betrayed Maduro. She also had to stabilise an economy that saw prices for basic goods soar in the days since the US attack, as well as wrestle some degree of control over the sprawling military-linked patronage networks that developed over decades of Chavismo rule.Venezuela has as many as 2,000 generals and admirals, more than double the number in the United States, a military superpower with 20 times more active duty and reserve troops. Senior and retired officers control food distribution, raw materials and the state oil company PDVSA, while dozens of generals sit on the boards of private firms.Many officials were able to run their regional fiefdoms as they saw fit, ordering patrols or checkpoints by soldiers under their command, and some parts of the country and the capital Caracas saw increased activity by security services since Maduro's capture.Gonzalez, the new head of the military counterintelligence agency DGCIM, worked closely with Cabello over his long career in Venezuela’s govt, particularly during two stints as head of the separate civilian spy agency.Yet it was to Rodriguez that Gonzalez owed his most recent posts. In 2024, Rodriguez tapped Gonzalez for a top job at the state oil company, Venezuela’s most important company and the engine of the country’s economy.Questions still remained over how much control Gonzalez would be able to exert over DGCIM. Cabello's allies within the agency could undermine him, the three sources with knowledge of the govt said.One source with knowledge of the inner workings of the security services said Gonzalez's DGCIM predecessor General Javier Marcano struggled to control the agency.""The role of boss of repression already has a name… Diosdado,"" this person said. ""Marcano was coordinating with (civilian) militias and with the colectivos, but he had serious difficulties controlling DGCIM because his designation was nominal.""Reuters could not reach Marcano directly and all formal communication with officials in Venezuela is handled through the communications ministry, which did not respond to a list of questions related to this story.The colectivos, closely connected to Cabello, could also make the country ungovernable by implementing a so-called ""anarchization"" strategy, which was first designed to fend off US intervention but could be directed against Rodriguez, the source close to the govt told Reuters. That strategy would mobilise the intelligence services and colectivos to plunge Caracas into disorder and chaos.Cabello could also slow the pace of prisoner releases that have been hailed by Trump. They have been proceeding much more slowly than demanded by families and rights groups, creating a potential pressure point for Rodriguez.Outside of Venezuela, however, pressure on Cabello continued to mount.""For the Trump administration to achieve a real transition in Venezuela, sooner or later Diosdado Cabello must face U.S. justice,"" US Representative Maria Elvira Salazar said on X this month. ""When Diosdado is brought to justice, it will be a decisive step toward a democratic transition in Venezuela and the release of all political hostages.""",Interim President Delcy Rodriguez has installed loyalists in key positions to protect herself from internal threats. Interior minister Diosdado Cabello is seen as the biggest threat to her leadership.

"New York heist: Gunmen take 'gotta catch ’em all' too seriously; Pokémon cards worth $100,000 stolen",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-york-heist-gunmen-take-gotta-catch-em-all-too-seriously-pokmon-cards-worth-100000-stolen/articleshow/126620441.cms,"Representative image





“Gotta catch ’em all” is meant to be a childhood slogan about collecting fantasy creatures, not a real-world crime spree. But in a brazen robbery that stunned New York’s trading card community, armed men appeared to take the Pokémon mantra far too literally, storming a Manhattan card shop and making off with rare collectables worth over $100,000.The robbery took place around 6:45 pm (local time) on Wednesday at Poké Court, a newly opened store on West 13th Street, an area better known for luxury boutiques and exclusive clubs.Three men entered the shop, and one of them immediately pulled out a gun and pointed it at customers and staff, store owner Courtney Chin was quoted as saying by the New York Times.Another suspect pulled a curtain across the front of the store and stood guard to stop anyone from leaving.Security footage shows two of the men smashing a locked display case with a hammer and grabbing high-value Pokémon cards and sealed packs before stuffing them into backpacks.Chin said the store keeps its most valuable items in the case, including rare and professionally authenticated cards.“They started systemically taking the items that had really large price tags, really high values,” Chin said, adding that the stolen items included a first-edition Charizard card worth about $15,000, as per the New York Times.Products inside the case were priced between $400 and $18,000, according to Peter Du, the store’s partnerships manager.The men, dressed in black, also took an unknown amount of cash from the register and stole a phone from a 27-year-old woman, police said.The entire incident lasted about three minutes, and no one was injured. No arrests have been made so far, and the investigation is ongoing, according to the New York Police Department, reported NBC News.The robbery occurred during Poké Court’s first community event since opening in November. Around 50 people were inside the store for a free arts-and-crafts workshop focused on customising Pokémon card display cases.Chin said she was shocked the shop was targeted on the night of the event. “It’s a beautiful place. It’s a community space, and we obviously want to keep it safe and bright and cozy and welcoming,” she said.A heightened police presence was seen outside the store the following day, with broken glass still visible on the smashed display case. Supporters of the store sent snacks and supplies, a gesture that content creator Keem Kim described as reflecting the spirit of the Pokémon community, as per the New York Times.The Manhattan robbery is the latest in a growing string of Pokémon card thefts across the United States. At least $300,000 worth of Pokémon cards were stolen from a California shop earlier this month, while a Massachusetts store lost more than $100,000 worth of rare cards in July, according to the New York Times.NBC News also reported recent incidents in Los Angeles, including a burglary in Burbank involving around $100,000 in merchandise and a separate robbery where a customer’s Pokémon collection valued at roughly $300,000 was stolen.Experts say the surge in thefts reflects the rising value of trading cards. Corey Williams, an assistant professor of economics at Shippensburg University, said, as quoted by the New York Times, that the pandemic fuelled renewed interest in Pokémon, with some collectors treating rare cards as low-cost investments.The weaponisation of monetary value, he noted, has made such items increasingly attractive targets for criminals.Store managers say many card shops are now rethinking security, including limiting displays of high-value cards or moving to appointment-only visits, as the risk of theft continues to grow.As investigators sift through security footage and hunt for leads, the slogan seems to have taken on a new, unintended meaning. This time, it’s not collectors but the police who are under pressure to “catch them all” — and bring the stolen Pokémon cards back where they belong.","The robbery took place around 6:45 pm (local time) on Wednesday at Poké Court, a newly opened store on West 13th Street.

Dr Hanuman Gowda, a 31-year-old Indian-origin physician working at ProMedica Hospital, has been arrested and charged after his 10-week-old son was found with multiple broken bones. Dr Gowda said he did not know how this happened, as there was no physical or verbal abuse at home. Days later, he told the police that the infant might have fallen off the bed, or off the bounce chair but investigators told him that the injuries were not consistent with what he was describing. Then Dr Gowda showed how he changed his son's diapers and police arrested him as they alleged that being a physician Dr Gowda was aware that his hand placement on a baby's chest would have caused great pain.Dr Gowday has been charged with two counts of second-degree felonious assault, two counts of second-degree endangering children, and two counts of third-degree endangering children.On January 4, the baby was brought to the Toledo Hospital after Dr Gowda reported that the baby appeared to be in pain. A medical examination revealed that teh baby had at least ten different bone fractures throughout his body. The hospital informed the police and reported ""possible non-accidental trauma"" to the baby.Dr Gowda described to the police how he would put his hand on the baby's chest to hold him down while changing his diaper. According to the affidavit he said “he has done this hard enough that he knows he is causing pain” to the infant.He also told police he would grab the baby’s arms and hold them down on the side “with force” and “he knows he has caused pain” to the infant because the child was crying.The incident was separate from Dr Gowda's work at the hospital and he was put on administrative leave. “We will work with and support the involved authorities as appropriate.

Pakistan Calls Indian Army Chief's Terror Camp Remark Delusional Rhetoric, Terror Bosses Blow Cover





At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday, including six children, as dense fog and over-speeding continued to disrupt traffic across several regions, according to officials.In the first incident, 14 people, including six children and five women, lost their lives when a truck carrying passengers fell from a bridge into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district.According to news agency PTI, the accident occurred in Kot Momin tehsil, around 200 kilometres from Lahore, during the early hours of the day.A spokesperson for Punjab Emergency Services Rescue 1122 said the truck had 23 people on board, most of them members of an extended family travelling from Islamabad to Faisalabad to attend a funeral.“As the motorway was closed because of heavy fog, the truck took a local route. It fell from the Galapur bridge in Kot Momin tehsil into a dry canal as the driver lost control over the vehicle because of poor visibility,” the spokesperson said.Nine people were injured in the crash and are being treated at the Civil Hospital in Kot Momin, according to PTI.In a separate incident in Balochistan, at least nine people were killed and 15 others injured when a passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway near Gwadar early Saturday.Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police Aslam Bangulzai confirmed the accident, saying the coach was travelling from Jiwani to Karachi. “The accident took place early this morning on the Makran coastal highway as the passenger coach overturned due to over speeding,” Bangulzai said, as quoted by PTI.Dense fog has severely affected traffic movement across Punjab’s motorways and major roads during night and early morning hours since the onset of an extreme cold wave last month.As reported by Dawn, several motorway sections have been closed intermittently due to low visibility.Pakistan frequently witnesses fatal road accidents, with factors such as over-speeding, poor enforcement of traffic rules, driver fatigue and weak licensing controls cited as major causes.On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed in a head-on collision between a bus and a van on the Jhang-Faisalabad road in Punjab, according to PTI.","At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday.

Shaksgam Valley: India bristles over China's fresh claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shaksgam-valley-india-bristles-over-chinas-fresh-claim-dispute-explained/articleshow/126529230.cms,"What is the Shaksgam Valley?

What is the dispute about?

Why does Shaksgam Valley matter strategically?

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh

The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth

The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications

Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims

For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?





NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The Shaksgam Valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region. It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east. It is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle. Beijing's defence of infrastructure construction in the region has drawn a sharp response.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126529183,imgsize-1792158,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"

Pact To Power Bloc: How Turkish Arms, Saudi Money And Pakistan Nukes May Align In Islamic NATO





Islamic Nato in the making? Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, this can be seen as an effort in direction to reshape security alignments in the Middle East region and beyond, as Bloomberg reported.The pact, initially signed by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in September, reportedly states that “any aggression” against one member would be treated as an attack on all -- a provision that mirrors Article 5 of Nato, of which Turkey is a member and fields the second-largest military after the US.Talks on Turkey’s entry are said to be at an advanced stage, with a deal appearing likely, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on condition of anonymity.Bloomberg reported that the expanded alliance reflects growing overlap in the strategic interests of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan across South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa.Turkey also sees the arrangement as a way to strengthen its security and deterrence posture at a time when questions persist over US reliability and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato, despite Washington’s close military ties with all three countries.Saudi Arabia would bring financial strength to the grouping, Pakistan its nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkey contributes military experience and a rapidly expanding defence industry, said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.“As the US prioritizes its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan said.Turkish defence ministry declined to comment on the report. Pakistan’s information ministry did not respond to requests for comment, while Saudi officials were unavailable over the weekend.If Turkey formally joins the pact, it would highlight a new phase in relations with Saudi Arabia, once rivals for leadership of the Sunni Muslim world. After years of strained ties, the two countries are now deepening economic and defence cooperation, including holding their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.Despite shared concerns over Shiite-majority Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia favour engagement with Tehran rather than confrontation. They also back a stable, Sunni-led Syria and support Palestinian statehood.Turkey and Pakistan already enjoy close military ties. Ankara is building corvette warships for Pakistan’s navy, has upgraded Islamabad’s F-16 fighter jets, and shares drone technology with both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Bloomberg previously reported that Turkey now wants both countries to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet programme.The trilateral defence discussions come after a ceasefire between India and Pakistan ended a four-day military clash and high tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Regional tensions remain high, however, with Pakistan and Afghanistan at odds following clashes and accusations by Islamabad that the Taliban is sheltering hostile militant groups.Turkey and Qatar have mediated talks between the sides, though those efforts have so far failed to produce a breakthrough, Bloomberg reported.","Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

‘Not 1, Not 1,000’: Jem Chief Masood Azhar Returns With Audio Threat As India Tightens Terror Noose

Def experts: Azhar’s statement sign of post-Sindoor frustration





A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","New audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar has surfaced on social media.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality





Pakistan on Saturday claimed that Iraq has expressed “keen interest” in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft, following talks between the air chiefs of the two countries.According to a statement issued by the Pakistan Army, air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, chief of air staff of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), met lieutenant general staff pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi, commander of the Iraqi Air Force, during an official visit to Iraq.The discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, including joint training, capacity building and operational coordination.“The Iraqi air chief praised PAF’s professionalism and technological advancement, expressed interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak trainer aircraft,” the statement said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Both sides also agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability between the two air forces.The JF-17 Thunder is a single-engine, lightweight combat aircraft jointly developed by China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.Pakistan has claimed that the aircraft proved its capabilities during last year’s conflict with India, although its effectiveness remains disputed.Pakistan had also deployed Chinese-origin J-10 fighter jets during the May 7–10 hostilities with India.The development comes days after Pakistan and Bangladesh air chiefs held talks on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 jets by Dhaka. However, Bangladesh has not officially confirmed any such plan.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif recently claimed that the country has seen increased interest in its fighter aircraft following the May 2025 standoff with India. Reports have also suggested that Pakistan is exploring similar defence deals with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, amid ongoing financial pressures.Notably, Pakistan has repeatedly relied on International Monetary Fund support in recent years, with the IMF approving a $7 billion bailout in September 2024 and an additional $1.4 billion loan in May 2025.",Iraq has expressed “keen interest’ in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft.

Widespread protests erupted in Pakistan’s Sindh province after a young Hindu farmer was killed by a landlord in Badin.According to a report by Pakistan's news outlet the Nation, Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.Following Kolhi’s death, demonstrators staged sit-ins on the Badin–Hyderabad National Highway and the Badin–Thar Coal Road. Hundreds of vehicles remained stranded for hours as protesters demanded justice for the killing of Kolhi and vowed not to disperse until those responsible are arrested.According to a statement shared by activist Shiva Kachhi, the protest has been ongoing without pause.“The protest for the arrest of the killers of the martyred Kailash Kolhi is making history. Shiva Kachhi, Chairman of Pakistan Darawar Ittehad, is leading the historic protest sit-in. This was not just a protest—it was the cry of a wounded conscience. From 10:00 am yesterday until late into the night, the sit-in continued without pause, proving that the demand for justice cannot be silenced,” Kachhi said in a social media post on X.“Men, women, elderly people, and innocent children stayed on the streets with one voice and one demand: justice for Kailash Kolhi.Arrest the killers. Despite exhaustion, hunger, and the cold of the night, the determination of the protesters remained unshaken. Kailash Kolhi’s only ‘crime’ was that he was poor, marginalised, and courageous enough to exist in a system that protects the powerful and crushes the weak. The tears of his children, the grief of his mother, and the silent agony of his widow are today questioning the entire system: Is the blood of the poor so cheap?” he added.Earlier, the victim’s family and community members staged a protest by placing the body at Piru Lashari Stop, where the SSP Badin assured them that the accused would be arrested within 24 hours.The incident occurred four days ago in Raho Kolhi village in the Piru Lashari city area. Despite assurances from district police officials, the main accused has yet to be arrested.The ongoing protest has drawn participation from leaders and workers of several political, nationalist, religious, and social organisations, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Jiye Sindh Mahaz, Qaumi Awami Tehreek, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (Bashir Qureshi group), and Awami Tehreek, The Nation reported.","Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif in a controversial statement has urged the United States and Turkey to “kidnap” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if they believed in justice and humanity, over the Israel-Gaza conflict.In a televised interview, whose clips have now gone viral on social media, Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away.”He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it.”Describing Netanyahu as the “worst criminal of humanity,” Asif claimed that “no atrocities in history match those committed against Palestinians in Gaza.” He added, “No community has done what Israel has done to Palestinians in the last 4,000-5,000 years. He [Netanyahu] is the biggest criminal of humanity. The world has not seen a bigger criminal.”Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes, beginning a sentence with, “And what does the law say about those who support such criminals…” before the show’s anchor, Hamid Mir, interjected and called for a break.Mir warned that Asif’s remarks risked being interpreted as a veiled reference to US President Donald Trump, and indicated that Asif would not remain on air after the break.Pakistan does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has historically expressed strong support for the Palestinian cause.

Gen Z uprising in Pakistan?

Is Pakistan heading towards a Gen Z uprising? A PhD student from the country has sparked a debate after critically examining present-day Pakistan, under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and army chief and de facto power centre Asim Munir , without naming either directly.The piece, written through a lens that shows contrast in powerful boomer generation and youth of Gen Z-Alpha, quickly struck a chord online and became a flashpoint for what many described as a quiet rebellion. It highlighted the widening divide between Pakistan’s ruling establishment, often referred to as “Boomers,” and its increasingly restless Gen Z population.The article, titled “It is over,” was written by US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani and published in Pakistan’s daily The Express Tribune on January 1. It was later taken down, reportedly following pressure from the Pakistani military.“For the older men and women in power, it's over. The young generation isn't buying any of what you're trying to sell to them. No matter how many talks and seminars you arrange in schools and colleges, trying to promote patriotism, it isn't working,” Nizamani wrote.Writing from the perspective of Gen Z and Generation Alpha, Nizamani rejected what he described as an imposed narrative of patriotism pushed by those in power, arguing that such efforts no longer resonate with young Pakistanis.“Young minds, the Gen Z, the alphas, they know exactly what is happening, and despite your consistent efforts of trying to 'sell' your views of patriotism to them, they are seeing right through it. Thanks to the internet, thanks to whatever little education we have left, despite your best efforts of keeping the masses as illiterate as possible, you have failed. You have failed to tell people what to think, they are thinking for themselves. They might be a little too scared to speak their minds because they prefer breathing,” Nizamani wrote.He argued that forced patriotism, speeches and seminars cannot replace justice, opportunity and basic rights, and said young people clearly see corruption, inequality and hypocrisy despite censorship and propaganda.Nizamani also highlighted generational differences over economic freedom, writing, “The Gen Z wants erased restrictions on freelancing, the boomers want to increase regulations on freelancing.”Concluding his article, he wrote: “Boomers, we have had enough. We aren't buying your narrative anymore. It's worn out.”The article drew support from followers of former prime minister Imran Khan, who is currently incarcerated. The Canada wing of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) shared the article on X, highlighting its key points.“Zorain Nizamani's article ‘It is Over’ was removed from eTribune most likely for exposing the reality: DG ISPR's university visits are futile. The youth see through propaganda and are no longer easy to mislead or control,” the PTI Canada wing said.Pakistani activist Mehlaqa Samdani also linked the article’s removal to censorship. “Not surprisingly, this article is no longer accessible through the Express Tribune's digital edition, exactly the kind of censorship Zorain talks about,” she wrote.The episode has intensified online debate over whether Pakistan’s younger generation is moving from quiet disillusionment toward open resistance against an entrenched establishment widely seen as out of touch.","US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani wrote an article on Pakistan's ruling establishment.

Pakistan on Tuesday expressed confidence that it may no longer need financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund within six months, with Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif claiming the country had seen a surge in aircraft orders following a four-day military standoff with India in May, Geo TV reported.Speaking on a Geo News programme, Asif made a fanciful claim while arguing that the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict showcased Pakistan's ""resolve and military effectiveness"" to the world.Military tensions escalated in May 2025 after Pakistan-sponsored terrorists carried out a terror attack in Pahalgam, killing 26 civilians in April. India responded with a strong military operation, launching Operation Sindoor, under which it targeted and destroyed multiple terror camps and Pakistani military facilities.However, Khawaja Asif, appearing disconnected from the ground reality, made such statements after a Bangladeshi defence delegation met Pakistan's air chief to discuss a potential sale of the JF-17 Thunder, the multi-role fighter aircraft jointly developed by China and Pakistan.There are also reports of talks between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to convert about $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, according to two Pakistani sources cited by Reuters.According to Arab News, several countries have since stepped up defence engagement with Pakistan.“Right now, the number of orders we are receiving after reaching this point is significant because our aircraft have been tested,” defence minister Asif told Pakistan’s Geo News channel.“We are receiving these orders, and it is possible that after six months we may not even need the IMF,” he said.Pakistan markets the Chinese co-developed JF-17 as a lower-cost multi-role fighter and has positioned itself as a supplier offering aircraft, training and maintenance outside Western supply chains.“I am saying this with full confidence,” Asif said. “If all these orders materialise over the next six months, we will not need the IMF.”Pakistan has repeatedly turned to the International Monetary Fund over the years, for financial support to stabilise its fragile economy, with such assistance tied to strict conditions including fiscal reforms, subsidy cuts and revenue-enhancing measures.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a separate $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at bolstering the country’s economic stability and climate resilience.Demonstrating Dhaka’s efforts to move closer to Islamabad, Bangladesh has expressed “potential interest” in acquiring the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft from Pakistan, along with plans to resume direct flights between the two countries from January 29 after a gap of more than a decade.The JF-17, jointly developed by China and Pakistan, was deployed by Pakistan against India during the May 7–10 hostilities. In November last year, Indian Air Force chief Air chief Marshal A P Singh said the aircraft was among at least five high-tech Pakistani fighters shot down during Operation Sindoor.This latest development and closeness between Pakistan and Bangladesh comes under the pretext of Dhaka's straining relations with India.Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are also in talks to convert around $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, as two Pakistani sources told Reuters, in a move that would deepen military cooperation between two Islamic nations. Pakistan and Saudi signed a mutual defence pact last year.The discussions highlight efforts by the long-time allies to operationalise defence cooperation at a time when Pakistan is under acute financial strain and Saudi Arabia is recalibrating its security partnerships amid uncertainty over US commitments in the Middle East.","Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif says country may not need IMF help in six months.

DHAKA: Demonstrating Dhaka’s efforts to get closer to Islamabad, Bangladesh has expressed a “potential interest” in procuring the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft from Pakistan, besides resuming direct flights between the two countries from Jan 29, after over a decade.JF-17 — jointly developed by China and Pakistan — was used against India during the May 7-10 hostilities by Pakistan — a combat aircraft, which IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh in Nov last year said was among the “at least five high-tech Pakistani fighters” shot down during Operation Sindoor.“Detailed discussions were held on the ‘potential procurement’ of JF-17 Thunder aircraft,” the Pakistan military's media wing ISPR said in a statement following a meeting between Bangladesh air force chief Hasan Mahmood Khan and his Pakistani counterpart Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu in Islamabad on Tuesday. “The meeting focused on strengthening operational cooperation and institutional synergy, with emphasis on training, capacity building, and collaboration in aerospace advancements,” ISPR said, an indication of warming relations between Islamabad and.

Own goal? Pakistan admits political-criminal-terror nexus on its soil; report flags rising violence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/own-goal-pakistan-admits-political-criminal-terror-nexus-on-its-soil-report-flags-rising-violence/articleshow/126374963.cms,"Explained: The Sindhudesh Push In Karachi And The Historical Fractures Driving Pakistan’s Turmoil





Pakistan’s Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Tuesday said that nearly 71% of terrorist incidents reported in 2025 originated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). He attributed this concentration to a “politically conducive environment and the flourishing political-criminal-terror-nexus which is flourishing there”.Data released by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) reinforces the scale of the surge. KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025” — a year-on-year increase of more than 40%.The broader national picture is even starker. According to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths. These included 2,115 terrorists, 664 security personnel, 580 civilians and 28 members of pro-government peace committees. PICSS said violence intensified in both “tempo and lethality”, pushing multiple security indicators to their highest levels in years.“Militant attacks climbed to their highest annual total since 2014, and the use of suicide bombings and small drones showed a clear upward trend,” the report said.Suicide attacks rose by 53%, while terrorist incidents overall increased to 1,063 — the highest since 2014.Security forces and civilians also bore rising costs. Security personnel fatalities rose 26% to their highest level since 2011, while civilian deaths increased by 24%, marking the worst toll in a decade. Injuries surged by 53% to 2,263, with sharp rises across all categories.The violence has been most acute in KP and Balochistan. In Bannu alone, Deputy Inspector General Sajjad Khan said 27 police personnel were killed in 134 attacks during 2025. Police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations, arresting 105 militants and killing 65, he said.Pakistan frequently accuses Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities of sheltering the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group blamed for a sharp increase in attacks inside Pakistan since 2021. Afghan officials reject the allegations, insisting they do not permit their territory to be used for attacks against other countries.While the TTP operates independently from Afghanistan’s Taliban, the two groups maintain close ties.Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have deteriorated since October, when border clashes followed explosions in Kabul on Oct. 9 that Afghan officials attributed to Pakistan. Although Qatar later helped mediate a ceasefire, talks hosted by Turkey in November failed to produce a lasting agreement.","KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025’ The broader national picture is even starker. 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126375028,imgsize-1338682,width-400,resizemode-4/photo-credit-ap.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: The polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target, leaving over 935,000 children under five unvaccinated, officials said, citing security challenges and population displacement as key hurdles, The Express Tribune reported.According to The Express Tribune, citing authorities, thousands of families from North and South Waziristan, Bajaur, and other merged districts have migrated to different parts of the country, complicating monitoring and vaccination efforts.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 19 polio cases in 2025, including four each in North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, and Tank; three in Bannu; two in Torghar; and one each in Dera Ismail Khan and Lower Kohistan, as reported by The Express Tribune.Officials noted that staffing and operational support for WHO and Unicef programmes in the merged districts were reduced last year, while WHO funding cuts also affected campaign coverage, leaving children in these areas at heightened risk.In Sindh, more than 12,000 children under five were reportedly missed during the final polio drive of 2025 in Hyderabad and surrounding areas, according to The Express Tribune.Refusals were recorded mainly in Cantonment areas and municipal towns such as Hussainabad, Preetabad, Qasimabad, and Tando Jam, with absent households and parental refusals cited as primary reasons.Despite these gaps, the nationwide anti-polio campaign successfully vaccinated more than 44.6 million children across Pakistan, according to The Express Tribune.Punjab led with 22.9 million children vaccinated, followed by Sindh with 10.6 million, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 7.15 million, and Balochistan with 2.58 million.Officials said contributions from other regions also added to the national tally.Authorities warned that without sustained vaccination efforts, particularly in displaced and high-risk populations, children in the merged districts remain vulnerable to polio, The Express Tribune reported.","Polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target.

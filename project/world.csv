In a post on social media platform X, Zelenskyy said that after discussions in Jeddah and a ceasefire proposal from the United States, Russia had ""stole almost another week – a week of war that only Russia wants.""He also alleged that the country will do everything to further intensify diplomacy and make it effective. “But every day now is about defending our independence, our state, and our people.""Then, reaffirming Ukraine’s commitment to its defence, he said, ""we must remember – it is the support of our army, all our defense and security forces, and our state that determines everything.”He also announced a restructuring of the country’s armed forces alongside commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi and defence minister Rustem Umerov, appointing Andrii Hnatov as the new chief of the general staff.The Ukrainian leader expressed gratitude to everyone who acknowledges the significance of Ukraine’s 'defence and resilience', including soldiers, civilians, and those organising fundraisers to support the country’s armed forces. ""We must remember – as long as the occupier is on our land, and as long as air raid sirens sound, we must defend Ukraine,"" he added.Zelenskyy’s remarks come amid growing tensions over the proposed ceasefire. Earlier, he criticised Russian President Vladimir Putin’s stance, calling it ""highly manipulative,"" alleging that Putin did not genuinely seek a ceasefire but is hesitant to admit this to US President Donald Trump.The US administration had urged Russia to agree to an unconditional ceasefire to which Putin responded by citing various concerns including fears that Ukraine could gain a military advantage.

Serbia: Public outrage on show in historic Belgrade protest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/serbia-public-outrage-on-show-in-historic-belgrade-protest/articleshow/119096597.cms,"(AP photo)

A broader fight against systemic corruption



Inside the Belgrade protest near Parliament



Panic while honoring Novi Sad victims



What comes next?



For two days, citizens poured into Belgrade for the largest protest in modern Serbian history. This occurred despite authorities' efforts to obstruct the demonstrations by halting public transportation.Thousands of students walked into the capital, spreading messages of solidarity through smaller towns along the way. The city's streets were packed, with people occupying several key locations.""I came for my child, for my son, so that his future can be better,"" a young man told DW.Police estimated a peak turnout of 107,000. Arhiv javnih skupova (Archive of Public Gatherings), an NGO which tracks mass gatherings, reported between 275,000 and 325,000 demonstrators — possibly more.The protest was initially organized by students, who have been blockading most state universities for over three months. Professors, teachers, health care workers, lawyers, IT professionals, war veterans, bikers and farmers supported the students' call — the farmers arriving on tractors.""We're here to support these brave young people, people who just want to live in a country where the rule of law works, nothing more,"" an elderly protester said.The students primarily demand accountability for the canopy collapse at the Novi Sad railway station in northern Serbia that killed 15 people in November.However, the broader public outrage over systemic corruption is directed toward the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and President Aleksandar Vucic . Protesters accuse Vucic of consolidating power and dismantling institutions.""This is a rare moment where the whole of Serbia is united under one cause. Even if the country doesn't change after this, we'll know that we stood up together and made our voices heard,"" a young man said at the protest in Belgrade.""Since this started, something has already shifted: a change in collective awareness. It's not enough, but it's a fantastic start,"" added a young woman.Despite fears of violence and predictions of storming public buildings, most incidents were isolated. Serbian media reported 22 arrests and 56 injuries. The Interior Ministry acknowledged multiple brawls and attacks on police officers, attributing them to protesters attempting to provoke disorder.The most intense standoff occurred between the Serbian Parliament building and the Novi Dvor, the president's office. Pro-government counterprotesters, calling themselves ""Students 2.0"" or ""Students who want to study,"" had set up a camp guarded by tractors and police cordons. Rumors circulated that hooligans and former members of the disbanded Special Operations Unit (JSO), whose commanders were convicted of war crimes, were stationed within the camp, raising fears of provocations.Student organizers relocated the main protest location to avoid clashes, but a group remained near the counterprotest camp. Tensions simmered throughout the day, with firecrackers, flares and loud bangs echoing, and both sides threw bottles and stones.At one point, a group of protesters tried to dismantle the barricades around the Parliament building but were pushed back by police. Student marshals, wearing yellow vests, symbolically raised them in the air to indicate they no longer ensured the crowd's safety, urging people to leave.The most alarming moment occurred during a 15-minute silence to honor the victims of the station collapse. A loud, unexpected noise described by witnesses as resembling a projectile or crashing aircraft, caused panic and triggered a brief stampede. Videos on social media captured the crowd scattering in fear.Dušan Simin, who was among the crowd, told DW that it ""sounded like a plane was landing from the direction of the Presidency building.""""We couldn't run away from it — we didn’t know what to do. You don’t know if something will fall on your head or hit you from the side,"" Simin said.""People must have instinctively thought something was coming down the street, so they started running to the side, and we fell over each other. My wife hit her head on a lamppost. I watched her, but I couldn’t help. We still feel uneasy.""He added that they planned to seek medical attention and that the incident has already been reported to the Belgrade Center for Human Rights, which has called on citizens to reach out if they need free legal assistance.""We will seek justice because what they did is not normal,"" Simin said.Balkan news broadcaster N1 quoted military analyst Aleksandar Radic , who suggested an acoustic weapon, specifically a ""sonic cannon"" reportedly available to Serbian security forces, caused the sound. An opposition lawmaker echoed this claim, but police swiftly denied deploying any such device.Political analyst Dusan Spasojevic described the protest as the largest since Serbia transitioned to parliamentary democracy. However, he noted a lack of political strategy, leaving the movement vulnerable to misdirection.""It's clear students aren't sure how to intensify the protest from here. There were no clear announcements about what's next. Meanwhile, some protesters stayed on the streets, wanting more, but without knowing what or how to achieve it,"" Spasojevic told DW.President Vucic expressed satisfaction with the protests in a press conference after the demonstrations and praised the security forces for preserving ""peace and stability.""""All people in power must understand the message when such a large number of people gather. We will have to change ourselves, and we will have to learn a lot,"" he stated.""On the other hand, I hope that some others have clearly understood the message from the majority of Serbia: that the citizens of Serbia do not want color revolutions, that the citizens of Serbia do not want violence, and that the citizens of Serbia want to change their government through elections.""Spasojevic said that the president's satisfaction with the protests is expected because he has had enough incidents to discuss, but just enough that his power remains unaffected.As of now, students have not announced further actions, nor the operationalization of the general strike that was part of the protest plan revealed to the public before the protests. The only certainty is that the movement isn’t retreating. Protesters are left to find new ways to maintain pressure.If it turns out that the authorities did indeed use a sound cannon against the citizens, Spasojevic said this could serve as an additional catalyst for the protests.""That's the kind of unnecessary overreach that fuels protests. Some people left disappointed, but they also left angrier than before, furious that illegal force might have been used against them. That could backfire on the authorities.""","Thousands of citizens poured into Belgrade for the largest protest in modern Serbian history.

At least 37 people have been killed following numerous tornadoes, severe winds, and dust storms that swept across the United States during the weekend, causing extensive destruction to homes and buildings across multiple states.Fatalities were recorded across Kansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas, Alabama, and Missouri. In Missouri, twelve people died, including three on Friday night when an EF-3 tornado with maximum winds of 140 mph struck Bakersfield, as confirmed by the National Weather Service on Saturday. This state has reported the maximum casualties.In Kansas, a motorway incident involving over 70 vehicles resulted in at least eight deaths, according to state patrol reports. Meanwhile, Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves confirmed six deaths across three counties and at least 27 injuries statewide. All previously missing persons have been located alive. Approximately 217 people remain displaced, with 23 counties reporting damage. Initial estimates indicate 12 tornadoes struck the state between Friday and Saturday night, as per the latest reports.Additionally, Arkansas reported three deaths and 32 injuries across eight counties, with a confirmed EF-3 tornado in Cave City reaching 165 mph winds. Additional fatalities included three in Alabama, three in Amarillo, Texas due to dust storm-related crashes, and two in Oklahoma resulting from wildfires and weather-related incidents.The risk of severe weather continues through Sunday (local time) from Florida up to the upper Ohio River Valley, as warned by the Storm Prediction Center. Over 60 million Americans face weather-related risks on Sunday.A tornado watch remains active in north-central Florida until 5 pm (local time), whilst parts of northeastern West Virginia, northwestern Virginia, and central Pennsylvania are under watch until 7 pm, with western New York facing heightened severe weather risks.Since Friday, the Storm Prediction Center has documented 75 preliminary tornado reports across seven states. The weather service continues its work to verify the total number of tornadoes.Across the nation, power disruptions affected over 337,000 customers by Sunday afternoon, with Missouri reporting nearly 41,000 outages, according to USA Today's tracking system.Weather service offices throughout the central and eastern United States deployed field teams on Sunday to assess tornado damage.President Donald Trump issued a statement on Sunday, indicating his office's monitoring of the situation and the deployment of National Guard to Arkansas.""My administration is ready to assist state and local officials, as they help their communities to try and recover from the damage,"" Trump added. ""Please join Melania and me in praying for everyone impacted by these terrible storms!""Various weather service offices conducted surveys: Columbia, South Carolina examined Lake Murray's north side; St. Louis confirmed an EF-1 tornado from Elmont to Union; Tennessee verified an EF-1 with 95 mph winds in Christiana; and New Orleans deployed two assessment teams.During the storms, Birmingham weather service staff sought refuge in their ""safe room"" when a tornado-warned system approached their facility.","Tornadoes, severe winds, and dust storms swept across the United States during the weekend, causing extensive destruction to homes and buildings.

Issuing a stark warning to the middle eastern country, Trump demanded that its backing of the rebels “must end immediately.” The strikes resulted in 31 deaths, according to a Houthi health official.Speaking on Sunday, Revolutionary Guards chief Hossein Salami rejected Trump’s warnings, stating in a televised speech: “Iran will not wage war, but if anyone threatens, it will give appropriate, decisive and conclusive responses.” He described the Houthis as “the representative of the Yemenis” and insisted that they made their ""strategic and operational decisions"" independently.This latest escalation comes against the long-standing tensions between the two nations. During Trump’s first term, in January 2020, the US killed Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Guards’ foreign operations unit, in a drone strike in Baghdad. Iran responded by launching missile attacks on bases in Iraq housing American and coalition troops. While no US personnel were killed, Washington reported that dozens suffered traumatic brain injuries.Earlier on Sunday, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei condemned the US air strikes, calling them a “brutal” act and a “gross violation of the principles of the UN Charter.”Iran’s top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, also took aim at Washington, saying it had ""no authority"" over Iran’s foreign policy.“The United States Government has no authority, or business, dictating Iranian foreign policy,"" Araghchi wrote on X, urging the US to “stop the killing of Yemeni people.” He added that the era of Washington influencing Tehran’s decisions ended with the 1979 Islamic Revolution.The Houthis, who have controlled large parts of Yemen for more than a decade, are part of the so-called “axis of resistance,” an alliance of pro-Iran factions that strongly oppose both Israel and the United States. The group has carried out attacks on Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war, citing solidarity with Palestinians.Saturday’s US air strikes marked the first American military action against the Houthis since Trump’s return to the White House in January.","Iran's Revolutionary Guards have warned of a ""decisive"" response to any attack following US President Donald Trump's air strikes against Yemen's Houthi rebels.

The Two stranded astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are set to return to Earth on Tuesday evening a day earlier than the previously reported schedule, said Nasa citing ""favourable conditions"".""Nasa and SpaceX met on Sunday to assess weather and splashdown conditions off Florida’s coast for the return of the agency’s Crew-9 mission from the International Space Station. Mission managers are targeting an earlier Crew-9 return opportunity based on favorable conditions forecasted for the evening of Tuesday, March 18,"" said the space agency in an official statement.A SpaceX Crew Dragon craft, which reached the ISS on Sunday, will transport the two astronauts stuck in space for over nine months along with another American astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut back home.Williams and Wilmore have remained on the ISS since June after their Boeing Starliner spacecraft encountered propulsion problems during its first crewed test flight, making it unsuitable for their return journey.On Sunday evening, Nasa announced the revised timing for the astronauts' ocean splashdown near Florida's coast to approximately 5.57 pm Tuesday (2157 GMT), preponed from the initial Wednesday schedule. ""The updated return target continues to allow the space station crew members time to complete handover duties while providing operational flexibility ahead of less favorable weather conditions expected for later in the week,"" added Nasa to its statement while announcing that they will show the return of the Crew-9 live and shared the updated schedule on its website.The Dragon capsule will also carry Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. The return journey's live broadcast will begin on Monday evening with hatch closure preparations.For Wilmore and Williams, this concludes an unexpected nine-month stay, originally planned as a brief roundtrip mission. They first arrived at the ISS in June 2024 using Boeing's Starliner vessel, with plans for a seven-day mission. However, technical difficulties with the Starliner, including problems with its propulsion system and helium leakages, compelled Nasa to send the spacecraft back to Earth without crew in September. As a result, the astronauts' duration of stay at the station became uncertainTheir extended stay exceeded the typical ISS rotation period of about six months. The unplanned extension of their mission, which required additional supplies of clothing and personal items, has drawn public attention and sympathy for their unplanned separation from family.",Nasa and SpaceX met on Sunday to assess weather and splashdown conditions for the return of the agency’s Crew-9 mission from the International Space Station.

Tornadoes tore through parts of the US, leaving a trail of destruction as powerful storms moved east into the Mississippi Valley and Deep South on Saturday. At least 17 people have died, with Missouri experiencing the highest toll, as officials confirmed 11 fatalities from overnight twisters.The Missouri State Highway Patrol confirmed multiple injuries alongside the fatalities. ""It was unrecognisable as a home. Just a debris field,"" said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers when they arrived, according to the Associated Press.""The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls,"" he added.According to Akers, rescuers successfully saved a woman from the residence. Officials in Arkansas reported three death in Independence County and 29 injuries across eight counties following overnight storms.""We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist,"" Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a post on X. Both Sanders and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared states of emergency.The severe weather system brought destructive winds to the Mississippi Valley and Deep South on Saturday. The Missouri State Highway Patrol reported two adult deaths in Bakersfield, Ozark County, with multiple injuries.Coroner Jim Akers reported one death early Saturday after a tornado destroyed a home approximately 177 kilometres east of Bakersfield. These casualties occurred as a substantial weather system crossed the country, generating winds that caused fatal dust storms and intensified over 100 wildfires.Severe weather conditions, including hurricane-force winds, were expected to affect regions inhabited by more than 100 million people. Forecasts predicted winds reaching 130 kph from Canada to Texas, bringing blizzard conditions to northern regions and increased wildfire risks to southern areas.Three people lost their lives on Friday in vehicular accidents during an Amarillo County dust storm in Texas, according to Sgt Cindy Barkley. One incident involved approximately 38 vehicles.""It's the worst I've ever seen,"" Barkley said, describing the near-zero visibility as a nightmare. ""We couldn't tell that they were all together until the dust kind of settled,"" he added.Cave City, Arkansas reported five injuries, prompting Mayor Jonas Anderson to declare a state of emergency early Saturday. ""Electricity infrastructure has been decimated and will remain off for an unknown period of time,"" he said.Oklahoma authorities ordered evacuations in certain areas as over 130 fires were reported statewide. The State Patrol noted winds strong enough to overturn several lorries, the Associated Press reported.Weather specialists noted that March typically experiences such extreme conditions. ""What's unique about this one is its large size and intensity,"" said Bill Bunting of the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Centre in Norman, Oklahoma.""And so what that is doing is producing really substantial impacts over a very large area,"" he added.The Storm Prediction Centre issued warnings about rapidly moving storms capable of producing tornadoes and large hailstones comparable to baseballs. The primary concern centred on straight-line winds, potentially reaching hurricane strength with speeds up to 160 kph.High-risk alerts were issued for Mississippi regions, including Jackson and Hattiesburg, alongside Alabama areas encompassing Birmingham and Tuscaloosa. The severe weather system threatened eastern Louisiana, western Georgia, central Tennessee and the western Florida Panhandle with potential storms and tornadoes.Multiple wildfires emerged across the Southern Plains amidst dry conditions and powerful winds. Authorities ordered evacuations in various communities across Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico.In Roberts County, Texas, northeast of Amarillo, a fire expanded dramatically from 2 square kilometres to approximately 85 square kilometres, according to the Texas A&M University Forest Service on X.Emergency crews contained its progression by evening. Another fire, situated 90 kilometres southward, spread to 10 square kilometres before containment.Strong winds disrupted power supply to over 2,60,000 homes and businesses across Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana, as reported by poweroutage.us.The National Weather Service announced blizzard warnings for specific areas in western Minnesota and eastern South Dakota, effective early Saturday. Expected snowfall ranged between 7.6 to 15.2 centimetres, with possibilities of reaching 30 centimetres.Forecasts indicated wind speeds reaching 97 kph, likely to create whiteout conditions.","At least 17 people have died, with Missouri experiencing the highest toll, as officials confirmed 11 fatalities from overnight twisters.

The administration plans to move around 300 alleged gang members to detention facilities in El Salvador, raising human rights concerns. Broader immigration crackdown: This move signals Trump’s intent to aggressively pursue stricter immigration policies, potentially setting the stage for broader crackdowns in a second term.

President Donald Trump on Saturday, invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, claiming the US was facing an invasion by a Venezuelan gang. The law, originally meant for wartime, gives the president broad powers, allowing him to speed up mass deportations of undocumented immigrants—potentially escalating his immigration crackdown.The declaration specifically addresses Tren de Aragua , which Trump alleges is operating as a hostile entity under Venezuelan government direction.""Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA,"" Trump's statement read, the Associated Press reported.""The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States,"" it added.This came the same day, a federal judge in Washington prohibited the administration from deporting five Venezuelans under the anticipated order, indicating potential legal challenges ahead.The federal judge's intervention to prevent the deportation of five Venezuelans using the Alien Enemies Act sparked immediate legal confrontations, even before the president's formal announcement.Trump had previously indicated his intention to utilise the 1798 Act, which was last implemented during World War 2 to authorise Japanese-American civilian internment.The American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward submitted an urgent lawsuit in Washington's federal court. They argued that the order would classify Tren de Aragua as a ""predatory incursion"" by a foreign government, potentially leading to indiscriminate deportation of Venezuelans.DC Circuit Chief Judge James E Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order, valid for 14 days, to protect five Venezuelans in immigration custody who were believed to face imminent deportation under the act.Boasberg implemented the order to maintain current circumstances and scheduled a subsequent hearing to consider extending protection to all Venezuelans in the United States.The Trump administration subsequently challenged the initial restraining order, arguing that preventing presidential action before its announcement would severely restrict executive branch operations.The Justice Department's appeal warned that allowing such orders could enable district courts to obstruct crucial national security actions upon receiving complaints. They suggested this could affect operations like drone strikes, intelligence activities, or terrorist apprehensions, urging the court to prevent such precedent.The Alien Enemies Act, part of the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, is a law designed for use during wartime or when the US faces an imminent threat of invasion by a foreign nation.The act grants the President the authority to detain or deport foreign nationals from enemy countries during periods of conflict, particularly targeting recent immigrants who could be perceived as aligning with US adversaries.According to CNN, legal experts argue that invoking the act outside of wartime—such as citing threats from gangs or cartels—would be legally challenging unless the US is under direct attack by a foreign government.The Alien Enemies Act has been invoked three times in US history, each during wartime, as noted by the Brennan Center. During World War I and World War II, it was used to detain and deport German, Austro-Hungarian, Italian, and Japanese immigrants.The act also played a role in the forced internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, a controversial chapter in US history.","The President can detain or deport any male over the age of 14 from an enemy nation if deemed a potential threat. The act allows Trump to bypass certain immigration and criminal law protections. Civil rights groups, including the ACLU, have already filed lawsuits, arguing that the move violates due process and legal rights.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119057394,imgsize-798201,width-400,resizemode-4/119057394.jpg"

US govt deports migrants even as a federal judge orders removals be stopped,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-govt-deports-migrants-even-as-a-federal-judge-orders-removals-be-stopped/articleshow/119095222.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington: In an escalating executive vs judiciary battle that began at 2am EST Saturday, a federal judge directed US govt to turn around flights carrying illegal immigrants that were already in the air after President Donald Trump invoked a 1798 law to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members.Judge James Boasberg, chief judge in the nation’s capital, blocked Trump officials from deporting five Venezuelans — later expanding it to all deportees — under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act proclamation that the US president invoked on Friday, saying they could face persecution and worse in their home country. The judge said he heard that “flights are actively departing” and ordered officials to turn around those already airborne. AP said Boasberg verbally ordered the planes be turned around, but they apparently were not and he did not include the directive in his written order. Officials too said deportations took place despite the judge’s ruling. Secretary of state Marco Rubio wrote on X that the US “sent 2 dangerous top MS-13 leaders plus 21 of its most wanted back to face justice in El Salvador.” “Also, as promised by @POTUS, we sent over 250 alien enemy members of Tren de Aragua, which El Salvador has agreed to hold in their very good jails at a fair price that will also save our taxpayer dollars.” El Salvador confirmed the arrival.In an extraordinary outburst echoing the charges against a self-deporting Indian scholar Ranjani Srinivasan, who was described as a terrorist sympathiser, a Trump administration official then accused the judge of supporting terrorists. “Tonight, a DC trial judge supported Tren de Aragua terrorists over the safety of Americans.... This order disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump’s power, and it puts the public and law enforcement at risk,” attorney general Pam Btondi said.The Act deployed by Trump has been used only three times before to bar citizens of hostile enemy govts to US — the last time during WWII when Washington incarcerated more than 100,000 US citizens of Japanese and Italian origin. The White House in fact invoked the Act on Friday to get around legal hurdles and surreptitiously fly out deportees but activists thwarted the move by moving court late night.The administration said it will appeal the ruling, among several relating to immigration and a raft of other issues that have gone against it, leading to frustration on part of the president and his associates about “activist judges” who they say need to be impeached for thwarting executive decisions. “We must impeach judges who are grossly undermining the will of the people and destroying America. It is the only way,” said tech honco and a close Trump aide Elon Musk.","Judge James Boasberg, chief judge in the nation’s capital, blocked Trump officials from deporting five Venezuelans.

US border officials target senior green card holders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-border-officials-target-senior-green-card-holders/articleshow/119094296.cms,"Immigration attorneys warn against surrendering green cards



Immigration attorneys are seeing an uptick in the number of green card holders (including Indians) being subjected to secondary inspection, including overnight detention at the port of entry (airports) by US Custom and Border Protection (CBP) officers, reports Lubna Kably. Some are also ‘pressured’ to voluntarily give up their green card. Elderly Indians who live with their children in the US but spend the winter months in India are especially susceptible.An important piece of advice from attorneys: Do not surrender your green card. A green card holder has the right to be heard by an immigration judge.Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), a lawful permanent resident (LPR) — aka green card holder — who is absent from the US for over 180 days is treated as seeking ‘re-admission’ and is subject to grounds of inadmissibility. While the issue of abandonment (relinquishment) of green card status typically arises when the individual has been outside the US for more than a year (365 days), a stay in India during the winter season is also coming up for increased scrutiny.Ashwin Sharma, an immigration attorney, based in Florida told TOI, “I have personally handled cases recently where the CBP has targeted elderly Indian green card holders , particularly grandparents who happen to have spent a bit longer outside the US, and pressured them to sign Form I-407 to ‘voluntarily’ surrender their lawful permanent resident status (green card). And the moment they have tried to push back, they have been met with threats of detention or ‘removal’ by the CBP officers who have been emboldened by Trump to see themselves as judge, jury, and executioner.”Kripa Upadhyay, a Seattle-based immigration attorney, stressed the importance of not surrendering the green card. “Generally, an individual’s green card cannot be revoked by the border unless the person ‘voluntarily’ surrenders (by signing Form 1-407). If a green card holder has spent more than 365 days out of the US they are deemed to have ‘abandoned’ their residence. Even if this is the allegation, the green card holder has the right to challenge this in court but they lose this right if they ‘voluntarily’ surrender at the airport!”“Only an immigration judge can take away a green card, so individuals should not sign this form. Unfortunately, people do not realise this because they are afraid, confused or do not understand what they are signing due to language barriers. This is a particular problem for our elderly green card holders who spend winter months in India and may not have sufficient evidence to prove maintenance of permanent resident status. Through documentation such as ownership of property, tax returns and employment one can overcome a presumption of abandonment,” said Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group.She referred to a case where an individual was placed in secondary inspection, because ever since becoming a lawful permanent resident (more than six years ago), he has spent a lot of time in India. Though he never spent more than six months (180 days) outside the US, it was clear from his travel history that he returned to the US only to maintain his green card status. “He was lucky this time and was admitted into the country but warned by CBP to give up his green card if he was not living in the US on a permanent basis,” said Batra.Rajiv S Khanna, an Arlington-based immigration attorney, sounded a word of caution, “One of the common scenarios that I have provided consultations on is when green card holders are not living in the US. They may visit every few months and consider that to be sufficient. That is legally incorrect. Maintaining a green card requires establishing and maintaining a permanent home in the US. Anything short of that can be grounds for ‘lifting the green card’ for abandonment.” To this, Jesse Bless, immigration attorney added, “Lawful permanent residents who are outside the US for more than a year (without a re-entry permit) are getting a notice to appear in removal proceedings.”Greg Siskin, co-founder of Siskin Susser, an immigration law firm, recalled, “During the previous Trump administration, there were sky marshals who were passing forms out on planes asking people to surrender their green cards and people were calling and texting from the planes asking what to do. People need to not surrender their cards. But they must be prepared to sit for a while in secondary inspection. It is possible a CBP officer could even detain a person overnight. But a person is entitled to a hearing in front of a judge and most judges are not going to be happy about these cases going in front of them so I suspect CBP will cave in if a person is adamant about not surrendering.”",Immigration attorneys are seeing an uptick in the number of green card holders being subjected to secondary inspection.

NEW DELHI: Expressing admiration for Donald Trump’s courage and resilience, PM Narendra Modi said his connect with the US president was that they both put nation first and had dedicated themselves to the service of the nation.“Even after being shot (July 2024), he remained unwaveringly dedicated to America. His life was for his nation. Trump’s will to live and fight for the US even after being shot appeals to me because this showed his America First spirit, just as I believe in Nation First. I stand for India First and that’s why I connect so well (with Trump),” the PM said.Modi’s emphatic endorsement of Trump in a podcast with Lex Fridman, popular podcaster and research scientist at MIT, comes at a time US allies, particularly Europe and Canada, are taking a heavy battering from the president who has been accused by some of dragging America into isolationism with his policies.India itself has been under threat from Trump’s tariff war but is hoping for an exemption from the Apr 2 deadline for reciprocal tariffs, based on a trade deal it’s negotiating.Trump was far more prepared in his second term, with a clear roadmap and steps to achieve his goals, the PM said, adding that he had put together a “strong, capable” team to assist him.In the podcast, Modi backed the recent thaw in ties with China said said normalcy had returned to the border since his meeting with President Xi Jinping last year, and that trust, enthusiasm and energy would return in bilateral ties “slowly but surely”. He said efforts were on to restore conditions to how they were before 2020.On Pakistan, while describing it as the epicentre of terrorism, Modi said all Indian attempts for a reconciliation had met with hostility and expressed hope Pakistan will choose the right path as its people deserved a future free of violence.On the Russia-Ukraine war, Modi strongly reiterated India’s position that both countries need to return to the negotiating table.“I can tell President Putin this is not the era of war. I can also tell President Zelensky that regardless of how many people stand with you, there will never be a resolution on the battlefield. Ukraine may hold countless discussions with its allies, but it will bear no fruit. Discussions must include both sides,” he said, adding the current situation provided an opportunity for meaningful talks between Russia and Ukraine. “I am not neutral. I strive for peace,” he said, underlining India’s position and expressing concern about how the war has hurt the Global South.Asked about his relations with Trump, Modi appreciat ed the “trust” that the president has in him. “Even after being shot, he remained unwaveringly dedicated to America. His life was for his nation. Trump’s will to live and fight for the US even after being shot appeals to me because this showed his America First spirit, just as I believe in Nation First. I stand for India First and that’s why I connect so well (with Trump),” the PM said.Asked what he liked about Trump, Modi recalled that the US president, during his first term, had ignored security protocol and agreed to his request to take a lap around the stadium hosting the ‘Howdy Modi’ event in Houston. “I was touched by his courage and his trust in me,” he said.On Trump describing him as a tough negotiator, Modi said he always puts India’s interests first. “That’s why in every forum, I speak up for India’s interest, not to harm anyone but in a positive manner and because of that, no one takes offence,” he said.On China, Modi said differences between the two countries were natural but “our focus is on ensuring these don’t turn into disputes”. “Instead of discord, we emphasise dialogue for building cooperative relationship. After my meeting with President Xi, we are seeing a return of normalcy to the border. We are now working to restore conditions to how they were before 2020. Slowly but surely, trust, enthusiasm and energy will return,” he said.“Of course, it will take some time because of the five-year gap. Our cooperation is essential also for global stability and prosperity. Since the 21st century will be Asia’s century, we want India and China to compete in a healthy way. Competition is not a bad thing but it should never turn into a conflict,” he added.","“Even after being shot (July 2024), he remained unwaveringly dedicated to America. His life was for his nation.

Trump envoy on his meeting with Putin

This Week

President Donald Trump may speak to Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week, White House special envoy Steve Witkoff said on Sunday, as the US pushes for a quick ceasefire to end the war in Ukraine.“I expect that there’ll be a call with both presidents this week,” Witkoff said on CNN’s. “And we’re also continuing to engage and have conversation with the Ukrainians.”Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow last week for talks. But the Russian leader balked at a US appeal for an immediate ceasefire, saying instead that issues still need to be resolved. Ukraine agreed to the terms of the truce deal in a meeting earlier in the week with US officials in Saudi Arabia.Still, Witkoff said his conversation with Putin “was positive, it was a solution-based discussion.” He added that he believes Putin “accepts the philosophy of President Trump,” and that both leaders want the war to end.Trump “really expects there to be some sort of deal in the coming weeks and I believe that’s the case,” Witkoff said.US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told ABC’sthat while Putin “will absolutely consider a ceasefire, there are some other things that he would like to see that President Trump’s national security team is considering over the coming days.”“This is going to be some type of territory for future security guarantees, the future status of Ukraine,” he said. “We know the components. There is a deal that will be had here.”Ukraine has sought assurances that the US and other allies will protect it in the event of a future Russian attack, but the White House has been reluctant to commit to that.Trump’s push for a ceasefire has been controversial, sparking anger in Kyiv and across Europe that the US may be trying to force Ukraine to capitulate to the Russians. The US president has pressured the Ukrainians with a pause in arms shipments and intelligence sharing.Trump, who called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy a “dictator,” has said the Ukrainians are more difficult to deal with than the Russians. And senior US officials have said it’s necessary to talk to both sides in order to bring peace to the battlefield after three years of war.On Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin had asked Witkoff to convey messages to Trump ahead of a possible phone call and added there was “cautious optimism” about the prospect of a ceasefire deal, according to the Interfax news agency.","President Donald Trump may speak to Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week.

President Donald Trump's administration on Saturday began making deep cuts to Voice of America and other government-run, pro-democracy programming, with the organisation's director saying all VOA employees have been put on leave. On Friday night, shortly after Congress passed its latest funding bill, Trump directed his administration to reduce the functions of several agencies to the minimum required by law.That included the US Agency for Global Media , which houses Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Asia and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba.On Saturday morning, Kari Lake , the failed Arizona gubernatorial and US Senate candidate whom Trump named a senior adviser to the agency, posted on X that employees should check their email. That coincided with notices going out placing Voice of America staff on paid administrative leave.""For the first time in 83 years, the storied Voice of America is being silenced,"" Michael Abramowitz, the organisation's director, said in a statement. He added that ""virtually"" the entire 1300-person staff was placed on leave.""VOA promotes freedom and democracy around the world by telling America's story and by providing objective and balanced news and information, especially for those living under tyranny,"" Abramowitz said.One reporter, who spoke under the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the press, said: ""We expected something like this to happen, and it just happened to be today.""The press advocacy group Reporters Without Borders said it ""condemns this decision as a departure from the US's historic role as a defender of free information and calls on the US government to restore VOA and urges Congress and the international community to take action against this unprecedented move"".The Agency for Global Media also sent notices terminating grants to Radio Free Asia and other programming run by the agency. Voice of America transmits United States domestic news into other countries, often translated into local languages. Radio Free Asia, Europe and Marti beam news into countries with authoritarian regimes in those regions like China, North Korea and Russia.""The cancellation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's grant agreement would be a massive gift to America's enemies,"" said the network's President and CEO, Stephen Capus, in a statement.Combined, the networks reach an estimated 427 million people. They date back to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organisations trying to extend US influence and combat authoritarianism that includes USAID, another agency targeted by Trump.The reduction is a dramatic blow at a staple of post-Cold War order that has long had bipartisan support. Voice of America's directors have included Dick Carlson, the father of conservative commentator Tucker Carlson.Thomas Kent, former president and CEO of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, said that Trump's intentions for the agencies are still foggy. Without these news sources, it will be that much harder for the country to get its messages to the world, he said.""Without the international broadcasting , the image of the United States and the Trump administration will be in the hands of others, including the administration's opponents, (and) countries and people who consider the United States an enemy,"" said Kent, an international consultant on media ethics.A video posted on X by Lake on Saturday talked about cost-cutting measures, not mentioning the employees and the mission of Voice of America.

She said she would try to break the agency's 15-year lease on the building.""We're doing everything we can to cancel contracts that can be cancelled, save more, downsize and make sure there's no misuse of your dollars,"" she said.The letter places employees on administrative leave and says staff would continue to receive pay and benefits ""until otherwise notified"".It ordered employees not to use Agency for Global Media facilities and return equipment like phones and computers.The Trump administration has already made other steps to assert its authority over Voice of America, and this week cancelled contracts that allowed VOA to use material from independent news organisations, such as The Associated Press.The administration has also banned the AP from press pools that cover the president and moved to take charge of what news organisations are members of the pools, and the FCC is investigating news organisations like CBS.Trump's order requiring reductions also includes several other, lesser-known government agencies such as the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars, a nonpartisan think tank, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness and the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.","Voice of America's parent, the US Agency for Global media is an organisation with a budget of around $270 million and more than 2,000 employees.

Qatal was brain behind Jan ’23 Rajouri attack that killed 7



Abu Qatal enjoyed heavy security cover comprising Pak army



NEW DELHI: Top Lashkar-e-Taiba commander Abu Qatal aka Qatal Sindhi, was gunned down by unidentified assailants in Pakistan’s Jhelum Sindh on Saturday night. One of the closest confidantes of LeT founder Hafiz Saeed , Qatal was the chief operational commander of the terror outfit, notorious for masterminding multiple attacks in J&K.Qatal was wanted by Indian law enforcement after his role in last year’s attack on a pilgrims’ bus returning from a temple in Reasi surfaced.Top Lashkar-e-Taiba commander Abu Qatal aka Qatal Sindhi enjoyed heavy security cover comprising the Pakistan army and operatives of LeT.On Saturday, Qatal and Saeed were returning after meeting the Mangla Corps commander of Pakistan army when the gunmen struck. “They were ambushed near Zeenat Hotel, close to Dina Punjab University in the Jhelum area around 7 pm. Saeed’s vehicle narrowly escaped the attack. The assailants opened fire, killing Qatal and one of his henchman on the spot, while another guard was critically injured and succumbed to injuries later,” a source said.Pakistan’s law enforcement termed the deaths a “targeted killing”. Sources said the killing was the result of infighting in Lashkar ranks. The shooting ends the pause in mysterious killings of terrorists in Pakistan who were high on India’s ‘persons of interest’ list.Qatal was born Zia-ur-Rehman but rode high on the notoriety chart as Qatal Sindhi, the operational ID assigned to him because of his involvement in terror activities dating back to 2002 03. Of late, the notorious terrorist was operating through proxy outfits like People’s Anti-Fascist Force (PAFF) and The Resistant Force (TRF) — the choice of nomenclature a shrewd camouflage for the jihadi outfit and aimed at currying favour with international human rights groups.National Investigation Agency (NIA) has also implicated Qatal, along with four other Lashkar operatives, in its chargesheet on the Rajouri terror attack case. On Jan 1, 2023, terrorists had launched a devastating assault on Dhangri village in Rajouri, killing seven people.“He, along with Saifullah Sajid Jutt, was the main handler of LeT terrorists operating in Poonch-Rajouri region. Qatal was also in charge of Khuiratta camp of LeT, located in Kotli district of Pakistan-occupied J&K,” an official said.As the main link between LeT cadres and operators in PoJK and Sindh province, Qatal played a crucial role in coordinating terror activities. He was also the most trusted handler of Saeed, who often relied on Qatal to maintain control over LeT detachments in PoJK, the source said.Qatal’s associates, Riyaz Ahmed and Hanzla Adnan, were killed in separate incidents in Pakistan in Sept and Dec 2023 respectively.Qatal had infiltrated the Jammu region in the early 2000s and had established a wide network of overground workers in Poonch and Rajouri through his old contacts. His role in various terror incidents was clearly established in investigations conducted by NIA.Saeed’s aide was also the mastermind of the Reasi bus attack on June 9, 2024, which killed nine pilgrims and injured 41. The bus, travelling from Shiv Khori temple to Katra, was ambushed with a barrage of gunfire, causing it to veer off the road and plummet into a deep gorge near Teryath village in Reasi’s Pouni area. This brazen attack was orchestrated under the leadership of Qatal.He was also involved in Bhatta-Durian terror incident, which resulted in the killing of five Army personnel, and the Kandi attack on officers and personnel of 9-Para Special Forces. His killing is significant, given his role in planning and executing terror attacks. Though it may disrupt Lashkar’s operations, the group is adept at adapting and has often overcome setbacks.He enjoyed heavy security cover comprising the Pakistan army and operatives of LeT. On Saturday evening, Qatal and Saeed were returning after meeting the Mangla Corps commander of Pakistan army when the gunmen struck. “They were ambushed near Zeenat Hotel, close to Dina Punjab University in the Jhelum area around 7pm. Saeed’s vehicle narrowly escaped the attack.

At least two Pakistsoldiers and nine terrorists were killed after the Pak security forces raided two hideouts used by an armed group in the restive northwest, triggering gun battles, Al Jazeera reported.The raids were conducted on Saturday in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Mohmand and Dera Ismail Khan districts, which border Afghanistan.According to local police, the fighters belonged to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban.Notably, TTP -- banned in Pakistan -- is a separate group but an ally of the Afghan Taliban, who reseized power in neighbouring Afghanistan in August 2021 as the United States and other NATO troops were in the final stages of a withdrawal from the country after 20 years of war.Many TTP leaders and fighters have found sanctuaries and have even been living openly in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, which also emboldened the Pakistani Taliban, according to Al Jazeera.In a separate incident on Saturday, fighters ambushed security forces in northwestern Pakistan's Kurram district, bordering Afghanistan, the report said, citing local police. Authorities have yet to confirm any casualties in that attack.Pakistan's military is engaged in an ongoing operation in Kurram, an area that has witnessed years of violence between Sunni and Shia Muslim communities, as reported by Al Jazeera. Hundreds of people have been killed in fighting between armed groups, exacerbating tensions in the region.Kurram has remained isolated since last November, after authorities blocked key roads following sectarian violence. The closure has led to severe shortages of medicine and food, deepening a humanitarian crisis.In another incident, a bomb exploded outside a mosque in the northwestern city of Peshawar, killing a religious leader, local police said on Saturday. It was unclear who was behind the attack, and an investigation was being conducted.","Pakistani security forces raid two hideouts used by an armed group, triggering gun battles.

Back-to-back attacks on mosques

Balochistan train attack

A powerful blast at a seminary-cum-mosque in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province’s Peshawar district killed a senior cleric and injured three others on Saturday, marking another attack on religious institutions in the region within 24 hours.Mufti Munir Shakir , the founder of the outlawed militant group Lashkar-i-Islam , succumbed to his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), hospital authorities confirmed. The explosion took place in Urmur Bala village, prompting a swift response from police, the Counter-Terrorism department, and bomb disposal teams, who are now investigating the scene.Mohammad Asim, an LRH spokesman, confirmed the cleric's passing, stating, “Mufti Shakir was brought to LRH in a critical condition and succumbed to his injuries.”Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister’s Advisor on Health, Ihtesham Ali, expressed his condolences, calling Shakir’s death a ""martyrdom"" and mourning the loss.Mufti Munir Shakir was a controversial figure in Khyber tribal region, known for founding Lashkar-i-Islam in 2004. However, his extremist views and conflicts with another militant leader, Haji Namdar, led to his expulsion from Bara Qambarkhel within six months.After continued internal strife, a tribal jirga forced both Shakir and Pir Saifur Rehman out of Bara in early 2005. The group later came under the leadership of Mangal Bagh, a former bus driver turned militant, who was elevated to amir in May 2005.Pakistani security forces launched their first military operation against Lashkar-i-Islam in mid-2005, demolishing the house of Haji Rabat and destroying an FM radio station the group had set up inside a mosque.The blast comes less than a day after another explosion at Maulana Abdul Aziz Mosque in South Waziristan on Friday. The attack, carried out using an improvised explosive device (IED), left Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) district chief Maulana Abdullah Nadeem and several others injured.The province has witnessed repeated attacks on mosques, particularly during Friday prayers when large gatherings make them vulnerable.Last month, a suicide blast at Darul Uloom Haqqania seminary killed six people, including JUI-S leader Maulana Hamidul Haq Haqqani, and injured 15 others.The Pakistan Army on Friday said that 18 of the 26 hostages killed in the Balochistan Liberation Army's recent ambush on a train were army and paramilitary soldiers.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General, Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, stated during a press conference with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti that militants executed all 26 hostages before the military operation began.“The 26 hostages include 18 army and paramilitary soldiers, three other government officials and five civilians,” he confirmed.","Mufti Munir Shakir, the founder of the outlawed militant group Lashkar-i-Islam, succumbed to his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), hospital authorities confirmed.

Smooth landing, rough questions

Passengers aboard Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight PK-306 got an unexpected surprise when their aircraft landed in Lahore—with one of its rear wheels missing. Despite what sounds like a scene from an action movie, the landing was smooth, and no injuries were reported.The big mystery now: Did the wheel vanish midair or was it never there to begin with?PIA officials have launched an investigation to determine whether the aircraft took off from Karachi already missing a wheel or if it fell off during takeoff. Some wheel fragments were reportedly found at Karachi airport, raising eyebrows about the plane’s condition before departure.""It appears that one of the rear wheels was in shabby condition when the aircraft took off,"" an official admitted, reported PTI.PIA’s damage control mode kicked in quickly. A spokesperson assured that the landing was “smooth and uneventful,” and passengers disembarked as usual—only for the captain’s routine inspection to reveal the missing wheel .""Passengers disembarked as per routine. During a walk-around inspection by the aircraft captain, it was revealed that one out of the six-wheel assemblies on the main landing gear (rear) is missing,"" a PIA spokesperson said, quoted PTI.""As per the standard flight practices, the matter was taken up by PIA flight safety and the Lahore airport teams who are investigating the matter and will submit their report later,"" the spokesperson said.While officials claim the aircraft is designed to handle such contingencies, the biggest question remains—was the wheel stolen?

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres on Friday called for urgent international support for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, warning that cuts in humanitarian aid could lead to a disaster.Speaking at a joint press briefing in Dhaka during his four-day visit to Bangladesh, Guterres urged the international community to provide financial and political assistance to both the refugees and their host communities.""I strongly appeal to the international community to allow us to avoid any tragedy,"" he said. He also praised Bangladesh's “extraordinary generosity” in sheltering more than one million Rohingya refugees and described it as a testament to the country’s humanitarian spirit.Guterres visited Cox’s Bazar, where most of the Rohingya refugees live in overcrowded camps, and described the impact of global aid cuts on vulnerable populations as “a crime”, reported AP.He criticised the United States and European countries for slashing humanitarian assistance while increasing defence budgets.According to AP, the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) has warned that without urgent funding, food rations for Rohingya refugees could be cut by half next month. A recent WFP letter stated that $81 million is needed to sustain operations until the end of the year, including $15 million for April alone.Guterres assured that the UN will continue efforts to secure funding and stressed that Rohingya refugees must not be forgotten. ""We cannot accept that the international community forgets about the Rohingya,"" he said.Bangladesh’s Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus met with Guterres and urged the UN to mobilise humanitarian aid and support the repatriation of Rohingya refugees to Myanmar, which he described as the ultimate solution.""We are trying to raise attention to the plight of the Rohingya people. The world should know how they are suffering. There is a feeling of frustration,"" Yunus was quoted as saying by AP.Guterres emphasised that Myanmar remains the homeland of the Rohingya and called on all parties in Myanmar to ensure their safe and voluntary return. ""My message to all parties in Myanmar is clear: exercise maximum restraint, prioritise the protection of civilians, and create conditions for the Rohingya to return home,"" he said, as per PTI.Bangladesh has consistently maintained that repatriation is the only long-term solution, but efforts have stalled due to ongoing political instability in Myanmar. The Buddhist-majority nation has been accused of genocide against the Rohingya in an international court.As per ANI, Guterres reaffirmed the UN’s commitment to advocating for Rohingya rights and ensuring that they receive humanitarian assistance.He also attended a photo exhibition in Dhaka, interacted with youth and civil society members, and held a joint press conference with foreign adviser Touhid Hossain.His visit will conclude with an iftar hosted by the chief adviser before he departs from Dhaka on March 16.","United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres on Friday called for urgent international support for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.

Nepal King Gyanendra: Thousands rally in Kathmandu to welcome former king amid calls for return of monarchy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/thousands-rally-in-kathmandu-to-welcome-former-king-amid-calls-for-return-of-monarchy/articleshow/118821430.cms,"Thousands rally in Kathmandu to welcome former king amid calls for return of monarchy (Picture credit: PTI)

Nepal’s former King Gyanendra Shah was greeted with the chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday, amid growing calls for the reinstatement of the monarchy and Nepal’s status as a Hindu state.According to the news agency AFP, Shah’s supporters waved Nepal’s flag and chanted slogans like ""Come king, save the nation!"" as the 77-year-old former monarch stepped out of Tribhuvan International Airport following a tour of western Nepal.The crowd, which included members of the pro-monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party , carried placards reading ""We want our King back"" and ""Abolish federal republican system and reinstate the monarchy.""AP reported that an estimated 10,000 supporters gathered outside the airport, blocking its main entrance. Passengers were forced to walk to and from the airport due to the heavy crowd. Riot police were deployed to prevent demonstrators from entering the premises, but no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 240-year-old monarchy in 2008 after a decade-long civil war that left over 16,000 dead. However, dissatisfaction with political instability, corruption and economic struggles has fuelled a resurgence of support for the former royal family.“The country faces instability, prices are high, people are jobless, and there is a lack of education and healthcare facilities,” said Rajindra Kunwar, a teacher who joined the rally who was quoted by AFP. “The poor are dying of hunger. The law applies to the public, but not to politicians. That’s why we need the king back”, Kunwar added.Nepal has had 13 different governments since 2008, with growing frustration over governance issues. Some protesters, including those who previously supported the abolition of the monarchy, have now changed their stance. “I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken,” said Kulraj Shrestha, a carpenter. “The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind”, Shrestha added.Gyanendra, who has generally remained silent on political matters, has made several public appearances recently. On the eve of Nepal’s Democracy Day last month, he issued a statement saying, ""It is now time. If we wish to save our nation and maintain national unity, I call on all countrymen to support us for Nepal's prosperity and progress.""Despite the rising pro-monarchy sentiment, political analyst Lok Raj Baral told AFP that the monarchy's return is unlikely, stating that it was ""a source of instability."" He added, ""For some disgruntled groups, it has become a retreat due to the incompetence of politicians.""As per PTI, security was heightened in Kathmandu, with dozens of riot policemen deployed around Narayanhiti Palace Museum, the former royal residence. There were rumours that Gyanendra might attempt to enter the palace with his supporters but the former king proceeded to his private residence, Nirmal Niwas, without any incident.The movement for the monarchy’s restoration has been gaining traction since February, when Gyanendra’s Democracy Day statement reignited debate on Nepal’s future political system.Bollywood actress Manisha Koirala, who is the granddaughter of Nepal’s first elected Prime Minister BP Koirala, urged Nepalis on social media to gather at the airport to welcome the former monarch.","Nepal's former King Gyanendra Shah greeted with chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday.

Can Gyanendra return to power?

Chants of ""Long live our beloved king"" and ""Vacate the royal palace for the king"" echoed through the streets of Kathmandu on Sunday as thousands of supporters of Nepal's former king, Gyanendra Shah , gathered to demand the restoration of the monarchy and Hinduism as the state religion.An estimated 10,000 royalists blocked the main entrance to Tribhuvan International Airport as Gyanendra returned from a tour of western Nepal. Protesters waved flags and carried banners calling for the former king’s reinstatement. The demonstration disrupted airport operations, forcing passengers to walk to and from the terminal, while hundreds of riot police prevented demonstrators from entering the airport. Despite the intensity of the protest, no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule. The country became a federal democratic republic, but since then, many Nepalis have grown frustrated with political instability and economic struggles.Since the abolition of the monarchy, Nepal has seen 13 different governments, leading many to believe the current system has failed. Corruption, economic hardship, and lack of political stability have left some citizens reconsidering their stance on monarchy.""We are here to give the king our full support and to rally behind him all the way to reinstating him in the royal throne,"" said Thir Bahadur Bhandari, a 72-year-old protester.Kulraj Shrestha, a 50-year-old carpenter, admitted he had initially opposed the monarchy but had since changed his mind. ""I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken. The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind,"" he said.Despite the growing support, Gyanendra has not commented on the renewed calls for his return. Political analysts believe his chances of regaining the throne remain slim in the near future. The republic is constitutionally enshrined, and mainstream political parties remain opposed to reinstating the monarchy.Gyanendra, who first became king in 2002 after the tragic massacre of his brother King Birendra and his family, initially ruled as a constitutional monarch. However, in 2005, he seized absolute power, dissolving the government and parliament, jailing politicians and journalists, and imposing emergency rule. His authoritarian rule led to the mass protests that ultimately resulted in the abolition of the monarchy.","Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule.
